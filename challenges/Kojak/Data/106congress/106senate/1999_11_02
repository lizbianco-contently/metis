Mr. President, Walter Payton was the pride of Columbia, MS. \nHe died all too early this past Monday at the age of 45 years--too \nyoung for a person of such integrity, ability, and generosity.\n  The Clarion Ledger newspaper of my home State this morning wrote a \nmagnificent article about him. It said Walter Payton amazed his \nMississippi teammates with his kindness almost as often as he dazzled \nthem with his ability. They tell of a man who studied audiology in \ncollege after playing high school football with a deaf friend. That \ntold a lot about the early life of this outstanding young man, and it \nis the kind of life he lived until his final day this past Monday.\n  Surprisingly, the man who would become a great football player did \nnot even try out for football until his junior year in high school, \nchoosing instead to play drums in the high school band. But he learned \nthe game of football as fast as he could run, and long\n\n[[Page S13620]]\n\nbefore the Nation had heard of the Chicago Bear named ``Sweetness,'' \nMississippians were cheering a Jefferson High superhero they called \n``Spiderman'' and a Jackson State Tiger known as Walter.\n  His 3,563 yards rushing at Jackson State University was one of nine \nschool records he set, and he scored a college career total of 66 \ntouchdowns. At Jackson State, in 1973, he led the Nation in scoring \nwith 160 points, and his 464 career points set an NCAA record. But \nJackson State was a Division 1-AA school, and Walter did not get the \nsame attention as players from some of the bigger, well-known colleges. \nStill, the Bears knew a caliber player when they saw one, and they knew \nabout some of the other famous Mississippians who had preceded him, so \nthey drafted him fourth in the overall draft in 1975.\n  In his first NFL game in 1975, he rushed eight times for a total of \nzero yards. But that did not tell the story of what was to come. The \nBears did not give up on him, and Walter Payton didn't give up on \nhimself. He worked as hard in Chicago as he had in Mississippi. By the \nend of his rookie year, he had started seven games and rushed for 679 \nyards and seven touchdowns. The next year he had the first of what \nwould be 10 1,000-yard seasons, rushing for 1,390 yards and 13 \ntouchdowns.\n  NFL coaches termed him the ``complete football player.'' Just last \nnight, I saw Mike Ditka saying he was the best, most complete football \nplayer he had ever seen. He bested Jim Brown's longstanding rushing \nrecord of 12,312 yards in 1984.\n  But he also was more than just a football player. He worked to help \nmankind. He created the Halas/Payton Foundation to assist Chicago \ninner-city youth in completing their education. He believed in \nnurturing young people through education and inspiration, and he knew \nthat the rewards of sports came in the challenges he set for himself, \nwhat he learned about himself, and what he accomplished as part of a \nteam.\n  Walter Payton's light shown brighter earlier than many people his \nage. That is why his passing on Monday was even more difficult to take. \nAt his induction in the NFL Football Hall of Fame in July 1993, he \nasked his son Jarrett to be the first son to present his father for \ninduction into the Football Hall of Fame. His son said:\n  ``Not only is he a great athlete, he's a role model--he's my role \nmodel.''\n  Drummer, NCAA champion, college Hall of Famer, Pro Football All Star, \nNFL Hall of Famer, ``Sweetness.''\n  Role model to his son and millions of other Jarretts, that is the \ntitle Walter Payton would most cherish as his legacy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield a moment to me?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be delighted to yield to my colleague from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague in \nadvising the Senate that today our State of Mississippi, mourns with a \nheavy heart, the passing of Walter Payton, who died yesterday.\n  His accomplishments on the football field at Jackson State University \nand at Soldiers Field in Chicago as a member of the Chicago Bears are \nwell known to all of us. He was the greatest running back in the \nhistory of football.\n  He reflected a great deal of credit on our State not only because he \nwas a great football player but because of his personality, his \ngenerosity, and his kindness to his family and friends. I know he would \noften fly members of his family and friends--including a member of my \nstaff, Barbara Rooks, who is a close friend of the Payton family--to \nChicago for football games. He was devoted to his mother, Mrs. Aylene \nPayton and his sister Pamela and he was very close to his brother \nEddie, who was a great football payer too as a well as a professional \ngolfer. Eddie Payton also coached the Jackson State University golf \nteam to the national championship.\n  The family is well respected in so many ways. I could go on for a \nlong time and tell you more about his mother and what a dear lady she \nis and the exemplary community spirit of all the members of Walter \nPayton's family.\n  I extend to his wife Connie and their children Jarrett and Brittney \nmy deepest sympathies. The articles in the New York Times today \ndescribe well his remarkable career, and they include accolades from \nfellow players, coaches, and friends. I ask unanimous consent that \nthese articles on the life and career of Walter Payton along with his \nbiography as an Enshrinee of the Pro Football Hall of Fame be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion Ledger, Nov. 2, 1999]\n\n                From College In Mississippi To Champion\n\n                         (By William C. Rhoden)\n\n       The news that Walter Payton died yesterday at his home in a \n     suburb of Chicago came not so much as a shock but as a \n     sorrowful, piercing spike. We were prepared last February by \n     the shock of seeing the once robust Payton looking gaunt and \n     frail as he announced that he suffered from a rare liver \n     disease. Now we mourn a family's loss of a father and \n     husband, and the industry's loss of a great athlete. I mourn \n     the loss of a shared past, life petals that peel away each \n     time someone contemporary dies.\n       I was not close to Walter Payton, but rather attached to \n     him.\n       We first met 28 years ago this month, on Nov. 13, 1971. \n     This was the sort of one-on-one introduction that defensive \n     backs dread and outstanding running backs love. We met at the \n     10-yard line in Mississippi Memorial Stadium.\n       This was before Payton became Sweetness; before he became a \n     Chicago Bear; before we were paid for plying our particular \n     crafts. We met in the rarefied atmosphere of black college \n     football. He was a freshman at Jackson State University in \n     Mississippi; I was a senior at Morgan State in Baltimore. \n     This was an inter-sectional game between once-beaten, once-\n     tied opponents. We had beaten Jackson State a year earlier at \n     R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, and now it was our turn to go \n     to the Deep South, deeper than I'd ever been. I was intrigued \n     by Mississippi, the state so tied to civil rights history. \n     All our coach kept talking about was that these Southern boys \n     were still fighting the Civil War: the South thought it was \n     better than the North, he said, and when it came to football, \n     felt it was heartier, better and tougher.\n       Jackson State had a great football legacy: Willie \n     Richardson, Gloster Richardson, Verlon Biggs, Harold Jackson, \n     Richard Caster, Lem Barney. This particular year it had \n     Jerome Barkum, later a wide receiver with the Jets, Robert \n     Brazile, later a linebacker with the Oilers, and Eddie \n     Payton, Walter's older brother, who became a great N.F.L. \n     punt returner and then a professional golfer. Walter began \n     the year unknown, playing behind his brother. By November he \n     was still playing behind his brother but was Jackson State's \n     secret weapon.\n       My recollection of the game is reduced to one poignant \n     frame--that first meeting at the 10-yard line. A sweep with \n     Payton slicing past the line, over the linebackers and \n     finally into the secondary. There was Payton, there was me; I \n     hit him and felt solid contact, then felt Payton bounce back \n     to the outside for a touchdown. What I remember thinking at \n     the moment was that this guy had great balance, gyroscopic \n     balance. He was nearly horizontal, legs still churning. \n     Payton was rushing toward the National Football League; I was \n     headed toward journalism, not doing such a good job of \n     tackling but recording the moment.\n       Years later in Chicago I teased him about Morgan State's \n     victory in 1970. Payton reminded me that we had won that game \n     when he was still in high school.\n       Payton represents so much to so many. He carried the banner \n     of black college football to an unprecedented level. To one \n     extent or another we all carried a burden of proof. One \n     success reflected well on the group. Individual success was \n     group success, even if the player went to a different \n     institution. Such as when Grambling sent eight players to the \n     N.F.L. one season, or now when Mike Strahan, who played at \n     Texas Southern, runs in the winning touchdown. Payton was an \n     object of such pride. His success felt good and warm.\n       He held so many N.F.L. records. He set the career record \n     for rushing yards, 16,726; for career attempts, 3,838; for \n     rushing yards in a game, 275; for seasons with 1,000 or more \n     yards, 10. He broke Jim Brown's N.F.L. career rushing mark, \n     12,312 yards, in Chicago on Oct. 7, 1984, the same day he \n     broke Brown's mark of 58 100-yard rushing games.\n       A large part of Payton's legacy is made up of numbers. \n     Yesterday, Robert Hughes, the Jackson State head coach, was \n     an assistant coach in 1971, said that what Payton meant went \n     beyond the numbers. ``What's most memorable to me is when he \n     started getting on a roll and started after Jim Brown's \n     record,'' Hughes said. ``Brown was the greatest running back \n     of all time. He didn't come from a predominantly black \n     school; he's from Syracuse. When Walter came in from a little \n     school in Mississippi to top all that, that's what made it \n     great.''\n       Walter Payton, with the aggressive, elusive style that was \n     formed at Jackson State. The N.F.L.'s career rushing leader. \n     The runner who led Chicago to its only Super Bowl victory. \n     Dead so young, at 45.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 2, 1999]\n\n             Football Remembers Payton, the Ultimate Player\n\n                           (By Mike Freeman)\n\n       Late yesterday afternoon each National Football League team \n     received an e-mail\n\n[[Page S13621]]\n\n     message from the Chicago Bears. Many executives knew what it \n     said before they read it: Walter Payton, one of the best ever \n     to play running back, had died.\n       For the past several days it has been rumored that Payton \n     had taken a turn for the worse, so the league was braced for \n     the news. Still, the announcement that Payton had succumbed \n     to bile-duct cancer at 45 rocked and deeply saddened the \n     world of professional football.\n       ``His attitude for life, you wanted to be around him,'' \n     said Mike Singletary, a close friend who played with Payton \n     from 1981 to 1987 on the Bears. Singletary read Scripture at \n     Payton's side on the morning of his death.\n       ``He was the kind of individual if you were down he would \n     not let you stay down,'' Singletary said.\n       Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the N.F.L. family was \n     devastated by the loss of Payton. Tagliabue called him ``one \n     of the greatest players in the history of the sport.''\n       ``The tremendous grace and dignity he displayed in his \n     final months reminded us again why `Sweetness' was the \n     perfect nickname for Watler Payton,'' he said in a statement.\n       In his 13 seasons with Chicago, Payton rushed for 16,726 \n     yards on 3,838 carries, still both N.F.L. records. One of \n     Payton's most impressive feats was that he played in 189 of \n     190 games from 1975, his first season, until his retirement \n     in 1987. For someone with Payton's style to participate and \n     dominate in that many games--he enjoyed plowing into \n     defenders and rarely ran out of bounds to avoid a tackle--is \n     remarkable.\n       ``He is the best football player I've ever seen,'' said \n     Saints Coach Mike Ditka, who coached Payton for six seasons \n     with Chicago.\n       Ditka added: ``At all positions, he's the best I've ever \n     seen. There are better runners than Walter, but he's the best \n     football player I ever saw. To me, that's the ultimate \n     compliment.''\n       What always amazed Payton's opponents was his combination \n     of grace and power. Payton once ran over half dozen players \n     from the Kansas City Chiefs, and on more than one occasion he \n     sprinted by speedy defensive backs.\n       It did not take long for the N.F.L. to see that Payton was \n     special. In 1977, his third season, Payton, standing 5 feet \n     10\\1/2\\ inches and weighing 204 pounds, was voted the \n     league's most valuable player after one of the best rushing \n     seasons in league history. He ran for 1,852 yards and 14 \n     touchdowns. His 5.5 yard a carry that season was a career \n     best and against Minnesota that season he ran for 275 yards, \n     a single-game record that still stands.\n       ``I remember always watching him and thinking, `How did he \n     just make that run?' '' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi \n     said. ``He was just a great player.\n       Accorsi echoed the sentiments of others that Payton may not \n     have had the natural gift of running back Barry Sanders or \n     the athleticism of Jim Brown, but that he made the most of \n     what he had.\n       ``I think Jim Brown is in a class by himself,'' Accorsi \n     said. ``And then there are other great players right behind \n     him like Walter Payton.''\n       Payton was known as much for his kindness off the field as \n     his prowess on it. He was involved with a number of charities \n     during and after his N.F.L. career, and although he valued \n     his privacy he was known for his kindness to people in the \n     league whom he did not know.\n       Accorsi saw Payton at the 1976 Pro Bowl, and even though it \n     was one of the first times the two had met, Payton told \n     Accorsi, ``I hope God blesses you.''\n       ``When some guys say stuff like that, you wonder if it is \n     phony,'' Accorsi said, ``but not with him. You could tell he \n     was very genuine.''\n       Bears fans in Chicago felt the same way, which is why \n     reaction to his death was swift and universal.\n       ``He to me is ranked with Joe DiMaggio in baseball--he was \n     the epitome of class,'' said Hank Oettinger, a native of \n     Chicago who was watching coverage of Payton's death at a bar \n     on the city's North Side. ``The man was such a gentleman, and \n     he would show it on the football field.''\n       Several fans broke down crying yesterday as they called \n     into Chicago television sports talk show and told of their \n     thoughts on Payton.\n       Asked what made Payton special, Ditka said: ``It would have \n     to be being Walter Payton. He was so good for the team. He \n     was the biggest practical joker and he kept everyone loose. \n     And he led by example on the field. He was the complete \n     player. He did everything. He was the greatest runner, but he \n     was also probably the best looking back you ever saw.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from the State of \nMississippi who are justifiably proud of Walter Payton. His home State \nof Mississippi can look to Walter Payton with great pride. There is a \ngreat deal of sadness in my home State of Illinois, particularly in the \ncity of Chicago, with the passing of Walter Payton at the age of 45.\n  Later today, I will enter into the Record a statement of tribute to \nMr. Payton, but I did not want to miss this opportunity this morning to \nmention several things about what Walter Payton meant to Chicago and \nIllinois.\n  He was more than a Hall of Fame football player. He ran for a record \n16,726 yards in a 13-year career, one of those years shortened by a \nstrike, and yet he established a record which probably will be \ndifficult to challenge or surpass at any time in the near future.\n  The one thing that was most amazing about Walter Payton was not the \nfact he was such a great rusher, with his hand on the football and \nmaking moves which no one could understand how he pulled off, but after \nbeing tackled and down on the ground, hit as hard as could be, he would \nreach over and pull up the tackler and help him back on his feet.\n  He was always a sportsman, always a gentleman, always someone you \ncould admire, not just for athletic prowess but for the fact he was a \ngood human being.\n  I had the good fortune this last Fourth of July to meet his wife and \nson. They are equally fine people. His son, late in his high school \ncareer, in his junior year, decided to try out for football. The apple \ndoes not fall far from the tree; he became a standout at Saint Viator \nin the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights and now is playing at the \nUniversity of Miami. I am sure he will have a good career of his own.\n  With the passing of a man such as Walter Payton, we have lost a great \nmodel in football and in life--the way he conducted himself as one of \nthe most famous football players of all time.\n  The last point I will make is, toward the end of his life when \nannouncing he faced this fatal illness, he made a plea across America \nto take organ donation seriously. He needed a liver transplant at one \npoint in his recuperation. It could have made a difference. It did not \nhappen.\n  I do not know the medical details as to his passing, but Walter \nPayton's message in his final months is one we should take to heart as \nwe remember him, not just from those fuzzy clips of his NFL career but \nbecause he reminded us, even as he was facing his last great game in \nlife, that each and every one of us has the opportunity to pass the \nball to someone who can carry it forward in organ donation, and the \nNation's commitment to that cause would be a great tribute to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13621-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13621-S13622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE DEATH OF WALTER PAYTON\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at \nthe news of the death of one of football's greatest stars ever, \nChicago's own Walter Payton.\n  Walter Payton was a hero, a leader, and a role model both on and off \nthe field. For 13 years, he thrilled Chicago Bears' fans as the NFL's \nall-time leading rusher--perhaps one of the greatest running backs ever \nto play the game of football. After retiring from professional football \nin 1987, Payton continued to touch the lives of Chicagoans as an \nentrepreneur and a community leader.\n  Walter Payton's historic career began at Jackson State University, \nwhere he set a college football record for points scored. The first \nchoice in the 1975 NFL draft, Payton--or ``Sweetness'' as he was known \nto Chicago Bears fans--became the NFL's all-time leader in running and \nin combined net yards and scored 110 touchdowns during his career with \nthe Bears. He made the Pro Bowl nine times and was named the league's \nMost Valuable Player twice, in 1977 and 1985. In 1977, Payton rushed \nfor a career-high 1,852 yards and carried the Bears to the playoffs for \nthe first time since 1963. He broke Jim Brown's long-standing record in \n1984 to become the league's all-time leading rusher, and finished his \ncareer with a record 16,726 total rushing yards. In 1985-86, Walter \nPayton led the Bears to an unforgettable 15-1 season and Super Bowl \nvictory--the first and only Super Bowl win in Bears' history. Walter \nPayton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, and was \nselected this year as the Greatest All-Time NFL Player by more than 200 \nplayers from the NFL Draft Class of 1999.\n  More important, Walter Payton matched his accomplishments on the \nfootball field with his selfless actions off the field on behalf of \nthose in need. He earned a degree in special education from Jackson \nState University and worked throughout his adult life to improve the \nlives of children. In 1988, he\n\n[[Page S13622]]\n\nestablished the Halas/Payton Foundation to help educate Chicago's \nyouth.\n  Walter Payton was truly an American hero in every sense of the term. \nHe died tragically at age 45, but his legacy will live in our hearts \nand minds forever. Today, Mr. President, Illinois mourns. Sweetness, we \nwill miss you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to perhaps the \nbest running back who ever carried a football, Walter Payton, who died \nyesterday at the age of 45. In Carl Sandburg's City of the Big \nShoulders, ``Sweetness,'' as Payton was nicknamed, managed to carry the \nfootball hopes of an entire city on his shoulders for 13 magnificent \nyears.\n  From the law firms on LaSalle to the meat packing plants on Fulton, \nMonday mornings in Chicago were always filled with tales of Payton's \nexploits on the field from the previous day. We marveled at his ability \nand reveled in the glory he brought to Chicago and Da Bears. In a life \ncut short by a rare disease, he blessed Chicago with several lifetimes \nof charisma, courage, and talent.\n  Who could forget the many times Payton lined up in the red zone and \nsoared above opposing defenders for a Bears touchdown? Or the frequency \nwith which his 5-10, 204-pound frame bowled over 250-pound linebackers \nen route to another 100-yard-plus rushing game? His relentless pursuit \nof that extra yard and the passion with which he sought it made his \nnickname, Sweetness, all the more ironic. It would take the rarest of \ndiseases, barely pronounceable and unfortunately insurmountable, to \nfinally bring Sweetness down.\n  It was that passion that inspired Payton's first position coach, Fred \nO'Connor, to declare: ``God must have taken a chisel and said, `I'm \ngoing to make me a halfback.' '' Coach Ditka called Payton simply ``the \ngreatest football player I've ever seen.'' Payton's eight National \nFootball League (NFL) records, most of which still stand today, merely \nunderscore his peerless performance on the field and his extraordinary \nlife away from it. The man who wore number 34 distinguished himself as \nthe greatest performer in the 80-year history of a team that boasts \nmore Hall of Famers than any other team in League history.\n  He played hurt many times throughout his career, and on one notable \noccasion, when he should have been hospitalized with a 102 degree \nfever, he played football. On that day, November 20, 1977, Payton \nturned in the greatest rushing performance in NFL history, rushing for \na league record 275 yards en route to victory against the Minnesota \nVikings.\n  Self-assured but never cocky, Sweetness had no interest in indulging \nthe media by uttering the self-aggrandizing sound bites that are all \ntoo common among today's athletes. Instead, he would praise the \nblocking efforts of fullback Matt Suhey or his offensive linemen, all \nof whom were inextricably linked to the surfeit of records he amassed. \nHe play the game with a rare humility--refusing to call attention to \nhimself--always recognizing the individuals who paved the way for his \nachievements.\n  He once refused to be interviewed by former Ms. America Phyllis \nGeorge unless his entire corps of linemen were included. Following his \nfirst 1,000 yard rushing season, Payton bought his offensive linemen \nengraved watches. The engraving, however, made no mention of the 1,390 \nyards he finished with that year, but instead noted the score of the \ngame in which he reached 1,000 yards, underscoring the essential \ncontributions that his offensive linemen made in enabling him to \nachieve this feat.\n  And how many times did we see Walter Payton dance down the field, a \nlimp leg, a quick cut, a break-away. He could find daylight in a \ncrowded elevator. And when a tackler finally brought him down, Walter \nPayton would jump to his feet and reach down to help his tackler up. \nThat's the kind of football player he was. That's the kind of person he \nwas.\n  Payton lightened the atmosphere at Hallas Hall with an often \noutlandish sense of humor, even during the years when the Bears \nreceived boos from the fans and scathing criticism from the press. \nRookies in training camp were often greeted by firecrackers in their \nlocker room and unsuspecting teammates often faced a series of pranks \nwhen they turned their backs on Payton. Just last week, as Payton was \nclinging to life, he sent Suhey on a trip to Hall of Famer Mike \nSingletary's house, but not before he gave Suhey a series of incorrect \naddresses and directed Suhey to hide a hamburger and a malt in \nSingletary's garage.\n  While Payton lived an unparalleled life on the football field, he \nalso lived a very full life off the field. He was a brilliant \nbusinessman, but never too busy to devote countless hours to charitable \ndeeds, most of which were unsolicited and voluntary. Sweetness shared \nwith us a sense of humanity that will endure as long as his records. I \nhad the good fortune on July 4th to meet his wife and children, who are \nequally fine people. The apple didn't fall too far from the tree. \nJarrett Payton, like his father, decided to try out for football in his \nJunior Year. Jarrett was a standout at St. Viator High School in \nArlington Heights, a Chicago suburb, and he is now playing football at \nthe University of Miami. It looks as if he may have quite a career of \nhis own.\n  In his last year, Walter Payton helped illuminate the plight of \nindividuals who are afflicted with diseases that require organ \ntransplants. Patients with the rare liver disease that Payton \ncontracted, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), have a 90% chance of \nsurviving more than one year if they receive a liver transplant. \nUnfortunately, the need for donations greatly exceeds the demand. The \nlonger that patients wait on the organ donation list, the more likely \nit is that their health will deteriorate. In Payton's case, the risk of \ndeadly complications, which included bile duct cancer, grew too \nquickly. Payton likely would have had to wait years for his life-saving \nliver. This was time he did not have before cancer took his life \nyesterday. A day when everyone who needs a life-saving organ can be \ntreated with one cannot come soon enough.\n  More than 66,000 men, women, and children are currently awaiting the \nchance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor. Minorities, \nwho comprise approximately 25% of the population, represent over 40% of \nthis organ transplant waiting list. Because of these alarming \nstatistics, thirteen people die each day while waiting for a donated \nliver, heart, kidney, or other organ. Half of these deaths are people \nof color. The untimely death of Payton is a wake-up call for each of us \nto become organ donors and discuss our intentions with our families so \nthat we do not lose another hero, or a son, a daughter, a mother or a \nfather to a disease that can be overcome with an organ transplant.\n  Mr. President, today is a sad day in Chicago and in our nation. We \nhave lost a father, a husband, a friend, and a role model all at once. \nWhile we are overcome with grief, we are also reminded of the blessings \nthat Payton bestowed upon his wife, Corrine, his children, Jarrett and \nBrittney, and the city of Chicago during his brief time with us.\n  So thanks for the memories, Sweetness. Soldier Field will never be \nthe same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13622-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13622-S13632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                                Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 3064 making \n     appropriations for the Government of the District of Columbia \n     and other activities chargeable in whole or in part against \n     revenues of said District for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the time situation with regard to \nthe conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there a set time to vote, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are to vote in 30 minutes. There are six \nSenators who have 5 minutes apiece.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we will hear from the managers of the \nbill, I am certain. There are two sets of managers, as a matter of \nfact. This is a bill that combines the District of Columbia\n\n[[Page S13623]]\n\nappropriations bill and the Labor-Health and Human Services bill. I am \nhere today as chairman to urge Members of the Senate to vote favorably \nfor this bill and to send it to the President.\n  The big bill in this conference report before us, the Labor-Health \nand Human Services bill, is the 13th appropriations bill. With the \nadoption of this conference report, we will have sent all 13 bills to \nthe President. If one considers the timeframe of this Congress, with \nthe time we spent on the impeachment process and then the delays that \ncame our way because of the various emergencies that have taken our \nattention, particularly in the appropriations process this year--\nKosovo, the devastating hurricanes, and the disaster in the farm area--\none will understand why we are this late in the day considering the \n13th bill.\n  This bill has had some problems because of our overall budget control \nmechanisms. We have been limited in terms of the money available. We \nhave stayed within those limits. We have forward funded some of the \nitems so they will be charged against future years. But those are items \nthat primarily would be spent in those years.\n  We have had a real commitment on a bipartisan basis not to invade the \nSocial Security surplus. As we look into the future with the retirement \nof an enormous generation, the baby boom generation, there is no \nquestion that Social Security surplus must be sound, and we are doing \nour best to make sure that is the case.\n  We have had a series of issues before us. We have had some \ndisagreements with the President. In this bill, we try to work out \nthose differences. We have provided moneys for our children, for the \nBoys and Girls Clubs; we have provided for law enforcement officers to \nhave safe, bulletproof vests. With so many things going on in terms of \nchildren and education, we tried to meet the President more than \nhalfway on his requests for education.\n  The bill would probably be signed but for the differences between the \nadministration and the Congress over how to handle the funding. We have \nincluded, as a matter of fact, against my best wishes, an across-the-\nboard cut. That is primarily because only the administration can \nidentify some of the areas we can reduce safely without harming the \nprograms, and I am confident when we come to what we call the final \nperiod to devise a bill, we will work out with the administration some \noffsets that will take care of the bill. I am hopeful we will have no \nacross-the-board cut, but if it comes, it will not be as large as the \none in this bill right now.\n  I am urging Members of the Senate to vote for this bill. I do believe \nwe can be assured, and I was assured yesterday, that the bill will be \nvetoed. There is no question about that. But  also, we had probably the \nmost productive and positive meeting with the administration yesterday. \nI expect to be starting those discussions in our office in the Capitol \nwith representatives of the President within just a few moments, and we \nare very hopeful we can come together and bring to the Senate and to \nthe Congress a solution to the differences between us and get this \nfinal series of bills completed.\n\n  There are five bills that have not been signed: State-Justice-\nCommerce was vetoed, and that is being reviewed by the group I just \nmentioned, along with the foreign assistance bill; the Interior bill is \nin conference and should be ready to send to the President today, I \nhope; the D.C. bill is here, and it should be available to us.\n  The impact of what I am saying is, I think it is possible, if the \nCongress has the will to come together now and to work with the \nPresident's people who have indicated their desire to finish this \nappropriations process, that we can finish our business and complete \nour work by a week from tomorrow. That will take a substantial amount \nof understanding on the part of everyone.\n  I am hopeful from what we are hearing now that some of the rhetoric \nwill subside and we will have positive thinking about how to complete \nour work. But I do urge approval of this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leader time to say a few words \nabout this bill and where we are.\n  Mr. President, there is no one for whom I have greater respect for \nthan the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska. But I must say, I \nquestion why we are here today voting on a bill that we know will be \nvetoed. If we are going to try to retain the positive environment to \nwhich the senior Senator has just alluded, I do not understand how it \nis positive to send a bill down to the President that we know will be \nvetoed, which will then require us to go right back to the negotiating \ntable where we were yesterday. I do not understand that.\n  I think a far better course is to defeat this bill, go back \ndownstairs, negotiate seriously with the White House, and come together \nwith Democrats to assure that we can pass a bill overwhelmingly.\n  I do not recall whether I have ever voted against an Education \nappropriations bill. This may be unprecedented for many of us on this \nside of the aisle. As I understand it, the distinguished ranking member \nof the subcommittee on Health and Human Services is going to vote \nagainst this bill. I am going to join him, and I am going to join with \nmost Democrats, if not all Democrats, in our unanimous opposition to \nwhat the bill represents. That is unprecedented.\n  We should not have to be here doing this today. If we are serious \nabout doing something positive and bringing this whole effort to \nclosure, I cannot imagine we could be doing anything more \ncounterproductive than to send a bill down that we know is going to be \nvetoed.\n  Why is it going to be vetoed? It is going to be vetoed because we \nviolate the very contract that we all signed 1 year ago, a contract \nthat Republicans and Democrats hailed at the time as a major departure \nwhen it comes to education. We recognized that, in as consequential a \nway as we know how to make at the Federal level, we are going to reduce \nclass size, just as we said we were going to hire more policemen with \nthe COPS Program a couple years before. We committed to hiring 100,000 \nnew teachers and ensuring that across this country the message is: We \nhear you. We are going to reduce class size and make quality education \nthe priority on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats.\n  I think both parties took out ads right afterward saying what a major \nachievement it was. We were all excited about the fact that we did this \nfor our kids, for education, and what a departure it represented from \npast practice. We did that 1 year ago.\n  Here we are now with the very question: Should we extend what we \nhailed last year to be the kind of achievement that it was? A couple of \ndays ago, a report came out which indicated that in those school \ndistricts where additional teachers had been hired, there was a clear \nand very extraordinary development: Class sizes were smaller, quality \neducation was up, teachers were being hired, and this program was \nworking. We had it in black and white--given to every Senator--it is \nworking.\n  So why now, with that clear evidence, with the bipartisan \nunderstanding that we had just a year ago that we were going to make \nthis commitment all the way through to the end, hiring 100,000 new \nteachers, why now that would even be on the table is something I do not \nunderstand. Twenty-nine thousand teachers could be fired.\n  But it is as a result of the fact that our Republican colleagues \ncontinue to refuse to extend and maintain the kind of program we all \nhailed last year that we are here with a threat of a veto.\n  I do not care whether it is this week, next week, if we are into \nDecember, if it is the day before Christmas, if that issue has not been \nresolved satisfactorily, we are not going to leave. We can talk all we \nwant to about a positive environment, but we are  not going to have a \npositive environment conducive to resolving this matter until that \nissue is resolved satisfactorily.\n\n  So there isn't much positive one can say about our dilemma on that \nissue.\n  Another big dilemma is the extraordinary impact delaying funding will \nhave on the NIH. Sixty percent of the research grant portfolio will be \ndelayed until the last 2 days of this fiscal year--60 percent. Eight \nthousand new research grants will be delayed and grantees will be \ndenied the opportunity to compete--8,000 grantees. This is\n\n[[Page S13624]]\n\nprobably going to have as Earth shaking an impact on NIH as anything \nsince NIH was created.\n  I do not know of anything that could have a more chilling effect on \nthe way we provide funding for grants through NIH than what this budget \nproposes. We have heard from the institutions that conduct life-saving \nresearch. They say you can't stop and start research programs without \nirretrievable loss.\n  I will bet you every Senator has been contacted by NIH expressing \ntheir concern and the concern of these researchers about the \ndevastating impact this is going to have.\n  But it is not just the NIH. The cut across the board alone will have \na major impact. Five thousand fewer children are going to receive Head \nStart services; and 2,800 fewer children are going to receive child \ncare assistance; 120,000 kids will be denied educational services.\n  This cut across the board has nothing to do with ridding ourselves of \nwaste. This goes to the muscle and the bone of programs that are very \nprofoundly affecting our research, our education, our opportunities for \nsafe neighborhoods, and the COPS Program. The array of things that will \nhappen if this cut is enacted will be devastating.\n  So I am hopeful that we will get serious and get real about creating \nthe positive environment that will allow us to resolve these matters. \nWe have to resolve the class size issue. We have to resolve the matter \nof offsets in a way that we can feel good about.\n  I am hoping we are going to do it sooner rather than later--but we \nare going to do it. It is the choice of our colleagues. We will do it \nlater, but we will all have to wait until those who continue to insist \non this approach understand that it will never happen; the vetoes will \nkeep coming; the opposition will be as strong and as united a week or 2 \nweeks from now as it is today. That is why I feel so strongly about the \nneed to oppose this conference report. Let's go back downstairs and do \nit right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from \nPennsylvania has 5 minutes and I have 5 minutes.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nTexas for yielding to me.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will support this conference report. I \nam saddened to hear the arguments from the other side of the aisle \nwhich have turned this matter pretty much into a partisan debate.\n  When we talk about the 1 percent across-the-board cut, frankly, that \nis something I do not like. But when you take a look at the increases \nwhich are in this bill, they remain largely intact, notwithstanding the \nfact that there will be a 1-percent cut.\n  For example, on Head Start, at $5.2 billion, it has an increase of \nsome $608.5 million. The 1-percent across-the-board cut will leave, \ninstead of a $608.5 million increase, a $570.9 million increase. You \nwill find that throughout the bill.\n  When the last Senator who spoke made a reference to the difficulties \nof the National Institutes of Health in stopping and starting, I point \nout that it has been the initiative of our subcommittee, significantly \na Republican initiative, to increase NIH, which has had the full \nconcurrence of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nrepresenting the Democrats. But 3 years ago, we sought an increase of \nalmost $1 billion, an increase of some $900 million, after the \nconference. Last year, we increased NIH funding by $2 billion. This \nyear, the Senate bill had $2 billion, and on the initiative of \nCongressman Porter in the House, a Republican, we increased it an \nadditional $300 million. The ranking Democrat would not even attend the \nconference we had.\n\n  So it does not ring with validity for those on the other side of the \naisle to point to the National Institutes of Health and say this \nconference report, this Republican conference report, is doing damage \nto NIH. The fact is, it is this side of the aisle that has taken the \nlead. Again, I include my colleague, Senator Harkin, who has been my \nfull partner. But the lead has been taken on this side of the aisle for \nthe NIH.\n  Now, this bill has, for these three Departments, in discretionary \nspending, $93.7 billion, which is an increase of $6 billion over last \nyear. We have $600 million more than the President on these very vital \nsocial programs. When it comes to education, this bill has $300 million \nmore than the President. We have provided very substantial funding.\n  There is a disagreement between this bill and what the President \nwants on class size reduction. The President has established a priority \nof class size reduction and wants it his way, and his way exactly. But \nwe have added a $1.2 billion increase in this budget and we have done \nso listing the President's priority first; that is, to cut class size. \nWe say, if the local school districts don't agree that class size is \ntheir No. 1 priority, they can use it on teacher competency, or they \ncan use it for local discretion, but they don't have an absolute \nstraitjacket. I believe that is the solvent principle of federalism.\n  Why say to the local school boards across America they have to have \nit for class size if they don't have that problem and they want to use \nit for something else in education?\n  Now, Senator Harkin and I--and I see my distinguished colleague on \nthe floor--have had a full partnership for a decade. He is nodding yes. \nWhen he was chairman and I was ranking, and now that I am chairman and \nhe is ranking, we have worked together. I can understand the \ndifficulties of parties, Democrats and Republicans. I know he is deeply \ntroubled by the 1-percent across-the-board cut; so am I. We tried to \nfind offsets and we tried mightily to avoid touching Social Security, \nwithout a 1-percent across-the-board cut.\n  It had been my hope that on my assurances to my colleague from Iowa \nwe could have stayed together on this. I can understand if it is a \nmatter of Democrats and Republicans and he does not see his way clear \nto do that at this time. I say to him, whatever way he votes--and he \nsmiles and laughs--my full effort will be to avoid a 1-percent across-\nthe-board cut so we can come out with the bill he and I crafted, the \nsubcommittee accepted, the full committee accepted, and the full Senate \naccepted, which is a very good bill.\n  In order to advance to the next stage, it is going to be a party-line \nvote, something I do not like in the Senate. But I urge my colleagues \nto support the bill so we can move to the next stage.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to follow up with my colleague and \nfriend from Pennsylvania. He is absolutely right; we have had a great \nworking relationship for a long time. He has been open with me, as has \nhis staff. We have had a great working relationship, and I think that \nproved itself in the bill we brought to the Senate floor. We had a \ngreat bill on the Senate floor. We had a strong, bipartisan vote, 75-\n23. It doesn't get much more bipartisan than that around here. It was \nabout half and half, Democrats and Republicans, voting for it. So it \nwas a good bill, a strong bill.\n  Now, my friend from Pennsylvania, for whom I have the highest respect \nand affinity, is right; there are a lot of good things in this bill. It \nreminds me of sitting down at a dinner and you have a smorgasbord of \nprime rib, steaks, lamb chops, pasta, and all this wonderful meal \nspread out, and you can sample each one, but you have to take a poison \npill with it. Is that really worth eating? That is the problem with \nthis bill. There are good things in it; I admit that to my friend from \nPennsylvania. But this 1-percent across-the-board mindless cut that was \nadded later on--I know not with the support of either one of us on the \nSenate side--is a poison pill. Then they tried to say this is 1 percent \nand you can take it from waste, fraud, and abuse, or anything like \nthat. But when you looked at the fine print, it was 1 percent from \nevery program, project, and activity;\n\n[[Page S13625]]\n\nevery line item had to be cut by 1 percent.\n  That means in a lot of health programs, labor programs, and in some \neducation programs, with that 1-percent cut, we are actually below what \nwe spent last year--not a reduction in the increase. We are actually \nbelow what we were last year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that table printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  SAMPLE OF PROGRAMS CUT BELOW A HARD FREEZE UNDER CONFERENCE AGREEMENT\n                                   \\1\\\n  [Compares Labor-HHS items from fiscal year 1999 level to fiscal year\n                   2000 level, total cut in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Program                               Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\n \nAdult Job Training...........................................      $7.38\nYouth Job Training...........................................      10.01\nYouth Opportunity Grants.....................................       2.5\nComm.

When you look at this table, you can see why it is such a \npoison pill. I am greatly troubled by the vote coming up. I have been \non this committee and the subcommittee now since 1985. I have been \nprivileged to chair it and then to be the ranking member with Senator \nSpecter as chairman. To my best recollection I have never voted against \na Labor-HHS appropriations bill--not once --when Republicans were in \ncharge and then when Democrats were in charge because we have always \nworked out a reasonable compromise. Well, this will mark the first time \nthat I will have to vote against it. I don't do so with glee. I don't \ndo so as some kind of a pound on the table, saying this is the worst \nthing in the world. With that poison pill in there, we just can't eat \nit. I don't think a lot of people can.\n  This is cutting Social Security, veterans' health care, Meals on \nWheels, community health centers, afterschool programs, and education. \nWell, we all want to protect Social Security. Let's do it the right \nway. I believe we are going to have to sit down with the White House. I \nwant to make sure Senator Specter, Senator Stevens, and I are there at \nthe table talking about this because I believe there is a way out of \nthis.\n  We have a scoring from the CBO that if we have a look-back penalty on \ntobacco companies for their failure to reduce teen smoking, we can \nraise the necessary budget authority and outlays needed to meet what we \nhave in our Labor-HHS bill without this mindless 1-percent across-the-\nboard cut, without dipping into Social Security. I believe that is the \nway to go. I notice that Congressman Porter, the chairman of the House \nsubcommittee, was quoted just this morning as saying he favors making \nroom for needed spending on discretionary programs by some type of a \ncigarette tax.\n  He said that with ``the revenue generated by such a proposal we could \nget rid of all of the accounting gimmicks such as the delayed \nobligations at NIH.''\n  I want to say something else about that. There is no one who has been \na stronger supporter of NIH than Senator Specter has been through all \nof this.\n  Again, we had a good bill. We had some delayed obligations at NIH. \nBut we had an amount that they could live with. Now, we are up to an \namount of about $7 billion, if I am not mistaken, in delayed \nobligations at NIH. I believe that is going to cause them some distinct \nhardships. We have to get those delayed obligations back down to the \narea we had when we had the bill on the Senate floor.\n  I compliment Senator Specter for doing a great job. He is a wonderful \nfriend of mine, and he has done a great job of leadership on this bill. \nIt is too bad that other authorities someplace decided to put in a \npoison pill. But, hopefully, after this is over, we can work together, \nwe can get it out, and we can have a bill that is close to the one that \nwe passed on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, under the previous order, the \nSenator from Illinois has 5 minutes, the Senator from New Jersey has 5 \nminutes, and the Senator from Texas has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. This is nominally the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill. But D.C. is such a small part \nof it. It is a flea on the back of a big rogue elephant.\n  We are happy the District of Columbia appropriations bill has reached \na point where it should be passed and signed by the President, and the \nDistrict of Columbia can go on about the business of managing itself. \nBut, unfortunately, leaders in Congress have decided to take this \nrelatively noncontroversial bill and add to it this behemoth of a \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  I am going to vote against this bill. As many others on the \nDemocratic side, it marks probably one of the few times in my career \nthat I have opposed the bill by which we fund the Department of Labor, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nEducation. But I think those who look closely at this bill will \nunderstand there is good reason to vote against it.\n  Mark my word; this bill that may pass today is going to be vetoed \nbefore the sun goes down, and we will be back tomorrow to talk about \nthe next version of the Labor-HHS bill.\n  Senator Daschle is correct. This is a colossal waste of time. We \nshould be negotiating a bill that can be signed instead of posturing \nourselves. But if we are to address a posture, let's look at this bill \nand the posture it takes on one agency. That agency is the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n\n  Let me tell you that if for no other reason, every Member of the \nSenate should vote against this bill because of the decision of the \nbudget ``smooths'' to change the way that we fund the agency that pays \nfor medical research in the United States of America.\n  Look at the way this bill would fund the National Institutes of \nHealth. Historically, the blue lines represent more or less even-line \nspending throughout the year, month after month, by the National \nInstitutes of Health on medical research, on cancer, on heart disease, \non diabetes, and on arthritis. That is the way it should be. It is \nordinary business, steady as you go. Researchers know the money will be \nthere and that they are going to be able to use their best skills to \nfind cures for the diseases that afflict Americans and people around \nthe world. But some member of the Budget Committee, or the \nAppropriations Committee, has said: Let's play a little game here. \nLet's take 40 percent of all the money for the NIH and give it to them \nin the last 2 days of the fiscal year. Let them sit for 11 months, 3 \nweeks, and 5 days without the money, and then dump it on them in the \nlast few days so that 40 percent of the money and 60 percent of the \ngrants will be funded at the tail end.\n  The red line indicates what would happen if this Republican proposal \nwent through. This is irresponsible. If we are going to play games with \nthe budget, let's not do it with the National Institutes of Health.\n  I will concede, as Senator Specter said earlier, both he and Senator \nHarkin, as well as Congressman Porter from my State, have done yeomen \nduty in increasing the money available to the National Institutes of \nHealth over the years. I have always supported that. I will tell you \nwhy.\n  Each Member of the Senate can tell a story of someone bringing a \nchild afflicted by a deadly disease into their office and begging them \nas a Member of the Senate to do everything they can to help the \nNational Institutes of Health. It is heartbreaking to face these \nfamilies. It is heartbreaking, I am sure, to sit on the subcommittee \nand consider the scores of people who come in asking for help at the \nNational Institutes of Health. But each of us in our own way gives them \nour word that we will do everything in our power to help medical \nresearch in America so that the mothers and fathers and husbands and \nwives sitting in hospital waiting rooms around America praying to God \nthat some scientist is going to\n\n[[Page S13626]]\n\ncome up with a cure will get every helping hand possible from Capitol \nHill. This bill breaks that promise. This bill plays politics with the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  This bill, if for no other reason, should be voted down by the Senate \nto send a message to this conference and every subsequent conference \nthat if you are going to find a way out of this morass, don't play \npolitics with the National Institutes of Health.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the sad responsibility of working with a \nfamily in the closing days of the life of their tiny little boy who had \na life-threatening genetic disorder called Pompey's disease. He never \nmade it to a clinical trial because we could never bring together the \nNIH and the university to do something to try to help him. But I did my \nbest, as I am sure every Member of the Senate would.\n\n  A mother came to see me last year with a child with epileptic \nseizures that were occurring sometimes every 2 minutes. Imagine what \nher life was like and the life of her family.\n  Each and every one of them said to me: Senator, can you do something \nto help us with medical research? I gave them my word that I would, as \neach of us does.\n  Let's make sure this bill today draws a line in the sand and says to \nfuture conference committees that we hold the National Institutes of \nHealth sacred, and we will not allow political games to be played with \ntheir budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nallotted to Senator Lautenberg of 5 minutes be equally divided between \nSenator Murray and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I echo the words of my colleagues, \nSenator Harkin from Iowa, and Senator Durbin from Illinois.\n  I came here with Senator Graham of Florida when we had this bill on \nthe floor. We talked about the 50-percent cut in title XX block grant \nsocial services. That does not sound like much, but let me translate \nthat into human terms.\n  We talked about the need to have an adequate amount of funding for \ncommunity mental health services, and the number of people who do not \nget any care whatsoever. How are we going to deal with people during an \nextreme mental illness and help children when we don't provide the \nfunding? It is unconscionable.\n  We talked about the cuts in congregate dining for elderly people, and \nwe talked about cuts for Meals on Wheels for elderly people who can't \nget dining. We haven't even fully funded that program. Now we are \ntalking about cuts in that program.\n  What are we about, if we are going to make cuts in these kinds of \nprograms that we haven't adequately funded in the first place?\n  I talked about the particular problem for Minnesota. When we have \nthese kinds of cuts in these block grant and social service programs, \nthey are passed on to the community level. The States are not involved. \nIt is going to take us a year and a half to two years to provide any of \nthis funding at the State level, if we are ever going to be able to do \nso.\n  I say to my colleagues, what about compassion? What about programs \nthat are so important to the neediest people, to the most vulnerable \ncitizens, to children, to the elderly? What are we doing cutting these \nprograms?\n  I wish Senator Graham was here as well because we restored that 30 \npercent funding on the floor of the Senate, including community mental \nhealth services. All of it has been taken out in conference committee, \nat least what we were able to add as an increase.\n  I think that is cruel, shortsighted, unfair, and I don't think it is \nthe Senate at its best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague on this side in \nurging a ``no'' vote on this bill, simply because, as Senator Wellstone \njust stated, of our compassion for the thousands of women who will not \nreceive services--victims of domestic violence who won't have housing \nor counseling or health for their young children; the thousands of \npeople who have diabetes or cancer who will not see the result of \nresearch done at NIH because of a 1-percent across-the-board cut; and, \nthe thousands of women and children who depend on Head Start, who \ndepend on our education programs, on the social services that are out \nthere so that those young families can grow and be responsible and \ncontribute back to our economy as strong families in the future. A 1-\npercent cut doesn't take into account the humanity behind the numbers \nin this bill.\n  Finally, on the topic of class size reduction, and why this side is \nso adamant about it, a block grant cannot guarantee that one child will \nget a better education. Because of the bipartisan work we did last \nyear, today 1.7 million children are getting a better education in a \nsmaller class size that guarantees they will have the ability to read, \nwrite, and perform the skills they need to do in order to compete in \nour complex world. If we continue this program, there will be millions \nmore who are able to learn to read, write, and do better in school.\n  This is a partnership we have with our States and our local school \ndistricts. Our responsibility is to help them do what they need to do; \nto provide help where help is needed. There has been a call for \nreducing class size from across this country, because people know what \nworks. The Congress should be a partner and continue our promise of a \nyear ago in making sure that happens.\n  The bill will be vetoed; it will be an item of contention. The \nDemocrats stand firm. We want to make sure those children get the best \neducation possible. We are a partner in making that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       impact aid reauthorization\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today with several of my fellow \nSenators to bring an important matter to the attention of our \ncolleagues in the Senate. I refer to the disproportionate allocation of \nFederal impact aid funding to local school districts across the \ncountry.\n  As you know, this program is a successful example of the role Federal \nfunding can play in education. This program succeeds in placing Federal \neducation dollars directly in the hands of local educators, rather than \nfederal bureaucrats.\n  State income taxes and local property taxes are often the primary \nfunding sources for public school systems. However, military families \npay income taxes to their ``State of residence,'' which may or may not \nbe the same as the State in which their children are attending pubic \nschools. In addition, military families living on base or American \nIndians living on trust lands or reservations don't pay property taxes. \nPublic schools are still required to provide these students a quality \neducation. Who pays to educate these children?\n  Mr. President, Impact Aid fills this gap left when traditional \nrevenue sources are inhibited by the presence of the Federal \nGovernment. This program is widely supported by my colleagues. In fact, \nit's a program which continually receives annual increases in \nappropriation levels. One would think if more money is flowing into the \nprogram then all States are fairly receiving increases in the annual \nfunding levels. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\n  There is a formula used to determine the amount of funding \ndistributed to each locally impacted school district. While clearly \nsome states are more heavily impacted than others, this formula \ndisproportionately favors certain states and their districts, at the \nexpense of others equally impacted and deserving. Hundreds of school \ndistricts across the United States are scraping for the dollars \nnecessary to educate our children. And they are doing it on less and \nless money every year.\n  States, local school districts, and parents are the primary resource \nto educate our children for the future. I would like to inquire of the \nchairman of Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions his intentions with \nrespect to addressing the formula disparities.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I appreciate my good friend from \nOklahoma bringing this to our attention. I have long been a supporter \nof Impact Aid, and I can speak to this issue from personal experience. \nFor 20 years, my\n\n[[Page S13627]]\n\nwife Linda taught at a school in southwest Colorado which is dependent \nupon the program, so I know firsthand its vital importance. In fact, \nmore than 24 million acres of land in Colorado are federally owned \nlands. Impact Aid eases the burden on surrounding school districts with \na smaller tax base because of these Federal lands, ensuring a high-\nquality education for all students.\n  My home State of Colorado has lost 16 percent in funding since this \nprogram was reauthorized in 1994. As the Impact Aid reauthorization is \nconsidered early next year, I look forward to a fair and honest \nevaluation of the funding formula.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nbringing the problem of Impact Aid fund distribution to the attention \nof the Senate.\n  In my State, the Impact Aid payments to schools is a relatively small \nsum, about $300,000. So, it is especially important that those funds \nare distributed in an accurate and timely manner. I hope that in our \nconsideration of reauthorizing the elementary and secondary education \nprograms, that Impact Aid is given careful review. I will work to be of \nassistance in this effort.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his leadership on this \nissue. And, I thank the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, the Senator from Vermont, for his willingness to \naddress the issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleagues Senator Jeffords and Senator \nKennedy working to remedy this situation. As my colleagues know, \nOklahoma has historically come out on the short end of the funding \nstick in terms of Impact Aid distribution formulas.\n  Oklahoma has a very large number of impacted districts and this \nfunding is so crucial for them. However, since the last authorization \nof Impact Aid, Oklahoma has lost 29 percent in Impact Aid funding.\n  I encourage my colleagues to continue to work, as they have been, to \naddress this inequity to ensure that all States are served by the \nImpact Aid Program.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma's \nbringing this matter to my attention. The Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions is currently preparing legislation to \nreauthorize programs included in the elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. The reauthorization process offers an opportunity for congress to \nreview the operations of these programs and to make appropriate \nmodifications. During the last reauthorization of ESEA in 1994, we \nrevised the Impact Aid Program in a way intended to target resources to \ndistricts based on their relative need in terms of serving federally \nconnected children. I believe that is the right direction to take and \nam open to considering any proposal which assists us in better meeting \nthis objective. I welcome the recommendations of all Members and look \nforward to further discussions regarding the problem which my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma wishes to address.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleagues, and I thank them for bringing this matter to my attention. \nI will work with Chairman Jeffords during the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that the Impact Aid \nProgram adequately addresses the needs of students in federally \nimpacted school districts, and that funding is directed to the \ndistricts with the most need, and is distributed in an equitable \nmanner. I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords, Senator \nInhofe, and other colleagues to address these issues fairly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Vermont, \nMassachusetts, Mississippi, Colorado, and Oklahoma for their interest \nin the reauthorization of Impact Aid and how it affects our States and \nmost importantly our children. I look forward to working together to \nprotect all impacted students.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I had hoped that this year, we could have a \nreasonable and orderly appropriations process, where we would make the \ntough decisions that are required to live within our means. I had hoped \nthat we could prioritize our spending, increasing funding for defense \nto strengthen our nation's readiness, investing in school improvements, \ndevoting needed funds to science and basic research, enhancing our \ntransportation system, and reducing our seemingly inexhaustible demand \nfor pork-barrel projects.\n  Instead, we are now at the end of the appropriations process and we \nare facing the prospect of spending even more than we have taken in--\ndespite the fact that revenues exceeded estimates and an on-budget \nsurplus was available to us. At this point we face a Hobson's choice. \nIn order to fulfill a commitment to protect the Social Security surplus \nthat both political parties made to the American people we have to vote \nfor a process that is abhorrent to any concept of responsible budgeting \nand legislating. In order to fund unwanted and unneeded legislative \npork we're taking money from every legitimate program we've already \nfunded--including crucial defense spending and reducing class size.\n  Rather than making the hard choices throughout the process, and \nforegoing popular parochial spending that is not critical to our \nnation's needs, we are forced to make an across-the-board cut in order \nto meet our commitment. This is not the responsible way to govern. In \nfact, it's indefensible. We haven't done our job, Mr. President. We're \nplaying rhetorical games and posturing artificially in order to keep \nthis little secret from the American people.\n  I will vote for this bill very reluctantly because it's the only \nmeasure on the table that meets our commitment. Once the President \nvetoes this bill, then we can get back to the business of making the \nhard choices. Cutting spending is never easy or popular, but it is \nnecessary if we are to keep our promises.\n  I oppose spending the Social Security trust funds because I believe \nthat when we voted years ago to take the Social Security trust fund \noff-budget, we did so in an effort to impose fiscal discipline on \nourselves. Although it has taken years to get to a point where we \ndidn't have to rely on Social Security surpluses to pay our bills, we \nare now at that point, and we've promised the American people that we \nwill refrain from using Social Security and Medicare taxes to fund \nother government programs. I support the promise because it helps \nstrengthen our spine to cut unnecessary spending. But strengthening \nSocial Security and Medicare for the long term will take more than just \nplacing the trust funds ``off limits.''\n  Mr. President, we have once again limped pathetically to the end of \nthe appropriations process, past the deadline and over the budget. The \nmere fact that we have to do an across-the-board cut is a testament to \nthe failure of this budget process. If we have to choose between \nthoughtful budgeting and honoring a commitment, I will vote to honor \nthe commitment. But that shouldn't be the choice.\n  I will vote for this bill, knowing that it will be vetoed, to send a \nstrong and clear message: government should not spend more than it \ntakes in.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning I voted against the Conference \nReport for the Labor-HHS-Education-DC Appropriations bill. I am \nextremely disappointed with the budgetary stalemate that this Congress \nseems to have reached. This Congress is yet to do much work that we \nshould be proud of and more than a month into the new fiscal year, we \nhave failed to even complete our appropriations work.\n  I want to mention just a few of the problems I had with this \nConference Report. First, this Report made significant reductions to \nessential programs funded through the Education Department. For \nexample, the proposal before us provided no funding for a class size \nreduction program that this Congress supported just last year. Vermont \nis a state that generally enjoys small class sizes for our students. \nBut even Vermont, a rural state with fairly small student to teacher \nratios benefits, from the President's visionary program to put more \nteachers into our class rooms.\n  Second, this Conference Report made unacceptable cuts to programs \nfunded through the Department of Health and Human Services. For \nexample, this bill cuts $44 million in requests from the Centers for \nDisease Control to immunize over 333,000 children against childhood \ndiseases.\n  In addition to these programmatic cuts, the Conference Report \ncontained\n\n[[Page S13628]]\n\nbudget gimmicks including the use of the Social Security Trust Fund and \nan across the board cut in spending that reflects Congress' inability \nto budget responsibly. I understand the President made it very clear \nthat he will veto this Report when it gets to his desk. In spite of \nthis knowledge, my colleagues on the other side felt it was a \nproductive use of our time to none the less move forward with an \nunacceptable bill, rather than attempt to negotiate and reach a \ncompromise.\n  The conference report included a .97 percent across the board, \ngovernment-wide cut in all discretionary programs. This included the \nfunding for programs such as education and crime prevention--two \nessential programs for ensuring the safety of our youth. The Office of \nManagement and Budget has estimated some of the effects of this type of \nacross the board cut. For example, approximately 71,000 fewer women, \ninfants, and children would benefit from the important Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also \nknown as the WIC program. An across the board cut of this nature would \nalso mean 1.3 million fewer Meals on Wheels will be delivered to the \nelderly.\n  Americans have witnessed over the past several weeks an enormous \namount of finger pointing from both sides of the aisle about who's \nusing the Social Security surplus and who's not. I don't think there's \nmuch to dispute. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, even with the so-called across the board cuts, the Republican \nproposed spending plan will still mean taking $17 billion from the \nSocial Security Trust Fund.\n  Let's step back and look at the message that we have sent to \nAmericans by agreeing to this Conference Report and sending it to the \nPresident. We have made a statement that we are not interested in \nplacing our students into smaller class sizes even though research has \nshown they will learn faster with less discipline problems and will \nhave higher high school graduation rates. We have said that we are not \ninterested in ensuring the health of our children by providing \nimmunizations that are known to prevent severe illness and even death \nform numerous childhood diseases. Finally, we have said that we are not \nconcerned about the nutrition of our women and children nor are we \ninterested in the nutrition of our homebound elderly.\n  What kind of priorities does this Congress have? Looking at this \nConference Report and at our work over the past few months, it's hard \nfor me to tell. We have failed on many fronts to do the work the people \nof this country have sent us here to do. We haven't passed a \ncomprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. We have not passed responsible \ngun control legislation. Just last week we were reminded that we have \nfailed to pass comprehensive medical privacy legislation, leaving the \nAdministration to do our work for us. And now, we can't even do one of \nour most important jobs--appropriating responsibly.\n  Mr. President, the Labor-HHS-Education-DC Appropriations Conference \nReport that this Senate passed this morning is just another example of \nwhere this Congress has failed. I look forward to the day when we can \nreturn to a time when we act responsibly and do the work the American \npeople expect of us.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues and \nthe American people to carefully consider one of the most pressing \npublic health issues which faces America, an issue about which far too \nfew people are aware and which is ever so obliquely tucked into the \nmany pages of the appropriations measure we are about to consider.\n  This issue has to do with the workings of our national organ \ntransplantation and allocation system and by extension the lives of \nhundreds of Americans whose lives hang in the balance.\n  Ideally, our national organ transplantation and allocation system--\nwhich at its core is about saving lives--would be governed according to \nstandard medical criteria whereby donated organs go to those who need \nthem most. Sadly, though, this is not the case. Our current organ \nallocation system has evolved into a needlessly contentious debate \nwhere fragile life-and-death decisions are being reduced to economic--\nand many times geographic--factors.\n  If you are an American citizen who needs a liver transplant to \nsurvive, and you reside in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York or Pennsylvania, \nyou have much less chance of receiving a transplant than someone else \nwith a similar level of illness who lives in another part of the \ncountry. That is the conclusion of the latest patient outcome data from \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n  Despite enhanced capacities to keep organs viable for longer periods \nof time and to make them available to those who would benefit most, \nmany regional transplant centers are still attempting to keep donated \norgans in their own geographic area. These ``organ hoarding'' policies \nand practices contribute to the deaths of thousands of Americans whose \nlives could otherwise be saved.\n  Consider: While an estimated 62,000 potential recipients are waiting \ntheir turn to receive organs, only 20,000 transplants take place in a \ngiven year. More than 4,000 Americans die each year--at least 11 per \nday--while awaiting organ transplants. Of those, it is estimated that \n1,000 Americans--more than 3 each day--might have been saved if the \nsystem operated more fairly.\n  Last year, HHS issued new regulations designed to reduce these \ninequities. The 1998 Final Rule contained provisions to make the \nnational organ transplant system more fair. Its goal was to ensure that \nthe allocation of scarce organs is based on medical criteria determined \nby physicians, and not on geography. But a rider to the 1998 omnibus \nspending bill delayed implementation of the regulations for a year--and \nrequired the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study the impact of the \nFinal Rule.\n  Whereas I opposed the moratorium that Congress passed just over one \nyear ago because I was convinced that the HHS rule was in the best \ninterest of patients, many of my colleagues ignored previous studies by \nthe Office of the Inspector General and the General Accounting Office, \namong others, and were swayed by the rhetoric of this very emotional \ndebate when they supported this one-year moratorium. Proponents of the \nmoratorium then argued that we did not have sufficient evidence to \nconclude that the current system has inequities. So innocent transplant \ncandidates had to wait at least another year for a sensible policy of \nbroader organ sharing.\n  Yet, ironically, some of my colleagues' action of endorsing a \nmoratorium reflected a bit of wisdom. If not for the provision in the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill of 1998 which called on the IOM to study \nthese issues, we would not have such clear evidence in support of the \nrule, evidence that is void of partisan or special interest input. By \nits very nature, the IOM was able to distance itself from the \npronouncements of those with vested interests and to undertake an \nacademic, evidence-based review of the issues. To question the \nintegrity of the report is to question the integrity of the Institute \nof Medicine, of our nation's greatest minds, and of the scientific \nprocess itself.\n  As charged by Congress, the IOM released its report on June 20, 1999. \nAnd the results were a vindication for patients everywhere and \nirrefutably argue for pressing forward with the HHS Final Rule with its \ncall for broader organ sharing. The IOM report has five noteworthy \nhighlights.\n  The first is waiting times. The IOM concludes that waiting time for \nliver transplantation is an issue only for the most critically ill \npatients. For patients who are less acutely ill, waiting time is not an \nappropriate criterion in deciding about the allocation of donor organs. \nThe IOM suggests that equitable access to transplantation would be best \nfacilitated by development of a system with objective criteria that \nreflect medical need.\n  The second is larger Organ Allocation Areas. The HHS Final Rule \nplaces priority on sharing organs as broadly as possible, within limits \ndictated by science and technology. The IOM report concurs with this \napproach, and specifically recommends establishing Organ Allocation \nAreas (OAAs) for livers. The IOM suggests that OAAs serving at least \nnine million people each would significantly promote equity in\n\n[[Page S13629]]\n\naccess to transplantation, and be feasible with current technology.\n  The third is federal oversight. The IOM report recommends that HHS \ncontinue to exercise the legitimate oversight responsibilities assigned \nto it by the National Organ Transplant Act. The report further notes \nthat strong federal oversight is necessary and appropriate to manage \nthe system of organ procurement and transplantation most effectively in \nthe public interest. The report also recommends the establishment of an \nIndependent Scientific Review Board to assist the Secretary in these \nefforts.\n  The fourth is data collection and dissemination. The IOM report finds \nthat current data are inadequate to monitor some aspects of the organ \ntransplantation program. They suggest that the Organ Procurement and \nTransplantation Network contractor should improve data collection, and \nmake standardized and useful data available to independent \ninvestigators and scientific reviewers in a timely fashion.\n  The fifth is effects on organ donation and small transplantation \ncenters. The IOM was also asked to consider whether the requirements in \nthe Final Rule would decrease organ donation, or cause harm to small \norgan transplantation centers. It found no evidence to suggest that \neither of these concerns would be realized. The IOM concurs that \nchanges in the organ transplantation system--along the lines proposed \nby the Secretary--would improve fair access to lifesaving \ntransplantation services.\n  Mr. President, 20 years ago retaining local allocation of organs was \na sensible policy because organ viability--the window of opportunity \nduring which an organ can be successfully transplanted--was not very \nlong. But over the past two decades, the scientific knowledge and \ntechniques for the retrieval, preservation and transplantation of \ndonated organs have improved tremendously and have led to the \ndevelopment of organ transplantation as a means to save lives. These \nrecent advances in science and technology now permit broader sharing of \norgans, with more focus on medical necessity and less restriction by \ngeography as criteria for organ allocation. And yet, despite these \nenhanced capacities to keep organs viable for longer periods of time \nand to make them available to patients in parts of the country far from \nwhere those organs first may have been retrieved, many small regional \ntransplant centers incredibly still fight to keep donated organs in \ntheir own geographic area.\n\n  The Final Rule reflects ongoing commitment by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services (HHS), which I share with many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, to maintain the most equitable and advanced \ntransplantation system and to reform the anachronistic allocation \nsystem which is needlessly costing lives.\n  The basic principles that underlie the 1998 Final Rule were supported \nby the conclusions of the IOM study. In late October of this year, HHS \nreleased a revised Final Rule, incorporating information and \nsuggestions from the IOM and from the transplant community. This \nrevised Final Rule is the culmination of the IOM study, four \nCongressional hearings, public hearings and consultations conducted by \nHHS, and nearly five years of public comment.\n  Today, proponents of the status-quo system of rank inequities have \nmanaged to include in this bill language which calls for yet another \nmoratorium. They now say that any new regulations must be developed \nonly after the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) is \nreauthorized. This is an interesting change of argumentation now that \nthe facts, as contained in the IOM report and other publications, have \nbeen publicized about how the current system in fact does not operate \nin the public's interest.\n  Whereas I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues to \nreauthorize NOTA, and most especially to the opportunity to develop a \nclear mandate and strategies for increasing organ donation, plans for \nfuture NOTA reauthorization should not be used as an excuse to \nperpetuate the current inequitable system which the Final Rule seeks to \nremedy. Additionally, the current NOTA statute does provide the \nSecretary with the necessary authority to immediately address the needs \nof those who are dying every day because of inequities in the system.\n  Currently, NOTA mandates that HHS and the transplant community share \nresponsibility to govern the organ transplantation and allocation \nsystem. The he underlying principle on which Congress enacted NOTA back \nin 1984 to better coordinate the use of donated organs and to address \nthe concern that the sickest patients receive priority for organ \ntransplantation. As a result of this law, the Organ Procurement and \nTransplantation Network (OPTN) was established. As you know, the OPTN's \nmembership is comprised of organ procurement organizations and \nhospitals with transplant facilities. The primary function of the OPTN \nis to maintain both a national computerized list of patients waiting \nfor transplantation and a 24-hour-a-day computerized organ placement \ncenter, which matches donors and recipients. Currently, the United \nNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a private entity, holds the federal \ncontract for the OPTN and establishes organ allocation policy.\n  I would like to assure my colleagues that under the revised Final \nRule, development of the medical and allocation policies of the OPTN \nremain the responsibility of transplant professionals, in cooperation \nwith the centers, patients and donor families represented on the OPTN \nboard. Most importantly, in the revised Final Rule, HHS provides for \nthe public accountability that is necessary for a national program on \nwhich so many lives depend.\n  The HHS regulations for broader organ sharing have been the subject \nof rigorous debate in Congress, within the transplant community, and on \nthe pages and airwaves of the local and national media. While \nconstructive discourse is the root of our democracy, what has concerned \nme over the past couple of years is that deceit and fear have \ncharacterized this particular debate. Even for those who are extremely \nclose to these issues, it has become more and more difficult to \ndistinguish the true facts. Indeed, this is the very reason that \nCongress stipulated the Institute of Medicine study this issue.\n  My greatest concern is for the lives of worthy, innocent transplant \ncandidates which hang in the balance each day, each hour, each minute \nthat we delay moving forward with these regulations. Please make every \nconsideration to expedite the process so that the transplant community \ncan move forward to improve the system so that more lives can be saved.\n  As my colleagues may know, the federal Task Force on Organ \nTransplantation (formed in 1986), in a critical decision, established \nthat donated organs belong to the community, and it identified that \ncommunity as a national one. Consistent with this decision, the new HHS \nregulations identify donated organs as a precious national, not local \nor regional, resource--thus helping to elicit what James Childress, a \nmedical ethicist who served on the transplant task force, calls \n``communal altruism'' or public commitment to organ donation. \nChildress, an authority on the subject of organ donation, states in a \n1989 edition of the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, \n``Donations of organs cannot be expected unless there is public \nconfidence in the justice of the system of organ distribution.''\n  In order to maintain an effective system for the allocation of life-\nsaving organs, we must first ensure that we have an adequate supply of \nthose organs. An adequate supply relies on public generosity and \ncommitment, which, in turn, relies on the public perception that the \nsystem for organ allocation is both publicly accountable and fair.\n  The HHS regulations have prompted debate in large part because they \nwould change the allocation system from a local/regional one to one of \nbroader organ sharing. They would allocate organs to the most medically \nurgent patients first, rather than to those residing in the same \ngeographic area as where the organ was donated. And I emphasize, that \nwhile the HHS regulations call for a national system, they do not call \nfor a national allocation system. They leave the specific policy \ndecisions in the hands of the transplant community.\n  I have registered as an organ donor; when I die, I do not care \nwhether or not my organs go to a resident of Pittsburgh; I hope they go \nto the person who needs them the most. The majority of Americans share \nmy sentiments. According to the results of a Gallup public opinion \nsurvey released this past\n\n[[Page S13630]]\n\nJune, most Americans--83 percent--want donated organs to go to the \nsickest patients first, regardless of where they live.\n  Not only do the HHS guidelines meet standards of effectiveness, in \npart, by helping to ensure broad public commitment to organ donation, \nthey also meet the related standard of equity. By creating a process \ndesigned to lead to a broader geographic sharing of organs, these \nproposed regulations equalize waiting times among transplant centers, \nthus also--and effectively--save more lives. CONSAD Research \nCorporation has already identified a number of alternative policies \nthat would equalize waiting times and save more lives.\n  The HHS regulations further require standardized medical criteria to \nbe used when placing patients on the national waiting list and \ndetermining their priority among all patients needing organ transplants \nthroughout the United States. They therefore call for equitable organ \nallocation throughout the country to ensure that the most medically \nurgent patients, within reasonable medical parameters, have first \naccess to organs.\n  We know that there currently exists enormous disparity in waiting \ntimes for organ transplantation from region to region in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chart of recently \nreleased HHS data be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, these disparities were first brought \ninto sharp focus in the 1997 Report of the OPTN: Waiting List Activity \nand Donor Procurement, and now even more so in this recently released \nHHS data. Why the median liver transplantation rate during one year for \n``listed'' candidates in Chicago would be 23% and 83% in Milwaukee is \nunconscionable. Equally disturbing is that a patient of blood type \n``O'' would have a median waiting time of 721 days in western \nPennsylvania and just 46 days in Iowa.\n  As we can see from the facts under the current allocation system, \noften a critically ill patient in one region can go without a life-\nsaving organ while a healthier patient in another region--one with a \nlarger supply of organs--can be treated as a priority.\n  In meeting this standard of equity, the HHS regulations can help to \nprevent what has become an alarming and extremely parochial trend--that \nof states passing ``local first'' laws or resolutions. Kentucky, \nLouisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona and Texas have \neither passed laws or resolutions or have proposed such laws that \nstrive to keep organs in their respective states, while not necessarily \nallocating these organs to state residents.\n  This is a critical distinction: Patients often travel from other \nstates for the high-quality care offered by large transplant centers, \nwhich generate considerable revenue. When states seek to retain organs \nin this manner, they are serving economic self-interest, not patient \ninterest. And what of the patients who reside in states with no liver \nor heart transplant program? These patients, including those with \nMedicaid and Medicare, must travel to other states, where the access to \norgans and the waiting times can vary significantly.\n  The new HHS guidelines would better meet procedural and substantive \nstandards of justice than does current policy. They would encourage \nmore public participation in the policy making process and, therefore, \nmore accountability, and they would equalize the treatment of medically \nsimilar cases.\n  In developing policies for the life-and-death issue of organ \nallocation, we should rise to broadly accepted standards of justice \nrather than acquiesce to narrowly defined regional interests.\n  Arthur L. Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania Center for \nBioethics and Peter Ubel of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter wrote in The New England Journal of Medicare on Oct. 29, 1998, \n``We believe that the United States should end policies that permit \ngeographic inequities and move quickly to determine the best use of \ndata on the efficacy of outcomes to create a more equitable national \nsystem of distribution.''\n  Because I believe that any organ allocation system should be defined \nby, and accommodate, the moral principles of effectiveness and equity, \nI strongly support the proposed change to a national allocation system \nas outlined in the Department of Health and Human Services revised \nregulation. I firmly believe that the Secretary needs to exercise her \nauthority so that a more equitable system based on uniform medical \ncriteria can immediately move forward. Again, I will repeat for my \ncolleagues that plans for future NOTA reauthorization should not be \nused as an excuse for delay while innocent Americans are needlessly \ndying. Further delay prevents more needy transplant candidates from \nreceiving vital, life-saving organs.\n  Now, I realize that this body will likely adopt this conference \nreport, despite its containing this controversial language for another \nmoratorium. But let us bear in mind that the President has vowed to \nveto this legislation over this issue and other spending priorities \ncontained herein.\n  Thus, it is not too late. When our leaders reconvene to negotiate \nbudget priorities with the administration, I urge my colleagues to \noppose another moratorium, and join me in ending a system that unfairly \ndeprives patients of access to life-saving organ transplantation, and \nallow the regulations to go forward. This is an issue which transcends \npolitics.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to be \nhere for the vote but I thank the conferees for their hard work on the \nconference report that provides federal funding for the District of \nColumbia, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), \nand Education. I am very disappointed that this report includes \nwasteful, locality-specific, pork-barrel projects, legislative riders, \nand budget gimmicks such as ``forward funding'' and a 1-percent cut in \ngovernment spending across-the-board. Therefore, I cannot support this \nbill.\n  This legislation is intended to provide funding directly benefiting \nAmerican families and senior citizens while assisting our most \nimportant resource, our children. It provides funding to help states \nand local communities educate our children. It also provides the funds \nto support our scientists in finding treatments for illness. This \nreport also provides funds for ensuring our nation's most vulnerable--\nour children, seniors and disabled have access to quality health care. \nFurthermore, it provides the monetary support for important programs \nassisting older Americans including Meals on Wheels and senior day care \nprograms.\n  I am pleased that this legislation took an important step towards \nensuring that our nation's schools have the flexibility to determine \nhow to meet the unique educational needs of their students instead of \nWashington bureaucrats mandating a ``one size fits all'' policy. \nSecond, this bill provides a significant increase in funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) which is critical in our ongoing \nbattle against disease.\n  These are just some of the important provisions in this conference \nreport. There are many additional items which are as pertinent to our \nnation's well-being which makes it all the more frustrating that this \nbill is still laden with earmarks, legislative riders and unjustifiable \nbudget gimmicks.\n  First, this legislation contains $388 million in total pork-barrel \nspending\n\n[[Page S13631]]\n\n($335 million in earmarks and set-asides for the Departments of Health \nand Human Services, and Education). Some of the more egregious \nviolations of the appropriate budgetary review process include:\n  $2.5 million for Alaska Works in Fairbanks, Alaska for construction \njob training;\n  $1.5 million for the University of Missouri-St. Louis for their \nRegional Center for Education and Work;\n  $104 million for the construction and renovation of specific health \ncare and other facilities including: Brookfield Zoo/Loyola University \nSchool of Medicine, University of Montana Institute for Environmental \nand Health Sciences and Edward Health Services, Naperville, Illinois; \nand\n  $3,000,000 to continue the Diabetes Lower Extremity Amputation \nPrevention (LEAP) programs at the University of South Alabama.\n  While these projects may have good reason to be deserving of funding, \nit is appalling that these funds are specifically earmarked and not \nsubject to the appropriate competitive grant process. I am confident \nthat there are many organizations which need financial assistance and \nyet, are not fortunate enough to have an advocate in the appropriations \nprocess to ensure that their funding is earmarked in this legislation. \nThis is wrong and does a disservice to all Americans who deserve fair \naccess to job training and quality health care.\n  Some of the legislative riders include $3.5 million in this report to \nimplement the Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Interventions for \nNewborns and Infants with Hearing Loss Act. This legislative initiative \nwas inserted into the Senate and House appropriation bill without \nhearings or debate on this proposal by either chamber. I applaud the \nintentions of this measure and share my colleagues' support for helping \nensure that all hospitals, not just the current 20%, provide screening \nin order to produce early diagnosis and intervention for our children \nto ensure that they have an equal start in life and learning. However, \nthe manner in which it was included in this measure bypasses the \nappropriate legislative procedure. Instead, this measure should have \nbeen given full consideration by the Senate as a free-standing \ninitiative or as an amendment to appropriate legislation.\n  Furthermore, I am also opposed to the use of budget gimmicks in this \nreport. First, the report has opted to use the newly popular budget \ngimmick of ``forward funding,'' used to postpone spending until the \nnext fiscal year to avoid counting costs in the current fiscal year. \nWhat this means is that $10 billion in funding for job training, health \nresearch, and education grants to states is pushed into next year--a \nbudgetary sleight of hand that merely delays the inevitable accounting \nfor these tax dollars. What a sham.\n  Finally, now that the surplus has been spent for pork-barrel spending \ninstead of shoring up Social Security and Medicare, paying down the \ndebt, and providing tax relief, the appropriators have opted to include \na 1-percent cut in government spending across-the-board to keep \nCongress from touching Social Security. Why not just cut the pork-\nbarrel spending in the first place to avoid resorting to such gimmicks?\n  Mr. President, because of the egregious amount of pork-barrel \nspending in this bill, the addition of legislative riders, and the 1-\npercent across-the-board spending cut, I must oppose its passage. I \nregret doing so because of the many important and worthy programs \nincluded in the conference agreement, but I cannot endorse the \ncontinued waste of taxpayer dollars on special interest programs, nor \ncan I acquiesce in bypassing the normal authorizing process for \nlegislative initiatives. If an Omnibus appropriations bill is required \nin order to complete the appropriations process for fiscal year 2000, I \nhope that the Congress finds the courage to remove the many earmarks, \nthe budget gimmicks, and the legislative riders contained in this \nreport, the bill, and all others so that we can provide the much needed \nfinancial support for job training, education, health care, research \nand senior programs and avoid a congressional sequester.\n  The full list of the objectionable provisions is on my Senate \nwebsite.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the most amazing rhetoric \non the other side. I am told by my colleague from Minnesota we have cut \nall the increases the Senate put in this bill. What is wrong is the \nfacts. We haven't cut the increases. In fact, we haven't cut them out \nat all. We have increased in the areas where we have prioritized.\n  Education: $2 billion more than in last year's budget. What does a 1-\npercent cut across-the-board mean? It means $1.8 billion more than we \nspent last year.\n  NIH: We are committed to giving NIH double the funding for medical \nresearch in this country. We are keeping our promise. We are increasing \nNIH $1.8 billion over last year.\n  Head Start: We increased it $600 million. A 1-percent cut means we \nare increasing it $594 million.\n  We are keeping a promise. We have said the most important thing we \nare going to do in this Congress is keep our Social Security surplus \nintact. We are doing it by making sure we do not go into that surplus. \nWe are making a 1-percent across-the-board cut in increases because we \nhave given so much more than we did last year.\n  Let me talk about what happens in a 1-percent decrease. Any person \nwho has ever run a corporation or an agency or even an office knows a \n1-percent cut does not go in the programs. We are not going to lose \nteachers. We are not going to lose people who are getting veteran \nbenefits. They are going to cut travel budgets, office supplies; they \nwill cut in the bureaucracy; that is, if they have the responsibility \nto make the right decisions.\n  We are going to keep our promise to keep social security intact. We \nare going to do it in a responsible way so they can take cuts in travel \nbudgets, they can take cuts in their bureaucracies to make sure the \nprograms are funded at the increased levels that Congress is requiring \nthem to do.\n  This is the most responsible act Congress has taken. I am stunned the \nother side will not step up to the plate and do what they promised \nalso; that is, keep Social Security intact.\n  I yield my remaining time to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not repeat what has been stated, \nother than generally to say most of the social programs in this bill, \nfrom Meals on Wheels to student aid to everything else in between, even \nafter the .97-percent cut, are substantially higher than last year and, \nin almost every instance, higher than what the President of the United \nStates asked for in his budget.\n  If doing that amounts to cutting a program, then, frankly, I don't \nunderstand what it means to increase a program and increase them as \ndramatically as we have in this bill. The best friend the National \nInstitutes of Health has ever had is a Republican Congress. We are \nincreasing National Institutes of Health because people such as Connie \nMack and a few others have said double it in the next 5 years. In this \nbill, we had in NIH $2.3 billion more than the President; with the \nacross-the-board cut, we are $2 billion in appropriations more than the \nPresident.\n  Essentially, there has been a lot of talk about saving Social \nSecurity, and we have used some OMB scoring where we think it is \nappropriate. There are those who still come to the floor and act as if \nthey actually know we have infringed on the Social Security surplus. \nLet me repeat for the Senate, in March, April, or May of next year, I \npredict with almost absolute certainty that a budget comes out close to \nthis budget produced by Senator Stevens and the appropriations bill and \nwill not take any money out of Social Security.\n  They can argue that the President's numbers wouldn't have taken any \nout--CBO's numbers might. But essentially, when the bell tolls and we \ndo the reevaluation, we are going to be able to say to the senior \ncitizens we didn't touch Social Security. The .97 is important to that \nsolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under an additional consent, \nrelevant trade amendments are in order in addition to the germaneness \nrequirement under rule XXII. Those additional first-degree trade \nrelevant amendments must be filed by 2:30 today.\n  I urge all Senators to offer and debate their amendments in a timely \nfashion. I request relevant amendments not be abused so we can complete \nthis very important trade legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for their support for the cloture motion. The vote reflects the \nstrong bipartisan support for the bill.\n  I also want to extend my thanks to the distinguished majority and \nminority leaders, who worked so hard to find the compromise that would \nallow the bill to move forward.\n  Due to their hard work, we have the opportunity to send a clear \nstatement to our neighbors in the Caribbean, Central America, and \nAfrica that we are willing to invest in a long-term economic \nrelationship--a relationship of partners in a common endeavor of \nexpanding trade, enhancing economic growth, and improving living \nstandards.\n  Most importantly, this bill will also send a clear signal to our \ntrading partners around the world who will join us shortly in Seattle \nfor the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization. It signals \nthat the United States is prepared to engage constructively in the \nwider world around us and to provide the leadership necessary to \nachieve our common goals.\n  Most importantly, the bill means we will fulfill our commitment to \nthe American workers and firms that will benefit from this bill--a \ncommitment that means $8.8 billion in new sales and an increase of \n121,000 jobs over the course of the next 5 years in the U.S. textile \nindustry alone.\n  As I have emphasized again and again in this debate, this is not a \nbill that is good just for our neighbors in the Caribbean and Central \nAmerica or our partners in Africa. This is a bill that is good for our \nworkers here at home as well. It is a ``win-win'' situation \neconomically for American workers and our friends abroad.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues over these coming hours \nto fashion a still stronger bill that would further those goals.\n  Let me emphasize once more the strong bipartisan support reflected in \nthe vote just taken. The motion for cloture carried by a vote of 74-23. \nI urge my colleagues to move as expeditiously as we can because time is \nlimited. As we all know, the Congress is coming to the end of the \ncurrent session and we want to make sure everybody has the opportunity \nto bring forward their amendments. It is important we do so in a \nfashion to expeditiously conclude action on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n\n[[Page S13633]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to join most emphatically with my \nrevered chairman in congratulating the Senate today, in thanking the \nmajority and minority leaders. We have risen to a moment which was \nominously in doubt.\n  Last week, as the week progressed, two things took place: One, on the \nSenate floor, as we now have established, we had 74 votes just to \nproceed with the bill--we will have more when this is done. Even so, we \nfound ourselves in a procedural tangle not unknown to the body which \nwas thwarting the will of an emphatic majority--and not just a majority \nfor this legislation but a majority for a tradition of openness in \ntrade that began 65 years ago with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act \nof 1934 at the depths of the Depression, the aftermath of the Smoot-\nHawley legislation, with our system of government very much under \nchallenge. That challenge would grow more fierce and would end in the \ngreat World War.\n  We were then, even so, confident enough of the promise of trade that \nwe could go forward in this matter. We have been going forward for 60 \nyears. However, 5 years ago we stopped. The President did obtain the \napproval of the Congress for the World Trade Organization. I shouldn't \nput it that the President ``obtained'' the approval of the Congress; \nCongress approved what Congress had sent our negotiators to obtain. \nThere was a little side ripple there. An international trade \norganization was to have been one of the main institutions of the \nBretton Woods system created in 1944. The International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development--we call it the World Bank--the \nInternational Monetary Fund were created; the International Trade \nOrganization didn't happen.\n  Finally, we caught up with ourselves and we created the World Trade \nOrganization which I believe now has 134 members with 30 observers \ncurrently applying for membership. I said there were two ominous, even \nmenacing moments. The second was that there was almost no attention \npaid in the press and media to this week-long frustrating, seemingly \nunavailing effort. We have been on this a week and we got nowhere. No \none noticed. It is as if no one cared.\n  We woke up. Yesterday, the Washington Post in a lead editorial on \nthis subject noted neither the administration nor the Congress had done \nanything they needed to do, and that at the end of this month the World \nTrade Organization will meet in Seattle. Our Ambassador, our Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Barshefsky, will open the meeting. Our \nPresident will be there, along with heads of state. We will be talking \nabout the next round of global trade negotiations. They can take 9, 10 \nyears. They are fundamentally important.\n\n  But our President will not have the authority to enter these \nnegotiations--or rather to send the resulting agreements to the \nCongress for expedited consideration. If he were to have had the sub-\nSaharan African legislation fail and the Caribbean initiative of \nPresident Reagan fail; if we were to have, in effect, allowed the Trade \nExpansion Act of 1962, President Kennedy's measure that led to the \nKennedy Round, like the Uruguay Round, expire and say to the 200,000 \nAmerican families who are displaced by trade, as others are, that we \nshould let economic forces work their way and tell them, that's too \nbad; if we allowed the Generalized System of Preferences to expire and \nsay, no matter, how would our representatives look? What would they \nsay? What could they undertake? Very little.\n  It would be a moment in trade that would be shameful, after 65 years \nof bringing the world out of the depths of the Great Depression, now, \nin the longest economic expansion in the United States, the longest \neconomic expansion in history.\n  For so many years we talked about ``the longest peacetime \nexpansion.'' No, no, this expansion is greater even than that from \nWorld War II. This is what trade has brought us. Not just trade, but \nwithout trade expansion we could not have had this economic expansion. \nNow, at least, we can go to Seattle and say: Here are our bona fides. \nWe are still players. We still want to go forward.\n  So, Mr. President, let the games begin. We have a long debate before \nus. It will be a bipartisan debate. The Senator from Delaware, the \nchairman of our committee, will be leading the debate. His deputy, if I \nmay so deputize myself, will be at his side across the aisle. Let us \nnow proceed, being of good heart and great expectations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from New \nYork if he could articulate the importance of the legislation before \nus.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I certainly could attempt to do so. I would not risk \noverstatement. There would be a setting in which, having given the \nPresident negotiating authority for a new round of international trade \ntalks, having arranged for Trade Adjustment Assistance to be continued \nas it has been for 37 years, we could say: The particular matters \nbefore us will be part of the trade negotiations--and so forth. We \ncould say we will get to it next year.\n  But we don't have that negotiating authority. The President goes to \nSeattle emptyhanded. The only thing he can bring with him is the trade \nlegislation we have before us--which we still have to take to the \nHouse. But this is all the United States can show the world, the world \nwhich has been following us for all these years.\n  So I hope, at a very minimum, the sense of tradition--even, if I may \nsay, of honor--will drive us forward in this matter.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would like to refer to fast track. Like my colleague, I \nam very unhappy that this authority has not been extended this \nPresident.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And, sir, that this President did not ask for it when \nhe could get it.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct. That is correct.\n  I also point out our committee in the last 2 years reported this \nlegislation out because there is strong bipartisan support for fast \ntrack to be granted to the President, this President, by both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sure.\n  Mr. ROTH. Unfortunately, there has not been strong leadership from \nthe White House on this matter. It seems to me it is a matter of grave \nconcern. But since that has not happened, I do agree with what my \ncolleague has just said, that it is important we act on this \nlegislation so it becomes clear to our friends and neighbors around the \nworld that we continue to plan to provide leadership in this most \nimportant area of trade.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, sir, and that it becomes clear to our friends \naround the world, as you say, and our friends downtown--give them \nheart; give them something to show.\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely. I applaud and congratulate the Senator from New \nYork for his leadership, not only during the current session but down \nthrough the years in this most important trade policy. We look forward \nto bringing home the bacon in the next 30 hours on this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished managers of the bill \noffered the $8 billion figure in sales and some 121,000 jobs. The truth \nis, we know from the Labor Department statistics that we have lost \n420,000 textile jobs nationwide and some 31,200 textile jobs in South \nCarolina alone. They said NAFTA was going to create 200,000 jobs. They \nclaim today it is 121,000. In Mexico itself, it was going to create \n200,000 jobs. We know textiles alone lost 420,000, and it is undisputed \nthat 31,200 jobs were lost in the State of South Carolina.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print two articles with respect to the \neconomy and how it has worked in Mexico, one from the Wall Street \nJournal and the other from the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13634]]\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 27, 1999]\n\n                           A Decade of Change\n\n                        (By Jonathan Friedland)\n\n\nthe have-nots: the free-market revolution promised so much; To many in \n               latin america, it has delivered so little\n\n       Texcalitla, Mexico.--Liberalization, privatization, \n     globalization. Mary Garcia may not be aware of them in so \n     many words, but she has felt their impact from behind the \n     two-frame stove of her cinder-block cafe, the Avenida \n     Nacional.\n       Perched alongside the highway that was once the main road \n     between Mexico City and the resort city of Acapulco, Mrs. \n     Garcia's restaurant used to serve dozens of plates of rabbit \n     stew to travelers daily. But early this decade, amid a severe \n     downsizing of the Mexican state, the government let private \n     contractors build a swift toll road between the two cities \n     that bypassed the Avenida Nacional.\n       Mrs. Garcia has far fewer clients nowadays. Not only that, \n     but the taxes she pays have gone up, in part because of the \n     new road. The Highway of the Sun, as it's called, has been \n     such a financial disaster that the government bought it back \n     two years ago from the companies that built it. The same \n     thing happened with a dozen banks, a pair of airlines and 25 \n     other highway projects. After botched privatizations, they \n     are back in the hands of the government, and taxpayers are \n     facing a bill that may total as much as $90 billion.\n       ``I am all for progress,'' Mrs. Garcia says wistfully, \n     straightening up the place settings in her empty restaurant. \n     ``But this kind of progress is killing us.''\n       From Texcalitla, here in Mexico's rural Guerrero state, to \n     Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America, there \n     are a lot of people who feel the same way. For many Latin \n     Americans, the free-market revolution that has swept the \n     region in the past decade hasn't delivered the kind of \n     progress they were told it would--easier lives, better \n     incomes and a more secure future. Instead, it has confirmed \n     many of their worst fears about capitalism.\n       Since Chile embarked on its free-market experiment in the \n     late 1970s, widespread domestic market liberalization, \n     privatization of once-unwieldy state asset holdings and a \n     removal of barriers to foreign competition have made Latin \n     America a much healthier place in purely macroeconomic \n     terms. Government finances are in better shape than ever. \n     Foreign direct investment is up, and inflation rates have \n     fallen. And Latin Americans have access to a wider variety \n     of goods and services than ever before.\n       But there has also been a big downside to the move from \n     closed to open economies. Buffeted by forces beyond their \n     control--such as the woes of other emerging markets as far \n     afield as Russia and Indonesia--Latin American economies have \n     posted frustratingly inconsistent growth rates in recent \n     years. Job creation has actually slowed while overall \n     unemployment in the region has remained stable, according to \n     Inter-American Development Bank statistics. That means that \n     more Latin Americans work in the informal economy than a \n     decade ago, and that income distribution, uneven to begin \n     with, has generally grown more so.\n       In fact, from 1980 to 1996, the latest year for which hard \n     data are available, the trend has been for an ever greater \n     percentage of national income to end up in ever fewer hands \n     in all Latin American countries except Costa Rica and \n     Uruguay, says Elena Martinez, regional director of the United \n     Nations Development Program. Unlike their bigger neighbors, \n     Costa Rica and Uruguay have kept a lid on competition and \n     have struggled to maintain their state-run social-welfare \n     systems.\n       Elsewhere, in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and other \n     countries, the pattern has been this: A handful of \n     entrepreneurs, often with close ties to their country's \n     political elite, have gotten richer. The middle class, never \n     large to begin with and traditionally propped up by plentiful \n     government jobs, urban food subsidies and trade barriers that \n     kept inefficient companies alive, has shrunk. And the poor, \n     whose safety net, never strong, has been strained by demands \n     for fiscal austerity from the international financiers these \n     countries depend on, keep getting poorer.\n       ``In the 1990s, Latin American policy makers have put their \n     emphasis on overall performance, on making sure the \n     macroeconomic indicators were lining up,'' says Gert \n     Rosenthal, a Guatemalan economist. ``But there is a growing \n     consensus that something is terribly wrong when you have this \n     and 40% of your population is in worse shape than before.''\n       The negative balance of the free-market experiment for many \n     Latin Americans has tipped the scales away from support for \n     further reform. Leading presidential candidates in Argentina, \n     Chile and Mexico--three countries with elections over the \n     next year--are all emphasizing the need to put people before \n     markets. ``There is a search for a kinder, gentler form of \n     capitalism,'' says Lacey Gallagher, head of Latin American \n     sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor's Co. in New York. ``It \n     is sad, but the reform process in a lot of countries is \n     getting stuck because political support for reforms has \n     dwindled so much.''\n       No one thinks Latin America will return to the days of \n     import substitution and uncontrollable deficit spending, or \n     that social revolution is on the horizon. But observers like \n     Ms. Gallagher worry that although they have embarked on \n     the free-market path, many Latin American economies aren't \n     yet flexible enough to adapt to change in the global \n     economy. Nor can they deliver an improved standard of \n     living to the majority of their citizens. ``The first-\n     stage reforms, which most Latin American countries have \n     already been through, worsen income distribution, make \n     economic cycles more profound and raise unemployment,'' \n     she says. ``The payoff comes with the second-stage \n     reforms.''\n       But those reforms, which include strengthening tax \n     collections, making taxation fairer and labor laws more \n     flexible, and streamlining institutions like courts and \n     schools, have run into public opposition mainly because of \n     the financial and social costs associated with the first \n     round of reforms. Politicians generally realize these are the \n     steps they have to take, but in the fledgling democratic \n     environment in which they operate, consensus building is a \n     painfully slow process.\n       In Argentina, for instance, President Carlos Menem has \n     tried for several years to scrap the country's antiquated \n     labor laws, but he can't because still-powerful unions \n     believe the old rules are the only remaining safeguard for \n     their workers. Lately, Mr. Menem hasn't pushed the point \n     because his Peronist party, built originally upon a base of \n     fervent worker support, needs union backing to prevail in \n     presidential elections scheduled for October.\n       Economists say the cost of the delay has been high. \n     Argentina, which pegged its currency to the dollar earlier in \n     the decade to quash triple-digit inflation, has entered a \n     nasty recession because of a big currency devaluation by \n     Brazil, its No. 1 trading partner. With its inflexible labor \n     laws, Argentina can't reduce wages to remain competitive. The \n     result: Output has fallen and unemployment has soared.\n       A similar though less pressing dilemma faces Mexican \n     President Ernesto Zedillo. In March, he floated a plan to \n     gradually privatize the country's electrical sector, arguing \n     that the government doesn't have the resources to invest the \n     $25 billion needed over the next few years to increase the \n     power supply. While many Mexicans agree with the president's \n     basic point--that state funds ought to be spent on things \n     like health and education rather than power plants--few trust \n     the private sector to do the job properly.\n       It isn't hard to see why. Mexico's privatization binge has \n     been plagued by costly blunders that have many wondering \n     whether state finances are truly better off now, and whether \n     the Mexican economy is truly more competitive than before, as \n     the government contends. ``It isn't obvious to most Mexicans \n     that their lives have improved as a result of these \n     programs,'' says Luis Rubio, a Mexico City development \n     expert.\n       The toll roads provide a case in point. With the passage of \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement on the horizon and an \n     urgent need to upgrade Mexico's crumbling road infrastructure \n     to handle a surge in trade, former President Carlos Salinas \n     de Gortari embarked on a crash public-works program in which \n     private construction companies built a network of pay-as-you-\n     go highways. But in the government's rush to get the job \n     done, unrealistic traffic and income projection's were \n     made, local banks were muscled into coming up with the \n     financing, and companies without the necessary management \n     skills were signed up to do the work.\n       ``Although it had a private-sector complexion, it was \n     really an old-fashioned public-works program,'' says William \n     F. Foote, a former banker who has studied Mexico's toll-road \n     blitz. ``It was done without reference to the realities of \n     the market.''\n       That quickly became clear. Projects were plagued by cost \n     overruns, and once the roads opened for business, neither \n     truckers nor travelers could afford the high tolls demanded.\n       Within a few years, the government stepped in to take over \n     many of the roads, leaving the companies that built them to \n     accept a more gradual return on their investment. Those \n     companies are, in several cases, still waiting to be fully \n     reimbursed and claim that their weak financial condition is \n     mainly due to their toll-road commitments. Meanwhile, roads \n     such as the Highway of the Sun remain glittering and \n     desperately short on traffic.\n       The fact that the road hasn't delivered on its promise \n     isn't lost on Graciela Martinez, an elderly woman sitting \n     under a tree near one of its toll plazas. Mrs. Martinez, who \n     sells iguanas for a living, stands up to show off her product \n     each time a vehicle slows to pay the toll. There haven't been \n     any sales today, she says solemnly, because city people don't \n     appreciate a good lizard.\n       But, she jokes, the dearth of traffic does have an upside. \n     While it isn't great for here pocketbook, she says,'' at \n     least it's easy on my feet.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico--Business Mexico, \n                              April 1997]\n\nWhat's Wrong With This Picture?: Optimistic Investors Overlook Mexico's \n                         Consumer Spending Gap\n\n                           By Nicholas Wilson\n\n       At first sight Mexico seems like an investor's dream: a \n     country of 93 million people, number 13 on the world list of \n     natural wealth per capita, recently opened virgin markets,\n\n[[Page S13635]]\n\n     and a government that is rapidly forging trade agreements in \n     the Americas and aboard. Mexico, however, is also home to \n     grinding poverty, so just how big is its market? The reality, \n     according to economists, is that only between 10 percent and \n     20 percent of the population are really considered consumers. \n     The extreme unequal distribution of wealth has created a \n     distorted market, the economy is hamstrung by a work force \n     with a poor level of education, and a sizable chunk of the \n     gross domestic product is devoted to exports rather than \n     production for domestic consumption. Furthermore, worker's \n     purchasing power, already low, was devastated by the December \n     1994 peso crash and the severe recession that followed. Even \n     optimists do not expect wages in real terms to recover until \n     the next century. `They say there are more than 90 million \n     consumers in Mexico, but less than 20 percent earn more than \n     5,000 pesos (US$625) per month. The rest of the population \n     lives just above subsistence level,'' says Pedro Javier \n     Gonzalez, economist at the Mexican Institute of Political \n     Studies. the figures make grim reading: the National \n     Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas, \n     Geografia e Informatica, INEGI) and the Banco de Mexico \n     estimate that nearly 68 million Mexicans live in poverty. \n     About a million homes do not have electricity and potable \n     water, and adult illiteracy is 13 percent. According to \n     UNICEF's most recent report there are 9 million Mexican \n     children living in extreme poverty (one third of Mexico's \n     population is under 15 years old); 800,000 between the ages \n     of 6 and 14 years working in various productive sectors; and \n     60,000 ``street kids,'' a number that is increasing by 7 \n     percent annually. The United Nations says poverty is most \n     extreme in the informal sectors of the world's economies. The \n     World Bank estimates 42 percent of Mexico's economic \n     population is employed in the informal sector; the Finance \n     Secretariat put the figure at 50 percent during its recent \n     clampdown on tax evaders. The informal economy includes \n     street vendors as well as largely self-sufficient campesinos \n     who ``effectively neither buy from nor sell to the rest of \n     the economy,'' says Gonzalez. The formal sector, however, is \n     not exactly made up of affluent consumers either. Sixty \n     percent of the registered work force earns between one and \n     two minimum salaries per day, according to a recent study by \n     the Worker's University of Mexico (Universidad Obrera de \n     Mexico). The minimum wage is currently worth about US$3.00 \n     per day. ``Minimum wage guys don't buy imports,'' says one \n     analyst who preferred to remain anonymous.\n\n\n                           overly optimistic\n\n       Despite the poverty indicators, foreign investors often \n     sound cheerful to the point of being almost blase about the \n     economic and social statistics. ``NAFTA will connect the \n     world's largest market (the U.S.) to the world's largest city \n     (Mexico City) says David Dean, promoter of a superhighway to \n     facilitate transport between the free trade agreement's \n     member nations. Yet many of Mexico City's inhabitants don't \n     even have access to drainage, electricity or basic education.\n       ``Mexico has a teledensity of 6-8 telephone lines per one \n     hundred people, compared to 60 per hundred in the U.S. \n     There's a lot of potential in Mexico,'' says recently arrived \n     Bill Ricke, Global One international telecommunications \n     consortium president.\n       The potential is here, economists agree, but it is unlikely \n     to be developed in the near future with most of the \n     population living in abject poverty. Telefonos de Mexico \n     (Telmex) last year disconnected more customers for not paying \n     their bills than it connected. ``Nearly all of the (US$4 \n     billion) long distance telecommunications market in Mexico is \n     accounted for by businesses. Individuals only make \n     international calls in extreme emergencies,'' says economist \n     Patricia Nelson. In reality the market is only about the top \n     15 percent of earners and businesses, she says.\n       Export businesses account for nearly 25 percent of the \n     gross domestic product (GDP), which in 1996 totaled US$326 \n     billion. In 1980 export businesses only accounted for 10 \n     percent of the GDP, says Gonzalez. At the same time, the \n     domestic demand per capita has actually shrunk in the last 20 \n     years, he says. Given the population's low purchasing power, \n     production for the domestic market is minimal. Therefore, the \n     proportion of GDP represented by the export sector is \n     distorted, and is higher than in many developed countries, \n     says ING Barings economist Sergio Martin.\n       The average salary in Mexico is only US$3,720 a year.\n       It now takes a worker 23 hours to earn enough to purchase \n     the goods included in the ``basic basket,'' the price of \n     which has shot up 913 percent since 1987, compared to 8.3 \n     hours 10 years ago, according to a report from the National \n     Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional \n     Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM).\n\n\n                               select few\n\n       Another distortion in Mexico's market is the eye-opening \n     difference between the rich and poor. Writer Carlos Fuentes \n     describes Mexico as a country where 25 Mexicans earn the same \n     as 25 million Mexicans. In the last two years, the 15 \n     wealthiest families' fortunes leapt from the US$16.4 billion \n     to US$25.6 billion, which is equivalent to 9 percent of the \n     GDP or 23.9 million annual minimum wages.\n       The result in economic terms is that ``there is a market \n     for luxury Mercedes cars, yet little demand for reasonably \n     priced shoes (relative to a country with Mexico's \n     population),'' says Gonzalez. There are nearly 100 million \n     Mexicans yet there are only 2 million credit cards, adds \n     Martin. ``As some people have more than one it means that \n     less than 2 percent of Mexicans have credit cards and some of \n     them have limits of 1,000 or 2,000 pesos (US$125 or 250).''\n       Education, or the lack of it, has also played a role in the \n     steady widening of the gap between rich and poor since Carlos \n     Salinas took office in 1988. Between 1987 and 1993, urban \n     workers with higher education saw their wages jump 100 \n     percent, whereas poorly educated workers (50 percent of \n     workers have only a primary school education) saw their wages \n     climb only 10 percent.\n       The rising poverty is a continual thorn in the government's \n     side. While its tough macroeconomic policies have drawn \n     praises from the international financial community, the \n     benefits have not trickled down to the poor. ``I don't see \n     the government doing anything to address the wealth \n     imbalance,'' Gonzalez says. Many think the government had \n     better get started, however, if it wants to make its newly \n     opened markets attractive to foreign investors. Moreover, \n     there may be social and political consequences if only a \n     handful of Mexicans continue to enjoy the fruit of the \n     economic reforms. ``I think we're living on borrowed time,'' \n     said U.S. Ambassador to Mexico James Jones at the end of last \n     year. ``This generation of adults will probably survive on \n     hope but I think over the next five to ten years if that \n     isn't translated into benefits and real opportunities, you're \n     going to have demagogues rise up who want to turn the clock \n     back.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the reason I included these articles is \nbecause my distinguished mentor, the senior Senator from New York, \nvoted with me on NAFTA and that is against NAFTA. We had misgivings. Of \ncourse, the proof is in the Wall Street Journal and the American \nChamber of Commerce articles about how they are making less down there \n4 to 5 years since the enactment of NAFTA. We were told it was going to \ncreate a positive balance of trade. We had a $5 billion-plus balance of \ntrade at the time of enactment. Now we have a $17 billion deficit in \nthe balance of trade with Mexico since NAFTA.\n  We were told it was going to solve the immigration problem. It has \nworsened. We were told it was going to solve the drug problem. It has \nworsened. As I said before, there is no education in the second kick of \na mule. We have been through this exercise about how we are all going \nto put our arms together and hug and love and help our neighbors. Fine \nwith me if it really would work that way. It has not worked that way \nand is not about to work that way in sub-Sahara and the Caribbean. I \nwill get into those items in just a few minutes.\n  With respect to the morning article--I try to get into the Wall \nStreet Journal because a lot of my crowd in South Carolina reads it. \nThey have me as the old isolationist: Hollings: ``Info revolution \nescapes him.''\n  Really? I know a good bit more about the information revolution than \nthe Wall Street Journal does. I helped bring a good bit of it to South \nCarolina, in fact, with my technical training for skills. I was in \nDublin, Ireland, and walked into the most modern microprocessing plants \nof Intel outside of Dublin. My friend, Frank McKay, was there. He said: \nGovernor, I want to show you your technical training program. We sent \ntwo teams to Midlands Tech in Columbia, SC, and we reproduced what was \nthere, and that is how I got it up and going and operating and in the \nblack.\n  I told this to Andy Grove when he came by, and he thanked me again. I \nknow a little bit about the information revolution. I am all for it. My \nproblem is, on the one hand, it does not create the jobs they all \nadvertise.\n  The Wall Street Journal ran an article about Wal-Mart and General \nMotors. Wal-Mart exceeded the number of employees of General Motors for \nthe first time.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 28, 1997]\n\n              Labor: The Changing Lot of the Hourly Worker\n\n       For decades, the U.S. has been evolving from a \n     manufacturing economy to a service economy.

The Wal-Mart workday is less physically \n     taxing than GM's, but the hours are longer and the pay barely \n     supports even a thrifty family. Still, Wal-Mart offers a \n     measure of responsibility and path of advancement to hourly \n     workers, thousands of whom are promoted to management each \n     year.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want the Wall Street Journal to read \nits own articles.\n  The leading line:\n\n       For decades, the U.S. has been evolving from a \n     manufacturing economy to a service economy. But Labor Day \n     1997 marks a milestone: Earlier this year, Wal-Mart Stores, \n     Inc., the discount retailer, passed General Motors \n     Corporation as the nation's largest private employer.\n\n  General Motors' average hourly wage is about $19 an hour; including \nbenefits, it is $44 an hour. Whereas at Wal-Mart stores, the average \nhourly wage is $7.50; including benefits, $10. In manufacturing, the \nsalary is four times that in the service economy. That is why they are \nall talking about this wonderful economic boom that has to do with the \nservice economy, so much so that the labor unions I see have buddied up \nwith the American Chamber of Commerce. The American Chamber of Commerce \nhas gone international. They are not representing Main Street America.\n  On yesterday, Monday, November 1, ``Corporate, Labor Leaders Both \nTrumpet Backing for Clinton's Trade-Talk Plan.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 1, 1999]\n\nCorporate, Labor Leaders Both Trumpet Backing for Clinton's Trade-Talk \n                                  Plan\n\n                           (By Helene Cooper)\n\n       Washington.--Depending on how you look at it, the joint \n     letter from corporate and union leaders supporting the \n     Clinton administration's agenda for global trade talks, was \n     either a huge win for big business or for labor unions.\n       The way corporate America tells it, the letter was a \n     victory for pro-trade American companies because John \n     Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, signed it. ``How are the labor \n     unions going to protest in Seattle [at the upcoming World \n     Trade Organization's big powwow] if Mr. Sweeney is saying \n     labor supports the trade agenda?'' asked Frank Coleman, \n     spokesman for the U.S. Chambers of Commerce.\n       Indeed, Mr. Sweeney's decision to back the Clinton trade \n     agenda rankled the more militant unions, such as the \n     Teamsters and the United Steelworkers of America.\n       But AFL-CIO leaders said the letter shows Mr. Sweeney at \n     his savviest. For one thing, the AFL-CIO is backing Vice-\n     President Al Gore's presidential campaign and wants to \n     minimize political damage to his election chances by \n     hammering him on trade.\n       More significantly, several big company chieftains, \n     including John E. Pepper, chairman of Procter & Gamble Co., \n     Maurice ``Hank'' Greenberg, head of American International \n     Group Inc., and Robert Shapiro, head of Monsanto Co., also \n     signed the letter.\n       The letter calls for a working group to be established \n     within the WTO to study core labor standards and trade, and \n     marks the first time many of America's biggest companies have \n     agreed to support U.S. moves linking trade liberalization \n     with labor standards.\n       ``The U.S. government must further ensure that any \n     agreements enable the United States to maintain its own high \n     standards for the environment, labor, health and safety,'' \n     the Oct. 25 letter said.\n       For years, Republican lawmakers, backed by big business, \n     have resisted linking trade expansion with labor and \n     environmental issues. While last week's letter makes no \n     mention of using trade sanctions against countries with poor \n     labor standards, Thea Lee, the AFL-CIO's trade policy \n     director, said that is labor's ultimate goal. ``What we want \n     is the ability to use trade rules to protect worker rights,'' \n     Ms. Lee said.\n       While AFL-CIO leaders still plan to show up in force in \n     Seattle this month to protest WTO policies they see as \n     antilabor, they also said it's important to get a seat at the \n     table so that union views can be represented.\n       Whether the Clinton administration will get the rest of the \n     WTO to sign on to its labor agenda for the Seattle meeting \n     remains to be seen. Developing countries, in particular, have \n     fought linking trade and labor, and many of these countries \n     see the establishment of a working group as the beginning of \n     a move to do just that. These countries are bound to fight \n     the issue in Seattle.\n       America's labor unions are hardly united on the matter. \n     Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell said he was ``shocked'' and \n     ``disappointed'' in Mr. Sweeney. ``We in no way agree that \n     the administration's trade policies are good for working men \n     and women,'' he said. ``The Teamsters will play a very active \n     role in demonstrations in Seattle.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, ``Mr. Sweeney's decision to back the \nClinton trade agenda rankled the more militant unions, such as the \nTeamsters, and the United Steelworkers of America.'' Those are the \nmanufacturing jobs. Just as the fabric boys divorced themselves from \napparel and now can toot for this kind of legislation, the head of the \nservice economy, John Sweeney, has forgotten about manufacturing jobs, \nand he is going along. That is why we got this overwhelmingly \nbipartisan majority.\n  But back to the point, this is what disturbs this particular Senator, \nthat we are hollowing out the manufacturing strength, the industrial \nbackbone of the United States of America.\n  The so-called service economy or information technology, or \ninformation society, strikingly--why don't they read the November 5, \n1999, edition of the London Economist that has just come out? On page \n87, there is an article entitled ``The New Economy, E-Exaggeration: The \nDigital Economy is Much Smaller Than You Think.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the London Economist, Nov. 5, 1999]\n\nThe New Economy E-xaggeration: The Digital Economy is Much Smaller Than \n                               You Think\n\n       Newspapers and magazines are packed with stories about the \n     digital economy, the information-technology (IT) revolution \n     and the Internet age. That their pages are filled with \n     advertising from IT firms presumably has nothing to do with \n     it. Such firms account for a quarter of the total value of \n     the S 500, and this week Dow Jones announced that \n     Microsoft, Intel and SBC Communications will be included in \n     its industrial average from November 1st. Not before time, \n     many say, for high-technology businesses now account for a \n     huge chunk of the economy. Actually, they don't.\n       New figures published on October 28th by America's \n     Department of Commerce appear to support the view that IT is \n     very important to the American economy. The department now \n     counts all business spending on software as investment \n     (previously, it was a cost). This has both increased the \n     apparent size of IT investment and boosted America's rate of \n     growth in recent years.\n       But measuring the size of the ``new'' economy is a \n     statistical minefield. The most generous estimate comes from \n     the OECD, which tracks the ``knowledge-based economy''. It \n     estimates that this accounts for 51% of total business output \n     in the developed economies--up from 45% in 1985. But this \n     definition, which tries to capture all industries that are \n     relatively intensive in their inputs of technology and human \n     capital, is implausibly wide. As well as computers and \n     telecoms, it also includes cars, chemicals, health, \n     education, and so forth. It would be a stretch to call many \n     of these businesses ``new''.\n       A study published in June by the Department of Commerce \n     estimates that the digital economy--the hardware and software \n     of the computer and telecoms industries--amounts to 8% of \n     America's GDP this year. If that sounds rather disappointing, \n     then a second finding--that IT has accounted for 35% of total \n     real GDP growth since 1994--should keep e-fanatics happy.\n       Perhaps unwisely. A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed \n     McKelvey of Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of \n     ``technology'' is too wide. They argue that since such things \n     as basic telecoms services, television, radio and consumer \n     electronics have been around for ages, they should be \n     excluded. As a result, they estimate the computing and \n     communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of GDP--\n     up from 2.8% in 1990. This would make it bigger than the car \n     industry, but smaller than health care or finance. In most \n     other economies, the share is lower; for the world as a \n     whole, therefore, the technology sector might be only 3-4% of \n     GDP.\n       But what, you might ask, about the Internet? Goldman \n     Sachs's estimate includes Internet service providers, such as \n     America Online, and the technology and software used by \n     online retailers, such as Amazon.com. It does not, however, \n     include transactions over the Internet. Should it? E-business \n     is tiny at present, but Forrester Research, an Internet \n     consultancy estimates that this will increase to more than \n     $1.5 trillion in America by 2003. Internet bulls calculate \n     that this would be equivalent to about 13% of GDP. Yet it is \n     misleading to take the total value of such goods and \n     services, whose production owes nothing to the Internet. The \n     value added of Internet sales--i.e., its contribution to \n     GDP--would be much less, probably little more than 1% of GDP.\n       This is not to deny that the Internet is changing the way \n     that many firms do business--by, for example, enabling them \n     to slim inventories--but, in the near future, as a proportion \n     of GDP, it is likely to remain small.\n\n\n                           a luddite's lament\n\n       If measuring the size of the technology sector is hard, \n     calculating its contribution to\n\n[[Page S13637]]\n\n     real economic growth is trickier still, because the prices of \n     IT goods and services (adjusted for quality) have fallen \n     sharply relative to the prices of other goods and services. \n     For example, official figures show that America's spending on \n     IT has risen by 14% a year in nominal terms since 1992, but \n     by more than 40% a year in real terms. This figure is so high \n     partly because it is extremely sensitive to assumptions about \n     the rate at which the price and quality of IT is changing.\n       The Commerce Department calculates that the technology \n     sector has contributed 35% to overall economic growth over \n     the past four years. But because such figures are based on \n     spending in real terms, the Goldman Sachs study reckons they \n     are misleading. In nominal terms, IT has accounted for a more \n     modest 10% of GDP growth in the past four years.\n       Another popularly quoted figure is that business spending \n     on IT has risen from 10% of firms' total capital-equipment \n     investment in 1980 to 60% today. But again, this is based on \n     constant-dollar figures, and so it hugely exaggerates the \n     true increase. In terms of current dollars (and before the \n     latest revisions), Goldman Sachs calcuate that business \n     investment in computers accounts for 35% of total capital \n     spending, not 60%. And even this exaggerates the importance \n     of IT, because much of the money goes to replace equipment \n     which becomes obsolete ever more quickly. The share of IT in \n     additional ``net'' investment is much smaller. Computers \n     still account for only 2% of America's total net capital \n     stock.\n       For years economists have been seeking in vain for evidence \n     that computers have dramatically raised productivity. One \n     explanation for the failure of productivity to surge may be \n     that official statistics are understating its growth. Another \n     is that much investment in IT has been wasted: hours spent \n     checking e-mail, surfing the Net or playing games reduce, not \n     increase, productivity. A third may simply be that IT is \n     still too small to make a difference: for the moment, \n     appropriately enough, you can count the digital economy on \n     the fingers of one hand.\n       That is changing, and firms are learning. And note this: if \n     you add in all computer software and telecoms (on the widest \n     definition), the share of IT in the capital stock rises to \n     10-12%. As it happens, this is almost the same as railways at \n     the peak of America's railway age in the late 19th century. \n     Railways boosted productivity and changed the face of \n     Victorian commerce. Hype is hype--but the new economy may yet \n     happen anyway.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote from the article:\n\n       . . . they estimate the computing and communications-\n     technology sector at a more modest 5% of the GDP --up from \n     2.8% in 1990. . . .\n       The value added of Internet sales--i.e., its contribution \n     to the gross domestic product--would be much less, probably \n     little more than 1% of the gross domestic product.\n\n  Mr. President, another popularly quoted figure is that business \nspending on information technology has risen from 10 percent of a \nfirm's total capital, equipment and investment in 1980 to 60 percent \ntoday. Again, this is based on constant dollar figures. And it hugely \nexaggerates the true increase.\n\n       In terms of current dollars . . . Goldman Sachs calculate \n     that business investments in computers accounts for 35% of \n     total capital spending, not 60%. And even this exaggerates \n     the importance of [information technology] because much of \n     the money goes to replace equipment which becomes obsolete \n     ever more quickly. The share of [information technology] in \n     additional ``net'' investment is much smaller. Computers \n     still account for only 2% of America's total net capital \n     stock.\n\n  I want to dwell on this for a moment, for the main and simple reason \nthat this really is what is at issue and why the Senator from South \nCarolina takes the floor. It is just not textiles. Textiles is on its \nway out.\n  And by another headline I saw in the New York Times, on the right-\nhand upper column of the front page this morning, President Clinton is \ngetting together with the People's Republic of China to admit them to \nthe World Trade Organization. You can pass the CBI, the sub-Sahara, the \nNAFTA there, there, and there yonder, and pull it all around, but once \nthat is done, once China gets into the World Trade Organization and \nstarts with its transshipments and its appeals, it controls the general \nassembly.\n  We had a resolution about 4 years ago to have hearings on human \nrights within the People's Republic of China. That crowd went back down \ninto Africa and Australia and around and changed the vote, and they \nnever had the hearing.\n  So I am telling you, we really are going to be a minority in the \nWorld Trade Organization. They can change around your environmental \nprotections, your labor protections, your high standard of living, and \neverything else. And the CBI and sub-Sahara, and everything else that \nwe think we are doing something to help, we are going to China, I can \ntell you that right now with the front page article about President \nClinton. So we know where we are headed with respect to that.\n  But my friend, Eamonn Fingleton, has written a book, ``In Praise of \nHard Industries.'' Obviously, I can't include the book in the Record at \nthis particular time. But I refer to its comparisons where the Wall \nStreet Journal time and time again has come out again and again with \ncertain misstatements.\n\n       In 1996, when everyone from the Wall Street Journal to the \n     Christian Science Monitor was dismissing the Japanese economy \n     as sluggish or stagnant or even mired in a deep slump, in \n     fact Japan's growth rate that year of 3.9 percent was the \n     best of any major economy and was significantly superior to \n     the rate of 2.8 percent recorded in the booming United \n     States. . . .\n       Although experts like the Economist's editor in chief . . . \n     predicted a decade ago that Japan's savings rate would plunge \n     in the 1990s, the truth is that at last count Japan was \n     producing $708 billion of new savings a year--or nearly 60 \n     percent more than America's total of $443 billion . . . Japan \n     has now decisively surpassed the United States as the world's \n     main source of capital . . . Japan's net external assets \n     jumped from $294 billion to $891 billion in the first seven \n     years of the 1990s. By contrast, America's net external \n     liabilities ballooned from $71 billion to $831 billion.\n\n  With these things going on, you begin to worry where you are headed \nwith the particular trade bill.\n\n  Again, instead of doubling the volume of steel imports since 1983, \nthe United States remains by far the largest importer.\n  So we are importing the steel. We are not having a savings rate. \nAccording to the Financial Times article that was printed in the Record \nthe other day:\n\n       Fears of a slide in the U.S. dollar has haunted global \n     currency markets for several months now. The dollar was \n     granted a reprieve last week following better than expected \n     August trade figures. But many observers believe it is only a \n     matter of time before the dollar succumbs to mounting trade \n     imbalances.\n\n  Quoting from the book I previously mentioned:\n\n       In the 1960s----\n\n  Since the distinguished Senator from New York went back 65 years--\n\n       In the 1960s President John F. Kennedy felt so strongly \n     about this that he ranked dollar devaluation alongside a \n     nuclear war as the two things he feared most.\n\n  There you go. Here we have it. We have a whole book written on it. \nWhy, yes, it provides jobs. The information technology society or \nglobalization, as they want to call it, the engine of our great \neconomic recovery in the United States, our wonderful world leadership, \nit provides jobs for the best, the top 5 percent of the population. You \nhave to be highly intelligent and everything else; like I have \nmentioned the 22,000 employees at Microsoft. All 22,000 are \nmillionaires. More power to them. But that does not give you any \nexports, that does not give you any growth. That does not give you any \nstrength of manufacturing in the industrial economy.\n  That is where we are hollowing it out. That is why we cannot afford \nit. I would love to help the Caribbean Basin. I would love to help the \nsub-Sahara. But time and again, we have given over and over and over \nagain with respect to--I remember back in the Philippines we had given \nthere. We had other particular initiatives whereby we always sacrificed \nat the textile desk.\n  I do not have it with me right now, but I have it down where we have \ngiven to Turkey. We gave to Egypt in Desert Storm. We have just \neliminated, in the Multifiber Arrangement, over a 10-year period--now \nwe are in the 5th year--all textile tariffs and everything else of that \nkind. So we do not have any protectionism about which to really talk.\n  We have important jobs. The textile jobs, compared to those retail \njobs--the average textile wage is $11 an hour. With benefits, it \nincreases that. Those are good jobs that we are trying to hold onto--\nthe jobs of middle America, which is the strength of the democratic \nsociety.\n  Let me go right back to the particular editorial. This is how silly \nthey can get. I will quote from the editorial. This editorial is from \nthe Wall Street Journal. So I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the editorial of this morning from the Wall Street Journal. \nThe title of the editorial is ``The Old Isolationists.''\n\n[[Page S13638]]\n\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         The Old Isolationists\n\n       We've got the ideal subject for President Clinton's next \n     speech on the ``new isolationism'' in Congress: Senate \n     Democrats. They've been abetting a filibuster that may kill \n     the Africa and Caribbean free-trade bill that Mr. Clinton at \n     least claims he still wants.\n       No doubt they think they can get away with this because the \n     media have barely noticed. Jesse Helms gives affluent, \n     powerful Carol Moseley-Braun a hard time for an \n     ambassadorship, and it becomes page one race-baiting mews. \n     But the President's own party stonewalls a trade bill that \n     would help millions of Africans escape their desperate \n     poverty, and the story lands back among the real estate ads.\n       The bill has everything Dan Rather and other good media \n     liberals claim to love. It's bipartisan, with support ranging \n     from New York liberal Charlie Rangel to Texas conservative \n     Phil Gramm. It'd help Africa not with handouts, but by \n     reducing U.S. tariffs and quotas so these countries can share \n     in the wealth of the global economy. And it repudiates Pat \n     Buchanan-style trade protectionism.\n       It's also a helluva good political story. Fronting for the \n     textile lobby, Ol' Fritz Hollings of South Carolina has been \n     leading a filibuster like he just walked out of the 19th \n     century. His hilarious rants cite as protectionist \n     authorities both Pat Buchanan and left-wing economist Paul \n     Krugman.\n       ``And so Buchanan comes out, and was the best voice we had \n     in a national sense. I have been talking trade while that boy \n     was in GoZANga. Is that the name of tat high school around \n     her, GoZANga?'' Ol' Fritz was yelling on the Senate floor \n     last week, referring to Gonzaga High School.\n       ``We are in trouble,'' the Senator from Milliken & Co. said \n     later. ``This boom they are talking about in the stock market \n     is the information society; it doesn't create the jobs.''\n       Self-parody aside, his strategy is obvious: run out the \n     Senate clock. That's why, after more than a week of debate, \n     GOP leader Trent Lott wants to get on with the vote and other \n     Senate business. Enter Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, \n     who says he's for the bill, but spent last week aiding Mr. \n     Hollings by rallying fellow Democrats to support Fritz's \n     filibuster.\n       Mr. Daschle's gripe was that Mr. Lott hadn't allowed a \n     wish-list of protectionist amendments: Pennsylvania's steel \n     front-man Rick Santorum on ``anti-dumping negotiations,'' \n     Iowa protectionist Tom Harkin on child labor, Michigan's Carl \n     Levin (a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Auto Workers) \n     on ``worker rights,'' among others. None of this has anything \n     to do with Africa trade.\n       The Senate is supposed to be full of statesmen. But on this \n     subject the House has been more worldly. When protectionists \n     tried a procedural ruse to kill Africa trade in the House, \n     Mr. Rangel gathered the names of 79 Democrats who would vote \n     for a GOP rule to limit debate. Mr. Lott has 48 or so \n     Republicans in favor of the bill in the Senate, but the White \n     House hasn't yet been able to get even a dozen Democrats for \n     the 60 votes necessary to shut off debate. Democratic Party \n     to Africa: Get lost.\n       These columns have often saluted Mr. Clinton's achievements \n     on trade policy, notably Nafta and Gatt. But it's been \n     downhill since then. The President hasn't pushed a trade bill \n     through Congress in five years, mainly because of Democratic \n     opposition. He's also taken to soft-selling fast-track \n     negotiating power lest it hurt Vice President Gore with Big \n     Labor. Rest assured this flagging enthusiasm for free trade \n     has been noted in Democratic circles.\n       Later this month Mr. Clinton traveles to an international \n     trade meeting in Seattle, supposedly to rally the world back \n     to the free-trade flag. But if he can't deliver through \n     Congress something as small as lower tariffs for Africa, Mr. \n     Clinton might as well stay home.\n       New York Democrat Pat Moynihan made the point with his \n     usual delicate bluntless on the Senate floor last week. ``The \n     chairman (Republican Bill Roth) and I were planning to spend \n     a few days in Seattle just meeting with people. We were not \n     going to speak. Dare we go? I suppose Ambassador Barshefsky, \n     is required to go,'' he said of the predicament the U.S. \n     trade rep would be in if the Africa bill failed. ``I don't \n     want to show my face.''\n       Late yesterday Mr. Daschle finally agreed to oppose Mr. \n     Hollings, but only after he got Mr. Lott to guarantee him \n     votes later on such domestic political and non-trade matters \n     as the minimum wage. This shows where his priorities lie. \n     When the final Africa trade bill votes are toted up, we'll \n     also see who the real isolationists are.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Daschle is right. Mr. Lott had not allowed a wish \nlist of protectionist amendments. You see, Mr. Lott had given fast \ntrack to this particular bill, until this morning, he said yesterday \nafternoon, but that was without notice. I went back to get some \namendments. When I was getting those amendments at 5:30, they closed \nthis Senate Chamber down. They didn't want amendments. Now he says you \ncan get amendments. Here is what the Wall Street Journal thinks:\n\n       Pennsylvania's steel front-man Rick Santorum on \n     ``antidumping negotiations,'' Iowa protectionist Tom Harkin \n     on child labor, Michigan's Carl Levin (a wholly owned \n     subsidiary of the United Auto Workers) on ``worker rights,'' \n     among others. None of this has anything to do with Africa \n     trade.\n\n  It doesn't? Child labor doesn't have anything to do with Africa \ntrade, with Caribbean Basin Initiative trade? It doesn't? Wait until \nthe Senator from Iowa comes out here and presents his amendment. That \nis how arrogant they have gotten. They splash a bunch of things people \nwould not understand. It has everything to do with it. In fact, those \nare the principal amendments the Senator from South Carolina has. If \nthe Senator from Delaware would agree to them, we could move on with \nthis bill.\n  Specifically, in NAFTA we had the labor side agreements. They are not \nincluded in the CBI/sub-Sahara. In NAFTA, we had the environmental side \nagreements. Not in CBI/sub-Sahara. In the Mexican NAFTA, we had \nreciprocity. Not in CBI, not in sub-Sahara. In fact, when the Senator \nfrom New York jumped back 65 years, to 1934, I didn't hear him \nenunciate clearly reciprocal trade agreements of Cordell Hull, \nreciprocity. They had hard, good businessmen. Trade was trade, not a \nmoral thing of foreign aid. That is our problem today. Too many in the \npolitical world think about trade as aid, another Marshall Plan. And \nthe Marshall Plan has worked. But there is a limit to what you can give \naway.\n  I have time and again said that two-thirds of the clothing I am \nlooking at is imported. One-third of all consumption in the United \nStates is imported right now. If this train continues, it will be over \nhalf within the next 5 years. That is the hollowing out. If we are \ngoing to follow the London economists and the Brits who went from the \nproduction of goods to the providing of services--a service economy--we \nare going to have minimal growth. They got a British Army, but it is \nnot as big as our Marine Corps. But we are going to lose influence in \nthe World Trade Organization, in GATT, treaties in the Mideast and \neverywhere else, because money talks. We don't have those things going.\n  Now, Mr. President, reciprocal trade. I have an amendment on \nreciprocity, one on labor rights, and I have one with respect to the \nmatter of the environment. It was all included. Let me just note, this \nis with tremendous interest to this particular Senator because I have \njust picked up this week's Time magazine. What we really have, in \nessence, is the campaign finance bill of 1999. They say they are not \ngoing to pass it, but this is the campaign finance bill of 1999.\n  In the middle, on pages 38 and 39, is an open-page Buyers Guide To \nCongress. Down here listed is the Caribbean tariff relief, a bill to \nlet the Caribbean and Central American countries export apparel to the \nUnited States duty and quota free. Then you can go down to the \ncontributions. The clothing firms want access to cheap-tax-advantage \noffshore production both Clinton and Republicans favor as a free trade \nmeasure.\n  They have in here--yes, the manufacturing and retail side is Sara Lee \nCorporation, Gap, the ATMI, and everything on the one side, and the \nAFL-CIO anti-sweat-shop groups. We have seen where that sort of split \nis. They are going along now with service labor leader John Sweeney and \nnot with the manufacturing jobs in America.\n  Then we go to last week's edition, and we have the fruit of its \nlabor. We see that, in addition to Sara Lee, we have Bill Farley and \nthe Fruit of the Loom group. It is just embarrassing to me when you \ntake Farley, who already moves 17,000 jobs out of Kentucky and some \n7,000 from Louisiana, and then he gets a $50 million bonus when this \nbill passes. They are talking about how we are going to help working \nAmericans. Then, all we have to do is go back to this week's London \nEconomist again, in the very first part of the magazine section. We can \nput that in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled ``Politics and \nSilicon Valley'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13639]]\n\n                  [From the Economist, Oct. 30, 1999]\n\n                      Politics and Silicon Valley\n\n     The rise of America's high-tech industry is not just a \n         windfall for presidential hopefuls. It could also be a \n         godsend for the liberal political tradition.\n       Until recently, computer geeks hardly noticed politics. \n     Washington was ``the ultimate big company''. Policy wonks and \n     political theorists--let alone the poor saps sitting in \n     Congress--``just didn't get it''. And the policy \n     establishment, doers and thinkers alike, was only too happy \n     to return the compliment. In the last presidential election \n     campaign, references to a high-tech future were vague and \n     perfunctory, and Silicon Valley or Seattle were not \n     particular ports of call. Washington, DC and the geeks \n     existed in different worlds.\n       How things have changed. According to the Centre for \n     Responsive Politics, a Washington watchdog group, by the end \n     of June this year contributions from the computer industry \n     were already three times those given to Bill Clinton and Bob \n     Dole combined during the 1996 campaign. Of the $843,000 in \n     direct industry contributions, over one-third went to George \n     W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, with the two \n     Democrats--Vice-President Al Gore and Bill Bradley--both \n     netting about half of the Texas governor's total. These \n     figures tell only part of the story, however. They do not \n     include contributions from telecommunications and biotech \n     companies, nor the millions of dollars the candidates have \n     received in fund-raisers organised by computer executives and \n     venture capitalists: entrepreneurs who helped fuel the high-\n     tech boom, and are now helping pave the way to the White \n     House.\n       Mr. Bush has courted the computer chiefs of Texas since \n     before he became governor, in 1995. Heading the committee of \n     computer luminaries advising him is Michael Dell, the \n     Godfather of Austin's high-tech revolution, who is actively \n     recruiting other computer executives into the Bush camp. \n     Among the other members of the committee are James Barksdale, \n     founder of Netscape, and John Chambers, president and CEO of \n     Cisco Systems. But if Mr. Bush has Texas sewn up, other \n     candidates have been prospecting elsewhere. In Colorado, \n     which now has the second-highest concentration of high-tech \n     jobs in the country, the state's prosperous telecom industry \n     has been donating generously to both Senator John McCain and \n     Mr. Gore. Trips to the Pacific north-west have been \n     especially lucrative for Mr. Bradley and Mr. McCain, with \n     Microsoft giving both candidates their largest computer-\n     industry donations to date. Nor are the contributions only \n     for the men at the top: the computer industry gave $8m to \n     congressional campaigns in 1998, more than twice what it gave \n     in 1994.\n       This money is all the sweeter for coming with few strings \n     attached. The computer industry has yet to develop a coherent \n     lobbying strategy, in which campaign donations are implicitly \n     exchanged for influence over the political process. This is \n     partly because the ``computer industry'' is really just a \n     collection of assorted (and often competing) interests. As \n     one industry analyst puts it, ``Just as there is no `Asia' to \n     Asians, there is no `technology community' to technology \n     companies.'' The interest of hardware companies are not \n     necessarily those of software or e-commerce companies, and \n     therefore a focused, industry-wide lobbying effort has been \n     difficult to co-ordinate.\n       Slowly, this is changing, as high-tech executives finally \n     learn the rules of political gamesmanship. Eric Benhamou, \n     boss of 3Com, dates the politicisation of Silicon Valley to \n     1996, when California's trial lawyers sponsored a ballot \n     measure that would have exposed high-tech companies to a \n     barrage of litigation. Since then the Valley has woken up to \n     the fact that it helps to have friends in Washington. The \n     government has the power to turn off one of the Valley's most \n     important resources: the supply of foreign brains. The \n     Microsoft antitrust case may even prove that it has the power \n     to restructure the entire computer industry. In short, the \n     two sides simple have to talk to each other.\n       The Technology Network (TechNet), a political action group \n     founded two years ago in Silicon Valley, has just set up a \n     second office in Austin, and plans to open more chapters in \n     the future--an attempt to influence policy at both state and \n     local level. Companies in Washington, DC--home of America \n     Online, America's biggest Internet service provider, and a \n     city where the computer industry has just taken over from \n     government as the biggest local employer--have also started \n     their own lobbying group, CapNet.\n       According to Steve Papermaster, an Austin entrepreneur who \n     heads TechNet Texas, there is a greater sense of urgency \n     within the technology industry to have more of a say in \n     politics. Like it or not, high-tech businesses have to work \n     in a world of taxes, regulation, lawsuits and legislation; \n     they need politicians just as much as politicians need them. \n     If not more: for political contributions from the high-tech \n     hives are still well below those that come in from such old-\n     fashioned sectors as banking or even agriculture. There is a \n     lot of catching-up to do.\n\n\n                       the geeks and the parties\n\n       The Republican and Democratic candidates who are now \n     trawling the high-tech industry, hands out, hope that this \n     new political awareness has a partisan tinge. Republicans \n     seem to have more grounds for optimism. After years when it \n     looked as if computers favoured big organisations over small \n     ones, and companies such as IBM appeared to be breeding \n     grounds for conformism, the high-tech industry is arguably \n     putting technology back on the side of individual liberty.\n       The average computer geek is convinced that the rise of \n     clever machines and interlinked networks is inexorably \n     shifting power from organisations to individuals, \n     decentralising authority and accelerating innovation. Not \n     only big companies and big unions, but also big government, \n     seem to be on the point of disappearing. The sort of world \n     the geeks are now conjuring up is a throwback to that of the \n     Founding Fathers, so admired by Republican revolutionaries of \n     the Gingrich mould, where (morally upright) yeomen farmers \n     pursued happiness quite undisturbed by government.\n       Yet Democrats, too, think they have natural friends in the \n     high-tech industry. There is a growing feeling in some \n     quarters that--as in the case against Microsoft--government \n     is not always a force for evil. Indeed, the public sector may \n     hold the key to solving the social problems that now plague \n     the high-tech industry: the shortage of educated labour, the \n     over-strained transport system and the rapidly growing gap \n     between rich and poor.\n       Some computer bosses are already appealing to politicians \n     to get their act together. Andy Grove, the head of Intel, has \n     told congressmen that the Internet is about to wipe out \n     entire sections of the economy--and has warned them that, \n     unless politicians start moving at ``Internet rather than \n     Washington speed'', America may see a repeat of the social \n     disaster that followed the mechanisation of agriculture. The \n     high-tech industry is beginning to realise that it is doing \n     nothing less than ``defining the economic structure of the \n     world,'' says Eric Schmidt, the boss of Novell. And with that \n     realisation comes, for some at least, a heavy sense of \n     responsibility.\n       So which party will gain from the computer industry's \n     belated entry into politics? It is hard to say. Mr. Schmidt \n     points out that most computer folk are seriously \n     disillusioned with the established parties: with the \n     Democrats because they are too soft on vested interests, with \n     the Republicans because of their ``Neanderthal'' social \n     views. They think politics is not about ideology, but about \n     fixing things, a tidy-minded approach that comes easily to \n     scientists and engineers--and which carries echoes of the \n     earlier, not-so-crazy Ross Perot.\n       It is often claimed that ``libertarian'' and \n     ``progressive'' groupings are emerging in the computer \n     industry. Yet these sound not dissimilar from the sort of \n     shifts that are occurring anyway inside the Republican and \n     Democratic Parties. Libertarians are represented by men like \n     T.J. Rodgers, the boss of Cypress Semiconductor, and Scott \n     McNealy, the head of Sun Microsystems, who argue that \n     government is being rendered largely irrelevant by the power \n     and speed of computers, and that the best way to deal with \n     problems such as the ``digital divide'' may well be to extend \n     the market, not invent new government programmes. This is \n     ``compassionate conservatism''--perhaps operating even \n     through beneficent computer companies themselves, offering \n     training and education--of the sort that George W. Bush might \n     recognize.\n       The progressives, who originally appeared under Bill \n     Packard at Hewlett-Packard in the 1990s, have now fanned out \n     to a growing number of institutions, from Joint Venture-\n     Silicon Valley, a think-tank dedicated to tackling local \n     problems, to TechNet, which now consists of no fewer than 140 \n     high-tech bosses. They argue that there is still an important \n     place for the government in a computer-driven economy--albeit \n     a much smaller and more intelligent government than the one \n     that currently resides in Washington. They love to point out \n     that government funded the research that gave birth to the \n     Internet, and one of their key complaints is that the federal \n     government's R spending over the past 30 years has declined \n     dramatically. Doesn't that sound just a bit like Al Gore?\n\n\n                           brave new politics\n\n       It is tempting to conclude that the high-tech industry, \n     flush with its new success, is claiming an impact on politics \n     that goes far beyond the facts. Yet politics is a theoretical \n     discipline, as well as a practical one; and here the \n     collusion with high-tech is leading in fascinating \n     directions. Computer-folk are beginning to look outside \n     cyber-land for the answers to their questions about the \n     future of society and government. At the same time, the \n     intellectual and policy establishments are increasingly \n     looking to the Valley, and other high-tech corners, for clues \n     as to the shape of things to come.\n       The latest think-tank in Washington, DC, the New America \n     Foundation, is largely funded by Silicon Valley money and is \n     devoted to exploring the sort of political topics that will \n     be at the heart of the digital age: digital democracy, the \n     future of privacy and the digital divide. New America is in \n     one of the few funky bits of Washington, Dupont Circle. It \n     has scooped up a good proportion of the brightest American \n     thinkers under 40 in its fellowship programme, including \n     Michael Lind, Jonathan Chait and Gregory Rodriguez, and it is \n     making sure that these bright young things interact with the \n     cyber-elite at regular retreats and discussions.\n       So far, the person who has straddled the worlds of social \n     theory and Silicon Valley most successfully is Manual \n     Castells, a sociologist at the University of California. Mr. \n     Castells enjoys a growing reputation as the\n\n[[Page S13640]]\n\n     first significant philosopher of cyber-space--a big thinker \n     in the European tradition who nevertheless knows the \n     difference between a gigabit and a gigabyte. His immense \n     three-volume study, ``The Information Age'' (Blackwell), \n     echoes Max Weber in its ambition and less happily in its \n     style (the ``spirit of informationalism'', for example). He \n     writes about the way in which global networks of computers \n     and people are reducing the power of nation states, \n     destabilizing elites, transforming work and leisure and \n     changing how people identify themselves.\n       Mr. Castells ruminates obscurely about ``the culture of \n     real virtuality'', ``the space of flows'' and ``timeless \n     time''. He also castigates the cyber-elite for sealing \n     themselves off in information cocoons and leaving the poor \n     behind. But this former Marxist and student activist cannot \n     restrain his enthusiasm for the way that it is diffusing \n     1960s libertarianism ``through the material culture of our \n     societies''. The result is that his sprawling boo, is now an \n     important fashion accessory in Palo Alto cafes.\n       Will the views it enshrines be more than a passing trend? \n     Very probably. The last time America underwent a fundamental \n     economic change, a fundamental political realignment rapidly \n     followed: the transition from an agrarian to an industrial \n     society in the mid-19th century soon gave rise to mass \n     political parties with their city bosses and umbilical ties \n     to labour and capital. The cyber-elite not only suspects that \n     changes of a similar magnitude are inevitable. It hopes to be \n     able to help shape the new politics.\n       Today's sharpest intellectuals are fascinated by Silicon \n     Valley for the same reason that thinkers early in this \n     century were intrigued by Henry Ford: the smell of huge \n     amounts of money made in new ways. But the Valley has more \n     interest for them than Motown ever had, because it deals in \n     the very stuff of intellectual life, information: and because \n     this, more than any other place, is a laboratory of the \n     future.\n       Individualism has been losing out as a practical doctrine \n     for the past century because the invention of mass production \n     encouraged the creation of big business, big labor and, \n     triangulated between the two, big government. this has been \n     the age not of Jefferson's yeoman farmer, but of William \n     Whyte's Organisation Man. Now, however, computers are \n     shifting the balance of power from collective entities such \n     as ``society'' or ``the general good'' and handing it back to \n     those whom governments once condescendingly referred to as \n     their ``subjects''.\n       This cult of individual effort, completely detached from \n     the old hierarchical or social structures, can be found \n     everywhere in Silicon Valley. The place is full of bright \n     immigrants willing to sacrifice their ancestral ties for a \n     seat at the table; almost 30% of the 4,000 companies started \n     between 1900-96, for example, were founded by Chinese or \n     Indians. The Valley takes the idea of individual merit \n     extremely seriously. People are judged on their brainpower, \n     rather than their sex or seniority; many of the new internet \n     firms are headed by people in their mid-20s.\n       The Valley's 6,000 firms exist in a ruthlessly \n     entrepreneurial environment. It is the world's best example \n     of what Joseph Schumpeter called ``creative destruction'': \n     old companies die and new ones emerge, allowing capital, \n     ideas and people to be reallocated. The companies are mostly \n     small and nimble, and the workers are as different as you can \n     get from old-fashioned company men. As the saying goes in the \n     Valley, when you want to change your job, you simply point \n     your car into a different driveway.\n\n\n                         the disappearing state\n\n       This twofold Siliconisation--the spread of both the \n     Valley's products and its way of doing business--is beginning \n     to challenge the rules of political life in several \n     fundamental ways. And it is doing so, of course, not merely \n     in America but the world over--though America is both farther \n     ahead, and represents more fertile ground.\n       First, the cyber-revolution is challenging the expansionary \n     tendencies of the state. Over the past century the state has \n     grown relentlessly, often with the enthusiastic support of \n     big business. But corporatism has no future in the new world \n     of creative destruction. (It is a safe bet that imitation \n     Silicon Valleys that have been planned by politicians are \n     going to hit the buffers.)\n       The spread of computer networks is also moving commerce \n     from the physical world to an ethereal plane that is hard for \n     the state to tax and regulate. The United States Treasury, \n     for example, is currently agonizing over the fact that e-\n     commerce doesn't seem to occur in any physical location, but \n     instead takes place in the nebulous world of ``cyber-space''. \n     The internet also makes it easier to move businesses out of \n     high-taxation zones and into low ones.\n       One of the state's main claims to power is that it ``knows \n     better what is good for people than the people know \n     themselves''. But the Siliconisation of the world has up-\n     ended this, putting both information and power into the hands \n     of individuals. Innovation is now so fast and furious that \n     big organizations increasingly look like dinosaurs, while \n     wired individuals race past them. And decision-making is \n     dispersed around global networks that fall beyond the control \n     of particular national governments.\n       The web is also challenging traditional ideas about \n     communities. Americans are accustomed to thinking that there \n     is an uncomfortable trade-off between individual freedom and \n     community ties: in the same breath that he praises America's \n     faith in individualism, Tocqueville warns that there is \n     danger each man may be `'shut up in the solitude of his own \n     heart''. Yet the Internet is arguably helping millions of \n     spontaneous communities to bloom: communities defined by \n     common interests rather than the accident of physical \n     proximity.\n       Information technology may be giving birth, too, to an \n     economy that is close to the theoretical models of capitalism \n     imagined by Adam Smith and his admirers. Those models assumed \n     that the world was made up of rational individuals who were \n     able to pursue their economic interests in the light of \n     perfect information and relatively free from government and \n     geographical obstacles. Geography is becoming less of a \n     constraint; governments are becoming less interventionist; \n     and information is more easily and rapidly available.\n       So far--Mr. Castells apart--Silicon Valley has not produced \n     a social thinker of any real stature. Technologists tend not \n     to be philosophers. But at the very least, computerization is \n     helping to push political debate in the right direction: \n     linking market freedoms with wider personal freedoms and \n     suggesting that the only way that government can continue to \n     be useful is by radically streamlining itself for a more \n     decentralized age.\n       It is a little early to expect that this sort of thinking \n     will colour next year's campaigns; the new alliances between \n     politicians and the cyber-elite have mostly sprung up for the \n     most ancient and pragmatic of reasons. But it may only be a \n     matter of time before America sees, on the back of the \n     computer age, a great new flowering of liberal politics.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It says:\n\n       How things have changed. According to the Centre for \n     Responsive Politics, a Washington watchdog group, by the end \n     of June this year, contributions from the computer industry \n     were already three times those given to Bill Clinton and Bob \n     Dole combined during the 1996 campaign. Of the $843,000 in \n     direct industry contributions, over one-third went to George \n     W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, with the two \n     Democrats--Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley--both \n     netting about half of the Texas Governor's total. These \n     figures tell only part of the story, however. They do not \n     include contributions from telecommunications and biotech \n     companies, nor the millions of dollars the candidates have \n     received in fundraisers organised by computer executives and \n     venture capitalists: entrepreneurs who helped fuel the high-\n     tech boom, and are now helping pave the way to the White \n     House.\n\n  And on and on. If they can see it in downtown London and on Main \nStreet America with the headline, ``The Buyer's Guide To Congress,'' \nand list in this particular bill the Caribbean tariff relief bill, we \nSenators don't have any pride. Is there no shame? Can't we understand \nwhat is going on and that NAFTA doesn't help the workers in South \nCarolina? We lost all the jobs. What few remain, they are saying the \nhigh-tech revolution has passed by, and it says the info revolution \nescapes them.\n  If I could get Gates to South Carolina tomorrow morning, I would \nbring him in. He is a wonderful industry and everything else. At least \ngive President Reagan credit; we subsidized the semiconductor industry \nby putting in a voluntary restraint agreement and Sematech.\n  That is why we would have Intel and otherwise gone. Yes; we have \nmoments of sobriety in this particular body. But it is election 2000. \nIt is all financing, and the buying of the Congress. They ought to be \nashamed to bring this bill.\n  But I will make the Senator from Delaware a deal. If he will accept a \nside agreement on labor similar to what we have on NAFTA, and a side \nagreement that we have on NAFTA with respect to the environment and \nreciprocity, we would not even have to. Those amendments ought to be \naccepted. They were on the NAFTA agreement. If he will accept those, I \nwill sit down, and we can go ahead and vote on this particular bill. I \nmake that proposal to the distinguished Senator from Delaware. After he \nhas had a chance to study it, I hope to hear from him because it would \nsave all of us a lot of time.\n  I have had relevant amendments, instead of the ``Hollings \nfilibuster'' all last week. The majority leader filibustered. He knew \nhow to do what he wanted to do. He filled the tree where you couldn't \nput up those amendments. You couldn't put up any kind of amendment with \nrespect to child labor. You couldn't put up in any amendments with \nrespect to trade. He filled the tree. He forced fast track. It was a \nbill with his amendments, take it or leave it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13641-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13641-S13657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13641]]\n                         DOD INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with a feeling of disappointment \nthat I come to the floor today. What's bothering me is a disturbing \nreport I am releasing today on the Office of the Inspector General, or \nIG, at the Department of Defense, DOD.\n  This is about a report prepared by the Majority Staff of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, of \nwhich I am the Chairman.\n  I have always had such great respect for the DOD IG. I have always \nthought that we could rely on that office to be fair and independent \nand thorough, and above all, honest.\n  In the past, I always felt like I could trust the DOD IG's judgment.\n  This report, Mr. President is disturbing.\n  The evidence in this report questions the credibility of the IG's \ninvestigative process. And it raises questions about the judgment of \nthe Acting IG, Mr. Donald Mancuso.\n  It is a report on the Oversight Investigation of allegations of \nmisconduct at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or DCIS. DCIS \nis the criminal investigations arm of the DOD IG.\n  The allegations examined by the Staff involve possible misconduct by \nDCIS agents between 1993 and 1996.\n  The current Acting DOD IG, Mr. Mancuso, is associated with the \nallegations. Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS from 1988 until 1997, \nwhen he became the Deputy DOD IG.\n  I also understand that Mr. Mancuso is a potential candidate for \nnomination to be the next DOD IG.\n  In June 1999, the Staff was approached by a former DCIS agent, Mr. \nWilliam G. Steakley.\n  Mr. Steakley raised numerous allegations regarding prohibited \nemployment practices at DCIS, but these were far too extensive and \ncomplex to be examined by my small Subcommittee staff.\n  However, one of Mr. Steakley's allegations caught our attention. This \nwas the allegation that DCIS officials had ``made false statements'' in \nadverse reports on his conduct.\n  Mr. Steakley alleged that an agent assigned to the DCIS internal \naffairs unit, Mr. Mathew A. Walinski, had a history of falsifying \ninvestigative reports to damage the reputations of fellow agents.\n  Mr. Steakley further alleged that senior DCIS management, including \nMr. Mancuso, was fully aware of the allegations about this agent's \nunethical practices, yet failed to take appropriate corrective action.\n  And Mr. Steakley claimed he had proof to back up the allegations.\n  The staff conducted a careful examination of these allegations and \nconcluded that some have merit.\n  To evaluate the allegations, the staff reviewed numerous documents to \ninclude the extensive files at the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, DOD \npersonnel files, and DCIS investigative reports. The staff also \nconducted a number of formal interviews.\n  A careful review of all pertinent material makes one point crystal \nclear:\n  The evidence shows that Mr. Walinski fabricated his reported \ninterview of the Air Force payroll technician, Ms. Nancy Gianino, on \nMay 21, 1993. This reported interview was conducted in connection with \nthe investigation of possible tax evasion charges against Mr. Steakley.\n  In addition, OSC files contain numerous references to a second \ninternal affairs case handled by Mr. Walinski, in which he apparently \nfabricated another report.\n  When the staff asked the DOD IG for this case file--known as the \nJohanson stolen gun case, they discovered that Mr. Walinski had \napparently fabricated the reported interview of Agent Jon Clark on \nMarch 2, 1994 and possibly others. This file contains sworn statements \nby the agents involved that Walinski's reported interview with Clark \nnever took place.\n  These two cases--when taken together--show that Mr. Walinski has a \nhistory of falsifying reports.\n  And more importantly, the record shows that rank and file complaints \nabout Mr. Walinski's unethical investigative practices went directly to \ntop DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso.\n  The record also shows DCIS management knew about the Walinski problem \nbut failed to take appropriate corrective action.\n  Yet despite rank and file complaints, Mr. Walinski's false reports \nwere used by DCIS management to discredit and punish Agents Johanson \nand Steakley.\n  In January 1999, Mr. Walinski was allowed to transfer to another \nfederal law enforcement agency--the Treasury IG--with no record of \npunishment or accountability. In his new assignment, Mr. Walinski is \nstill responsible for investigating employee misconduct.\n  In fact, the record shows that at least 3 weeks after DCIS management \nwas informed that Mr. Walinski had fabricated the Clark interview, he \nwas given a generous cash bonus award.\n  Moreover, Mr. Walinski was assigned to conduct an inspection of the \nfield office where rank and file complaints about his false reports had \noriginated.\n  While investigating Mr. Steakley's allegations, the staff discovered \nthat the DCIS internal affairs unit--to which Mr. Walinski was \nassigned--was directed by Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth.\n  Mr. Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in U.S. District Court in \nMarch 1996. He was apprehended and confessed to filing a fraudulent \npassport application after a fellow agent recognized his photo in a law \nenforcement bulletin.\n  The government authorities, who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's \ncriminal conduct, believe that he committed about 12 overt acts of \nfraud. These overt acts of fraud were committed while Mr. Hollingsworth \nwas Director of the DCIS internal affairs unit--Mr. Walinski's office.\n  Mr. President, can you imagine that? The head of the internal affairs \nunit of DOD's criminal investigative division was committing passport \nfraud. That's certainly a confidence builder in that organization, \nisn't it?\n  These authorities further believe Mr. Hollingsworth's actions were \nespecially disturbing since passport fraud is usually committed in \nfurtherance of a more serious crime, but the underlying crime was never \ndiscovered.\n  Although Mr. Mancuso and Mr. Hollingsworth were considered friends by \nassociates, Mr. Mancuso failed to recuse himself from administrative \nactions affecting Mr. Hollingsworth.\n  Mr. Mancuso even aided in Hollingsworth's defense during criminal \ntrial proceedings--even though Mr. Hollingsworth was considered \nuncooperative.\n  What's more, Mr. Mancuso endorsed an outstanding performance rating \nfor Mr. Hollingsworth three weeks after he confessed to felonious \nactivity to U.S. State Department special agents.\n  Mr. Mancuso even wrote a letter on official DOD IG stationary to the \nsentencing judge, Judge Ellis, on the convicted felon's behalf.\n  In this letter, he asked the judge to consider extenuating \ncircumstances. He told the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth had taken a \nhalf day's leave to file the fraudulent passport application. \nEvidently, Mr. Mancuso thought that taking leave to commit a crime was \nsonehow exculpatory.\n  This is what Mr. Mancuso said in his letter to Judge Ellis, and I \nquote: ``Mr. Hollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' \nbut he ``took leave to commit a felony.''\n  Mr. Mancuso concluded with this telling remark: ``To this day, there \nis no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper \nrelating to his duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and \nmanager.''\n  Coming from a law enforcement officer like Mr. Mancuso, these words \ndefy understanding. The last time I checked, part of doing your job as \na law enforcement officer is not committing crimes.\n  Mr. Hollingsworth confessed to and was convicted of felonious \nactivity while employed by DCIS as a criminal investigator.\n  As State Department agents put it, these crimes were committed in the \nfurtherance of a more serious crime that was never discovered.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Mancuso seems to have been completely blind to the \nproblem.\n  As a result of a series of decisions--personally approved by Mr. \nMancuso, Mr. Hollingsworth was allowed to remain in an employed status \nat DCIS for 6 months after his felony conviction. He was then allowed \nto retire with a full federal law enforcement annuity exactly on his \n50th birthday in September 1996.\n\n[[Page S13642]]\n\n  Had Mr. Mancuso exercised good judgement and other available legal \noptions, Mr. Hollingsworth could have been removed from DCIS \nimmediately after conviction--in March 1996. Under these circumstances, \nhe would have been forced to wait 12 years--until the year 2008--to \nbegin receiving a non-law enforcement annuity commencing at age 62. Had \nMr. Mancuso exercised this option, he would have saved the taxpayers at \nleast $750,000.00, which is the amount of money Mr. Hollingsworth will \ncollect thanks to the generous treatment he received from his friend \nand colleague, Mr. Mancuso.\n  Think of the signal this sends to rank and file law enforcement \nofficers who look to their managers for leadership and fair treatment.\n  The office of the DOD IG demands the highest standards of integrity, \njudgment, and conduct.\n  Does Mr. Mancuso meet those standards?\n  Given Mr. Mancuso's poor judgment and his irresponsible handling of \nthe three cases examined in the staff report, I believe it is \nreasonable to question:\n  (1) Whether Mr. Mancuso should now be nominated and confirmed as the \nDOD IG;\n  (2) Whether Mr. Mancuso should be allowed to remain in the post he \nnow occupies--Acting DOD IG;\n  And given the evidence that Mr. Walinski falsified several \ninvestigative reports, it is reasonable to question whether he should \nbe assigned to a position at the Treasury Department in which he is \nresponsible for conducting criminal and administrative inquiries.\n  Mr. President, today I am forwarding the Majority Staff report to the \nappropriate committees, the Secretaries of Defense and Treasury and \nother officials.\n  These officials must evaluate Mr. Mancuso's fitness to serve as the \nDOD IG as well as Mr. Walinski's continued assignment as a criminal \ninvestigator.\n  I hope they will take the time to review this report before making a \nfinal decision on these matters.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to have printed two \ndocuments in the Record: (1) A letter of comment from Mr. Mancuso; and \n(2) the Majority Staff report. I know it's a lengthy report, and the \nGPO says it will cost $2,282.00 to print. But leaving no stone unturned \nin ensuring that a person of the highest integrity occupies the key \nwatch dog post of DOD IG is well worth that cost, in my view.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Majority Staff Report to the Chairman on the Oversight Investigation--\n   The Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Department of Defense\n\n(U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n      Courts, October 1999, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Chairman)\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Majority Staff for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \n     Administrative Oversight and the Courts has conducted an \n     inquiry into the personnel practices and conduct of certain \n     agents within the Defense Criminal Investigative Service \n     (DCIS). The DCIS is an agency in the Office of the Department \n     of Defense (DOD) Inspector General (IG). The former Director \n     of DCIS--a sworn federal law enforcement officer--is now \n     Acting DOD IG, Mr. Donald Mancuso. Mr. Mancuso was Director \n     of DCIS from 1988-1997. Mr. Mancuso is currently a potential \n     candidate for nomination to be the next DOD IG.\n       This staff report contrasts DCIS personnel management \n     practices that condoned and encouraged maltreatment of rank \n     and file agents, including the use of falsified investigative \n     reports, while protecting and rewarding a fellow manager who \n     was a convicted felon. Management's favorable treatment of \n     the convicted felon, Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth, will result \n     in his receiving substantial sums of money in federal law \n     enforcement retirement annuities between 1996 and the year \n     2008. If DCIS management had exercised good judgment and \n     other more reasonable options, Mr. Hollingsworth would not \n     have been allowed to retire on his 50th birthday and receive \n     the $750,000.000 in benefits. He would have had to wait 12 \n     years to retire. In another matter, a criminal investigator, \n     who falsified reports. Mr. Mathew A. Walinski, also received \n     a cash bonus award after this misconduct was brought to the \n     attention of senior DCIS management.\n       The staff report cites three separate personnel cases \n     brought to the Subcommittee's attention involving DCIS. Each \n     of these cases involves questionable personnel practices that \n     were either condoned or ignored by DCIS management between \n     1993 and 1996.\n       The Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts \n     has primary jurisdiction and oversight authority for \n     administrative practices and procedures throughout the \n     Federal Government. As part of the process of conducting its \n     oversight responsibilities, the Subcommittee has been \n     examining administrative procedures followed by various \n     inspectors general. This report reflects the Subcommittee \n     Majority Staff's review of questionable administrative \n     decisions and misconduct within the criminal investigative \n     branch in the DOD IG's office--DCIS, while Mr. Mancuso was \n     the director of the organization.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       In June of 1999, the Subcommittee Majority Staff was \n     approached by a former agent of DCIS, Mr. Gary Steakley. Mr. \n     Steakley alleged that a DCIS internal affairs Special Agent, \n     Mr. Walinski, had a history of falsifying official reports to \n     damage the reputations of fellow agents. Mr. Steakley also \n     alleged that senior officials at DCIS were fully aware of \n     this agent's questionable practices, yet failed to take \n     appropriate corrective action.\n       It should be noted that an investigator in the Office of \n     Special Counsel (OSC), Mr. William Shea, also looked into Mr. \n     Steakley's allegations of DCIS misconduct. OSC concluded that \n     Mr. Steakley was not a victim of prohibited personnel \n     practices. While the staff examined the conduct of DCIS \n     supervisors in regard to several specific decisions, it did \n     not attempt to examine the numerous other allegations raised \n     by Mr. Steakley.\n       While investigating Mr. Steakley's allegations, the staff \n     learned that Mr. Walinski was supervised by Mr. \n     Hollingsworth--the director of internal affairs. Mr. \n     Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in April 1996. \n     Nonetheless, management allowed him to retire with full \n     federal law enforcement retirement benefits six months after \n     his felony conviction. Federal law enforcement agencies \n     commonly remove an employee on criminal misconduct alone, or \n     at a minimum, immediately after a felony conviction. Had \n     management availed itself of other appropriate legal removal \n     options, Mr. Hollingsworth would not have been allowed to \n     retire on his 50th birthday, which gave him entitlement to \n     benefits amounting to more than three quarters of a million \n     dollars.\n       The staff reviewed numerous documents to include the above-\n     referenced OCS investigation, DOD personnel files, DOD \n     investigative reports, a Subcommittee-requested review by the \n     Office of Personnel Management (OPM), State Department \n     Diplomatic Security investigative reports, and public court \n     papers registered in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Virginia. The Subcommittee Majority Staff also \n     conducted the following formal interviews:\n     Former DOD personnel:\n       Mr. Matthew Walinski, DCIS Special Agent Internal Affairs\n       Mr. Larry Hollingsworth, DCIS Director of Internal Affairs\n       Mr. William Dupree, Deputy Director of DCIS\n       Ms. Eleanor Hill, Former DOD Inspector General\n     Current DOD personnel:\n       Mr. Donald Mancuso, Former Director of DCIS and Current \n     Acting IG for DOD\n       Ms. Jane Charters, DCIS Investigative Support\n       Ms. Donna Seracino, Director of Personnel for DCIS\n       Ms. Linda Martz, Employee Relations Specialist\n       Mr. Paul Tedesco, DCIS liaison agent in Hollingsworth \n     criminal case\n       Mr. John Keenan, Current Director of DCIS, formerly Dir., \n     DCIS Operations\n       Mr. Thomas Bonner, Current Agent in Charge Dallas Office, \n     DCIS, Assist. Dir DCIS Internal Affairs\n       Ms. Nancy Gianino, Air Force Payroll Specialist\n       Lt. Col. Greg McClelland, DOD IG Administrative \n     Investigator\n     State Department Personnel:\n       Special Agent Robert Starnes and Special Agent Sean O'Brien\n     Office of Special Counsel:\n       Investigator William Shea\n       Current and former DCIS Special Agents were also \n     interviewed on a confidential basis. They requested \n     confidentiality out of fear of reprisal. This report will \n     show fears of such reprisal are plausible based on the facts \n     developed by the Subcommittee.\n\n\n                    summary of significant findings\n\n     The case of convicted felon Mr. Hollingsworth\n       Mr. Hollingsworth was the Director of internal affairs for \n     DCIS from April 1991 to September 1996. This unit routinely \n     conducted investigations regarding the integrity and \n     conductor of agents in DCIS. As stated above, in at least two \n     cases, DCIS management had knowledge of false witness \n     statements by an internal affairs agent, Mr. Walinski.\n       Former Director of DCIS, Mr. Donald Mancuso, assisted Mr. \n     Hollingsworth in remaining in an employed status--as Director \n     of internal affairs--for six months after his felony \n     conviction in U.S. District Court. Law enforcement \n     authorities, who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal \n     activities, believe that he committed at least 12 acts of \n     overt fraud while head of the DCIS internal affairs unit.\n       Mr. Mancuso, a sworn federal law enforcement officer, aided \n     in the defense of this particular subordinate at his criminal \n     trial. At no time did Mr. Mancuso offer to recuse himself \n     from administrative or personnel actions\n\n[[Page S13643]]\n\n     in regards to Mr. Hollingsworth--even though they were \n     considered ``close personal friends.''\n       Mr. Mancuso endorsed an outstanding performance evaluation \n     of Mr. Hollingsworth three weeks after he confessed to \n     felonious activity to the U.S. State Department special \n     agents.\n       Using official DOD IG stationery, with DOD IG emblem, Mr. \n     Mancuso wrote to the sentencing judge on the convicted \n     felon's behalf, even though the State Department \n     investigators opined Mr. Hollingsworth was an uncooperative \n     defendant. Mr. Mancuso signed the letter in his official \n     capacity as an Assistant Inspector General.\n       Former DOD Inspector General Eleanor Hill stated that Mr. \n     Mancuso did not advise her of pertinent facts in the case. \n     Ms. Hill had directed Mr. Mancuso to remove Mr. Hollingsworth \n     from his position ``as soon as legally possible.''\n       Mr. Mancuso directly assisted Mr. Hollingsworth in \n     obtaining over three quarters of a million dollars in full \n     federal law enforcement retirement benefits six months after \n     a felony conviction. OPM retirement experts, legal counsel at \n     DOD's Washington Headquarters Service, and Inspector General \n     regulations all state that Mr. Mancuso had options to remove \n     this employee immediately after conviction. In fact, the law, \n     DOD regulations, and an OPM opinion all suggest that Mr. \n     Hollingsworth could have been removed based on the criminal \n     conduct alone, and not on criminal court procedures.\n       The retirement benefits given to Mr. Hollingsworth were \n     extremely generous, since federal law enforcement officials \n     may retire at ago 50 instead of age 62, and computation of \n     their general schedule grade has law enforcement availability \n     pay of up to 25% added in on top of regular pay. This \n     resulted in a convicted felon being able to obtain \n     approximately $750,000.00 in additional annuity payments \n     (excluding cost-of-living allowances) as compared to what he \n     would have received had he been terminated immediately after \n     conviction and allowed only non-law enforcement civil service \n     retirement benefits commencing at age 62 in the year 2008.\n     Falsification of Witness Statements by Agent Walinski in \n         Steakley Case\n       There were numerous claims of misconduct made by Mr. \n     Steakley in regard to the conduct of the DCIS office of \n     internal affairs. Several of Mr. Steakley's allegations were \n     substantiated.\n       There is credible evidence that at least one agent assigned \n     to DCIS internal affairs, Agent Walinski, falsified a witness \n     statement in support of a tax evasion charge against Mr. \n     Steakley, and was reprimanded and reassigned for a similar \n     problem in another internal affairs case. Agent Walinski even \n     acknowledged that the tax evasion charge was ``unresolved'' \n     and that his inconclusive findings were not made apparent in \n     his report to the DCIS Administrative Review Board (ARB).\n       The false tax evasion charge in which Mr. Steakley was \n     eventually exonerated was instigated by DCIS management, to \n     include Mr. Mancuso, in an area in which DCIS had no \n     authority or jurisdiction. The States of California and \n     Virginia repeatedly informed DCIS that the agency could not \n     obtain Mr. Steakley's tax records without a court order or \n     authorization from the taxpayer involved. DCIS had neither.\n       In an interview with the Subcommittee staff, Lt. Col. Greg \n     McClelland, an independent DOD IG investigator assigned to \n     review allegations by Mr. Steakley, characterized the conduct \n     of Agent Walinski in this case as ``egregious.'' The \n     Subcommittee staff has substantiated evidence that Agent \n     Walinski made false statements to Lt. Col. McClelland in \n     sworn testimony in 1997.\n       Mr. Steakley's attorney, Mr. Luciano A. Cerasi of the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), \n     notified DCIS management that Agent Walinski's witness \n     interview of an Air Force payroll technician was falsified. \n     DCIS management ignored Mr. Cerasi's allegations despite the \n     fact that it had received another FLEOA letter alleging that \n     Agent Walinski had falsified witness statement in a separate \n     internal affairs investigation.\n     Falsification of Witness Statements by Agent Walinski in \n         Johanson Case\n       Prior to the adjudication of the Steakley case, Agent \n     Walinski had falsified witness statements against another \n     DCIS agent.\n       DCIS Agent Stephen Johanson had his undercover weapon \n     stolen from his residence near Los Angeles, California while \n     he was participating in the execution of a search warrant in \n     another California city. In the investigation that followed \n     the theft of Johanson's weapon. Agent Walinski falsified more \n     witness statements. His false reports resulted in a \n     recommendation that Agent Johanson be suspended without pay \n     for 8 calendar days for failing to secure and return an \n     issued weapon. DCIS supervisors and rank and file agents \n     protested to management at DCIS headquarters in Washington \n     that Agent Walinski's interviews were either inaccurate or \n     never took place.\n       FLEOA attorney Cerasi wrote a second letter to top DCIS \n     management supporting rank and file agents' complaints about \n     Agent Walinski's reports in the Johanson case. Mr. Cerasi \n     alleged that Agent Walinski has falsified his interview of \n     Agent Jon Clark.\n       DCIS officials claim that Agent Walinski was reprimanded \n     for ``failing to show due diligence and accuracy'' in \n     reporting witness interviews in the Johanson case. Agent \n     Walinski reported an interview of DCIS Agent Clark that never \n     took place. Despite these allegations, personnel records \n     indicate that Agent Walinski received a cash award--at least \n     18 days after rank and file agents had formally complained to \n     senior management at DCIS headquarters that Agent Walinski \n     falsified reports. The staff could find no evidence that DCIS \n     management ever attempted to determine if the allegations \n     about Mr. Walinski's reports had merit. In fact, immediately \n     following the first Johanson investigation and while the re-\n     investigation was in progress, Mr. Walinski was assigned a \n     leadership role in the inspection of the field office where \n     the complaints about his reports had originated. This could \n     be viewed as a retaliatory measure to silence the agents who \n     had ``blown the whistle'' on Agent Walinski.\n       DCIS now records all witness interviews for accuracy. Some \n     DCIS Agents refer to this new practice as ``the Walinski \n     rule.''.\n\n\n                             report format\n\n       This report has been divided into three separate DCIS \n     personnel cases as follows:\n\n           --The Case of Mr. Hollingsworth\n           --The Case of Mr. Steakley\n           --The Case of Mr. Johanson\n\n       In addition, the report includes written comments from the \n     Acting DOD IG, Mr. Mancuso, along with an extensive list of \n     the source documents used in preparing the report.\n       On September 27, 1999, Mr. Mancuso requested that he be \n     given the opportunity to review this report prior to its \n     release and to provide written comments. In response, the \n     Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, assured \n     Mr. Mancuso that his written response would be attached to \n     the staff report. Consistent with the Chairman's commitment, \n     Mr. Mancuso's written response, dated October 1, 1999, is \n     included at the end of the report.\n       The attachments listed at the end of each section of the \n     report are far too voluminous to reproduce in the printed \n     report. A complete set of the attachments will be maintained \n     in the Subcommittee files and available on Judiciary \n     Committee's web site along with other Committee documents.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       The three personnel cases, which the staff reviewed, \n     demonstrate disparate treatment given to DCIS employees by \n     senior management.\n       Mr. Hollingsworth, a high ranking DCIS official, was \n     convicted of a felony but protected by Mr. Mancuso and \n     allowed to retire 6 months later--on his 50th birthday--with \n     a full law enforcement annuity. Mr. Walinski falsified \n     reports to such a degree that several witness statements \n     appearing in his investigative reports never took place. He \n     even claimed in sworn testimony in 1997 that a DOD employee, \n     whom he had interviewed and reported absent from her office \n     due to ``extended illness,'' had ovarian cancer, despite the \n     fact there was no evidence that this person suffered from \n     such a disease. Mr. Walinski received a cash bonus award \n     weeks after allegations about his falsified reports reached \n     senior DCIS management. DCIS management never attempted to \n     determine whether those allegations had merit, and Mr. \n     Walinski was allowed to transfer to another law enforcement \n     agency--Treasury IG--with no record of accountability.\n       Two other DCIS employees were the subject of disciplinary \n     action by DCIS management for significantly less serious \n     offenses, and in one case, based on no evidence. Mr. \n     Steakley, repeatedly and unjustly accused of numerous \n     misconduct charges, is now retired with a damaged reputation \n     among the federal law enforcement community that was \n     undeserved. Similarly, Mr. Johanson was undeservedly punished \n     for having a gun stolen from his residence during a burglary. \n     This gun was issued to him by his own agency. The initial \n     punishment proposed for Mr. Johanson was based on false \n     witness interviews and a distorted interpretation of \n     disciplinary guidelines.\n       The Office of the DOD Inspector General is a position that \n     requires a very high standard of integrity, with equal \n     treatment for all departmental employees. When information is \n     developed on the criminal misconduct of a senior employee \n     such as Mr. Hollingsworth, that employee should be removed \n     ``as soon as legally possible'' to ensure that the morale of \n     all employees is maintained. When allegations are made of \n     misconduct such as against Mr. Walinski, the IG's office \n     should ensure that allegations are professionally and \n     thoroughly investigated, and all discrepancies are resolved. \n     When allegations are made against employees such as Mr. \n     Steakley and Mr. Johanson, charges should be investigated, \n     witnesses should be accurately interviewed, and bias should \n     not interfere with the integrity or facts in the \n     investigation.\n       If DCIS--under Mr. Mancuso's management--could not \n     investigate its own employees honestly and fairly, then how \n     could the much larger Office of the DOD IG--if managed by Mr. \n     Mancuso--be expected by the American people to investigate \n     honestly and fairly misconduct and fraud within the entire \n     Department of Defense?\n       Given Mr. Mancuso's poor judgment and his irresponsible \n     handling of the three cases examined in this report, it is \n     reasonable to question: 1) Whether Mr. Mancuso should now be \n     nominated and confirmed as the DOD\n\n[[Page S13644]]\n\n     IG--an office that demands the highest standards of \n     integrity, judgment, and conduct; and 2) Whether Mr. Mancuso \n     should be allowed to remain in the post of Acting DOD IG. In \n     addition, given the evidence that Mr. Walinski falsified \n     several witness interviews, it is reasonable to question \n     whether Mr. Walinski should be assigned to a position in \n     which he is responsible for conducting criminal or \n     administrative inquiries.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       1. The Majority Staff recommends that Members consider a \n     change in legislation regarding federal law enforcement \n     officers convicted of felonies. Consideration should be given \n     to whether federal law enforcement officers should be \n     immediately dismissed after their conviction of a felony.\n       Under current law, agencies have considerable discretionary \n     authority in determining how to handle such cases. In the \n     Hollingsworth case, a series of personnel actions approved by \n     DOD Acting Inspector General Mancuso raise serious questions \n     about his integrity and judgment. The proposed change in \n     legislation could eliminate any discretionary authority on \n     the part of individual law enforcement agencies in dismissing \n     employees convicted of felonies.\n       2. The Majority Staff recommends that the Chairman forward \n     this report to appropriate committees, the Secretaries of \n     Defense and the Treasury and other officials who must \n     evaluate Mr. Mancuso's fitness as a potential candidate to be \n     DOD IG, as well as Mr. Walinski's continued assignment as a \n     GS-1811 criminal investigator.\n\n\n                     THE CASE OF MR. HOLLINGSWORTH\n\n       Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth, former GS-15 Director of \n     internal affairs, DCIS, was convicted of a felony charge in \n     1996 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Virginia. Mr. Hollingsworth was never terminated by DCIS and \n     allowed to retire on his 50th birthday--six months after a \n     felony conviction. He is currently receiving full federal law \n     enforcement retirement benefits totaling approximately \n     $750,000.00 he would not otherwise have received had \n     management exercised other more reasonable options.\n     Background on felonious activity by Mr. Hollingsworth\n       According to State Department law enforcement agents, Mr. \n     Hollingsworth's criminal activity in this case commenced on \n     or about September, 1992, when he reviewed the local \n     obituaries in Florida and obtained the name of Charles W. \n     Drew, who was born in 1944 and died in 1948. Mr. \n     Hollingsworth, with a Top Secret security clearance, \n     requested from the State of Florida a copy of the death \n     certificate, representing himself as the deceased's half-\n     brother. Mr. Hollingsworth leased a mailbox in Springfield, \n     Virginia under the alias of Charles and Maureen Drew and \n     Harold Turner.\n       Mr. Hollingsworth then obtained a birth certificate for \n     Charles Drew from the State of Georgia and had it sent to the \n     mailbox in Springfield, Virginia. Mr. Hollingsworth then \n     leased another mailbox under the alias of Charles and Mary \n     Drew in Arlington, Virginia. Mr. Holingsworth submitted an \n     application and received a social security card under the \n     alias Charles Drew Jr. by posing as the applicant's father. \n     Mr. Hollingsworth, accompanied by his spouse, applied for and \n     received a Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles \n     identification card in the name of Charles Drew. Using the \n     DMV identification card in the name of Charles Drew, Mr. \n     Hollingsworth applied for a U.S. Passport. It should be noted \n     that his wife, Mrs. Jaureen Hollingsworth, a DOD IG employee \n     at the time, was never implicated or charged in this \n     felonious activity. She was not a suspect in the \n     investigation by the U.S. State Department. Mr. Hollingsworth \n     stated to State Department law enforcement agents that he \n     procured approximately eight to ten false identify documents, \n     to include an international drivers license and a priest ID, \n     by means of mail order.\n       In April of 1995, U.S. State Department law enforcement \n     officials placed a photo of Mr. Hollingsworth in law \n     enforcement bulletins as an unidentified suspect in passport \n     fraud. the local Philadelphia office of DCIS notified DCIS \n     headquarters in Washington D.C. that a photo of Mr. \n     Hollingsworth was found in a bulletin. Officials at DCIS in \n     Washington D.C. notified Mr. Mancuso who is turn immediately \n     notified Inspector General Eleanor Hill. Mr. Mancuso was then \n     ordered by DOD IG Eleanor Hill to notify the State Department \n     Office of Inspector General.\n       [See Attachment #1--Sentencing memorandum date stamped 06/\n     04/96]\n       [See Attachment #2--State Department Investigative \n     Timeline]\n     Statements made by State Department law enforcement agent\n       On July 16, 1999, the Subcommittee Majority Staff \n     interviewed Sean O'Brien, Special Agent with the State \n     Department Diplomatic Security Service. Agent O'Brien was one \n     of the agents assigned to the Hollingsworth case. Agent \n     O'Brien stated that there were at least 12 overt acts of \n     fraud perpetrated by Mr. Hollingsworth over the course of \n     several years. Agent O'Brien felt that the actions of Mr. \n     Hollingsworth were disturbing in light of the fact that \n     passport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more \n     serious crime, and a credible motive had never been \n     established.\n       Mr. O'Brien added that family members of the deceased boy, \n     Charles Drew, whose identify was used by Mr. Hollingsworth, \n     were very upset and prepared to testify at trial. Agent \n     O'Brien also opined that various motions to dismiss the case \n     were delaying tactics used by Mr. Hollingsworth until he \n     reached his 50th birthday--when he could retire with law \n     enforcement benefits.\n       The State Department Supervisor of the Hollingsworth case, \n     Special Agent Robert Starnes, stated that DCIS management \n     initially refused to let him examine the contents of Mr. \n     Hollingsworth's government computer under the pretense that \n     Mr. Hollingsworth may have had personal and/or classified \n     material on a government computer. Despite possessing a Top \n     Secret security clearance, Agent Starnes had to raise the \n     possibility of a search warrant with DCIS management before \n     they acquiesced and allowed a consent search of the computer.\n       DCIS management assigned DCIS Agent Paul Tedesco as the \n     point of contact in this case for the State Department. \n     Relevant information regarding Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal \n     conduct was provided by State Department investigators \n     directly to DCIS Agent Tedesco during all criminal \n     proceedings. Agent Tedesco also provided certified court \n     documents to then Director of Operations and current Director \n     of DCIS John Keenan. These court documents described the \n     criminal conduct of Mr. Hollingsworth. Agent Tedesco stated \n     that DCIS management was kept fully informed of the criminal \n     conduct of Mr. Hollingsworth from the time of his confession \n     through sentencing.\n       In the experienced opinion of State Department Case Agent \n     Sean O'Brien, State Department Special Agent Case Supervisor \n     Starnes and DCIS Case Liaison Agent Paul Tedesco, this \n     fraudulent activity was most probably in furtherance of \n     another crime that was never discovered or proven.\n       [See Attachment #3--Subcommittee memorandum of 07/16/99 \n     interview with agent O'Brien]\n     Chronology of judicial and personnel actions in the case of \n         Mr. Hollingsworth\n       07/28/95: Larry J.

[See Attachment #8--Letter from \n     Hollingsworth's attorney to Mr. Mancuso dated 09/20/96]\n     DOD General Counsel claims conditional plea prevented removal \n         of Mr. Hollingsworth\n       On September 14, 1999, Mr. Mancuso and the Deputy General \n     Counsel (Inspector General), Mr. Kevin Flanagan, stated to \n     the Subcommittee that the reason Mr. Hollingsworth was never \n     removed and allowed to retire, was that his guilty plea was \n     ``conditional'' and that he could withdraw his plea at any \n     time at his own initiative.\n       The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 11(A)(2) \n     states; ``with the approval of the court and the consent of \n     the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of \n     guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right, on \n     appeal from the judgment, a review of the adverse \n     determination of any specified pretrial motion. A defendant \n     who prevails on appeal shall be allowed to withdraw the \n     plea.''\n       The plea agreement in this case acknowledges a conditional \n     plea by Mr. Hollingsworth reserving ``his right to appeal the \n     Court's adverse March 8, 1996 ruling denying defendant's \n     motion to suppress his statement to State Department \n     Agents''. The plea agreement also states; ``the defendant \n     knowingly waives his right to appeal any sentence.''\n       Therefore, Mr. Hollingsworth never had unilateral authority \n     to withdraw his plea at anytime, as Mr. Mancuso and DOD \n     General Counsel argued. Their reason for not terminating Mr. \n     Hollingsworth after conviction appears to be invalid.\n       [See Attachment #20--Rules of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(1)]\n       [See Attachment #21 Plea Agreement dated 03/15/96 page 3]\n       Mr. Hollingsworth was never removed by DOD and as stated in \n     the chronology, remains a convicted felon despite the \n     numerous motions to dismiss. Federal Law, DOD IG regulations, \n     legal counsel at the DOD Washington Headquarters Services \n     (WHS) and OPM General Counsel stated that Mr. Hollingsworth \n     could have been removed based on his criminal misconduct \n     alone. The misconduct must be proved with a ``preponderance \n     of the evidence'' and not ``beyond a\n\n[[Page S13645]]\n\n     reasonable doubt.'' Preponderance of the evidence is a much \n     lower threshold than a criminal court procedure wherein \n     criminal conduct must be proved ``beyond a reasonable \n     doubt.''\n     Federal law states Mr. Hollingsworth could be dismissed \n         within 7 days\n       5 U.S.C. 7513, (b), regarding removals of federal employees \n     states:\n       1. At least 30 days advance written notice, unless there is \n     reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a \n     crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, \n     stating the specific reasons for the proposed action.\n       2. A reasonable time, but not less than seven days, to \n     answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and \n     other documentary evidence in support of the answer. [See \n     Attachment #9--5 United States Code 7513]\n       The DOD Time Line cites this law as reason for a 60 day \n     delay in issuing a 30 day ``proposed removal.'' Mr. \n     Hollingsworth had already served a considerable amount of \n     time in jail before the proposed removal was issued.\n     DOD Inspector General Regulations state Mr. Hollingsworth \n         could have been terminated after Indictment.\n       IGDR 1400.4, Displinary and Adverse Action dated December \n     30, 1994, page 7, states an immediate removal can be \n     initiated ``when the agency has reasonable cause to believe \n     that an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence \n     of imprisonment may be imposed. Reasonable cause to believe \n     is not established by the mere fact either of an arrest or an \n     ongoing agency investigation of possible criminal misconduct. \n     A criminal indictment will usually constitute reasonable \n     cause.''\n       [See Attachment #10--IGDR--dated 12/30/94, Page 7]\n     DOD WHS Legal Counsel advises Mr. Hollingsworth may be \n         terminated after his guilty plea\n       On March 14, 1996, Gilda Goldsmith, legal counsel at the \n     DOD WHS, advised that ``the indefinite suspension, which \n     suspends Mr. Hollingsworth from duty until final disposition \n     of criminal charges and any administrative proceedings, does \n     not bar the agency from terminating him based on his guilty \n     plea . . . the agency could remove Mr. Hollingworth for both \n     the guilty plea and underlying conduct, but would have to \n     prove the conduct by a preponderance of the evidence if the \n     conviction is reversed.''\n       [See Attachment #11--DOD WHS Legal Counsel memo dated 03/\n     14/96]\n     OPM General Counsel cites other options available to DCIS \n         management\n       The Subcommittee Majority Staff requested the assistance of \n     OPM in determining whether Mr. Hollingsworth, a convicted \n     felon, was entitled to a federal law enforcement retirement \n     six months after conviction and two months after serving his \n     senence of jail on weekends.

Rules of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(1)\n       21. Plea Agreement dated 03/15/96\n\n\n         walinski: criminal investigator, dcis internal affairs\n\n       Mr. Matthew A. Walinski worked at the Defense Criminal \n     Investigative Service (DCIS) as a criminal investigator (GS-\n     1811) from August 1987 through 1998. Since January 1999, he \n     has been employed as a criminal investigator (special agent) \n     in the Office of\n\n[[Page S13647]]\n\n     the Inspector General at the Department of the Treasury. His \n     assigned duties at the Treasury Department include \n     investigating employee misconduct and fraud. Although \n     Walinski was promoted to the grade of GS-14 at DCIS in August \n     1991, he accepted a reduction in grade to GS-13 at the \n     Treasury Department. He told the Subcommittee on September 8, \n     1999 that he left DCIS because he was informed by the DCIS \n     Director Keenan that his goal of becoming a manager was \n     unattainable.\n     DCIS Internal Affairs\n       In June 1999, the Subcommittee received a complaint from a \n     former DCIS agent that Walinski had falsified official \n     reports of investigation while employed at DCIS. The \n     complaints about the falsification of reports by Walinski \n     relate to investigations he conducted while assigned to DCIS' \n     Program Review and Analysis Directorate. This office is known \n     informally as ``internal affairs.'' Walinski was assigned to \n     internal affairs from August 1991 until July 1994.\n       Throughout Walinski's tour of duty in the office of \n     internal affairs, the unit was headed by Mr. Larry J. \n     Hollingsworth. As Director of internal affairs, Hollingsworth \n     held a key position in DCIS's organizational structure--along \n     with the Director (Mancuso), Deputy Director (Dupree), and \n     the Director of Operations (Keenan). Though important \n     internal affairs was a small office. It normally consisted of \n     three investigators (Hollingsworth, Bonnar, and Walinski). \n     However, the office could be augmented--as needed--with \n     special agents from the field.\n       Hollingsworth directed the DCIS office of internal affairs \n     from April 1991 until his retirement in September 1996, \n     according to a document provided by the IG's office. That \n     Hollingsworth was technically listed as the director of \n     internal affairs until his retirement in September 1996 \n     defies understanding, since Hollingsworth was convicted of a \n     felony (18 USC 1001) in March 1996 and sentenced to 30 days \n     in jail on the weekends in June 1996.\n       The authorities, who conducted the investigation (Bureau of \n     Diplomatic Security) of Hollingsworth's criminal activities, \n     believe Hollingsworth committed about 12 overt acts of fraud \n     between October 1992 and April 1994. The 12 alleged overt \n     acts of fraud committed by Hollingsworth were perpetrated \n     while he was the director of DCIS' office of internal \n     affairs. Hollingsworth's criminal conduct while director of \n     internal affairs must inevitably raise questions about the \n     overall integrity of the work performed by this office while \n     Hollingsworth was director.\n       Mr. Thomas J. Bonnar was the Assistant Director of Program \n     Review. Bonnar was Mr. Walinski's immediate supervisor.\n       While Hollingsworth was in charge of the day-to-day \n     operations of the office of internal review, the DCIS \n     Director, Mr. Donald Mancuso, exercised overall management \n     control of all internal investigations. As DCIS Director, \n     Mancuso was the person chiefly responsible for the conduct of \n     internal inquiries. His position description (DDES0466) \n     states under ``Major Duties,'' paragraph (1): Mancuso \n     ``provides staffing and direction for the conduct of internal \n     investigations, as needed.'' Once allegations were received \n     about potential misconduct by DCIS agents, Mancuso and the \n     Deputy DCIS Director, Mr. William Dupree, would usually \n     decide if an inquiry would be conducted, and what its scope \n     would be. As a rule, those decisions were reached in \n     consultation with Hollingsworth.\n       Mancuso and Dupree would normally receive periodic \n     briefings or status reports on each internal investigation \n     still in progress. If a problem arose during an inquiry, \n     Mancuso and Dupree would know about it. When Walinski \n     completed his report of investigation, it would usually be \n     forwarded up the chain of command by Hollingsworth to an \n     Administrative Review Board (ARB). The ARB then made \n     recommendations. Either Mancuso or Dupree would review those \n     recommendations and make the final decision on what--if any--\n     disciplinary action was needed.\n       While assigned to DCIS' office of internal review, Walinski \n     was tasked to complete about 30 ``administrative inquiries'' \n     concerning allegations of misconduct by DCIS agents. The \n     complaints about the falsification of his reports pertain to \n     two ``administrative inquiries'' conducted by Walinski in \n     1993 and 1994 as follows: (1) the tax fraud case involving \n     Special Agent (SA) William G. Steakley--Administrative \n     Inquiry 91; and (2) Stolen gun case involving Special Agent \n     (SA) Stephen J. Johanson--Administrative Inquiry 108.\n       The purpose of this portion of our review was to assess the \n     validity of the allegations against Walinski and to search \n     for the answers to three questions: (1) Did Walinski falsify \n     his reports on the Steakley and Johanson cases? (2) If \n     Walinski falsified reports, did senior management at DCIS \n     know about it? And (3) If DCIS management knew about it, did \n     management take appropriate corrective action?\n       To answer the three questions, the Majority Staff examined \n     all pertinent General Counsel, IG, and U.S. Office of Special \n     Counsel (OSC) files, including reports of investigations and \n     E-mails. The staff also conducted a number of separate \n     interviews.\n     The Case of Mr. Steakley\n       On May 11, 1993, Walinski opened the tax evasion case \n     against Steakley. This was Administrative Inquiry 91. It was \n     opened ``based on information that SA Steakley made \n     misleading statements to the DCIS payroll support activity \n     regarding his actual place of residence in an apparent effort \n     to circumvent his state income tax obligations.''\n       [See Attachment 1--page 1 of Report of Investigation (ROI)]\n       The foundation for Walinski's ROI on the Steakley tax fraud \n     case was his interview with a payroll specialist at Bolling \n     AFB, Washington, D.C.--Mrs. Nancy Gianino. At the time, \n     Gianino was responsible for handling all DCIS payroll \n     matters. Walinski's official witness interview report, dated \n     June 1, 1993, states that Gianino was interviewed at Bolling \n     AFB on May 21, 1993 ``concerning her knowledge of the payroll \n     deductions of SA Steakley.''\n     Gianino Interview\n       Since the Gianino interview is such a crucial piece of \n     evidence in evaluating the accuracy of Walinski's reports, it \n     is quoted here in its entirety:\n       ``Mrs. Gianino said that sometime in late November 1991 she \n     received a letter from SA Steakley which instructed her to \n     discontinue payroll withholding on SA Steakley's salary by \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia. After receiving the letter, \n     which is appended as attachment 1, she contacted SA Steakley \n     via telephone and he informed her that he was being \n     transferred and had, in conjunction with his transfer, \n     established residency in the State of Tennessee. At the time \n     she thought it was strange that an employee who lived and \n     worked in Virginia could move his residency to another state, \n     but because SA Steakley told her he was being transferred in \n     December 1991 she was not concerned. On December 11, 1991, \n     Mrs. Gianino changed SA Steakley's state tax code from \n     Virginia to Tennessee. Mrs. Gianino stated that very shortly \n     after her discussions with SA Steakley she became very ill \n     and was off work for an extended period of time. Because of \n     her illness she was unable to follow-up concerning SA \n     Steakley and his move as would be her normal practice. \n     Normally, Mrs. Gianino makes sure that state income taxes are \n     withheld from the state where the individual's duty \n     assignment is located, especially a state as strict as \n     California.\n       In the Spring of 1993, after her return from the extended \n     illness, Mrs. Gianino started to reconcile the payroll \n     records for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. \n     During this reconciliation she reviewed and compared the \n     permanent duty station location for each employee from their \n     Notification of Personnel Action Standard Form 50; the state \n     code of each employee utilized by the Air Force for \n     deductions for state income taxes; and the current mailing \n     address for each employee. She then discovered that SA \n     Steakley was permanently assigned to California, had a state \n     tax code for Tennessee, and a mailing address in Virginia. \n     Mrs. Gianino stated that she brought this discrepancy to the \n     attention of DCIS management as the Air Force considers this \n     situation to be unacceptable under applicable payroll \n     guidelines.\n       Mrs. Gianino said that in retrospect she felt that both SA \n     Steakley's letter and the subsequent telephone call were \n     vague and very misleading.''\n       [See Amendment 1, Witness Interview/Gianino]\n     DCIS Contacts State Tax Authorities\n       Based on the information provided by Gianino, DCIS \n     officials, including Walinski and Hollingsworth, contacted \n     the departments of taxation in the states of California and \n     Virginia to determine whether Steakley had unpaid income tax \n     liabilities in either state. In addition, they contacted the \n     State of Tennessee to determine whether Steakley was a \n     resident of that state.\n       DCIS made repeated attempts to obtain information on \n     Steakley's tax obligations in California and Virginia. \n     Letters were sent to the tax authorities in both states on \n     July 27, 1993, July 30, 1993 and December 2, 1993. The \n     letters were followed up by telephone calls.\n     Access To Tax Records Blocked\n       In a memo dated December 23, 1993, Walinski reported that \n     he was unable to obtain any information from Virginia on \n     Steakley's tax liabilities. Walinski reported:\n       On December 22, 1993, an official in Virginia's Department \n     of Taxation informed DCIS: The Commonwealth of Virginia will \n     not acknowledge or provide documentation to generic tax \n     liability issues unless the writer of the correspondence is \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia taxpayer . . . . . Per \n     Commonwealth of Virginia Statute the information in question \n     could not be released to DCIS because DCIS was not the \n     taxpayer in question.''\n       [See Amendment 1, Contact Report with Department of \n     Taxation, Commonwealth of Virginia]\n       In an E-mail message to his supervisor, Bonnar, on July 8, \n     1994, Walinski reported that identical restrictions applied \n     to access on individual tax liability data in California. \n     Walinski reported:\n       On May 5, 1994, California tax authorities informed DCIS: \n     By law, California can not release any information concerning \n     an individual taxpayer without a court order or a release \n     from the individual in question.''\n       [See Attachment 1, Contact Report with California Franchise \n     Tax Board]\n     DCIS Continues to Pursue Tax Data\n       Even though DCIS was prohibited by state law from obtaining \n     information on Steakley's state tax liabilities, DCIS \n     Director Mancuso and Hollingsworth pressed\n\n[[Page S13648]]\n\n     Walinski to find a way to obtain that information.\n       During an interview on August 24, 1999, Hollingsworth \n     reacted strongly to the suggestion that DCIS lacks authority \n     to obtain information on Steakley's unpaid state tax \n     liabilities. He insisted that DCIS had all the authority it \n     needed to get the job done. He said: ``I could have done that \n     investigation.'' Both Mancuso and Hollingsworth were formerly \n     employed criminal investigators at the Internal Revenue \n     Service.\n       Mancuso's E-mail to Hollingsworth on July 7, 1994 \n     demonstrates something more than a passing interest in the \n     Steakley tax evasion case. Mancuso's message conveys a sense \n     of urgency on the need to obtain Steakley's state tax data. \n     It also seems to suggest that DOD legal counsel may have \n     advised DCIS not to pursue tax fraud charges against \n     Steakley. Mancuso made this request:\n       ``Please copy me on all transmittals between our office and \n     the states of California and Virginia relative to Mr. \n     Steakley's taxes. It has been a ridiculous amount of time \n     since you told me that we were waiting to hear back from \n     them. At the time of our last discussion I directed you to \n     document your contacts so that I could refer to them if some \n     quick action did not ensue. I've spoken to OGC [Office of the \n     General Counsel] and I think I can get their support despite \n     Perkul [Deputy General Counsel, Washington Headquarters \n     Services] and crew.''\n       ``I'd also like to start making phone calls to the two \n     states and finding out what they're doing with our \n     information.''\n       [See Attachment 1, E-mail from Mancuso to Bonnar and \n     Hollingsworth]\n       When asked by an independent DOD investigator, Mr. Greg \n     McClelland, why DCIS would pursue tax charges against \n     Steakley when prohibited by state law from obtaining that \n     information, Mancuso replied: ``We'll pursue anything that \n     goes to the integrity of the agent.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Greg McClelland interview, March 13, \n     1997, p. 35]\n       Mancuso's reply to McClelland's question in March 1997 \n     suggests that he may have known that DCIS lacked authority to \n     gain access to Steakley state tax records. During an \n     interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso provided a \n     completely different answer to essentially the same question. \n     He was asked why DCIS would pursue charges against Steakley \n     in an area--individual state tax obligations--where it had no \n     authority or jurisdiction to operate. He claimed ignorance. \n     He replied: ``I did not know that DCIS was not authorized \n     access to individual state income tax data.''\n     Walinski Complains about Pressure on Tax Data\n       One day after Mancuso's E-mail to Hollingsworth--July 8, \n     1994, Walinski complained about the pressure from Mancuso to \n     his supervisor, Bonnar. In this E-mail, Walinski stated:\n       ``I do not understand what he [Mancuso] wants us to do. . . \n     . Without a release from Steakley, which both he and his \n     attorney(s) stated will not be provided or a court order of \n     some kind there is nothing else that I can do. I am sorry!''\n       [See Attachment 1, Walinski E-Mail to Bonnar]\n     Steakley's Tax Attorney Responds\n       DCIS attempted to interview SA Steakley's tax accountant/\n     lawyer, Mr. John T. Ambrose, but Steakley refused to waive \n     attorney-client privilege, and Mr. Ambrose refused to be \n     interviewed. However, after further discussion, Steakley's \n     tax attorney provided DCIS with a letter addressing various \n     tax issues bearing on the potential charges against his \n     client. The letter was dated February 22, 1994 and hand \n     delivered to Dupree. Mr. Ambrose stated:\n       ``For tax year 1992, based on a determination that Mr. \n     Steakley was a resident of Tennessee, I prepared three (3) \n     state income tax returns for the Steakleys, one resident \n     state income tax return for Virginia and two (2) nonresident \n     state income tax returns for Virginia and California. In \n     determining how to complete those returns, I reviewed the tax \n     instructions published by the respective state tax agencies \n     and consulted with personnel at those agencies.''\n       [See Attachment 3]\n     Tennessee Residency\n       A DCIS records check in Tennessee did show that SA Steakley \n     owned two homes in the state; was registered to vote there \n     and, in fact, voted in the November 1992 general elections; \n     and applied for and received a state driver's license. Mr. \n     Walinski's report of investigation contains the general \n     guidelines in Tennessee tax law that are used as the standard \n     for determining whether a person can claim they are a \n     resident of the state. According to the information contained \n     in Walinski's report, Steakley appears to meet most of the \n     state residency requirements.\n     No Proof of Tax Fraud\n       At the conclusion of Walinski's investigation, DCIS had no \n     credible evidence or proof that Steakley had unpaid tax \n     liabilities in either California or Virginia.\n       In our interview on September 8, 1999, Walinski \n     acknowledged that his report of investigation on the tax \n     evasion case against Steakley was inconclusive and \n     unsubstantiated.\n       Walinski characterized the tax fraud case against Steakley \n     as ``an unresolved case.'' The investigation had serious \n     shortcomings: ``We couldn't nail him,'' Walinski said. \n     Walinski's inconclusive findings are not apparent in his \n     report. In fact, the report suggests DCIS had an airtight \n     case against Steakley. Walinski also claims Mancuso and \n     Dupree were aware of the flaw. Despite these known \n     deficiencies, Walinski said that he was ``not surprised'' \n     to learn that the ARB Board had subsequently recommended \n     that Steakley ``be removed from his position at DCIS'' for \n     failing to meet his state tax obligations--a \n     recommendation based on Walinski's incomplete report. \n     ``That's just the way DCIS did things,'' he said.\n       In our interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso \n     contradicted Walinski's assertion that management knew the \n     tax case against Steakley was weak. Mancuso insisted that he \n     was not aware of the lack of credible evidence to support tax \n     evasion charges that were eventually brought against \n     Steakley. He said: ``I didn't know about that.''\n     Decisions on Tax Investigation Questioned\n       The staff does not understand why Mancuso and Dupree \n     decided to pursue the tax evasion charges given the \n     prohibitions in place that effectively blocked access to \n     Steakley's state tax records. If DCIS believed that this \n     matter needed further investigation, it should have referred \n     the matter to an external organization that had the authority \n     and jurisdiction to examine those records and determine if \n     Steakley had unpaid tax liabilities. In the absence of that \n     information, the tax evasion charge would be unjustified.\n     ARB Board Recommends Removal\n       The DCIS ARB met on February 7, 1994 to consider the \n     Steakley tax evasion case.\n       In a memo dated March 7, 1994, the ARB recommended that SA \n     Steakley ``be removed from his position with DCIS for \n     violating Executive Order 12674.'' The Board concluded that \n     ``SA Steakley has a tax liability to the State of California \n     and he took overt steps to avoid paying this tax from \n     December 1991 through February 1993.'' The Board's report was \n     signed by James J. Hagen, Special Agent in Charge.\n       [See Attachment 4, page 2]\n     Tax Fraud Charges\n       On August 4, 1994, after reviewing the ARB's \n     recommendations, DCIS management issued Steakley a ``Notice \n     of Proposed Suspension.'' The notice was signed by Mr. John \n     F. Keenan, Director of Investigative Operations. Mr. Keenan \n     was also previously employed by the Internal Revenue Service \n     as a special agent. He is the Director of DCIS today.\n       Mr. Keenan rejected the ARB's recommendation to remove \n     Steakley. Instead, he proposed that SA Steakley be \n     ``suspended without pay for fourteen (14) calendar days.'' \n     The proposed suspension was based on: (1) SA Steakley's \n     failure to pay income taxes in the states of California and \n     Virginia; and (2) SA Steakley's failure to comply with \n     Executive Order 12730 [Section 101, paragraph (1)] that \n     requires employees to pay federal, state, and local taxes--\n     ``that are imposed by law.''\n       [See Attachment 5, page 1]\n       In presenting their case against Steakley, both Mr. Keenan \n     and the ARB relied heavily on Walinski's reported interview \n     of Gianino. Key portions of that interview were incorporated \n     in both memos. For example, after reviewing the \n     communications between Steakley and Gianino in 1991 about \n     payroll deductions--as summarized in Walinski's report, \n     Keenan's memo cites her alleged reconciliation of DCIS \n     payroll records as the event that triggered the whole \n     investigation:\n       ``In the spring of 1993, during a reconciliation of payroll \n     records for DCIS, it was discovered that you were permanently \n     assigned to California, had a state tax code for Tennessee, \n     and a mailing address in Virginia. This discrepancy was \n     brought to the attention of DCIS management as the Air Force \n     considers this situation to be unacceptable under applicable \n     payroll guidelines.\n       [See Attachment 5, page 2]\n     Adjudication--Charges Dropped\n       On October 25, 1994, Mancuso's deputy, Dupree, informed \n     Steakley that the tax fraud charges against him would be \n     dropped.\n       In a memo addressed to Steakley, Mr. Dupree attempted to \n     provide an explanation for his decision to drop the charges:\n       ``I have considered the written response submitted by your \n     representative, Mr. Luciano Cerasi, as well as the oral \n     response presented by you and Mr. Cerasi on October 20, 1994. \n     Based on the information you provided concerning the filing \n     date of October 15 for the state of California, I have \n     decided that the charges are not substantiated. Therefore, it \n     is my decision to overturn the proposal to suspend you for 14 \n     days.''\n       [See Attachment 6]\n       Dupree's explanation seems to suggest that the charges were \n     dropped because the California's state tax filing deadline \n     had not yet arrived. His explanation is difficult to \n     comprehend. Senior DCIS officials had consistently claimed \n     that Steakley's misconduct was ``an integrity issue.'' For \n     example, in his memo dated August 4, 1994, Keenan told \n     Steakley:\n       ``I find you have violated the trust placed in you as a \n     employee of the OIG [Office of the Inspector General].''\n       [See Attachment 5, page 3]\n       It very difficult to reconcile Dupree's explanation for \n     dropping the charges with the questions raised about \n     Steakley's integrity--particularly since Dupree's memo was \n     signed ten days after the California filing deadline had \n     passed.\n\n[[Page S13649]]\n\n     FLEOA's Allegations Against Walinski\n       During the adjudication process on tax fraud charges, \n     Steakley was represented by an attorney with the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), Mr. Luciano A. \n     Cerasi.\n       As Steakley's defense counsel, Cerasi directed a 10-page \n     letter to Dupree in response to the proposed notice of \n     suspension issued to Steakley in August 1994. Cerasi's letter \n     was hand-delivered to Dupree on September 15, 1994. Cerasi \n     argued that ``the proposed adverse action against SA Steakley \n     must be rescinded due to a lack of preponderant evidence to \n     support the charges.''\n       In offering a spirited defense of his client, Cerasi, who \n     represents rank and file agents, also raised explosive \n     allegations about the accuracy of the investigative report \n     underlying the tax evasion charges. He alleged that \n     Walinski's report contained ``false, misleading, and \n     fabricated investigative material.''\n       Cerasi alleged that Walinski had ``fabricated the interview \n     in another [Johanson] case.'' He alleged that Walinski \n     ``completely fabricated the results of his interview with \n     Mrs. Nancy Gianino.'' He referred to Walinski as \n     ``management's pit bull.'' He said Walinski was ``willing to \n     fabricate investigative information to destroy the career of \n     a subject of an investigation.'' Cerasi urged Dupree to re-\n     open the case and re-investigate the entire matter.\n       [See Attachment 7, pages 2 and 3]\n       Cerasi's allegations about Walinski's report on the \n     Steakley case in September 1994 followed allegations and \n     complaints, which surfaced two months earlier, about \n     Walinski's report on the Johanson stolen gun case. The \n     Johanson case is discussed in the next section of this \n     report.\n     Steakley's Request for Re-Investigation\n       On October 20, 1994, both Cerasi and Steakley were given an \n     opportunity to present an oral response to the tax evasion \n     charges. During the oral rebuttal session in Dupree's office, \n     Steakley followed up on Cerasi's written request for a \n     ``reinvestigation of this whole Walinski file.'' Steakley \n     requested ``an internal investigation of SA Walinski's \n     actions.'' Steakley stated once again ``he had proof that SA \n     Walinski had fabricated the results of the administrative \n     inquiry involving his state income taxes.''\n       [See Attachments 8, page 1]\n     Steakley's ``Proof''\n       The ``proof'' referred to by Steakley was a taped telephone \n     conversation he had with Gianino on September 8, 1994 about \n     Walinski's reported interview of her on May 21, 1993. This \n     tape was subsequently provided to and transcribed by the DOD \n     IG, and a copy of the transcription is located in the files \n     of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC).\n       The Majority Staff reviewed the tape transcription in the \n     OSC files.\n       Gianino's statements on this tape appear to indicate that \n     Walinski fabricated the entire Gianino interview. Steakley \n     read her Walinski's report of interview. She said that every \n     statement in Walinski's report, which was attributed to her, \n     was ``not true.'' She never had an extended illness, and her \n     leave records would prove it. She said Walinski made several \n     visits to her office to examine Steakley's file. She gave him \n     the file, and he took notes from the file. [Walinski probably \n     made these visits in March or April 1993 when checking \n     Steakley's time and attendance records during the \n     investigation of Steakley's accident with a government \n     vehicle in Administrative Inquiry 86]. At the conclusion of \n     the tape, Gianino said: ``Walinski came over here with his \n     badge and puts false accusations in his report. How am I ever \n     going to trust anybody coming over here [from that office] \n     again.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Telephone Conversation between William \n     G. Steakley and Nancy Gianino, September 8, 1994--Tape \n     Transcription, page 78]\n     DCIS Rejects Request for Re-Investigation\n       Except for what appears to be an exchange of perfunctory \n     phone calls in 1995, requests for an independent review of \n     Walinski's report were largely ignored--and finally \n     dismissed--by senior DCIS management. Another three years \n     would pass before Steakley's allegations about Walinski would \n     be subjected to an independent review.\n     IG Request for Independent Review\n       The independent review was triggered by a series of letters \n     from Steakley to Ms. Eleanor Hill, DOD IG, and to Senator \n     Fred Thompson. These letters were dated February 9, 1996 and \n     March 12, 1996. In these letters, Steakley renewed his \n     allegations that ``Walinski and Hollingsworth had ``prepared \n     fabricated reports.'' They had ``falsely accused him of tax \n     fraud,'' he alleged. These letters also put a new twist on \n     the allegations. Steakley now alleged that ``Walinski stated \n     directly that the entire matter was directed by Mancuso and \n     Dupree.''\n       [See Attachment 9, Steakley letters to Hill and Sen. \n     Thompson multiple pages]\n     DOD IG Refers Case to PCIE\n       Since Steakley's allegations were ``long-standing in nature \n     and involve a number of individuals in various parts of the \n     IG organization,'' Hill concluded that her office was not \n     capable of conducting ``an objective internal investigation \n     of the allegations.'' She said it simply was ``not \n     feasible.'' Consequently, on May 23, 1996, she referred the \n     entire matter to the President's Council on Integrity and \n     Efficiency (PCIE) for further review.\n       [See Attachment 10, Hill's letters to PCIE and Senator \n     Thompson, May 23, 1996, page 1]\n     PCIE Response\n       On October 16, 1996--five months after Hill's request was \n     made, the PCIE returned the case to the DOD IG ``for \n     appropriate handling,'' because Steakley's complaints \n     concerned IG employees--not the IG herself. [Attachment 10, \n     PCIE letter to Hill, page 2] Following another request from \n     the DOD IG on February 20, 1997, the Integrity Committee of \n     the PCIE agreed to review Steakley's allegations. In her \n     final request, Hill again expressed frustration over her \n     inability to conduct an independent review: ``Our attempts to \n     conduct an impartial internal inquiry have been hampered by \n     the increasing number of senior managers who have recused \n     themselves as a result of the growing allegations, including \n     the Director [Mancuso] of the office which would be \n     investigating this matter internally.''\n       [See Attachment 10, PCIE letter to Hill, October 16, 1996]\n     Case Referred to OSC\n       On June 3, 1997, the case was finally referred to OSC for \n     investigation.\n       [See Attachment 10, Hill memo to PCIE, February 20, 1997; \n     OSC letter to DOD IG, June 3, 1997; IC letter to PCIE, \n     January 8, 1999, page 2]\n     OSC Report and Conclusions\n       On July 21, 1998, the OSC completed a report on Steakley's \n     allegations about senior DCIS officials. The OSC report \n     focused primarily on prohibited employment practices and not \n     whether Walinski had falsified official reports on \n     investigation.\n       Despite a mountain of evidence pointing to a number of \n     unresolved issues, the OSC notified DOD in December 1998 that \n     Steakley's allegations ``were without merit,'' and the case \n     was closed in January 1999.\n       [See Attahcment 10, IC letter to PCIE, January 8, 1999. \n     page 2.]\n     McClelland's Investigation\n       On March 27, 1996--two months before Hill initially \n     referred the matter to the PCIE, she attempted to launch an \n     investigation of Steakley's allegations. This investigation \n     continued while Hill worked with PCIE/OSC to assume \n     responsibility for the investigation.\n       The job was assigned to the IG's Office of Departmental \n     Inquiries--an organization that is separate from DCIS--and \n     more independent, though both offices report to the same \n     boss--the DOD IG. Mr. Dennis Cullen was initially assigned as \n     the case action officer on April 2, 1996, but Mr. Greg \n     McClelland was placed in charge of the internal inquiry on \n     December 12, 1996.\n       Between January and June 1997, McClelland conducted a very \n     extensive set of interviews. The staff has examined the \n     transcripts of McClelland's interviews and believes that \n     McClelland conducted a very thorough and credible \n     investigation. He gathered all pertinent information needed \n     to prepare an independent report on Steakley's allegations. \n     While McClelland actually began drafting a report, it was \n     never finalized. Once the OSC agreed to assume jurisdiction \n     over the case on June 3, 1997, McClelland was directed to \n     terminate his effort and transfer all materials to the OSC. \n     Even though McClelland's report was never finalized, his \n     files contain important information bearing on the \n     allegations against Walinski--information that was completely \n     ignored by OSC.\n     McClelland's Investigative Plan\n       The guidance given to McClelland was clear. He was to \n     investigate all the allegations raised by Steakley, including \n     ``alleged false statements'' by a DCIS investigator. On the \n     tax fraud inquiry, he intended to address this issue: ``Did \n     DCIS fabricate an ethics violation [suspected tax fraud] \n     against Mr. Steakley?'' He planned to ``review applicable \n     regulations'' to determine whether ``officials acted within \n     the scope of their authority.'' His investigative plan called \n     for questioning Gianino first. If warranted--based on \n     information obtained from Gianino, he would then interview \n     other DCIS officials as follows: Walinski, Hollingsworth, \n     Dupree, and Mancuso.\n       [See Attachment 11, page 3]\n     Gianino\n       On January 28, 1997, McClelland interviewed the key \n     witness--Gianino--regarding the contents of Walinski's \n     reported interview of her on May 21, 1993. In this interview, \n     Gianino disputes and contradicts virtually every point raised \n     in Walinski's report.\n       Walinski's report declares that the interview took place at \n     Gianino's Bolling AFB office on May 21, 1993. Gianino, by \n     comparison, testified that she had just one telephone \n     conversation with Walinski; that he called her; but she was \n     unable to remember when the call took place.\n       McClelland questioned Gianino about each individual part of \n     Walinski's report of interview. McClelland read her each \n     sentence in Walinski's report. In each case, he asked \n     Gianino: ``Is that accurate?'' And in each case, Gianino \n     replied: ``I did not call him.'' Or ``that's not a true \n     statement.'' Or ``that's not true.'' Or ``I did not do \n     that.'' On the question of sick leave between 1991 and 1993, \n     Gianino testified: ``I had maybe a couple of hours of sick \n     leave. But I was not out for a long extended period of time \n     due to illness.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Gianino interview, 1/28/97, pages 4-12]\n\n                        Gianino's Leave Records\n\n       The staff examined Gianino's leave records for 1991 through \n     1993.\n\n[[Page S13650]]\n\n       In his report of investigation, Walinski states: ``Very \n     shortly after her discussions with Steakley [in late 1991], \n     she [Gianino] became very ill and was off work for an \n     extended period of time. Because of her illness she was \n     unable to follow-up concerning Steakley. . . . In the Spring \n     of 1993, after her return from the extended illness, Mrs. \n     Gianino. . . .''\n       Walinski's assertions about Gianino's absence from her \n     Bolling AFB office due to an extended illness are \n     inconsistent with her official leave records.\n       Those records show: (1) Gianino used 54.5 hours of sick \n     leave in 1992; and (2) she used .5 hours in the first half of \n     1993 and a total of 15 hours of sick leave for the balance of \n     the year.\n       [See Attachment 12]\n     Walinski\n       McClelland then interviewed Walinski--first on February 14, \n     1997--and then again on June 6, 1997. After questioning \n     Walinski at length about other parts of his report of \n     investigation on the Steakley tax fraud case, McClelland \n     confronts him with the conflict between his report and \n     Gianino's sworn testimony:\n       ``Okay. Well, Mr. Walinski, we have a problem. And the \n     problem is that Ms. Gianino controverts almost everything you \n     say about her in here [Walinski's report], under oath, on \n     tape.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, page 62]\n       Walinski replies: ``Okay, Well,--In here somewhere we will \n     find the information that she provided to me, and it will be \n     in her handwriting.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, page 62]\n       Walinski never produced any documentation from Gianino that \n     had a bearing on the contents or accuracy of his May 21, 1993 \n     report of interview.\n       Then McClelland moved to the key question about sick leave. \n     Walinski's report contains a number of references to how \n     Gianino ``became very ill and was off work for an extended \n     period of time.'' McClelland asked this question:\n       ``Okay. Ms. Gianino states that she was not out sick from \n     December 1991 to spring 1993, and the records substantiate \n     that.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, page 65]\n       McClelland asked Walinski to explain the discrepancy \n     between his report and Gianino's official leave records. Here \n     is Walinski's response:\n       ``Well,--well, the remembrance that I have is, folks, is \n     that she was out sick, and I remember everybody at \n     headquarters telling me that . . . I think she had cancer \n     really bad, ovarian cancer, and she would come into work and \n     work a couple of hours, and then she would go home.\n       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, pages 14 \n     and 65]\n       Under intense probing, Walinski admitted that the Gianino \n     interview may not have taken place on May 21, 1993--as stated \n     in his official report. He told McClelland: ``I interviewed \n     her [Gianino], like, two or three times.'' McClelland \n     responded to this revelation with another question: ``Why \n     isn't that reflected in the ROI [report of investigation]?'' \n     Walinski's response helps to shed light on his investigative \n     methods. He told McClelland that his reports do not \n     necessarily reflect the way he conducted the investigation:\n       ``Well, because one day I went over there and she told me \n     this information. Another day I went over there and I \n     interviewed her and I was interviewing her about another, \n     you, something else.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, pages 63-\n     65]\n       During the second interview on June 6, 1997, McClelland \n     attempted to determine if there was any concrete linkage \n     between Walinski's handwritten notes of the Gianino interview \n     and the final version of the interview that accompanied his \n     report of investigation. McClelland determined that there was \n     essentially no linkage. Not one important fact contained in \n     the final report could be traced back to Walinski's \n     handwritten notes. And Walinski agreed with McClelland's \n     assessment. The Majority Staff examined those notes and \n     agreed with McClelland's assessment. Walinski's notes are \n     undated and cannot be considered proof that the interview \n     took place. McClelland asked Walinski about the disconnect. \n     Walinski replied:\n       ``I don't write down verbatim what people tell me, so I \n     remember she just said she was out . . . I just write down \n     highlights in my notes . . . Just enough that jogs my memory \n     so I can remember what people said.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 6/6/97, pages 28, \n     37, 69]\n     Staff Interviews Gianino\n       Gianino was interviewed on June 30, 1999 regarding her \n     knowledge of Walinski's May 21, 1993 witness interview \n     report.\n       At the beginning of the interview, the Majority Staff gave \n     her an opportunity to examine Walinski's report. She had \n     never seen it. She re-confirmed all the facts previously \n     developed by McClelland. Point-by-point, she characterized \n     Walinski's report as completely false. She stated that she \n     was never interviewed by Walinski but may have spoken to him \n     briefly on the telephone. She noted that he was even mistaken \n     about her GS grade. Walinski reported that she was a ``GS-12 \n     Payroll Specialist'' at the top of the witness interview \n     form. In fact, Gianino was a GS-7 Payroll technician on the \n     date of the interview. When asked why she thought Walinski \n     fabricated his report of interview, she offered this opinion:\n       ``DCIS was out to get Steakley. They wanted to destroy \n     him''\n       On August 20, 1999, the staff conducted a follow-up \n     interview with Gianino. At that time, she was shown portions \n     of Walinski's sworn testimony to McClelland on February 14, \n     1997 where he attempted to explain the discrepancy between \n     his report and her leave records. In this testimony, Walinski \n     fabricated a new reason for his May 1993 report about her \n     extended absences from the office. He suggested that ``she \n     had cancer really bad, ovarian cancer.'' Gianino was shocked \n     that Walinski had made such a statement under oath. She said: \n     ``that statement is not true. I have never had ovarian \n     cancer.''\n     Staff Interviews Walinski\n       On September 8, 1999, the Majority Staff questioned \n     Walinski about the accuracy of his May 21, 1993 interview of \n     Gianino. During the meeting, he attempted to offer evidence \n     that his reported interview of Gianino did, in fact, take \n     place.\n       This is the explanation offered by Walinski:\n       Since Steakley had refused to cooperate with the \n     investigation and provide his state income tax returns, DCIS \n     could not prove that Steakley had failed to meet his state \n     tax obligations. This shortcoming was painfully evident when \n     the ARB Board met to review the Steakley case. Walinski's \n     report did not answer the key question: What were Steakley's \n     total unpaid tax liabilities? Exactly how much did he owe \n     Virginia and California?\n       The ARB wanted that question answered. So Walinski was \n     called into the ARB Board meeting and directed to get the \n     missing information. Walinski claims he contacted Gianino on \n     the telephone and then went over to her office at Bolling \n     AFB. At this meeting, she provided the earnings data that he \n     needed to calculate Steakley's unpaid state taxes for the \n     Board. He said there were detailed notes containing the tax \n     calculations. He further stated that some of those notes were \n     in Gianino's handwriting, and they prove that the Gianino \n     interview actually took place as he reported.\n       [See Attachment 14]\n       Walinski offered essentially the same explanation to \n     McClelland in testimony on February 14, 1997, and June 6, \n     1997.\n       Walinski's explanation does not stand up to scrutiny for \n     three reasons:\n       First, Walinski's handwritten notes that he purportedly \n     took during his interview of Gianino on May 21, 1993 do not \n     contain tax calculations or references to them.\n       Second, The final version of Walinski's report of interview \n     with Gianino on May 21, 1993 contains no reference to income \n     tax calculations.\n       Third, since the ARB Board did not meet on the Steakley tax \n     evasion case until February 17, 1994--nine months after the \n     reported Gianino interview, and since Walinski claims the tax \n     calculations were prepared in response to a question that \n     arose during the Board meeting, the notes on tax \n     calculations--if they ever existed--could not constitute \n     proof that the Gianino interview took place as reported by \n     Walinski.\n     McClelland's Evaluation of Walinski\n       McClelland was interviewed on August 4, 1999 to elicit his \n     impressions on the irreconcilable differences between the \n     testimony of Walinski and Gianino. This is what McClelland \n     stated:\n       ``While he was unable to document willful intent on the \n     part of Walinski, he characterized Walinski's conduct and \n     reporting in the Steakley tax fraud case as egregious. \n     Walinski was a sloppy investigator. His report contained \n     widespread discrepancies and inaccuracies.''\n     Response by Management\n       This portion of the reports addresses the question of how \n     DCIS management responded to allegations that Walinski had \n     fabricated his official report on the Steakley investigation:\n       Did DCIS management make an honest attempt to review the \n     allegations about Walinski's report?\n       The Majority Staff was unable to find any evidence to \n     suggest that DCIS management attempted to evaluate complaints \n     that Walinski had falsified his report on the Steakley tax \n     fraud case.\n       Examples of how DCIS management responded to the \n     allegations are cited below.\n\n                                 Bonnar\n\n       In a memo dated November 15, 1994, Bonnar--Walinski's \n     immediate supervisor--reported that he had received a \n     telephone call from Steakley the previous day--November 14, \n     1994. Bonnar reported that Steakley asked if Dupree had \n     launched an investigation into Mr. Walinski's actions. \n     Steakley had requested the investigation during his meeting \n     with Dupree on October 20, 1994. Bonnar told Steakley: \n     ``there are no pending internal administrative inquiries \n     involving your case.''\n       In the memo, Bonnar also reported on Steakley's overall \n     impressions of DCIS' commitment to reviewing Walinski's \n     actions:\n       ``It was clear to him [Steakley] that Mr. Dupree had \n     decided not to act on his request for an investigation.\n       [See Attachment 8, page 2]\n\n                             Hollingsworth\n\n       According to the OSC report, Dupree asked Hollingsworth to \n     be certain that Walinski's\n\n[[Page S13651]]\n\n     report was consistent with the facts, and Hollingsworth \n     assured him that there was no truth to Steakley's \n     allegations:\n       ``Dupree asked Hollingsworth to look into the [Walinski] \n     matter and recalled that he was assured by Hollingsworth that \n     the documents were in support of the information . . . and \n     found the allegation was not correct.''\n       [See Attachment 15, pages 15 and 22]\n       OSC's assessment does not seem to square with the facts.\n       First, there is no evidence to suggest that Hollingsworth \n     investigated the accuracy of Walinski's report. Quite to the \n     contrary, a memo signed by Hollingsworth on November 23, 1994 \n     suggests that he had no plan to do it--unless Steakley \n     provided more specific information Hollingsworth stated:\n       ``Based on a review of the allegations made by SA Steakley, \n     no action will be taken until he provides written \n     documentation.''\n       [See Attachment 16]\n       Use of the words ``written documentation'' seems important, \n     since Steakley had taped a conversation with Gianino on \n     September 8, 1994 suggesting that Walinski had falsified the \n     interview. Testimony by Dupree, which is cited in the next \n     section of this report, indicates that management knew about \n     the tape but refused to consider it as a useful piece of \n     evidence.\n       Secondly, it seems like Hollingsworth thought he knew the \n     answer to the key question surrounding the accuracy of \n     Walinski's report--Gianino's leave status. In his November \n     23, 1994 memo, Hollingsworth indicated that he had already \n     made up his mind on this core issue:\n       ``The one issue that can be readily resolved is the issue \n     of Mrs. Nancy Gianino's leave status. Contrary to SA \n     Steakley's allegations, her lengthy leave was well known at \n     DCIS since she handles the payroll at Bolling AFB for DCIS.''\n       [See Attachment 16]\n       An independent interview of Gianino and review of her leave \n     records would have quickly resolved all the issues \n     surrounding Walinski's report of investigation. However, \n     Hollingsworth failed to pursue this line of inquiry.\n\n                                 Dupree\n\n       On March 13, 1997, McClelland interviewed Mancuso's Deputy, \n     Mr. William Dupree, about his knowledge of and reactions to \n     allegations that Walinski had falsified his report on the \n     Steakley tax evasion case.\n       Initially, Dupree flatly denied having any knowledge about \n     Walinski's fabricated reports. For example, McClelland asked: \n     ``Were you aware of factual inaccuracies in the [Walinski] \n     ROI [report of investigation]?'' Dupree's answer: ``No.'' \n     McClelland's follow-up question: ``You weren't?'' Dupree: \n     ``No.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Dupree interview 3/13/97, page 37]\n       Fortunately, McClelland pressed Dupree about the issue and \n     succeeded in making Dupree admit he was aware of the problem. \n     From his response, it seems very clear that he never had any \n     intention of examining the accuracy of Walinski's reports.\n\n                                Question\n\n       McClelland asked him if he remembered if the subject of \n     ``false information in Walinski's ROI [report of \n     investigation] came up at a meeting in his office [Meeting \n     with Steakley and Cerasi in October 20, 1994].''\n       [See Attachment 2, Dupree interview, 3/13 97, page 38]\n       This was Dupree's response:\n\n                                Response\n\n       ``Oh, Gary [Steakley] was making all kinds of statements \n     about things. Yeah. The falseness, you know, allegedly there \n     are false statements. But you know, he didn't provide any \n     facts or information.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Page 38]\n\n                                Question\n\n       McClelland then began questioning Dupree about his response \n     to allegations that Walinski had falsified the Gianino \n     interview. McClelland asked this question: ``Did you take any \n     action to look into that?''\n\n                                Response\n\n       ``Other than to assure Larry [Hollingsworth], `Let's make \n     sure that what we're doing is something we can support and \n     back it up and everything. But Gary didn't offer anything. He \n     said he had a tape [interview with Gianino on September 8, \n     1994]. And I'm saying, Gary, you know, I need more than \n     that.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Page 39]\n\n                                Question\n\n       McClelland turned to the crucial follow-up question: ``Did \n     anybody call Gianino and find out, find out what she had \n     actually said?''\n\n                                Response\n\n       Dupree's response is very revealing. It suggests he never \n     had any intention of checking out the questions about the \n     inaccuracy of Walinski's report. He said:\n       ``I have no reason to question the statement that she \n     provided to Walinski, an agent, no different than the \n     statement I provide to you.''\n\n                                Question\n\n       McClelland responded with this question: ``Well, you have \n     an allegation from Gary [Steakley]?''\n\n                                Response\n\n       ``Allegation. With what? He is the person that's being \n     investigated. I had reason to believe Gary [Steakley] was \n     making a speculative allegation without any evidence other \n     than he doesn't like Matt Walinski.''\n\n                             Final Exchange\n\n       McClelland closed this segment of the interview with \n     another question:\n       ``If you were to find out that there were inaccuracies in \n     the ROI [report of investigation] with regard to--.''\n       However, before McClelland could complete the sentence, \n     Depuree jumped in with this assertion: ``I would do the \n     similar thing we previously did.'' So McClelland asked: And \n     what's that? Dupree's response: ``Investigate it.''\n       [See attachment 2, page 41]\n       The Majority Staff's puzzled by Dupree's response to the \n     last question. He had allegations--from FLEOA and Steakley--\n     about inaccuracies in Walinski's investigation report. Why \n     did he fail to investigate them?\n       Hollingsworth provided a partial answer to this question \n     during an interview on August 24, 1999. Hollingsworth \n     asserted:\n       ``DCIS gave absolutely no credence to Steakley's \n     allegations.''\n\n                                Mancuso\n\n       McClelland also interviewed DCIS Director Mancuso on March \n     13, 1997.\n       Mancuso's responses to McClelland's questions clearly \n     indicate that he was aware of the allegations about \n     Walinski's report.\n       This is Mancuso's response to McClelland's question about \n     his knowledge of inaccuracies in Walinski's report of \n     investigation and the Gianino interview:\n       ``I know that there was a question that Gary [Steakley] had \n     as to where Matt [Walinski] had gotten the information. I \n     remember something on that  * * * * But it was--what I heard \n     of complaints, I heard from Gary. I'm not aware from Bill \n     [Dupree] or from anyone else that there was anything \n     inaccurate in Matt's report.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Mancuso interview, 3/13/97, page 27]\n       McClelland then asked Mancuso: ``What did you hear from \n     Gary [Steakley] on that [inaccuracies in Walinski's report]?\n       In replying to this question, Mancuso indicates that \n     Steakley's allegations about Walinski's report were coming \n     into his office and being relayed to him through secondary \n     sources:\n       ``I would walk down the hall and somebody would say \n     Steakley called me up last night, and he was saying that Matt \n     Walinski had not attributed remarks properly in some way and \n     that kind of thing.''\n       [See Attachment 2, Mancuso interview, 3/13/97, page 26]\n       McClelland follow up by asking: Did he [Steakley] tell you \n     anything about a woman over at payroll called Nancy Gianino? \n     Mancuso's reply suggests that he was not only familiar with \n     Gianino's name, but more importantly, he heard about her from \n     sources other than Steakley. It also suggests that Mancuso \n     had knowledge of the core problem with Walinski's report. \n     This is Mancuso's reply: ``I've heard that from other people. \n     I did not hear it from Gary.'' Mancuso's response to that \n     question prompted McClelland to suggest that Mancuso had \n     ``some idea of the allegations that Steakley was making with \n     regard to Gianino?'' Mancuso admitted that he did but again \n     claimed that it was coming from Steakley.\n       [See Attachment 2, Mancuso interview, 3/13/97, pages 26-27]\n       Mancuso's response to these questions is consistent with \n     the assessment presented by the OSC in its report of July 21, \n     1998 on the Steakley case, OSC concluded:\n       ``Mancuso was aware of the conflict between the Walinski \n     interview of Gianino and Steakley's version of the interview. \n     However, Mancuso was not aware of any manufactured \n     information relating to Steakley.''\n       [See Attachment 15, page 22]\n     Mancuso Ignored Walinski Problem\n       To summarize, Mancuso admits that he knew about Steakley's \n     allegation that Walinski had fabricated the Gianino \n     interview, but no one in DCIS, including Dupree, had ever \n     suggested to him that there was any truth to those \n     allegations. Clearly, management did not give the allegations \n     much credibility. As Hollingworth put it: ``DCIS gave \n     absolutely no credence to Steakley's allegations.''\n       It seems very clear from Mancuso's testimony that he never \n     considered the need to investigate the allegations. The \n     apparent lack of curiosity on the part of the most senior \n     criminal investigator at the DOD IG is astonishing. As a \n     result, the allegations about Walinski were never examined, \n     and no corrective action was taken.\n\n\n                        the case of mr. Johanson\n\n       Walinski initiated this inquiry--Administrative Inquiry \n     108--on February 23, 1994 after DCIS headquarters, including \n     Bonnar, Hollingsworth, and Nancuso, were officially notified \n     that a DCIS-issued weapon was stolen from the home of Special \n     Agent Stephen Johanson, who was assigned to the Van Nuys \n     Resident Agency office in California.\n     Stolen Gun\n       DCIS had issued Johanson two weapons: (1) a 9mm Sig Sauer \n     that he normally carried; and (2) a smaller Smith and Wesson \n     revolver for undercover work.\n       Sometime between February 14 and February 16, 1994, while \n     Johanson was participating in the execution of a search \n     warrant in San Diego, his home in Palmdale was burglarized. \n     The burglars stole a number of items valued at about \n     $10,000.00, including jewelry and the loaded Smith and Wesson \n     revolver. The stolen revolver was issued to Johanson because \n     of his involvement in an\n\n[[Page S13652]]\n\n     undercover operation the previous year. Since an earthquake \n     had severely damaged the Van Nuys Resident Agency office and \n     made it insecure--and no Class-5 safe was available there, \n     Johanson kept this weapon stored on the top shelf of his \n     bedroom closet under a pile of clothing. When he returned \n     from San Diego on February 16th and discovered the burglary, \n     he immediately notified the local police authorities and DCIS \n     management of the break-in and loss of the service weapon.\n     Walinski's Report\n       Walinski reported that he conducted the following \n     interviews of DCIS officials assigned to the Los Angeles \n     Field Office: (1) Richard Smith, Special Agent in Charge \n     (SAC)--March 4, 1994; (2) Robert Young, Assistant Special \n     Agent in Charge (ASAC)--March 2, 1994; (3); Jon Clark, Group \n     Manager--March 2, 1994; (4) Michael R. Shiohama (RAC)--March \n     2, 1994; (5) Michael D. Litterelle, Firearms Coordinator--\n     March 3, 1994; and (6) Stephen J. Johanson, Special Agent--\n     March 3, 1994. While all the interviews were conducted during \n     a 3-day period, March 2-4, it took Walinski more than five \n     weeks to sign, date, and finalize these interviews. They are \n     actually dated April 12-13, 1994.\n       Based on these interviews, Walinski reached four important \n     conclusions. These conclusions are contained in his report of \n     investigation: First, Johanson's supervisors--RAC, SAC, and \n     ASAC--never authorized Johanson to have the undercover weapon \n     issued to him. Second, has supervisors did not know that \n     Johanson had the undercover weapon until it was reported as \n     stolen. Third, Johanson informed the Group Manager (Clark) on \n     February 10, 1994 that he had the undercover weapon, and the \n     Group Manager ``immediately'' instructed him to turn it in at \n     the next firearms range training session scheduled for March \n     7, 1994. And fourth, neither Johanson nor the Firearms \n     Coordinator could remember who authorized Johanson to have \n     the undercover weapon.\n       [See Attachment 1, Report of Investigation, Synopsis]\n       Walinski completed this inquiry on April 15, 1994. On that \n     date, Hollingsworth forwarded Walinski's report of \n     investigation and appended interviews to Dupree ``for \n     whatever action you deem appropriate.''\n       [See Attachment 1, letter of transmittal]\n     ARB Recommendation\n       The Administrative Review Board (ARB) met on April 21, 1993 \n     to consider Walinski's report on the Johanson case.\n       After reviewing Walinski's report, the ARB reached these \n     conclusions: (1) Johanson stored a government-issued weapon \n     at his residence while on ``extended leave or non-duty status \n     for 5 or more consecutive days'' in violation of Section \n     3807.4 of the DCIS Special Agent's Manual; and (2) Johanson \n     was not authorized to posses two issued weapons. The ARB also \n     concluded that Johanson failed to return the weapon at the \n     conclusion of the undercover operation and failed to sign the \n     proper forms when the weapon was issued to him.\n       The ARB recommended that Johanson be suspended for 10 days \n     without pay. The ARB's report, dated May 9, 1994, was \n     forwarded to the SAC, Los Angeles Field Office, Richard R. \n     Smith, for consideration.\n       [See Attachment 2, page 1]\n     Charges\n       On June 24, 1994, Smith issued a Notice of Proposed \n     Suspension to Johanson. Smith recommended that Johanson be \n     suspended without pay for 8 calendar days: for failing ``to \n     sign for, properly secure, and return a weapon issued to you \n     for an undercover assignment.''\n       Smith's memo to Johanson recited many facts taken directly \n     from Walinski's report of investigation and accompanying \n     interviews. These same facts were subsequently disputed--and \n     formally challenged--by many of the agents involved.\n       Smith's decision to discipline Johanson seemed to hinge on \n     one piece of disputed information developed by Walinski. This \n     was a meeting that allegedly occurred in the Van Nuys \n     Resident Agency office on February 10, 1994. At this meeting, \n     Walinski claimed that Group Manager Jon Clark informed \n     Johanson that he would not be assigned to an ongoing \n     undercover operation known as ``Skyworthy.'' According to \n     Walinski, Johanson then informed Clark that he still had an \n     undercover weapon. At this point, Walinski states, Clark told \n     Johanson to bring the weapon to the next firearms \n     qualification session to be held on March 7, 1994. This \n     particular assertion appears in Walinski's interviews of \n     Young, Clark and Johanson as well as in his report of \n     investigation. The February 10, 1994 meeting is the \n     centerpiece of Smith's Notice of Proposed Suspension. Smith \n     used this piece of information as the basis for charging \n     Johanson with failing to return a weapon issued to him for \n     undercover work. This is what Smith said about the alleged \n     February 10, 1994 meeting attended by Clark:\n       ``On February 10, 1994, you [Johanson] were informed by \n     Group Manager Clark that you would not be part of the \n     undercover operation relocated from 50PX [Phoenix]. When you \n     told Group Manager Clark that you still had a second weapon \n     in your possession he instructed you to bring it to the next \n     50LA range qualification on March 7, 1994. Before you could \n     return the weapon, your home was burglarized and the gun was \n     stolen.''\n       [See Attachment 3, page 1]\n     Rank and File Challenge Walinski's Report\n       The first formal complaint about Walinski's report on the \n     stolen gun case was initiated on the day Johanson received \n     Smith's Notice of Proposed Suspension--July 6, 1994--and saw \n     the erroneous information about the February 10th meeting.\n       The first complaint was embodied in a sworn statement \n     signed jointly by Supervisory Special Agent Jon Clark and Mr. \n     Thomas J. Bonnar--Walinski's immediate supervisor at DCIS \n     Headquarters in Washington. While this statement was signed \n     on July 19, 1994, it concerned a telephone conversation \n     between Johanson and Clark on July 6, 1994. The joint Clark/\n     Bonnar statement clearly suggests that Walinski falsified \n     information in this report of investigation on the stolen gun \n     case.\n       Portions of the joint statement are summarized below.\n       After receiving Smith's Notice of Proposed Suspension on \n     July 6, 1994, Johanson called Jon Clark on the telephone to \n     express alarm and confusion over a statement in Smith's memo \n     that was attributed to Clark. Johanson read the following \n     statement to Clark:\n       ``That he [Johanson] was instructed by Group Manager Jon \n     Clark on February 10, 1994, that he was not going to be \n     participating in the undercover operation at LAFO [Los \n     Angeles Field Office] and that he should return the \n     undercover weapon he had at the next firearms \n     qualification.''\n       [See Attachment 4, page 1]\n       Johanson informed Clark that he had no recollection of \n     receiving this instruction from Clark and asked Clark if he \n     could recall giving it. This is how Clark responded to the \n     news:\n       ``I was astonished and confounded by this statement. I \n     asked him to re-read the statement. I said I have no idea how \n     or why that statement was in the letter. I said I had no \n     recollection of providing him those instructions nor had I \n     any recollection of saying that to anyone. Moreover, I was \n     not aware of the fact that he had an undercover weapon.''\n       [See Attachment 4, page 1]\n       Clark told Johanson that he would check his calendar for \n     the date of February 10, 1994 to verify whether he was at the \n     meeting in the Van Nuys Resident Agency office as reported by \n     Walinski. In checking his calendar, he discovered that he was \n     not in the Van Nuys office that day. Instead, he spent that \n     entire day at the El Segundo Resident Agency office on other \n     business with both Young and Smith [Smith and Young later \n     confirm the fact. Smith and Young were the SAC and ASAC in \n     the Los Angeles Field Office].\n       Following the phone conversation with Johanson, Clark \n     contacted Smith and Young in the Los Angeles Field Office to \n     inquire about the origins of the assertions in Smith's letter \n     to Johanson. Smith advised Clark that the information on the \n     February 10, 1994 meeting was extracted for Walinski's \n     ``internal'' report of investigation (ROI). At that point, \n     Clark assured Smith that ``he had not provided a statement on \n     this investigation.'' Clark asked Smith to double-check the \n     ROI ``to be sure that was no mistake.'' Smith re-checked the \n     ROI and ``advised me that there was a DCIS Form 1, Report of \n     Interview of me.''\n       Clark denied again that he was ever interviewed by \n     Walinski. This is what he said to Smith:\n       ``I was perplexed. I advised SAC Smith that I had no \n     recollection of this report being taken and asked that I be \n     permitted to read it to refresh my recollection. He said no. \n     . . . I informed SAC Smith that these were facts that I not \n     only did not say--but information I did not know. . . . I \n     could not corroborate the statement attributed to me in SAC \n     Smith's letter to Johanson. . . . I cannot believe I made \n     those statements since I had no specific knowledge of those \n     facts. The statements appear to be factually inaccurate, and \n     therefore would not have been stated by me.''\n       [See Attachment 4, page 1-2]\n       About a week later--on July 5, 1994--Mr. Michael D. \n     Litterelle [Firearms Coordinator] informed Clark that he had \n     a copy of Walinski's ROI, and Litterelle actually gave Clark \n     a copy of Walinski's form 1 Witness Interview of Clark. After \n     reading it, Clark stated:\n       ``I read the interview and found it contained statements \n     that were attributed to me that I knew were untrue. . . . I \n     never made this statement.''\n       [See Attachment 4, page 3]\n       The exact distribution of the joint Bonner-Clark statement \n     is unknown. However, since it was ``solicited'' by Bonner, \n     the Assistant Director of internal affairs, it would not be \n     unreasonable to assume that Hollingsworth--the director--and \n     other DCIS managers knew about it and actually saw it.\n     Supervisor Challenges Walinski's Report\n       Several weeks after the Bonnar/Clark complaint, another \n     formal complaint about Walinski's report was submitted to \n     Hollingsworth's office. This one was signed on August 4, 1994 \n     by ASAC Young in the Los Angeles Field Office. It contained a \n     detailed, line-by-line commentary on inaccuracies in \n     Walinski's interview of Young along with highly critical \n     comments on Walinski's interviews of Clark and Shiohama on \n     the same date [March 2, 1994].\n       Young stated that he was ``somewhat shocked'' after reading \n     Walinski's report. He stated that Walinski's report contained \n     statement that were misleading, ``wrong''\n\n[[Page S13653]]\n\n     and ``inaccurate.'' He said that Walinski attributed \n     statements to him that he never made.\n       After alluding to the ``significant discrepancies'' in \n     Walinski's interview of Clark, Young reports that Shiohama \n     had advised him that ``there were subject areas in the report \n     or statements that he had not discussed with SA Walinski. \n     Shiohama stated that the last paragraph of his interview was \n     totally inaccurate.'' However, both Young and Shiohama \n     insisted that portions of their interviews appeared to \n     accurately reflect what they had said to Walinski.\n     Appeal to Management About Walinski's Reports\n       In asking Hollingsworth to examine the discrepancies in \n     Walinski's report, Young makes an appeal to senior management \n     on behalf of rank and file agents:\n       ``I am not trying to cause you or Matt [Walinski] problems. \n     But in this situation I am caught in the middle. I have \n     agents that are in the process of being disciplined and based \n     on what I know now the recommended disciplinary actions may \n     be based on incomplete and inaccurate information. The agents \n     throughout the Field Office know this and are now finding \n     fault with management for not taking some type of action to \n     have this situation re-evaluated.''\n       [See Attachment 5, Note from Young to Hollingsworth]\n       Young's report was officially moved up the chain of \n     command--to the top. Young forwarded it to Bonnar who, in \n     turn, submitted it to Hollingsworth, and Dupree--Mr. \n     Mancuso's Deputy. However, during an interview on September \n     14, 1999, Mancuso denied having knowledge of the allegation \n     that the Clark interview was fabricated until recently or \n     August 1999.\n     FLEOA Letter\n       Young's formal complaint to Hollingsworth about Walinski's \n     inaccurate reports was followed almost immediately by a \n     formal complaint from another source.\n       During the adjudication phase of the stolen gun case, \n     Johnson was represented by an attorney with the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), Luciano A. Cerasi--\n     the same lawyer who represented Steakley in the tax evasion \n     case.\n       In a letter to Dupree, dated August 8, 1994, regarding the \n     Johanson case, Cerasi raised the possibility that Walinski \n     had falsified his report of investigation. Cerasi's letter \n     contains this explosive allegation:\n       ``It is questionable whether SA Walinski even interviewed \n     SA Clark.''\n       Cerasi also raised questions about why five weeks elapsed \n     between the dates on which Walinski conducted the disputed \n     interviews and the final dates on the interview reports. \n     Cerasi suggested that this delay violated DCIS policy \n     requiring that witness reports be completed and finalized \n     within 3 working days of the investigative activity. Cerasi \n     characterized Walinski's report as a ``shabby investigative \n     effort'' that would only serve to demonstrate to other agents \n     that in DCIS ``justice is unattainable.''\n       [See Attachment 6, pages 3-4]\n     Attempted DCIS Coverup Possible\n       Initially, DCIS management may have tried to put a lid on \n     the groundswell of adverse information on Walinski's reports \n     that began to surface in mid-1994. First, there were \n     complaints from rank and file agents--Clark, Young, and \n     Shiohama--in July and August 1994. Those were followed \n     immediately by the FLEOA letter. A month later--in September \n     1994--FLEOA filed a second complaint with management. This \n     one concerned allegations that Walinski had fabricated the \n     Gianino interview.\n       The sworn statement signed jointly by Bonnar and Clark \n     alludes to a possible attempt by DCIS management to keep a \n     lid on all the complaints about Walinski's reports:\n       ``On July 8, 1994, ASAC Young advised me that HQ [DCIS \n     Headquarters] had decided that they would wait and not raise \n     the issue regarding my discrepant interview unless it was \n     raised by SA Johanson. I [Clark] expressed concern that this \n     may be released to agents and that they may conclude that I \n     fabricated this story and it would therefore discredit me. I \n     was informed that the information was controlled in its \n     release.''\n       [See Attachment 4, pages 2-3]\n       On August 9, 1999, the staff contacted the DOD IG with this \n     question: ``Who at DCIS made this decision?'' The following \n     answer was provided on September 30, 1999: ``We have not been \n     able to determine who, if anyone, made this alleged \n     decision.''\n     Re-Investigation\n       As a result of all the complaints. DCIS management \n     eventually made a decision to launch a re-investigation of \n     the Johanson stolen gun case. The re-investigation was \n     conducted by SA Timothy L. Shroeder from August 10, 1994 \n     until October 5, 1994.\n       Unfortunately, the re-investigation was conducted in a \n     complete vacuum--as if the entire matter had never been \n     investigated by Walinski.\n       It is easy to understand why DCIS needed to go back to \n     square one and re-examine all the facts bearing on the stolen \n     weapon. The second investigation had to be impartial and \n     independent after Walinski was accused of falsifying \n     information contained in the original investigation. At the \n     same time, DCIS management had a responsibility and an \n     obligation to determine whether Walinski had falsified his \n     report--as alleged by rank and file agents. Unfortunately, \n     there was no attempt to reconcile the facts contained in \n     Walinski's report of investigation with the facts developed \n     in the re-investigation. In fact, the agent in charge of the \n     re-investigation--Shroeder--received specific instructions to \n     steer clear of the disputed interviews. Hollingsworth gave \n     him these instructions: The ``new investigation should be \n     conducted without reviewing the results of the previous \n     interviews.''\n       [See Attachment 7]\n       Clearly, Shroeder needed to avoid the pitfalls created in \n     first investigation, but management should have assigned \n     another agent to examine the allegations made about \n     Walinski's report. If Walinski bungled his investigation and \n     the case had to be re-investigated, then DCIS management \n     should have determined exactly where and how Walinski's \n     investigation deviated from accepted standards. All the \n     complaints from rank and file agents and the FLEOA attorney \n     required nothing less than that.\n     New Charges\n       Based on the re-investigation, Smith recommended that \n     Johanson be suspended without pay for 10 calendar days. \n     Smith's second Notice of Proposed Suspension was dated \n     November 23, 1994. Smith charged Johanson with violating two \n     sections of the Special Agents' Manual: (1) Failing to \n     exercise ``utmost caution'' in storing a firearm at his \n     residence; and (2) Storing a weapon at his residence while \n     away from his assigned office for an extended time.\n       [See attachment 8, pages 1-2]\n       In the final notice on suspension, dated February 9, 1995, \n     Durpee suspended Johanson for 3 calendar days, beginning on \n     February 15, 1995.\n       [See attachment 9]\n     Need for Investigation Questioned\n       It's difficult to understand why DCIS would suspend an \n     agent for losing a gun that was stolen from his home during a \n     burglary. The staff checked with other federal law \n     enforcement authorities to determine how similar cases have \n     been handled in the past. Under normal circumstances, they \n     suggested that a routine administrative inquiry would be \n     conducted. Once it was determined that the firearm was stolen \n     during a burglary and the theft was duly reported to the \n     proper authorities, the entire matter would be dropped.\n     Walinsky ``Disciplined'' for Bungled Investigation\n       On July 20, 1999 and again on August 4, 1999, Ms. Jane \n     Charters was interviewed regarding her knowledge of personnel \n     actions taken against Walinski in the wake of the bungled \n     Johanson investigation.\n       Ms. Charters is currently the Director of the Investigative \n     Support Branch at DCIS--the same position she occupied in \n     1994 during the Johanson and Steakley investigations. She \n     exercises personnel responsibilities in DCIS.\n       During the first interview of July 20, 1994, Charters \n     stated that as a result of mistakes in stolen gun case \n     investigations, DCIS ``lost confidence'' in Walinski and \n     transferred him out of internal affairs and into her office. \n     In the new position, Walinski was no longer conducting \n     internal investigations. Instead, he was to be responsible \n     for DCIS training, physical fitness and security. Charters \n     also reported that Walinski was issued a letter of reprimand \n     that was placed in his file--a fact that was confirmed by \n     Bonnar during an interview on July 12, 1999.\n     Walinski's Personnel File\n       On two occasions in July--July 7th and again on July 23, \n     1999, the Majority Staff examined Walinski personnel file to \n     determine if the disciplinary actions taken against him for \n     his mistakes in Johanson investigation--as described by \n     Charters and others--were accurately reflected in performance \n     ratings and other personnel actions in his file.\n       The Majority Staff found no evidence that Walinski was ever \n     disciplined for the failed Johanson gun case. Quite to the \n     contrary, the available evidence suggests Walinski was \n     actually rewarded for what happened.\n       Here is what the Majority Staff found in his file:\n\n                  Employee Performance Rating--1993/94\n\n       For the rating period August 26, 1993 to March 31, 1994, \n     Walinski received an ``outstanding'' rating.\n       The outstanding rating applied to the period of time when \n     Walinski conducted two investigations--Steakley and \n     Johanson--where the accuracy of his reports were later \n     questioned. In fact, the rating period included the date--\n     March 2, 1994--on Walinski claims he conducted interviews \n     with Young, Clark, and Shiohama. Those reports of interview \n     were later characterized as false, misleading and inaccurate \n     by the agents involved and the FLEOA attorney. The Gianino \n     interview occurred on May 21, 1993--just prior to the \n     beginning of the rating period, but considerable \n     investigative activity on the Steakley case occurred during \n     his rating period.\n       The rating officials offered this comment: ``Walinski \n     continues to excel in every aspect of his job. He is a very \n     valued employee of DCIS.'' The outstanding rating was \n     approved by Bonnar and the Director of internal affairs, \n     Hollingsworth, on April 15, 1994--the exact same day that \n     Hollingsworth forwarded Walinski's completed report of \n     investigation on the Johanson case to Dupree.\n       [See attachment 10]\n\n               Incentive Award Nomination--Recommendation\n\n       On April 25, 1994, Hollingsworth recommended that Walinski \n     receive a performance award of $1,200.00 to accompany the\n\n[[Page S13654]]\n\n     ``outstanding'' rating he received for the period August 1993 \n     to March 1994--the same period when he conducted witness \n     interviews in the Johanson case that were later characterized \n     as false, inaccurate and misleading.\n       [See attachment 11]\n\n                       Previous Cash Award--1993\n\n       The form used to recommend the $1,200.00 performance award \n     also noted that Walinski had not received any other \n     performance awards in the preceding 52 weeks. His personnel \n     file indicates otherwise. He received a ``Special Act or \n     Service Award'' of $2,000.00 on May 2, 1993--several weeks \n     before his fabricated interview with Gianino on May 21, 1993.\n       [See Attachments 11 & 12]\n\n                    Special Performance Rating--1994\n\n       This a special rating given to Walinski immediately before \n     his sudden transfer out of internal affairs and into the \n     Investigative Support Directorate. It was the last rating he \n     received for his work in internal affairs and covered a \n     ``shortened rating period'' of April 1, 1994 through July 2, \n     1994. This rating period includes the date on which Walinski \n     finalized the report of investigation on the Johanson case--\n     April 15, 1994. The closing date for this reporting period--\n     July 2, 1994--came one day before his move to Charters' \n     office and just four days before the first known written \n     complaint about Walinski's false and inaccurate reports \n     reached DCIS Headquarters in Washington.\n       Bonnar and Hollingsworth gave him a ``fully successful'' \n     rating, but for unexplained reasons, took over three months \n     to approve it. It was finally signed on October 12, 1994. \n     Walinski's other ratings were approved quickly--within two \n     weeks of the end of the rating period.\n       [See Attachment 12].\n       DCIS says the delay was due to ``an administrative \n     oversight.''\n       Walinski stated August 2, 1999 that this is the rating \n     where ``he took a hit'' for his mistakes in the Johanson \n     case. The language in the performance rating documents seemed \n     to support Walinski's assessment:\n       ``Unfortunately, during this rating period he failed to \n     show due diligence and accuracy in reporting the results of \n     some interviews with regard to one administrative inquiry. \n     This one shortfall in SA Walinski's performance is not \n     typical of the otherwise high quality and professional level \n     of his work.''\n       [See Attachment 13, pages 3-4]\n       when Bonnar and Hollingsworth signed this document in \n     October 1994, they had already received the allegations about \n     Walinski's false reports on the Steakley tax evasion case. \n     For that reason, the reference to ``accuracy of reporting'' \n     in just one internal investigation does not appear to square \n     with the facts.\n\n                              Reassignment\n\n       Walinski's personnel records indicate that his transfer \n     from internal affairs to the Investigative Support Branch \n     became effective on July 3, 1994.\n       [See Attachment 14]\n       As previously reported, Charters suggested during two \n     interviews that DCIS management ``had lost confidence in \n     Walinski'' as an investigator ``and moved him into her \n     office'' as a disciplinary measure. Charters' description of \n     the reasons behind Walinksi's transfer are consistent with \n     those provided by Mancuso during an interview on September \n     14, 1999.\n       Hollingsworth and Walinski, by comparison, provided a \n     completely different set of reasons behind the July 1994 \n     move.\n       During an interview on August 24, 1994, Holllingsworth \n     suggested that the move was not taken for disciplinary \n     reasons: ``It was for his health.'' He said Walinki ``blew'' \n     the Johnason case because ``he was totally stressed out.'' \n     Hollingsworth feared he might ``have a heart attack.''\n       Walinski meaintains that the transfer was driven by routine \n     considerations.\n       During an interview on September 8, 1999, he gave the \n     following reasons for the move: (1) There was an attractive \n     opening in Charters' organization; (2) The opening offered \n     him some growth potential into a management position in the \n     future; (3) He had completed his planned 3-year tour of duty \n     in internal affairs; and (4) He had a plan for addressing the \n     training deficiencies in Charters' Directorate. When asked if \n     there was any other reasons for the move, he said ``No.''\n       [See Attachment 15, pages 1-2]\n     Walinski Assigned Inspection Duties\n       A personnel document, signed by Bonnar and Hollingsworth on \n     October 12, 1994 suggests that Walinski conduct inspections \n     long after he was reassigned to ``training'' in Charters' \n     office. Along with inquiries of employee misconduct, \n     inspections are the main responsibility of the internal \n     affairs office. This document suggests that Walinski continue \n     to perform, work for the internal affairs office--despite his \n     removal from that office. This document shows that Walinski \n     played a leadership role in various inspections as follows:\n       ``He also worked on the preparation for the Los Angeles FO \n     [field office] inspection. Although the Los Angeles FO \n     inspection was conducted after the end of this special rating \n     period when SA Walinski reported to his new assignment in the \n     Investigative Support Directorate, he returned to assist with \n     the LA inspection and played a significant role by leading \n     inspection efforts in the DCIS offices in Phoenix, Tuscon, \n     Albuquerque, and Honolulu as well as Los Angeles. He worked \n     independently on these inspections without the need for any \n     close supervision.''\n       [See Attachment 13, page 3]\n       During an interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso \n     expressed surprise that Walinski led the inspection of the \n     Los Angeles field office after his reassignment:\n       Mancuso said he had no knowledge of Walinski's involvement \n     in the inspection of the LA Field Office after his transfer. \n     He would be surprised and concerned if true, and said he \n     would be checking on the accuracy of that information.\n     Decision on Inspection Duties Questioned\n       In an information paper provided on September 30, 1999, \n     Mancuso admitted that Walinski was involved in the inspection \n     of the Los Angeles Field Office. However, Mancuso maintains \n     Walinski was kept on the team only ``to train his \n     replacement'' and ``did not participate in the actual \n     inspection.'' Mancuso's statement conflicts with the \n     personnel document signed by Bonnar, Hollingsworth, and \n     Walinski in 1994 referenced above.\n       It is very difficult to understand why Walinski would have \n     been assigned to prepare the inspection report on the Los \n     Angeles Field Office in the wake of all the allegations and \n     complaints flowing from the Johanson case. The re-\n     investigation of the Johanson case, which began in August \n     1944 and was concluded in October 1994, was in progress while \n     Walinski conducted the inspection of the Los Angeles Field \n     Office. That re-investigation was specifically triggered by \n     his disputed interviews of at least three agents assigned to \n     the Los Angeles field Office. Those agents made formal \n     complaints to management about the quality of Walinski's \n     reports. In effect, these agents ``blew the whistle'' on \n     Walinski. Assigning Walinski a leadership role in the Los \n     Angeles Field Office inspection could be viewed as a \n     retaliatory measure, and as such, a very questionable \n     management decision.\n\n                        Performance Award--1994\n\n       On July 24, 1994--exactly three weeks after his transfer \n     from internal affairs into training, Walinski received a cash \n     award of $1,200.00.\n       [See Attachment 16]\n       At our meeting with Charters on August 4, 1997, she offered \n     an explanation for the $1,200.00 cash award--in light of \n     Walinski's mistakes on the Johanson case. She suggested that \n     it was given for the rating period August 26, 1993 through \n     March 31, 1994--``before the problem arose over the Johanson \n     gun case.''\n       Charters' explanation is not supported by the facts. The \n     facts cited below clearly indicate that DCIS management was \n     aware of the complaints about Walinski's report at least \n     three weeks before Walinski received the cash award:\n\n       --The rating period for which the cash award was given \n     included the date--March 2, 1994--on which Walinski conducted \n     interviews of agents that were later characterized as false, \n     misleading and inaccurate in rank and file complaints to \n     management;\n       --Management claims that Walinski was transferred from \n     internal affairs into training on July 3, 1994 as a \n     disciplinary measure for the mistakes he made in the Johanson \n     case. This indicates that management knew about the \n     allegations prior to that date;\n       --Walinski admitted that he received a reprimand for making \n     ``administrative errors'' in his report on the Johanson case \n     while still assigned to internal affairs--or prior to July 3, \n     1999;\n       --Clark informed DCIS management, beginning on July 6, \n     1994, that Walinski's March 2, 1994 interview of Clark was \n     completely false;\n\n       The facts show that the $1,200.00 cash award given to \n     Walinski on July 24, 1994 came at least three weeks after \n     DCIS management had knowledge that Walinski had falsified \n     reports on the Johanson case.\n\n                               Reprimand\n\n       The staff was never able to locate the letter of reprimand \n     that was placed in Walinski's file, nor was the staff able to \n     establish the exact date on which the reprimand was given.\n       During an interview on July 12, 1999, Walinski's immediate \n     supervisor, Tom Bonnar, stated that he was ``furious'' with \n     Walinski about the Johanson interview statements. He said \n     Walinski ``was verbally and officially reprimanded and a \n     letter was placed in his file.'' Bonnar doubted the reprimand \n     would still be in his personnel file, since it's customary to \n     remove them after a brief period of time.\n       [See Attachment 17, page 2]\n       On September 8, 1999, Walinski confirmed that Bonnar had \n     indeed ``handed him'' a ``letter of caution'' for making \n     ``administrative errors'' on the Johanson case, but he could \n     not remember if he kept it for 30, 60, or 90 days. In a \n     telephone conversation on August 2, 1999, Walinski claimed \n     that ``Bonnar told him to destroy it in the shredder after 30 \n     days.''\n       Walinski also seemed somewhat confused about the actual \n     date of the reprimand. Initially, he suggested that it was \n     dated October 12, 1994. However when it was pointed out that \n     date was the exact day Bonnar and Hollingsworth approved his \n     last performance evaluation for internal affairs, he \n     suggested that October 12, 1994 might have seen the day he \n     destroyed the letter of reprimand. Mr. Walinski seemed \n     certain of one fact: he received the reprimand while still in \n     internal\n\n[[Page S13655]]\n\n     affairs. This statement is consistent with statements by \n     Charters and Mancuso that the reprimand was issued before \n     July 3, 1994.\n       [See Attachment 15, page 2]\n     Walinski's Rebuttal\n       Walinski has a simple explanation for the inaccuracies in \n     his report of investigation on the Johanson stolen gun case. \n     His explanation was given during testimony to McClelland on \n     February 14, 1997 and confirmed in a telephone conversation \n     on August 2, 1999.\n       He claims it was a clerical error. In a nutshell, this is \n     his explanation:\n       ``The headers got switched. The wrong headers ended up on \n     the Form 1 interview sheet. I said that one guy said one \n     thing when I said another guy said another thing. This \n     happened when the interviews got typed up. We had a secretary \n     that wasn't a top quality individual. She typed them up \n     wrong. . . . But it was my mistake.''\n       [See Attachment 18, interview, 2/14/97, pages 74-75, and \n     telephone interview 8/2/99]\n       During an interview on September 8, 1999, Walinski offered \n     a similar explanation:\n       ``It was an administrative error. I roughed out the form 1 \n     interview reports on my computer and gave my write up to a \n     secretary. The secretary got the headers mixed up and \n     switched some paragraphs.''\n       [See Attachment 15, page 2]\n       Walinski's explanation is highly questionable for two \n     reasons: 1) if the Clark interview never took place--as Clark \n     stated, then how could Clark's name end up on a Form 1 \n     ``header'' that was only inadvertently ``switched''? Clark's \n     name not should not have appeared on the radar screen; And 2) \n     Both Young and Shiohama contend that portions of their \n     interviews were true and accurate. If portions of the Young \n     and Shiohama interviews were true and accurate, then how \n     could the incorrect portions of their interviews involved \n     ``switched headers''?\n       Furthermore, Walinski states that he prepared his write-ups \n     of the interviews on a computer and transferred them to a \n     clerk typist to be finalized. That being the case, a mix up \n     of headers seems improbable.\n     Walinski rule\n       Following the Johanson investigation, DCIS management \n     instituted investigative reforms, including the so-called \n     ``Walinski rule.'' Under this rule, all interviews have to be \n     recorded and transcripts reviewed and verified by witnesses.\n     Management Backs Up Walinski\n       During an official DOD IG interview by McClelland on March \n     13, 1997, both Dupree and Mancuso attempted to diminish the \n     significance of the allegations that Walinski had falsified \n     his reports on the Johanson case. They seemed to accept the \n     `'wrong headers'' excuse used by Walinski.\n       McClelland questioned Dupree on March 13, 1997 about \n     ``Walinski's ability as an investigator'' and problems with \n     regard to ``factual inaccuracies'' in his reports. During the \n     course of that interview, Dupree offered Walinski's ``wrong \n     header'' excuse. This is what Dupree said:\n       ``Matt's [Walinski] probably one of the most capable \n     investigators I know. It wasn't factual inaccuracies. It was \n     in the deliberation of putting a lot of statements together. \n     Unfortunately, some of the comments that were made by \n     individuals were transposed to other individuals. The \n     statements and the facts were absolutely correct. They were \n     just attributed to the wrong person.''\n       [See Attachment 18, interview, 3/13/97, pages 45-46]\n       During an interview on March 13, 1997, McClelland asked \n     Mancuso if he ever got ``any word from Bill Dupree about \n     inaccuracies in the report of investigation that Walinski \n     prepared.'' Although McClelland appeared to be asking about \n     the Steakley report, Mancuso's response seems to address the \n     Johanson case. Mancuso also accepted the ``switched headers'' \n     excuse:\n       ``No. Again, I'm a little bit fuzzy because we had one or \n     two instances where Matt [Walinski] on different cases which \n     were in the same area, where Matt had inaccurately attributed \n     certain remarks--had confused witnesses' names in his notes. \n     But I don't recall any inaccuracies involving Steakley. . . . \n     Gary [Steakley] was saying Walinski's responsible for other \n     cases that are now suspect because of inaccuracies. . . .''\n       [See Attachment 18, interview, 3/13/97, pages 25-46]\n     Management's Knowledge of Allegations\n       The testimony given by Dupree and Mancuso to McClelland on \n     March 13, 1997 clearly indicates that senior management at \n     DCIS was aware of the allegations about Walinski's falsified \n     report on the Johanson case.\n       Rank and file complaints about Walinski's false and \n     misleading reports went right to the top at Headquarters as \n     follows:\n\n       --On July 19, 1994, Agent Clark signed a sworn statement, \n     alleging that Walinski had falsified his report [based on \n     complaints received from Johanson on July 6, 1994]; Clark's \n     statement was ``solicited'' and witnessed by Bonnar, the \n     Assistant Director of Internal Affairs and Walinski's \n     immediate supervisor; A document indicates that DCIS \n     headquarters was aware of this complaint on or about July 8, \n     1994;\n       --On August 4, 1994, ASAC Young in the Los Angeles Field \n     Office formally complained to Hollingsworth about Walinski's \n     false and inaccurate reports of interview with agents Young, \n     Clark, and Shiohama; Young reports that rank and file agents \n     are ``finding fault with management for not taking some type \n     of action to have this situation re-evaluated;'' \n     Hollingsworth forwarded Young's formal complaint to Mancuso's \n     Deputy, Dupree;\n       --On August 8, 1994, FLEOA addressed a formal complaint to \n     Dupree, alleging that Walinski falsified his report of \n     investigation;\n       --On August 10, 1994, management launched a re-\n     investigation of the Johanson case based on rank and file \n     complaints about Walinski's reports;\n     Mancuso's Knowledge of Allegations\n       Mancuso's broad responsibilities for internal \n     investigations suggest that he would have been informed \n     immediately of rank and file complaints about the integrity \n     of an ongoing inquiry. Testimony and statements indicate that \n     Mancuso was kept up-to-date on the progress of all ongoing \n     internal investigations. Mancuso's responsibilities as DCIS \n     Director--and the DCIS person chiefly responsible ``for \n     staffing and direction for the conduct of internal \n     investigations''--meant that he would have been informed \n     about the controversy over the Walinski report on the \n     Johanson case and would have been involved in the decision to \n     re-investigate the case and reassign Walinski to Charters' \n     office.\n       During an interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso was \n     questioned about his knowledge and awareness of the \n     allegations about Walinski's reports. This is what Mancuso \n     said:\n       Mancuso admitted that he knew about ``the problems of \n     Walinski's reporting'' on the Johanson case back in 1994, but \n     he contends that he was unaware of the allegations that \n     Walinski had fabricated the Clark interview in its entirety \n     ``until a few weeks ago'' or in August 1999.\n       Mancuso said that Walinski was given a reprimand and \n     transferred [in July 1994] because of rank and file \n     complaints, of which he was aware, about the credibility of \n     the work being performed by the internal affairs office. He \n     said the ``transfer and reprimand were the culmination of \n     several negative reports on Walinski.'' As a result of these \n     complaints, policy changes--like the need to record and \n     verify interviews--were put in place--and the Johanson case \n     was re-investigated.\n       Mancuso insisted that he ``did not know about the extent of \n     Walinski's mistakes.'' He claims that as DCIS Director, he \n     normally ``did not get beyond that level of detail,'' though \n     he admitted he got deeply involved with the Steakley case \n     because of the lack of progress in the investigation.\n       [See attachment 19, page 1]\n     Decision to Re-Open Case\n       The directive that re-opened the Johanson case was dated \n     September 23, 1994. This memo suggests that DCIS managers \n     were aware of rank and file complaints about Walinski's \n     report.\n       The memo states that the Johanson case was re-opened \n     ``after allegations of discrepancies were made concerning the \n     original interviews.'' It also states that Charters and \n     Hollingsworth directed the assigned agent [Schroeder] ``to \n     conduct an independent inquiry concerning the circumstances \n     surrounding'' Johanson's stolen firearm.\n       [See attachment 7]\n     Legal Questions about Walinski's Reports\n       There seems to be a consensus within DCIS that Walinski's \n     reports on the Steakley and Johanson were ``inaccurate.'' \n     DCIS thinking seems to suggest that Walinski's reports might \n     have carelessly deviated from the facts, or he may have \n     misinterpreted a statement. He was just mistaken or careless. \n     Or as Walinski put it, he just made ``administrative \n     errors.''\n       During an interview on July 12, 1999, Bonnar characterized \n     Walinski's reports this way:\n       ``The statements in Walinski's reports were inaccurate and \n     not falsified.''\n       [See attachment 17, page 2]\n       Mr. John Kennan, the current Director of DCIS, was \n     interviewed on August 4, 1999. He indicated that he was well \n     aware of all the adverse information on Walinski's reports in \n     August 1994, but he attempted to minimize the significance of \n     the problem. He said those reports were not a concern \n     because:\n       ``Walinski's inaccurate reports did not affect the outcome \n     of the investigation.''\n       McClelland offered a similar view in an interview with OSC \n     on November 5, 1997:\n       ``Walinski had been inconsistent and inaccurate in his \n     report on the tax issue (regarding Gianino's testimony) but \n     that it was not harmful. Walinski was just a sloppy \n     investigator.''\n       [See Attachment 20]\n       The staff believes that Walinski's reports of interview \n     with Gianino and Clark and his sworn testimony to McClelland \n     regarding these matters in 1997 went far beyond simple \n     factual inaccuracies. The staff believes that Walinski \n     invited or fabricated information contained in those reports \n     for the following reasons:\n       First, both Gianino and Clark deny that they were ever \n     interviewed by Walinski; they deny making the statements \n     attributed to them by Walinski; and both deny any knowledge \n     of the facts attributed to them by Walinski.\n       Second, it is possible to independently verify certain \n     inaccuracies in Walinski's reports.\n       --In Gianino's case, Walinski stated ``very shortly after \n     her [Gianino's] discussions with Steakley she became very ill \n     and was off\n\n[[Page S13656]]\n\n     work for an extended period of time.'' Walinski later \n     explained that ``she had cancer really bad, ovarian cancer.'' \n     Gianino's official leave records clearly indicate that she \n     had no ``extended illness'' as reported by Walinski. In fact, \n     she was shocked when told that Walinski had testified in \n     1997--under oath--that she had ovarian cancer. She stated: \n     ``That statement is not true.''\n       --In Clark's case, Walinski stated that Clark had made \n     statements, which Clark said he never made, at a meeting, \n     which Clark said he never attended. Clark's appointment \n     calendar shows that he did not attend the meeting at the DCIS \n     office identified by Walinski. Instead, he spent that entire \n     day at another DCIS office with two other supervisory \n     agents--Young and Smith--who both subsequently confirmed that \n     fact.\n       DCIS officials also contend that even if Walinski's reports \n     contained false information, that information was ``not \n     harmful.'' For example, what difference does it make if \n     Gianino did not have an ``extended illness' as reported by \n     Walinski. They argued that the questionable facts generated \n     by Walinski did not affect the outcome of the investigation.\n       The level of danger or harm caused by a false statement is \n     not a valid standard for determining whether the law was \n     violated.\n       Under the law--18 USC 1001--a person who deliberately makes \n     false statements could be convicted of a felony and sent to \n     prison for up to five years. The law does not make exceptions \n     for the extent of damage or harm caused by a false statement. \n     In fact, a court decision specifically suggests the false \n     statements need not involve loss or damage to the government \n     [U.S. v. Fern, C.A. 11 (Fla.) 1983, 696 F.2d 1269].\n       Furthermore, the staff would argue that Walinski's false \n     reports did, in fact, cause damage.\n       First, Walinski's reports undermined the integrity and \n     credibility of the investigative process at DCIS--the Defense \n     Department's criminal investigative arm.\n       Second, Walinski's reports damage the reputations of two \n     fellow agents--Steakley and Johanson. Walinski's false \n     reports formed the foundation for charges that were \n     eventually made against both individuals. According to \n     Steakley, those reports caused Steakley and Johanson and \n     their families to incur considerable legal expenses and \n     mental anguish.\n     Other Cases\n       During the course of the inquiry into the Steakley and \n     Johanson cases, the majority Staff received allegations from \n     a current and a former DCIS agent that Walinski had falsified \n     reports during two other internal investigations, but the \n     staff was unable to investigate and substantiate those \n     allegations.\n     Conclusion\n       Based on a thorough review of all documents bearing on the \n     Steakley and Johanson cases, it is crystal clear that senior \n     DCIS management, including Mancuso, were aware of the \n     allegations about Walinski's witness reports. Although \n     management made certain administrative adjustments in the \n     wake of rank and file complaints about Walinski's reports, \n     management never attempted to determine if those allegations \n     had merit. Management never attempted to reconcile Walinski's \n     reports with the facts. Independent interviews of Gianino and \n     Clark would have quickly established the fact that Walinski \n     had fabricated at least two witness interviews. This very \n     simple step would have led to appropriate corrective action. \n     Instead, the record shows that Walinski was never \n     disciplined. In fact, the record shows that Walinski actually \n     was given a cash award--at least three weeks after management \n     began receiving rank and file complaints about the accuracy \n     of his reports.\n\n                       Stealkey Case--Attachments\n\n       (1) Report of Investigation--Administrative Inquiry 91, May \n     1993, with witness interviews and other documents\n       (2) McClelland interviews located in Subcommittee and OSC \n     files; Testimony dates and pages cited; Including tape \n     transcriptions\n       (3) Letter from Steakley's tax attorney, John T.

Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n         Courts, Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing regarding the inquiry of \n     your Subcommittee into certain personnel cases in the Defense \n     Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS). Your letter of \n     September 27, 1999, invited the Office of Inspector General \n     (OIG) to provide a written response based on my interview by \n     your staff on September 14, 1999. I understand that this \n     response will be attached to any final report that you may \n     issue.\n       In your letter you state that I was allowed the opportunity \n     to review the factual findings of your staff. I respectfully \n     disagree with that assertion. I have not been given an \n     opportunity to review any written work product, nor did your \n     staff orally share any draft findings. Rather, our meeting \n     consisted of an interview in which I responded to a lengthy \n     series of questions. In light of these facts, the OIG would \n     again request the opportunity to review your final written \n     report and provide comments prior to its release.\n       During my nine-year tenure as Director, DCIS, I supervised \n     approximately 500 investigative personnel at any given time \n     and the conduct of nearly 10,000 defense fraud \n     investigations. I have devoted my life to public service and \n     have proudly served for over 27 years. I am committed to \n     integrity in leadership within the Inspector General \n     community and proud of my investigative and management \n     record.\n       Given my limited understanding of the scope of the inquiry \n     of your Subcommittee, I will in this letter attempt to \n     furnish you with further insight as to the matters in \n     question. My objective in this matter is to provide you with \n     the information you need to accurately assess these cases. \n     Specifically, I will address actions with respect to the \n     handling of DCIS internal review matters involving Special \n     Agents (SA) Hollingsworth, Steakley and Walinski.\n       SA Larry Hollingsworth: SA Hollingsworth was employed by \n     the DCIS from November 1983 until his retirement in September \n     1996. I first met SA Hollingsworth some time after his hiring \n     during which time we were peers, I as Special Agent in Charge \n     (SAC) of the New York Field Office and he as SAC of the \n     Chicago Field Office.\n       In July 1995, I identified a photograph in a law \n     enforcement journal as possibly that of SA Hollingsworth. The \n     unidentified individual was being sought by the Department of \n     State (DoS) relative to the filing of a false passport \n     application. I immediately contacted the DoS and reported my \n     suspicions to them and later assisted the DoS in arranging a \n     surveillance of SA Hollingsworth in anticipation of a search \n     of his home. Following the search, he was immediately barred \n     from the worksite and kept from any active service with this \n     organization. Although he was arrested in July 1995, he was \n     not indicted until January 1996. During those seven months, \n     while the DoS investigation was ongoing, SA Hollingsworth was \n     allowed to use sick leave to the extent verifiable by\n\n[[Page S13657]]\n\n     medical authorities and accumulated annual leave. Subsequent \n     to his indictment, he was suspended without pay and denied \n     further use of leave. He entered a conditional guilty plea in \n     March 1996 and was sentenced in June 1996.\n       During this time period I was involved in a variety of \n     administrative matters in which SA Hollingsworth contested \n     actions proposed by his supervisor. I, as Director, DCIS, at \n     the time was his second level supervisor and acted as \n     deciding official in each of these matters. These \n     administrative actions were separate and distinct from the \n     investigation by the DoS and prosecution by the Department of \n     Justice.\n       My next involvement with this matter began when SA \n     Hollingsworth appealed a Notice of Proposed Removal issued by \n     his supervisor. On August 23, 1996, his attorney requested an \n     extension until September 13, 1996, to file a written \n     response and notified us of his intent to make a subsequent \n     oral presentation. As deciding official, I granted this \n     request consistent with past DCIS practice and, to \n     preclude further delay, I simultaneously scheduled the \n     oral presentation for September 23, 1996. However, four \n     days prior to his scheduled oral presentation, SA \n     Hollingsworth retired.\n       SA Hollingsworth was provided the same due process afforded \n     to all other DCIS special agents in the form of a review by \n     the Special Agents Administrative Review Board and reasonable \n     time to prepare a written and oral response to a Notice of \n     Proposed Removal. Variation from past practice would have \n     been unwarranted and inconsistent with my experience as a \n     deciding official in dozens of disciplinary proceedings.\n       SA Hollingsworth's criminal conduct was both inexcusable \n     and inexplicable. His violation of law was totally out of \n     character and inconsistent with his job performance and \n     lengthy career. I noted this same observation in a letter to \n     the sentencing judge as I went on record describing SA \n     Hollingsworth's job performance.\n       Throughout this process, the OIG was provided advice by \n     personnel and legal experts. The course of action taken in \n     this case was one of the several available options permitted \n     by Federal personnel guidelines.\n       SA Gary Steakley: SA Steakley began his employment with \n     DCIS in December 1987. From that time until he entered the \n     Worker's Compensation program in February 1993 as a result of \n     a traffic accident involving a Government vehicle, he worked \n     in a variety of positions within DCIS. As Director, DCIS, I \n     selected him for several positions and promoted him to his \n     last job as manager of a DCIS investigative office in \n     California.\n       Subsequent to his vehicle accident, SA Steakley was the \n     subject of several adverse personnel and disciplinary \n     actions. With the exception of ensuring that internal reviews \n     proceeded in due course, my actions with respect to SA \n     Steakley were taken as the deciding official in these cases. \n     In addition, as Director, I proposed to involuntarily \n     transfer him in order to ``backfill'' his management billet \n     after his accident. In this case, the then Deputy Inspector \n     General acted as deciding official.\n       SA Steakley was treated fairly by DCIS, although he has \n     repeatedly alleged that he was subjected to prohibited \n     personnel practices. His allegations have been reviewed in \n     various venues, including the Office of Special Counsel who, \n     in December 1998, closed their file and declined to pursue \n     the case further.\n       SA Matthew Walinski: SA Walinski held a variety of \n     positions in DCIS from his initial hiring in August 1987, \n     until his transfer to the Office of Inspector General, \n     Department of the Treasury, earlier this year. Your staff has \n     questioned the accuracy of several reports of interview \n     prepared by SA Walinski to include a report dealing with SA \n     Steakley. It is my understanding that your staff perceives \n     that allegations concerning SA Walinski were not pursued with \n     the same tenacity shown in the SA Steakley investigations.\n       I was not aware of many of the facts alleged in this matter \n     until reviewing documents in response to the inquiry of your \n     Subcommittee. I did, however, have a general concern at the \n     time regarding the handling of internal investigations. As a \n     result, I directed that the internal review process be \n     restructured so as to ensure that all future interviews be \n     taped and transcribed to preclude any further dispute as to \n     reporting. I was also appraised by my deputy that SA Walinski \n     was being transferred from his duties to a position in the \n     DCIS Training Branch. It is my understanding that SA Walinski \n     received a downgraded appraisal as a result of his poor \n     performance as well as a written letter cautioning him as to \n     the importance of accuracy in his reporting.\n       In closing, I hope that my insights have provided you the \n     information you need to accurately assess these cases.

Mr. President, I think it is imperative that Congress \ncontinue to send the strongest possible signal only that the highest \nstandards and integrity are acceptable among our law enforcement and \nwatchdog communities, the more we will ensure that outcome.

I call up my amendment No. 2379 and ask the clerk to \nreport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2379:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. . LABOR AGREEMENT REQUIRED.\n\n       The benefits provided by the amendments made by this Act \n     shall not become available to any country until--\n       (1) the President has negotiated with that country a side \n     agreement concerning labor standards, similar to the North \n     American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (as defined in \n     section 532(b)(2) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 \n     U.S.C. 3471(b)(2)); and\n       (2) submitted that agreement to the Congress.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the amendment has been read in its \nentirety. It is very brief and much to the point. It is similar to the \nNorth American agreement on labor. When we debated NAFTA at length, \nthere was a great deal more participation and attention given. In these \nclosing days, everyone is anxious to get out of town. Most of the \nattention has been given, of course, to the appropriations bills and \nthe budget, and avoiding, as they say, spending Social Security after \nthey have already spent at least $17 billion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had a very interesting experience with \nrespect to labor conditions in Mexico prior to the NAFTA agreement. I \nwanted to see with my own eyes exactly what was going on. I visited \nTijuana, which is right across the line from southern California.\n  I was being led around a valley. There were some 200,000 people \nliving in the valley, with beautiful plants, mowed lawns, flags \noutside. But the 200,000 living in the valley were living in veritable \nhovels; the living conditions were miserable.\n  I was in the middle of the tour when the mayor came up to me and \nasked if I would meet with 12 of the residents of that valley. I told \nhim I would be glad to. He was very courteous and generous.\n  I met with that group. In a few sentences, summing up what occurred, \nthe Christmas before--actually around New Year's--they had a heavy rain \nin southern California and in the Tijuana area. With that rain, the \nhardened and crusted soil became mushy and muddy and boggy, and the \nlittle hovels made with garage doors and other such items started \nslipping and sliding. In those streets, there are no light poles and \nthere are no water lines. There is nothing, just bare existence.\n  They were all trying to hold on to their houses and put them back in \norder. These particular workers missed a day of work. Under the work \nrules in Mexico, if you miss a day of work, you are docked 3 days. So \nthey lost 4 days' pay.\n  Around February, one of the workers was making plastic coat hangers--\nthe industry had moved from San Angelo to Tijuana. They had no eye \nprotection whatsoever. The machines were stamping out the plastic, and \na flick of plastic went into the worker's eye. The\n\n[[Page S13658]]\n\nworkers asked for protection and could not get any. That really teed \nthem off.\n  It came to a crisis on May 1 when the favorite supervisor, a young \nwoman who was expecting at the time, went to the front office. She said \nshe was sick and would have to take off the rest of the day. They said: \nNo, you are not taking off the rest of the day; you are working. Later \nthat afternoon, she miscarried, and that exploded the movement of these \n12 workers. They said: We are not going to stand for this anymore. We \nare going to get some consideration of working conditions and pay.\n  The workers chipped in money and sent two of the folks up to Los \nAngeles to employ a lawyer. They discovered that when the plant moved \nfrom San Angelo to Mexico, they filled out papers showing how the plant \nwas organized and that they had a union and swapped money each month, \nbut no shop steward or union representatives ever met with them. They \nnever knew anything about a union.\n  Under the work rules of the country of Mexico, if one tries to \norganize a plant once one is already organized, then that person is \nsubject to firing, and all 12 of them were fired. They lost their jobs, \ntheir livelihoods. That is what the mayor wanted me to know and \nunderstand. They were out of work.\n  My colleagues talk about the immigration problem. If I had any \nrecommendation for the 12, I would say: Sneak across the border--don't \nworry about it--and find work in California or South Carolina or some \nother place because they could not get a job any longer in the country \nof Mexico.\n  That concerned me, and I have followed the work conditions. That is \none of the reasons with NAFTA, while I opposed it, I wanted to be sure \nwe had the side agreements. The side agreements were established. The \nwork center is in Dallas. The Secretary of Labor meets with them. They \nare trying to work on this problem.\n  I have references to some of the working conditions in El Salvador.\n  On March 13, 1999, five workers from the Doall factory, where Liz \nClaiborne garments are sown, met with a team of graduate students from \nColumbia University who were in El Salvador conducting a study of wage \nrates in relation to basic survival needs.\n\n  A few days later, all five workers were fired. Doall's chief of \npersonnel simply told them: You are fired because you and your friends \ncried before the gringos, and the Koreans don't want unionists at this \nfactory.\n  So much for workers' rights in that Liz Claiborne plant.\n  There are 225 maquila assembly factories in El Salvador, 68,000 \nworkers sending 581 million garments a year to the United States worth \n$1.2 billion. Yet there is not one single union with a contract in any \nof these maquila factories because it is against the law; it is not \nallowed.\n  This is Yolanda Vasquez de Bonilla:\n\n       I was fired from the Doall Factory No. 3 together with 17 \n     others on August 5, 1998.\n       From the beginning, the unbearable working conditions in \n     the factory impressed me a great deal, which included \n     obligatory overtime hours every day of the week, including \n     Saturdays and sometimes Sundays. On alternate days, we worked \n     until 11 p.m., and some weeks we were obligated to work every \n     day until 11 p.m. at night. We were mistreated, including \n     being yelled at and having vulgar words used against us . . . \n     humiliated for wanting to use the restrooms, and being denied \n     permission to visit the Salvadoran Social Security Institute \n     for medical consults.\n       The highest wage I received, working 7 days a week and more \n     than 100 hours, was 1,200 colones (U.S. $137). Nevertheless, \n     I accepted all this that I have briefly narrated since I have \n     two children who are in school and I must support them.\n\n  They go on to tell similar stories time and again about different \nworkers at that plant in El Salvador.\n  With the limited time I have, I will reference the United States firm \nin Guatemala City of Phillips-Van Heusen.\n\n       Van Heusen closed its Camisas Modernas plant in Guatemala \n     City just before its 500 workers were to receive their \n     legally mandated year-end bonuses and go on a three-week \n     break.\n\n  That is typical of what they do if they get any kind of benefits at \nall. Just at the end of the year, when they are supposed to get their \nbonuses, they go down and close the plant.\n\n       Unionist and former Zacapa municipal worker Angel Pineda \n     was ambushed and shot to death March 8 in the village of San \n     Jorge, Zacapa. Pineda was a mayoral candidate nominated by \n     the leftist New Guatemala Democratic Front. According to the \n     Guatemalan Workers Central, Pineda had participated in a \n     campaign to remove Zacapa Mayor Carlos Roberto Vargas on \n     corruption charges. Another union leader and Vargas opponent \n     was shot to death in January.\n\n  Then again in Guatemala:\n\n       A recent U.N. report said poverty encompasses 60 percent of \n     the urban population and 80 percent of rural inhabitants. \n     Figures from the Institute for Economic and Social \n     Investigations of San Carlos University are even more \n     devastating, reporting that 93 percent of the indigenous \n     population lives in poverty and 81 percent cannot meet \n     nutritional needs.\n\n  Mr. President, again:\n\n       Workers from more than a dozen different factories complain \n     about everything from restricted bathroom visits and sore \n     backs to illegal firings and abuse.\n       Sewing machines hum and rock music blares as 13-year-old \n     Maria furiously folds clothes inside a Guatemalan factory \n     called Sam Lucas S.A.\n\n  Maria is a 13-year-old. According to the Wall Street Journal, of \ncourse, that has nothing to do with any employee in the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative or Africa.\n\n       The Grade 2 dropout folds 50 shirts an hour, or 2,700 \n     shirts a week that will end up in North American stores.\n       Sometimes Maria's boss extends her 10-hour day and asks her \n     to stay until 10:30 p.m. or all night, assembling clothes for \n     export in this tax-free plant called a maquila. . . .\n       Forced overtime, union busting, no social security benefits \n     and unpaid work are typical grievances of factory staff, who \n     are mostly young, female, Indian, and poor.\n\n  Mr. President, in Honduras:\n\n       A two-week strike at the Korean-owned Kimi de Honduras \n     maquiladora ended September 2 after they dropped criminal \n     charges against the union and accepted a new pay scale. The \n     strike began August 18 when 500 workers, mostly women, \n     demanded compliance with a March union contract. [This \n     particular plant] produces apparel for U.S. retailer J.C. \n     Penney and is part of the eight-plant Continental Park, a \n     free-trade zone in La Lima. Unionized Kimi workers closed \n     down Continental [in] August with blockades, but anti-riot \n     police arrived August 30. In solidarity, most workers from \n     other factories refused to enter the zone, but were \n     subsequently beaten and gassed by the police. Kimi union \n     officials promptly distributed leaflets to workers of other \n     factories, urging them to return to work and prevent more \n     violence. Some 100,000 workers are employed in the country's \n     200 maquilas, which export $1.6 billion in goods to the \n     United States each year.\n\n  You have the Roca Suppliers Search maquiladora in El Salvador:\n\n       The Roca Suppliers Search maquiladora in the town of \n     Mejicanos was abruptly closed November 19, leaving 240 \n     workers laid off. The workers say production was moved to \n     another factory after a group of 22 workers met with \n     representatives of the progressive union federation. [They \n     really work and make] U.S. brands including Calvin Klein and \n     L.L. Bean. The factory's owner said the shop closed due to a \n     lack of raw materials. Labor activists noted that the \n     termination came just before legally mandated Christmas \n     bonuses. The bonuses average about $40.\n\n  Then again, in El Salvador: They work from Monday through Friday, \nfrom 6:50 a.m. to 6:10 p.m., and on Saturday until 5:40 p.m., and \noccasional shifts to 9:40 p.m. It is common for the cutting and packing \ndepartments to work 20-hour shifts from 6:50 a.m. to 3 a.m.\n\n       Anyone unable or refusing to work the overtime hours will \n     be suspended and fined, and upon repeat ``offenses,'' they \n     will be fired.\n       There is no time clock. Records of an employee's overtime \n     hours are written in a log by the supervisor. Workers report \n     that it is not uncommon to be short changed two hours of \n     overtime if the supervisor is angry with them.\n       There is a one 40-minute break in the day for lunch from \n     noon to 12:40 p.m.\n       All new workers must undergo and pay for a pregnancy test. \n     If they test positive, they are immediately fired. The test \n     costs two days' wages.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this particular group of conditions in \nEl Salvador be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Kathie Lee Sweatshop in El Salvador\n\n\n Caribbean Apparel, S.A. de C.V., American Free Trade Zone, Santa Ana, \n                              El Salvador\n\n       A Korean-owned maquila with 900 plus workers.\n\n     Death threats\n     Workers illegally fired and intimidated\n     Pregnancy tests\n     Forced overtime\n     Locked bathrooms\n     Starvation wages\n     Workers paid 15 cents for every $16.96 pair of Kathie Lee \n           pants they sew\n\n[[Page S13659]]\n\n     Cursing and screaming at the workers to go faster\n     Denial of access to health care\n     Workers fired and blacklisted if they try to defend their \n           rights\n\n       Caribbean Apparel is inaccessible to public inspection. The \n     American Free Trade Zone is surrounded by walls topped with \n     razor wire. Armed guards are posted at the entrance gate.\n     Labels\n       Kathie Lee (Wal-Mart), Leslie Fay, Koret, Cape Cod (Kmart)\n     Sweatshop Conditions at Caribbean Apparel\n       Forced Overtime: 11-hour shifts, 6 days a week--Monday-\n     Friday: 6:50 a.m. to 6:10 p.m. Saturday: 6:50 a.m. to 5:40 \n     p.m. There are occasional shifts to 9:40 p.m. It is common \n     for the cutting and packing departments to work 20-hour \n     shifts from 6:50 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.\n       Anyone unable or refusing to work the overtime hours will \n     be suspended and fined, and upon repeat ``offenses'' they \n     will be fired.\n       There is no time clock. Records of an employee's overtime \n     hours are written in a log by the supervisor. Workers report \n     that it is not uncommon to be short changed two hours of \n     overtime if the supervisor is angry with them.\n       There is a one 40-minute break in the day for lunch from \n     noon to 12:40 p.m.\n       Mandatory Pregnancy Tests: All new workers must undergo and \n     pay for a pregnancy test. If they test positive they are \n     immediately fired. The test costs two days wages.\n       Below Subsistence Wages: The base wage at Caribbean Apparel \n     is 60 cents an hour or $4.79 for the day. This wage meets \n     only \\1/3\\ of the cost of living.\n       Searched On the Way In and Out: Workers are searched on the \n     way in--candy or water is taken away from them which the \n     company says might soil the garments. On the way out, the \n     workers are also searched.\n       The Factory is Excessively Hot: The factory lacks proper \n     ventilation. There are few fans. In the afternoon the \n     temperature on the shop floor soars.\n       No Clean Drinking Water: Only tap water is available, which \n     is dirty and warm. Caribbean Apparel refuses to provide cold \n     purified drinking water.\n       Bathrooms Locked: The workers are not allowed to get up or \n     move from their work sites. The bathrooms are locked from \n     7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., and again from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00. \n     Workers need permission to use the bathroom, which is limited \n     to one visit per morning shift and one during the afternoon \n     shift. The workers report that the bathrooms are filthy.\n       Pressure and Screaming to go Faster: There is constant \n     pressure to work faster and to meet production goals of \n     sewing 100-150 pieces an hour. Mr. Lee, the production \n     supervisor, curses and screams at the women to go faster. \n     Some workers have been hit. For talking back to a supervisor \n     the women are locked in isolation in a room. Most cannot \n     reach their daily production quota and if they do the company \n     arbitrarily raises the goal the next day.\n     Where a Worker Spends Money\n     Rent for two small rooms costs $57.07 per month, or $1.88 a \n           day.\n     The round trip bus to work costs 46 cents.\n     A modest lunch is $1.37.\n\n       At the end of the day sewing Kathie Lee garments a worker \n     is left with just $1.08, which is not even enough to purchase \n     supper for a small family. Unable to afford milk, the \n     workers' children are raised on coffee and lemonade.\n     15 Cents to Sew Kathie Lee Pants\n       The women earn just 15 cents for every pair of $16.96 \n     Kathie Lee pants they sew. That means that wages amount to \n     only \\9/10\\ of one percent of the retail price of the \n     garment. (62 workers on a production line have a daily \n     production quota of sewing 2,000 pairs of Kathie Lee pants \n     each 8-hour shift. 62 workers $4.79 = 296.98/2,000 $16.96 = \n     $33,920/33,920) 296.98 = .0087553/or \\9/10\\ of one percent \n     $16.96 = 15 cents)\n     Denied Access to Health Care\n       Despite the fact that money is deducted from the workers' \n     pay, Caribbean Apparel management routinely prohibits the \n     workers access to the Social Security Health Care Clinic. Nor \n     does the company allow sick days. If a worker misses a day, \n     even with written confirmation from a doctor that she or her \n     child was very sick, she will still be punished and fined two \n     or three days pay.\n       If the workers are seen meeting together, they can be \n     fired. If the workers are seen discussing factory conditions \n     with independent human rights organizations they will be \n     fired. If workers are suspected of organizing a union they \n     will be fired and blacklisted.\n     Fear and Repression--There are No Rights at Caribbean Apparel\n       Fear and repression permeate the factory. The workers have \n     no rights. Everyone knows that they can be illegally fired, \n     at any time, for being unable to work overtime, for needing \n     to take a sick day, for questioning factory conditions or \n     pay, for talking back to a supervisor, or for attempting to \n     learn and defend their basic human and worker rights.\n     Fired for Organizing\n       Six workers have been illegally fired beginning in August \n     for daring to organize a union at Caribbean Apparel. All six \n     workers were elected officials to the new union.\n     List of Fired Workers\n     Blanca Ruth Palacios\n     Lorena del Carmen Hernandez Moran\n     Oscal Humberto Guevara\n     Dalila Aracely Corona\n     Norma Aracely Padilla\n     Jose Martin Duenas\n     Death Threat\n       In September, Jiovanni Fuentes, a union organizer assisting \n     the workers at Caribbean Apparel, received a death threat \n     from the company. He was told that he and his friends should \n     leave the work or they would be killed. He was told that he \n     was dealing with the Mafia, and in El Salvador it costs less \n     than $15 to have someone killed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Kathie Lee/Wal-Mart Sweatshop in Mexico\n\n\n                 Ho Lee Modas de Mexico, Puebla, Mexico\n\n     550 workers\n     The Ho Lee factory sews women's blazers, pants and blouses \n           for Wal-Mart and other labels. Kathie Lee garments have \n           been sewn there.\n     Sweatshop conditions\n       Forced Overtime: 12\\1/2\\ to 14 hour shifts, 6 days a week. \n     Monday to Friday: 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Saturday: 8:00 a.m. \n     to 4:00 p.m.\n       There is one 40-minute break in the day for lunch.\n       The workers are at the factory between 67 and 79 hours a \n     week.\n       New Employees are forced to take a mandatory pregnancy \n     test.\n       For a 48-hour week the workers earn $29.57 or 61 cents an \n     hour which is well below a subsistence wage.\n       Workers are searched on the way in and out of the factory.\n       The supervisors yell and scream at the women to work \n     faster.\n       Bathrooms are filthy and lack toilet seats or paper. The \n     workers have to manually flush the toilet using buckets of \n     water. Some of the toilets lack lighting.\n       14-15-16 year old minors have been employed in the plants.\n       Public access to the plant is prohibited by several heavily \n     armed guards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Kathie Lee/Wal-Mart Sweatshop in Guatemala\n\n\n           San Lucas, S.A., Santiago, Sacatepequez, Guatemala\n\n     1,500 workers\n     The San Lucas factory sews Kathie Lee jackets and dresses.\n     Sweatshop conditions\n       Forced Overtime: 11 to 14\\1/2\\ hour shifts, 6 days a week. \n     Monday to Saturday: 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., sometimes they \n     work until 10:00 p.m. The workers are at the factory between \n     66 and 80 hours a week.\n       Refusal to work overtime is punished with an 8-day \n     suspension without pay. The second or third time this \n     ``offense'' occurs, the worker is fired.\n       Below Subsistence Wages: For 44 regular hours, the pay is \n     $28.57, or 65 cents an hour. This does not meet subsistence \n     needs.\n       Armed security guards control access to the toilets, and \n     check the amount of time the women spend in the bathroom, \n     hurrying them up if they think they are spending too much \n     time.\n       Public access to the plant is prohibited by several heavily \n     armed guards.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, again quoting:\n\n       In September, Jiovanni Fuentes, a union organizer assisting \n     the workers at Caribbean Apparel, received a death threat \n     from the company. He was told that he and his friends should \n     leave work, or they would be killed. He was told that he was \n     dealing with the Mafia, and in El Salvador, it costs less \n     than $15 to have someone killed.\n\n  I could go on and on. Obviously, these working conditions are not to \nthe attention of this particular body. They could care less.\n  Labor conditions are very important. The standard of living in the \nUnited States of America is an issue. When you open up a manufacturing \nplant, it is required that you have clean air, clean water, minimum \nwage, safe working machinery, safe working conditions, plant closing \nnotice, parental leave, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nunemployment compensation. All of these particulars are needed. These \nelevate to the high standard of American living. And it deserves \nprotection. At least it deserves a negotiation--which we included in \nthe NAFTA agreement--in this particular CBI and sub-Saharan agreement.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending amendment \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2428\n\n         (Purpose: To strengthen the transshipment provisions)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2428 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2428.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as I have said before, unless the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act is significantly improved, it will \nfail to stimulate any meaningful growth in Africa; it will fail to \nprovide significant opportunities for commerce or development; and, in \nfact, if we do not make some changes, it may do harm to both Africans \nand Americans. So what this amendment does is take an important step \ntoward preventing harm and improving this trade legislation.\n  Mutually beneficial economic legislation has to be fair to all \nparties involved. The African Growth and Opportunity Act must be \namended to adequately address the problems of transshipment, not just \nto make certain that it is fair to Africans but also to ensure \nAmericans are not cheated and that American law isn't broken.\n  Let me talk a little bit about transshipment. Transshipment occurs \nwhen textiles originating in one country are sent through another \nbefore they come to the United States. What this does is, the actual \ncountry of origin seeks to disguise itself and therefore ignore our \nU.S. quotas. This is not a minor matter. Approximately $2 billion worth \nof illegally transshipped textiles enter the United States every year.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has determined that for every $1 billion of \nillegally transshipped products that enter the United States, 40,000 \njobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost.\n  Let me repeat that.\n  The Customs Service says that every time we have a billion dollars of \nillegally transshipped products entering the United States, we lose \n40,000 jobs in this country in that area of our economy.\n  Failure to protect against transshipment surely does harm. Those who \nthink transshipment isn't going to be a problem in Africa had better \nthink again.\n  We have had a chance to take a look at the official web site of the \nChina Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. It quotes an \nanalyst as follows. This is a direct quote we have on this board. This \nis what they say on the web site:\n\n       Setting up assembly plants with Chinese equipment \n     technology and personnel could not only greatly increase \n     sales in African countries but also circumvent quotas imposed \n     on commodities of Chinese origin by European and American \n     countries.\n\n  That is very explicit and very intentional. The Chinese know standard \nUnited States protections against transshipment are weak, and they \nobviously intend to exploit them.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act, as it currently stands \nwithout my amendment, relies on those same weak protections--the same \ntextile visa system that China and others have successfully manipulated \nin the past. This inadequate system requires government officials in \nthe exporting country to give textiles visas certifying the goods' \ncountry of origin for those textiles to be exported. Too often, this \nisn't good enough; corrupt officials simply sell the visas to the \nhighest bidder.\n  What does this amendment do? This amendment changes this failing \nsystem. It makes U.S. importers responsible for certifying where \ntextiles and apparel are produced. This gives the U.S. entities a \nstrong financial stake in the legality of their imports.\n  This amendment allows us not to rely simply on foreign officials. \nThis standard relies on the American companies that operate right here \nunder American law, and it holds those companies liable for any false \nstatements or omissions in the certification process.\n  This amendment lays out clear procedures and tough penalties so that \nthese regulations will actually work.\n  If the Senate agrees to this amendment, countries such as China that \nwant to evade United States trade regulations will have to rethink \ntheir designs on Africa. If we agree to this amendment, the \nopportunities promised by this legislation really will go to Africans, \nand not to third parties. If we agree to this amendment, Americans will \nnot lose their jobs because of AGOA's inadequate transshipment \nprotection.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2379\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Hollings amendment for two \nreasons.\n  First, as I have stated previously, the goal of this legislation is \nto encourage investments in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. \nThe amendment would undermine that effort by requiring the difficult \nnegotiations of side agreements which would delay the incentive the \nbill would create. That, I argue, is of no help to these developing \ncountries and will not lead to any greater improvement in the labor \nstandards provisions that are already incorporated into these programs. \nVirtually every study available indicates that labor standards rise \nwith a country's level of economic development.\n  The goal of the bill is to give these countries an opportunity to tap \nprivate investment capital as a means of encouraging economic \ndevelopment and economic growth. That is the most certain way to ensure \nthese countries have the ability to enforce any labor standards they \nchoose to enact into law.\n  Frankly, the worst opponent of labor standards is the lack of \neconomic opportunities in these countries. It is difficult to insist on \nsafe working conditions on the job and negotiate a living wage when you \nhave no other job opportunities. The point of this legislation is to \nprovide those job opportunities. Creating obstacles to that goal will \ndiminish, not enhance, the positive impact the bill would have on labor \nstandards.\n  The second reason I oppose the amendment is that it essentially \ndepends on economic sanctions to work. The threat is that the economic \nbenefits of the beneficiary countries will be cut off if the countries \ndo not comply with the terms of some agreement yet to be negotiated. \nThat not only undercuts the investment incentive by increasing the \nuncertainty of a country's participation in the program; it also does \nlittle to raise labor standards.\n  What is needed is a cooperative approach bilaterally between the \nUnited States and the particular developing country and among the \ncountries of the region as a whole.\n  The lesson of the NAFTA side agreement, in my view, is that sanction \nmechanisms have done little to encourage better labor practices. What \nhas worked under the NAFTA agreement is the cooperative ventures of the \nthree participants. What is needed in the context of both regions \ntargeted by this bill is a stronger effort among the participants, with \nthe support of the United States, to tackle common problems facing \ntheir strongest resource--their workforce.\n  The Senate substitute before us does not preclude those sorts of \nconstructive efforts by the President. Indeed, the President would do \nwell to pursue a similar model in the context of our broader relations \nwith our African, Caribbean, and Central American neighbors. The model \noffered by the pending amendment would not, in my judgment, help that \ngoal.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. At the \nappropriate time, I will make a motion to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S13661]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am sort of stunned in a way because \nthe argument is made that this is going to forestall the jobs that are \nintended under the bill.\n  Could it really be that we want to finance 13-year-olds and child \nlabor?\n  Could it be that they have to work 100 hours a week at 13 cents an \nhour?\n  Could it be if they become pregnant and have to go home sick that \nthey are fired?\n  I could go down the list of things.\n  That is what I just pointed out. I am confident my colleagues don't \nwant to finance those kinds of atrocities.\n  I am just stunned that someone would say this would hold it up \nbecause the agreement is yet to be had. The agreement is to be joined \nby the authorities and the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, and the other countries down there in the Caribbean Basin. If \nthey haven't agreed, obviously, they couldn't be in violation, or they \ncouldn't be with the side agreement.\n  That is why it is very innocent language suggesting that the benefits \ndon't take effect until we have had a chance to sit down, both sides, \nand decide what will be agreed to and what will be done by the \nparticular governments. So it would be violations of their own \ngovernment policies.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2483\n\n (Purpose: To require the negotiation, and submission to Congress, of \n    side agreements concerning the environment before benefits are \n                               received)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am not trying to forestall. I am \ntrying to comply with the requirements. I call up my amendment on the \nenvironmental side, and I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2483.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENT REQUIRED.\n\n       The benefits provided by the amendments made by this Act \n     shall not be available to any country until the President has \n     negotiated with that country a side agreement concerning the \n     environment, similar to the North American Agreement on \n     Environmental Cooperation, and submitted that agreement to \n     the Congress.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the emphasis in this Amendment is \nsimilar to the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation.\n  It is the very same thing we required in NAFTA with Mexico and Canada \nwith respect to the Canadian side.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nentitled ``Canadians Challenge California Pollution Rules Under \nNAFTA.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Gazette, (Montreal), Oct. 27, 1999]\n\n       Canadians Challenge California Pollution Rule Under NAFTA\n\n                           (By Andrew Duffy)\n\n       Ottawa.--A Canadian firm has filed a NAFTA environmental \n     complaint against California, charging the state failed to \n     protect its groundwater from leaky gasoline-storage tanks.\n       The unusual move by Vancouver's Methanex Corporation, which \n     produces a gasoline additive being phased out by California, \n     comes in addition to the company's $1.4-billion lawsuit \n     against the state and the U.S. government, an action launched \n     under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n       Methanex argues California's ban on MTBE (methyl tertiary-\n     butyl ether) is unfair because the problem lies not with the \n     gasoline additive, but with aging underground gas storage \n     tanks that leak into aquifers.\n       ``It thus treats a symptom (MTBE) of gasoline leakage \n     rather than the leakage itself, deflecting attention from the \n     state's failure to enforce its environmental laws,'' says the \n     company's environmental complaint, which has just been \n     submitted to the Commission on Environmental Co-operation.\n       The Montreal-based commission was established under a NAFTA \n     side-agreement to ensure Canada, Mexico and the U.S. maintain \n     environmental standards in the face of trade pressures.\n       In its 16-page submission--the first of its kind from a \n     corporation--Methanex contends California has not enforced \n     existing laws designed to protect groundwater from \n     contamination by leaky underground gas tanks.\n       Methanex is North America's largest supplier of MTBE, a \n     gasoline additive that makes fuel burn more completely in a \n     car engine, thus reducing tailpipe emissions.\n       Earlier this year, California Governor Gray Davis issued a \n     regulation that will ban MTBE by 2002 because of concerns \n     that it's polluting lakes and drinking water in the state.\n       ``We believe that what's occurring in California is plain \n     wrong from an environmental perspective,'' said Methanex \n     vice-president Michael Macdonald.\n       ``People have lost sense of the plotline: that MTBE only \n     gets into the environment through gasoline releases. We're \n     trying to focus attention on the root cause of the issue, \n     which is leaking underground storage tanks.''\n       California has the strictest air-quality controls in North \n     America. As part of those controls, oil-refiners in the state \n     were required to improve their gasolines during the 1990s; \n     many turned to MTBE to cut emissions.\n       But California researchers now say MTBE is so highly \n     soluble--more so than other gas components--that it travels \n     far from the source of gas leaks to pollute groundwater.\n       MTBE contamination has forced the closing of wells in Santa \n     Monica, Lake Tahoe, Sacramento and Santa Clara, according to \n     a state auditor's report issued last year. The same report \n     said evidence from animal studies suggests the chemical \n     compound may be a human carcinogen.\n       Methanex has notified the U.S. government it will seek \n     damages under NAFTA's Chapter 11, which gives corporations \n     the right to sue governments if they make decisions that \n     unfairly damage their interests.\n       Company officials said yesterday they're about to enter \n     discussions on an out-of-court settlement with the U.S. State \n     Department.\n       American companies have used Chapter 11 to challenge \n     Canadian laws that restricted the use of another gasoline \n     additive, MMT; banned the export of PCBs; and halted the \n     export of fresh water from British Columbia.\n       The only case to be settled--the one that involved MMT--\n     cost Canadian taxpayers $20 million.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Similarly, I have an article about the side deals to \nthe trade agreement giving labor and environmental issues a new form of \nsignificance that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 29, 1998]\n\n                          A Vision Unfulfilled\n\n                           (By Karen Brandon)\n\n       The new pier's long, crooked finger points deep into the \n     Caribbean Sea near the fragile coral reef off the coast of \n     Cozumel, Mexico.\n       The mere existence of the structure offers a metaphor for \n     the paradoxes raised by the world's most ambitious attempt to \n     tie environmental concerns to international free trade.\n       The Puerta Maya pier dispute is the sole case to wind its \n     way completely through the labyrinth of bureaucracy \n     established to resolve environmental conflicts under the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement.\n       Environmentalists persuasively argued that the Mexican \n     government violated its own environmental laws when it \n     assessed the potential impact of the pier, designed to \n     accommodate more and larger cruise ships and to bring more \n     tourists to the region.\n       According to the 55-page ``final factual record'' that \n     followed an 18-month investigation, the environmentalists \n     essentially won.\n       ``We proved that the Mexican government violated the law,'' \n     said Gustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Environmental \n     Law Center, one of the organizations that raised the issue. \n     ``It's an enormous victory for international environmental \n     rights.''\n       But the victory is only on paper. The Puerta Maya pier was \n     built, and tourists now disembark from cruise ships there to \n     stroll its walkway lined with liquor, perfume and souvenir \n     shops.\n       As the outcome of the pier project suggests, the \n     environmental legacy of the free trade agreement begun nearly \n     five ago is contradictory.\n       The very trade agreement that elevated environmental \n     concerns to an unprecedented level, making ``sustainable \n     development'' one of its goals, also gave businesses a new \n     tool to combat pollution regulations they consider onerous. \n     The measure, an investment provision that has been \n     interpreted to allow companies to sue countries whose \n     pollution regulations hinder profits, is essentially \n     unaffected by the environmental side accord and lies beyond \n     the direct jurisdiction of the Commission for Environmental \n     Cooperation, the organization created to oversee \n     environmental concerns.\n       In analyzing the impact of the agreement's overall \n     environmental agenda, the Tribune interviewed scores of \n     economists, legal experts, government officials and \n     environmental activists in Canada, Mexico and the United \n     States.\n       The free trade agreement, with its side accord, did not \n     force a cleanup of long-polluted sites. It did not foist \n     tough new international standards on polluters. It did not \n     create a new police agency to enforce regulations that had \n     long been ignored.\n       The agreement set no minimum or uniform standards for the \n     three participating nations. Instead, it promised to see, \n     somehow, that each nation enforced its environmental laws, \n     and it gave citizens a new international forum to raise \n     complaints about countries that failed to do so.\n\n[[Page S13662]]\n\n       Even its most passionate advocates concede the pact has no \n     practical means to punish governments or companies other than \n     through the stigma of bad publicity. A provision for \n     sanctions exists for a ``persistent pattern'' of failure to \n     enforce environmental laws, but many experts say it will \n     never be used.\n       Moreover, though it technically bars the weakening of \n     environmental laws to attract investment, the agreement \n     offers no real tool to counteract any decision by the \n     countries to alter their own environmental laws for any \n     reason, analysts note.\n       ``The implication is that the three governments are going \n     to be at least as good by the environment as they are \n     today,'' said David Gantz, associate director of the National \n     Law Center for Inter-American Free Trade at the University of \n     Arizona in Tucson. That assumption, he added, is ``dependent \n     on their goodwill.''\n       Scenes from the U.S.-Mexico border, the fastest-growing \n     region in North America, tell the story of the vast \n     environmental problems facing Mexico. Explosive population \n     and industrial growth, some of it fueled by the trade \n     agreement itself, have only worsened the pollution that \n     plagues the region's air, water and ground.\n       The border remains a stark contradiction, a place where the \n     world's most prosperous corporations using the most modern \n     manufacturing techniques stand beside poor neighborhoods \n     where people live in shacks made of wooden pallets or \n     cardboard, without running water, sewers, electricity or \n     telephones.\n       In Tijuana, obvious industrial violations are easy to find. \n     The stench of a bathtub refinishing plant burns the eyes and \n     nose of anyone within blocks of the building, and industrial \n     fans meant to clear the air for workers inside stand idle. At \n     the site of the abandoned lead smelting factory Metales y \n     Derivados, a subsidiary of San Diego-based New Frontier \n     Trading Corp., which is now the subject of a citizens' \n     complaint against Mexico, leaking car batteries lie in huge \n     mounds, and the only pretense of a cleanup is torn plastic \n     sheeting.\n       The New River, which crosses the Mexico-California border, \n     is essentially a sewer, even more so now that the temporary \n     ``fix'' for it has been to encase it in huge tubing, rather \n     than to clean it. Ciudad Juarez has no facility to treat the \n     sewage from its 1.3 million residents.\n       John Knox, a University of Texas law professor and former \n     negotiator for the State Department on the environmental side \n     accord, said, ``I think it's fairly easy to say it is better \n     than nothing, but if you compare what it's doing to the scope \n     of the problem, then it seems pretty minuscule.''\n\n\n                           new opportunities\n\n       When it took hold on New Year's Day 1994, the trade \n     agreement already had deeply divided environmentalists. \n     Opponents feared it would make Mexico a pollution haven and \n     drag down the higher standards of Canada and the United \n     States. Advocates believed it could be Mexico's best hope, \n     both by pressuring it into better environmental standards and \n     by improving its economy, which in turn could lead to higher \n     environmental standards.\n       Pollution intensity is highest in the early stages of a \n     country's industrialization, but it wanes as income levels \n     rise. Researchers have found that environmental degradation \n     tends to decline once annual per capita incomes reach a \n     threshold of $8,000--roughly double Mexico's per capita \n     income.\n       One particular dispute settled in July has only exacerbated \n     environmentalists' fears that governments would be pressured \n     to reduce their pollution standards.\n       In June 1997, the Canadian government banned a gasoline \n     additive after some studies suggested the chemical, MMT, used \n     to boost octane's power, could cause nerve damage. In \n     retaliation, the manufacturer, Richmond, VA-based Ethyl \n     Corp., sued the Canadian government for $250 million under a \n     provision in the trade agreement's main text, not its \n     environmental side accord, contending that the ban \n     essentially amounted to an ``expropriation'' for which it \n     should be compensated.\n       The same substance has provoked considerable controversy in \n     the United States, where it was among the chemicals banned by \n     the 1977 Clean Air Act. Eighteen years later, Ethyl won the \n     right to sell MMT from an appeals court ruling that \n     overturned the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to \n     continue the ban in lieu of sufficient studies on the \n     substance's potential effects.\n       In July, the Canadian government rescinded the ban and \n     agreed to pay Ethyl $13 million for lost profits and legal \n     costs.\n       ``Virtually any public policy which diminishes corporate \n     profits is vulnerable,'' said Michelle Swenarchuk, director \n     of international programs for the Canadian Environmental Law \n     Association. ``It has profound intimidating effects.''\n       The prospect of such a suit had helped to kill a Canadian \n     proposal that would have required cigarettes be sold only in \n     plain brown packaging to make them less appealing to \n     children, she said.\n       A similar case is pending against Mexico under the same \n     provision, which authorizes arbitration panels to handle such \n     cases in private. In it, Metalclad Corp., a Southern \n     California hazardous-waste disposal business, is seeking $990 \n     million in damages for being denied permission to open a \n     landfill in central Mexico.\n       Meanwhile, 20 cases (eight against Canada, eight against \n     Mexico and four against the United States) have been brought \n     to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation alleging that \n     governments have failed to enforce their environmental \n     provisions. Eleven are under review, including one that is \n     undergoing the most advanced procedure for redress available, \n     the preparation of a factual record. That case stems from \n     allegations that the Canadian government has failed to \n     protect fish and fish habitat in British Columbia's rivers \n     from damage by hydroelectric dams.\n       The notorious environmental problems of Mexico do not stem \n     from its laws. Many are styled after U.S. provisions, and \n     some are more stringent.\n       But enforcement is lax or absent. In a recent World Bank \n     Group study in Mexico, more than half of the industries \n     surveyed said they did not comply with environmental \n     regulations.\n       The Mexican government insists that it has made important \n     strides in dealing with the environment, principally with \n     more environmental inspections.\n       ``Government action . . . has presented important advances \n     in the three years of the present administration,'' a \n     statement from the Mexican embassy is Washington, D.C., said.\n       But its federal government this year has been forced to \n     make deep spending cuts that include its environmental \n     program because of the ongoing drop in the price of oil, upon \n     which Mexico depends for more than one-third of its revenues.\n       Slow steps\n       The environmental accord created two institutions dedicated \n     to pollution cleanup along the U.S.-Mexico border: the North \n     American Development Bank, created by $450 million \n     contributed in equal parts by the United States and Mexico to \n     arrange financing for projects; and its sister agency, the \n     Border Environmental Cooperation Commission, which evaluates \n     projects before they can receive the bank's backing. The \n     institutions got off to a slow start, and the chief obstacle \n     for most projects was basic: They had to find a way to pay \n     for themselves.\n       The bank's mission--to finance the projects primarily by \n     guaranteeing loans, rather than by grants--proved an almost \n     insurmountable hurdle for communities in an impoverished \n     region that had never found the financial resources or the \n     political will to meet basic needs, such as providing \n     drinking water and sewers.\n       ``Is it possible to clean up on a for-profit basis 30 years \n     of raping the environment for profit?'' asked David Schorr, \n     senior trade analyst for the World Wildlife Fund.\n       Though other development banks offer low-interest loans, \n     the North American Development Bank has no such discount. \n     ``Market rates can make a loan package prohibitively \n     expensive for poor communities,'' said Mark Spalding, a \n     University of California at San Diego instructor who \n     participated in the negotiations to create the two \n     institutions. It was only in April 1996, when the bank \n     received a $170 million infusion of grants from the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency, that its projects began to \n     seem viable.\n       Now, 19 projects representing a planned investment of $600 \n     million have been approved, and the first of them, two \n     landfills, are to be completed in January. Eight are under \n     construction, and two more, including a sewage treatment \n     plant for Ciudad Juarez, are soon to begin. Dozens of others \n     are in preliminary planning stages, beginning the arduous \n     process to determine how, and whether, they can be financed.\n       While the bank's sewage-treatment projects represent \n     unquestionable improvements for border communities, they have \n     faced one criticism. The standards set for Mexican \n     communities are beneath those considered basic in the U.S.\n       One of the few evaluations of the side agreement's \n     environmental agenda suggests that it has been modestly \n     successful in carrying out cooperative initiatives among the \n     countries. The accomplishments include agreements among the \n     countries to phase out some pollutants, and to develop or \n     expand new programs for conservation of species, including \n     monarch butterflies and migratory songbirds, concluded the \n     Institute for International Economics, a non-profit, non-\n     partisan research institution in Washington, D.C\n       The Commission for Environmental Cooperation, which has \n     been plagued by political rifts between the U.S. and Mexico, \n     admits it has yet to resolve the debate over whether trade \n     liberalization leads to better or worse environmental \n     conditions. ``While there are theoretical arguments on both \n     sides, there is little empirical data available to settle \n     it,'' its own assessment concluded.\n       This fall the commission published a study purporting to \n     find a drop in pollution across North America during the \n     trade agreement's first year. It failed to take into account \n     one substantial portion of the continent, however--Mexico, \n     which has yet to implement the necessary pollution reporting \n     system.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. From that article:\n\n       Environmentalists persuasively argued that the Mexican \n     government violated its own environmental laws when it \n     assessed the potential impact of the pier, designed to \n     accommodate more and larger cruise ships.\n       ``We proved that the Mexican government violated the law,'' \n     said Gustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Environmental \n     Law Center, one of the organizations that raised\n\n[[Page S13663]]\n\n     the issue. ``It is an enormous victory for international \n     environmental rights.''\n\n  The emphasis, of course, is that there are those in the countries \ninvolved with labor rights and with the environment. They are not \npurely nomads. They have an environmental movement in Mexico and in \nCanada.\n  We would help to extend environmental concerns and labor rights with \nthis particular agreement if they adopt these two amendments.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I remind my colleague that my bill already \nincludes significant labor conditions. Specifically, the beneficiary \ncountries must be taking steps to afford their workers' internationally \nrecognized worker rights. If the beneficiary countries fail to protect \nworker rights, then the benefits under both the CBI and Africa may be \nterminated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2428\n\n  I will now address the proposed amendment of the Senator from \nWisconsin. The legislation he refers to, to add some novel \ntransshipment provisions, raises serious constitutional questions in \nthe United States. What the bill would do is impose joint liability on \nthe importer and the retailer for any material false statement or any \nomission made in filing the numerous forms and certifications that have \nto be filed to enter any textile or apparel items into the United \nStates and receive the meager benefits available under the bill.\n  The bill adds Draconian new penalties for any alleged transshipment. \nWhile I am not opposed to adding such penalties for what is outright \ncustoms fraud subject to all the normal due process protections \nordained by the Constitution and contained in current U.S. law, this \nbill allows for the imposition of such penalty on what it terms ``the \nbest information available.''\n  Let me put that in its proper context. Under this bill, a retailer \nwho has no control over either the exporter's or importer's action \ncould be held jointly liable for any minor omission made by either the \nexporter or importer and held liable not because the retailer was found \nto be guilty of infraction beyond a reasonable doubt but merely on the \nbasis of the best information available to the Customs Service.\n  That turns the whole notion of a due process protection guaranteed by \nthe Constitution and by American administrative law on its head. I \nsubmit this is the opposite of constitutional protection.\n  This is an example, in the words of Jeremy Benton, of what is called \ndog law. The author decided they can't tell the dog right or wrong \nahead of time, and they kick it after the fact to let it know they \nthink it has done wrong. My guess is there aren't too many retailers \nwilling to get in the way of a hard left foot. This bill aims at their \npraises, but what Customs provisions do as a result is discourage trade \nand thereby discourage investment.\n  In short, this proposal is not what the author suggested nor is this \nbill, as the title claims: Hope for Africa. In fact, this bill is the \nreverse of what we want to do in establishing a new partnership with \nAfrica.\n  I urge my colleague to oppose this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Hollings amendment No. 2483 and \nI do so for two reasons. First, as I have stated previously, the goal \nof this legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the \nCaribbean, and Central America. The amendment undermines that effort by \nrequiring the difficult negotiation of side agreements on both labor \nand the environment that delays the incentive that the bill is intended \nto create. This is bad for labor and environmental conditions in the \nbeneficiary countries as well as their economies.\n  The available research suggests labor and environmental standards \nrise with a country's level of economic development. This is because \nfor countries that are on the edge of famine, enforcing labor standards \nand protecting the environment are a luxury. The Finance Committee bill \nhelps economically and in improving labor and environmental standards \nby giving these countries an opportunity to tap private investment \ncapital as a means of encouraging economic development and economic \ngrowth. That is a most certain way to ensure that these countries have \nthe wherewithal to pay for environmental protection.\n  The second reason I will oppose the amendment is that it essentially \ndepends on economic sanctions to work. It threatens to cut off a series \nof economic benefits if the countries do not comply with the terms of \nsome agreement yet to be negotiated. That not only undercuts the \ninvestment incentive by increasing the uncertainty of a country's \nparticipation in the program, it also does little to raise labor and \nenvironmental standards. As we have heard during the extended debate we \nhave had on economic sanctions in the past, they do, actually, little \nto affect the behavior of the target country. Indeed, in the case of \nthe intended beneficiaries of these tariff preference programs, they \nwould have the opposite effect on labor and environmental protections \nby discouraging investment in economic growth.\n  What is needed, as I said earlier, is a cooperative approach, \nbilaterally between the United States and the particular developing \ncountry and among the countries of the regions as a whole. The \nexperience under the NAFTA side agreement reinforces my point. The \nsanctions mechanisms have done little to encourage better labor and \nenvironmental practices. What has worked under the NAFTA agreement is \nthe cooperative ventures of the three participants on both the labor \nand the environmental front. The NAFTA Commission on Environmental \nCooperation, for example, advises all three countries on how to tackle \ncommon environmental problems. That advice has helped ensure \ncoordination rather than conflict among the NAFTA partners over \nenvironmental issues.\n  The Senate substitute before us does not preclude these sorts of \nconstructive efforts by the President. Indeed, the President would do \nwell to pursue a similar model in the context of our broader relations \nwith our African, Caribbean, and Central American neighbors. The model \noffered by the pending amendment would not help us towards that goal. \nI, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Hollings amendment \nNo. 2483.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2428\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a little confusing. We are \ndebating several amendments at once. I would like to see if we could \nget a little back and forth going. I wanted to respond to the \nchairman's comments about my amendment, but then he went into several \narguments about the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. I am \nworried it is going to be awfully hard for people to follow this.\n  Let me return to and respond to the concerns of the chairman with \nregard to the amendment I have offered, to try to do something about \nthis problem of transshipment, this problem that some countries--very \nlikely China--will take advantage of this new Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act to ship a lot more of their goods through Africa into \nthe United States, and not only harm the African nations and people who \nare trying to benefit from this but harm American jobs.\n  Every $1 billion of transshipped goods into this country apparently \ncosts about 40,000 American jobs in the textile-related area.\n  When the chairman suggests we are trying to discourage legal trade by \nthis amendment, that is the opposite of what we are doing. We are \ntrying to prevent this kind of circumvention of\n\n[[Page S13664]]\n\nthe spirit and intent of the law by unfair and what should be illegal \ntransshipment.\n  The Senator has suggested somehow there is a constitutional problem \nwith imposing some penalties on importers who are given some \nresponsibilities in this regard. I was not clear on what the \nconstitutional provision was. I assume it is the notion of taking \nproperty without due process of law. But if we take a look at these \npenalties, what we are trying to do is make absolutely sure the \nimporter cooperates with the Customs Service in order to make sure what \nis happening is not a scam by a government, such as the Chinese \nGovernment, to transship its goods through Africa.\n  Let's look at the actual language the Senator has complained about. \nHe refers to the use of ``best available information.'' All that is \nrequired for an importer is that an importer has to cooperate. Let me \nemphasize this for my colleagues. It says:\n\n       If an importer or retailer fails to cooperate with the \n     Customs Service in an investigation to determine if there was \n     a violation of any provision of this section, the Customs \n     Service shall base its determination on the best available \n     information.\n\n  The only time this ``best available information'' is even utilized is \nwhere the importer has not been willing to cooperate. I think that is \nentirely reasonable. The Senator refers to these penalties as \ndraconian, as too severe. Let's remember what this bill does. It gives \nthese importers a golden opportunity, a new opportunity to make a lot \nof money through these new trade opportunities with Africa. I do not \nthink it is draconian to ask these importers to take reasonable steps \nto avoid the kind of abuse China obviously intends to pursue in this \narea.\n  The penalty for the first offense is a civil penalty in the amount \nequal to 200 percent of declared value of merchandise, plus forfeiture \nof merchandise. In light of the new opportunities this gives these \nimporters, I do not see this as draconian. I see this as a penalty that \nis commensurate with the kind of opportunities they are provided. I \nassume these importers in good faith do not want to facilitate \nChinese circumvention of our laws and our quotas. I assume their goal \nis a good-faith desire to make a profit by trading with these African \ncountries. So we need to do something other than what is the current \nlaw, and all the bill does in its current form is reiterate the current \nlaw that does not work because it relies on foreign officials to \ncertify these products are really African goods.\n\n  That is not good enough. We need to place some responsibility on the \nimporter who is subject to American law. This is the critical point. \nEither we are going to simply pass this bill, which, frankly, already \nis very unbalanced and not sufficient to protect American workers, or \nwe are going to try to fix it. Surely, one area we need to fix is this \ntransshipment problem.\n  Let me quote, again, these web sites of the People's Republic of \nChina, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. They say, \nabout the current law which this bill continues:\n\n       There are many opportunities for Chinese business people in \n     Africa. Setting up assembly plants with Chinese equipment and \n     personnel could not only greatly increase sales in African \n     countries, but also circumvent the quotas imposed on \n     commodities of Chinese origin imposed by European and \n     American countries.\n\n  The opposition to this amendment simply wants to allow the Chinese \nGovernment to continue this program. They provide no tough penalties, \nno obligation for people we can do something about, such as importers \nand people under American law. They want to let the good times roll for \nthese Chinese companies and governments that are trying to undercut \nAmerican jobs.\n  I think that is wrong. Clearly, if there is anything should be \nadopted, it should be some cracking down on the extremely abusive \npractice of transshipping. Let's not let these African countries be \npawns for the Chinese goal of undercutting American jobs.\n  Our amendment will strengthen this bill. It certainly will not weaken \nthe bill. It will make the bill a much more honest attempt to make sure \nthis fosters a trade relationship between the United States and the \ncountries of Africa--not a conduit for Chinese abuse of American \nquotas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask consent it be in order for me to move \nto table the following amendment----\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2483\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator withhold? When he moves \nto table, that will terminate all debate, as I understand it.\n  I want to offer one more amendment. But with respect to the \nenvironmental amendment, it is clear the distinguished chairman of \nFinance says: Look, this environmental side agreement we had in NAFTA \nwould now discourage investment. It didn't discourage investment in \nMexico and didn't discourage investment in Canada. It would not \ndiscourage investment. What we are saying is before you open up as \ncompared to the CBI, you have to have clean air and clean water and the \nenvironmental protection statements. You have to have all of these \nparticular requirements. But, by the way, if you want to get rid of \nthem, then go down to the CBI.\n  The message is clear. This is what you might call the Job Export Act \nof 1999.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2485\n\n (Purpose: To require the negotiation of a reciprocal trade agreement \n    lowering tariffs on imports of U.S. goods with a country before \n         benefits are received under this Act by that country)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2485, relative to \nreciprocity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2485:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENTS REQUIRED.\n\n       The benefits provided by the amendments made by this Act \n     shall not be available to any country until the President has \n     negotiated, obtained, and implemented an agreement with the \n     country providing tariff concessions for the importation of \n     United States-made goods that reduce any such import tariffs \n     to rates identical to the tariff rates applied by the United \n     States to that country.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a matter of reciprocity. We have \nthat working, as they can tell you, wonderful success with Canada and \nMexico; reciprocity on all the trade items.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of tariffs in the Caribbean, \nSub-Sahara Africa, and the tariffs and other taxes on computer hardware \nand software printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              In percent as high as\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Textile Tariffs in the Caribbean\n \nDominican Republic....................  43 (Includes 8% VAT).\nEl Salvador...........................  37.5 (Includes 12% VAT).\nHonduras..............................  35 (Includes 10% VAT).\nGuatemala.............................  40 (Includes 10% VAT).\nCosta Rica............................  39 (Includes 13% VAT).\nHaiti.................................  29.\nJamaica...............................  40 (Includes 15% general\n                                         consumption tax).\nNicaragua.............................  35 (Includes 15% VAT).\nTrinidad & Tobago.....................  40 (Includes 15% VAT).\n \n       Textile Tariffs in Africa\n \nSouthern Africa Customs Union (South    74 (Includes 14% VAT for South\n Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia      Africa).\n and Swaziland).\nCentral African Republic..............  30.\nCameroon..............................  30.\nChad..................................  30.\nCongo.................................  30.\nEthiopia..............................  80.\nGabon.................................  30.\nGhana.................................  25.\nKenya.................................  80 (Includes 18% VAT).\nMauritius.............................  88.\nNigeria...............................  55 (Includes 5% VAT).\nTanzania..............................  40.\nZimbabwe..............................  200.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                          WORLDWIDE TARIFFS AND TAXES ON COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Hardware       Software\n                    Country                        tariff (in     tariff (in              Other taxes\n                                                    percent)       percent)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfrica:\n    Angola.....................................

Tariffs on textiles, the 10-percent tariff, which is \nready to be blended out, in the blending out and termination of the \nMultifiber Arrangement in the next 5 years. Be that as it may, we have, \nin the Dominican Republic a tariff of 43 percent plus 8 percent VAT; El \nSalvador, 37.5 plus; Honduras, 35 percent plus; Guatemala, 40 percent; \nCosta Rica, 39; Jamaica, 40; Nicaragua, 35; 40 percent to Trinidad. We \nhave a similar group of tariffs with respect to the tariffs in Africa: \nthe Central African Republic, 30 percent; Cameroon, 30; Chad, 30; \nCongo, 30; Ethiopia, 80 percent; Gabon, 30 percent; Ghana, 25; Kenya, \n80 percent; Mauritius, 88; Nigeria, 55 percent; Tanzania, 40; Zimbabwe, \n200 percent.\n  I plead for reciprocity. I plead for the information revolution, \nwhich somehow bypassed me according to this morning's editorial in the \nWall Street Journal.\n  With respect to tariffs on computer hardware and software, we are \ntrying to make sure they do not do transshipments, as the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin has pointed out, and in turn, include such \ntariffs as: Ethiopia, 50 percent on computer hardware and software; \nGhana, 25 percent, plus a 35-percent customs tax, plus a 40-percent \nentry tax on software and a 12.5-percent complementary tax on hardware.\n  They are keeping out these advancements due to these high tariffs. \nThis will help not just the African countries, but protect the computer \ninformation age material.\n  In Lesoto, 18 percent plus a 14-percent VAT.\n  In Malawi, 45-percent tariff plus a 20-percent surcharge.\n  In Mozambique, 35-percent tariff plus a 30-percent tax on computer \ndisks, a 5-percent circulation tax.\n  In Senegal, 20 percent with a 20-percent VAT plus 5-percent stamp \ntax, for a total of 45 percent.\n  In Sudan, 40 percent.\n  In Tanzania, 30 percent plus a 30-percent sales tax plus a 5-percent \nsurtax. That is a 65-percent tax.\n  In Zambia, 25 percent and a 20-percent sales tax.\n  In Zimbabwe, a 40-percent tariff plus a 10-percent surcharge, for a \ntotal of 50 percent.\n  Going down that list, we have traded a lot of things, and this does \nnot just relegate itself to textiles, it relegates itself to all trade.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is pointing out, very \nappropriately, the transshipments. We encourage the transshipments \nwithout reciprocity. That is why we put it into NAFTA. It should be \npart of this. We voted on this. It was supported by the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member with NAFTA. I \ndo not see why they cannot support it now rather than moving to table \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose this Hollings amendment for three \nreasons.\n  The first reason, as I have stated previously, is that the purpose of \nthis legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the Caribbean, \nand Central America by offering these poverty-stricken countries a \nmeasure of preferential access to our market. The amendment would \nundermine the effort by making eligibility explicitly dependent on the \noffer of reciprocal benefits to the United States equivalent to those \nto which the United States is entitled under NAFTA.\n  The underlying requirements of the African-CBI provisions of the \nFinance Committee's substitute do encourage the beneficiary countries \nto remove barriers to trade. The existing requirements also impose an \naffirmative obligation to avoid discrimination against U.S. products in \nthe beneficiary country's trade. What the Finance Committee substitute \ndoes not require is market access equivalent to that of NAFTA, a \nstandard that even the WTO members among these beneficiary countries \ncould not currently satisfy.\n  The second reason I oppose the amendment is that the Finance \nCommittee already instructs the President to begin the process of \nnegotiating with the beneficiary country under both programs for trade \nagreements that would provide reciprocal market access to the United \nStates as well as a still more solid foundation with a long-term \neconomic relationship between the United States and its African, \nCaribbean, and Central American neighbors.\n  Under the Africa provisions of the bill, the President is instructed \nto assess the prospects for such agreement and is called on to \nestablish a regional economic forum. That forum could prove \ninstrumental in solving market access problems that U.S. firms may face \ncurrently as well as a forum for any eventual negotiation.\n  Under the CBI provisions of the bill, the Finance Committee sought to \nencourage our Caribbean-Central American trading partners to join with \nus in pressing for the early conclusion and implementation of the free \ntrade agreements of the Americas. Each of the beneficiary countries of \nthe CBI program has played an active and constructive role in those \ntalks today.\n  In both Africa and the CBI, we are making progress in opening markets \nand eliminating barriers to United States trade. The fact that we do \nnot currently enjoy precisely those benefits offered by Canada and \nMexico in\n\n[[Page S13666]]\n\nthe context of the NAFTA is no bar to action here.\n  Finally, the bill does encourage reciprocity where it really counts \nin the context of this bill. By encouraging the use of U.S. fabric and \nU.S. yarn in the assembly of apparel products bound for the United \nStates, the bill establishes a solid economic partnership between \nindustry and the United States and firms in the beneficiary country. \nThat provides real benefits to American firms and workers in the \ntextile industry by establishing the platform by which American textile \nmakers can compete worldwide. That is precisely the benefit our \nindustry most seeks in the context of our growing economic relationship \nwith both regions.\n  In short, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \nmove to table the following amendments with one show of seconds. The \namendments are: Hollings No. 2379, Feingold No. 2428, Hollings No. \n2483, and Hollings No. 2485. I further ask unanimous consent that these \nvotes occur in a stacked sequence beginning at 3:45, with the time \nbetween now and then equally divided in the usual form; there be no \nother amendments in order prior to the votes; there be 4 minutes \nequally divided just before each vote; and the votes occur in the order \nin which the amendments were called up.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I had indicated we \nwould like a chance to offer our amendment at about this time. I \ninquire if this agreement could include an agreement to allow Senator \nGrassley and me time to present our amendment before these votes.\n  Mr. ROTH. All these amendments are going to be disposed of by a \ntabling motion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I understand that. What I am inquiring is whether or not, \nas part of this agreement, the Senator can indicate that Senator \nGrassley and I will have a chance to offer our amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Before or after the vote?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Before the vote. We will be happy to take a vote as part \nof that sequence or have it at a later point, but that we at least have \na chance, since we are both here, to present our amendment before these \nvotes are taken.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will be happy to add the Conrad-Grassley amendment to the \nlist if it is all right with my colleague.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes. May I ask how much time the Senators from Iowa and \nNorth Dakota wish?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleague how much time he wants. May we have 10 \nminutes, at most, on our side to talk about this amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. I then change my proposal to 4 o'clock rather than 3:45, \nwith the understanding my colleagues will take 10 minutes for their \nside of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have a question for the chairman. He \nand I talked about my adding another amendment prior to these votes as \nwell, amendment No. 2406. I also only need 10 minutes. I ask it be \nincluded in the sequence of votes as well.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator give me the number of his amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This is No. 2406.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me renew my request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order for me to move to table the following \namendments, with one show of seconds. The amendments are: Hollings \namendment No. 2379, Feingold amendment No. 2428, Hollings amendment No. \n2483, Hollings amendment No. 2485, Conrad-Grassley amendment No. 2359, \nand Feingold amendment No. 2406.\n  I further ask consent that these votes occur in a stacked sequence \nbeginning at 4 o'clock, with the time between now and then equally \ndivided in the usual form, and there be no other amendments in order \nprior to the votes, and there be 4 minutes equally divided just before \neach vote, and the votes occur in the order in which the amendments \nwere called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Each will be a 15-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would ask, to clarify the request, \nthat the debate on amendments Nos. 2359 and 2406 be limited to 10 \nminutes per amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my understanding was we were going to get \n10 minutes on our side on our amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes; 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the chairman modify his request in that regard?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I think he did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let the Chair restate its understanding. The \nChair's understanding is, it will be in order for the Senator from \nDelaware to move to table the amendments which have been listed, with \none showing of seconds; further, that these votes would occur in a \nstacked sequence beginning at 4 p.m.; between now and 4 p.m., however, \namendments Nos. 2359, and 2406 will be allowed to be debated for a \nmaximum of 10 minutes each. The remaining time until 4 p.m. would be \ndivided equally as stated in the unanimous consent request.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is not correct from our standpoint because our \nunderstanding was we were going to get 10 minutes on our side. As the \nChair has stated it, it would be 10 minutes total debate on our \namendment. So if you could just amend that unanimous consent request to \nbe that on amendment No. 2359, there be up to 10 minutes on a side--and \nwe will endeavor not to use that full time--it would be fully \nagreeable.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is satisfactory.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would ask for the same on the amendment I am \nproposing with the expectation we will not use all the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. But, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the votes start \nat 4:15, then, instead of 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I first congratulate the Chair for having \nrecapitulated this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Not a small intellectual feat, equal to my \nunderstanding of some of the amendments themselves.\n  Sir, I am going to make two quick comments. One is anecdotal. I \nwas involved with the negotiation of the Long-Term Cotton Textile \nAgreement under President Kennedy in 1962. This was a major effort. It \nwas done at the behest of the Southern mill owners and operators, the \nproducers of cotton textiles, and also of the trade unions that \nrepresented the garment trades, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union \nand the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, now formed with \nanother union into UNITE. It was a precondition of getting the Trade \nExpansion Act of 1962, the one major piece of legislation of President \nKennedy's first term.\n\n  It came and went on to produce what we know as the Kennedy Round. \nThat sequence of long negotiations, most recently was the Uruguay \nRound, which produced the World Trade Organization. There is another \nround coming up, we hope, in the aftermath of the Seattle meeting.\n  Years went by, and I found I was Ambassador to India. On an occasion, \nin meeting with the Foreign Minister, I said to him, just curiously: Do \nyou find that the quota which India received in the American market of \ncotton textiles is onerous? It had now been a decade since it was in \nplace. I asked: Is it a trade restriction that is particularly of \nconcern to you? Because if it was, I was required to report it back to \nWashington.\n  The Foreign Minister said: Oh, no. That quota guarantees us that much \naccess to the American market which we would otherwise not have, \nbecause American textile manufacturers are the low-cost producers. We \ndo not hand loom cotton textiles in this country or wool for that \nmatter. We have the most advanced machinery in the world.\n\n[[Page S13667]]\n\n  Not to know that, to depict us as the potential victims of the \nChinese, with their child labor, does not show any understanding of why \nnations have child labor. They do so because they do not have machines. \nThey do not have the infrastructure of a modern economy.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act requires that the President \ncertify basically the openness of the trading system, as much as it is \ngoing to be open, of the respective countries. The African Growth Act, \nfor example, requires that he determine the country involved has \nestablished or is making continual progress towards establishing an \nopen trading system for the elimination of barriers to U.S. trade and \ninvestment and the resolution of bilateral trade and investment \ndisputes.\n  Sir, does anyone wish to name me a nation in the world that would not \nbe open to American investment today? I would ask my friend, the \nchairman of the committee, is he aware of any country in the world that \nwould refuse American investment?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would say to the contrary, every country is eager to have \nAmerican investment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. They spend their time sending us delegations.\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There may have been a time--yes, there was, in the era \nof a planned economy, in the era of the Soviet Union, in another era. \nAre we debating another era?\n  We are going to ask the President, under one of these amendments--I \nhave lost track which one--to negotiate 147 reciprocal trade treaties--\n147--and then, sir, in one of them--I will not say which, because I do \nnot think it would be quite fair--but in one of them, for the third act \nof imported children's wear, that somehow involves textiles made in the \nFar East or wherever, the violation is punishable by a fine of $1 \nmillion and 5 years in prison.\n\n  Do we send people to prison for the mislabeling of cotton goods? I \nmean, heavens, a little balance, a little perspective. We are talking \nabout marginal producers on the margin of the world economy, trying to \ngive them a hand. In the case of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, we are \ntrying to do what President Reagan said was only fair and balanced: If \nwe were going to have the North American Free Trade Agreement, it \nshould not close out Central America and the Caribbean.\n  I hope we will proceed as long as we have to with such amendments, \nbut I hope some perspective will be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note, in order to comply with \nthe time agreement previously agreed to, the Conrad amendment would be \ncalled up at this time.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 2359\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade adjustment \n                         assistance to farmers)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, the Conrad-\nGrassley amendment, amendment No. 2359, that has been previously filed \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 2359.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to give full \nconsideration to this amendment. I consider this a fairness amendment \nbecause this amendment, which would extend trade adjustment assistance \nto farmers, says we ought to be giving them the protection we already \ngive other folks who work for a living.\n  Right now we have trade adjustment assistance on the books. It is \nlaw. If you are working on a job, and you lose your job because of a \nflood of unfairly traded imports, you have a chance to get back on your \nfeet. But farmers are left out. Farmers are excluded because farmers do \nnot lose their job when they are faced with a flood of unfairly traded \nimports. Instead, they are faced with a dramatic drop in income.\n  Instead, I would like to run through a number of charts that show the \nconditions facing American farmers today.\n  This shows what has happened to prices over the last 53 years. These \nare wheat and barley prices. These are in real terms, inflation \nadjusted, constant dollars. We have the lowest prices in 53 years. One \nreason is a flood of unfairly traded Canadian imports.\n  This is the result. This chart shows what the cost of production is. \nThat is the green line. The red line shows what prices for wheat have \nbeen over the last 3 years.\n  Colleagues, wheat prices are far below the cost of production and \nhave been for over 3 years, again partly because of a flood of Canadian \nimports unfairly traded.\n  The question is, Are we going to help farmers the same way we help \nother workers who are faced with this condition? I hope we say yes. I \nhope we recognize that it is simple fairness to extend the same \nprotection to farmers we extend to other folks who are working for a \nliving in this country.\n  This amendment is carefully crafted. It is limited to $10,000 per \nfarmer per year with an overall cap cost of $100 million that is fully \nand completely paid for. We have an offset.\n  Interestingly, it is one of those rare circumstances where our offset \nis supported by the industry that would be paying. We have an offset \nthat affects the real estate investment trust. It is supported by the \nreal estate industry. They are willing to pay a little something more \nto get what they consider is a fair result. It is the same provision \nthat was in the President's tax bill. It is the same provision that has \nhad support on other matters before the Senate but not included in any \nfinal packages.\n  This matter is completely and fully offset. It simply allows that in \na circumstance where the price of a commodity has dropped by over 20 \npercent as certified by the Secretary of Agriculture and where imports \ncontributed importantly to this price drop, farmers will then be \neligible for trade adjustment assistance.\n  This is the same standard the Department of Labor uses to determine \nwhether workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance when they \nlose their jobs. In order to be eligible, farmers would have to \ndemonstrate their net farm income has declined from the previous year, \nand they would need to meet with the Extension Service to plan how to \nadjust the import competition.\n  If all of those conditions are met, training and employment benefits \navailable to workers would then be available to farmers as an option.\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley, is the cosponsor of this amendment \nand has played a key role in its development. I know he has words he \nwould like to say about this measure as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nI am sponsoring with Senator Conrad to establish a new, limited Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program for farmers and fishermen. There are two \nkey reasons why this new program is so necessary, and why Senator \nConrad and I are offering this legislation.\n  The first and most important reason is that the existing Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program simply does not work for farmers. When a \nsudden surge in imports of an agricultural commodity dramatically \nlowers prices for that commodity, and sharply reduces the net income \nfor family farmers, these farmers are undeniably hurt by import \ncompetition.\n  They are just as hurt as steel workers, or auto workers, or textile \nworkers who experience the same thing. But because farmers lose income, \nbut not their jobs, they do not qualify for the existing Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for workers program. The reduction in family farm \nincome from important competition hurts farmers in a very serious way, \nbecause it comes at a time when farmers desperately need cash \nassistance to repay their operating loans and adjust to the import \ncompetition.\n  The second reason why I offer this legislation is to correct an \ninequity that should not continue. The inequity is that it is clear \nthat President Kennedy, who designed the original Trade\n\n[[Page S13668]]\n\nAdjustment Assistance program as part of the Trade Expansion Act of \n1962, clearly intended farmers to benefit from the program, just as \nmuch as other workers hurt as a result of a federal policy to reduce \nbarriers to foreign trade. In his message to the Congress on the Trade \nExpansion Act of 1962, President Kennedy spoke about his Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program. In fact, in his March 12, 1962 message, \nhe referred to farmers at least three times.\n  Here is part of what President Kennedy said.\n\n       I am recommending as an essential part of the new trade \n     program that companies, farmers, and workers who suffer \n     damage from increased foreign import competition be assisted \n     in their efforts to adjust to that competition. When \n     considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid \n     higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not \n     be required to bear the brunt of the impact. Rather, the \n     burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  What President Kennedy said was so important I want to emphasize what \nhe said: those who are injured by the national trade policies of the \nUnited States should not bear the brunt of the impact. And trade \nadjustment assistance should be available for companies, farmers, and \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, this is simply an issue of fairness. Basic American \nfairness. The United States has lead the world in liberalizing trade. \nWe started this process of global trade liberalization in 1947, when \nmost of the world was reeling from the enormous physical and economic \ndevastation of World War Two. We saw then that the way to avoid this \ntype of catastrophe in the future was to bring nations closer together \nthrough peaceful trade and open markets. That process has been \nspectacularly successful. Through eight series, or rounds, of \nmultilateral trade negotiations, we have scrapped ten of thousands of \ntariffs. Many non-tariff trade barriers have been torn down. Others \nhave been sharply reduced. The result of 50 years of trade \nliberalization has been the creation of enormous wealth and prosperity, \nand millions of new jobs. But not everyone has prospered.\n  Some have been injured by this deliberate policy of free trade and \nopen markets. And that's exactly why President Kennedy and the 87th \nCongress created the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. To help those \ninjured by our national policy of free trade and open markets adjust to \ntheir changing circumstances with limited assistance.\n  President Kennedy's Secretary of Labor, Arthur J. Goldberg put it the \nbest. Secretary Goldberg said:\n\n       As a humane Government, we recognize our responsibility to \n     provide adequate assistance to those who may be injured by a \n     deliberately chosen trade policy . . . It is because of the \n     desire to do justice to the people who are affected. . .\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot do justice by helping only some of the \npeople affected by our national trade policy. We cannot do justice by \nignoring farmers. We must do justice by ignoring farmers. We must reach \nout to everyone, including farmers, just as President Kennedy \nenvisioned. Now, I know there are some in this Chamber who believe that \nwe should wait to make changes in the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram until we can do a full review of the entire TAA program.\n  I do not agree with that view, for a very fundamental reason. We are \nonly about four weeks away from the start of the WTO Ministerial \nConference in Seattle. In Seattle, the United States will help launch \nthe ninth series, or round, of multilateral trade negotiations since \n1947.\n  A key goal of the Seattle Ministerial will be to liberalize world \nagricultural markets even more. This will mean increased import \ncompetition for American agricultural products, not less. Farmers have \nalways been among the strongest supporters of free trade, because so \nmuch of what they produce is sold in the international marketplace.\n  The income our farm families earn in these foreign markets sustains \nour economy, and contributes greatly to our national well-being. But \nfarm support for free trade cannot, and should not, be taken for \ngranted.\n  As I said in support of this legislation last week, we are in the \nworst farm crisis since the depression of the 1930s. Now, low commodity \nprices are not caused exclusively by import competition. But it is \ncertainly a contributing factor to these historically low prices.\n  If we lose the support of the farm community for free trade, Mr. \nPresident, I doubt that we will be able to win congressional approval \nfor any new trade concessions that may be negotiated in the new round \nof trade talks. So this is all about fairness. It is about equality. It \nis about common sense.\n  For all of these reasons, and because, as Labor Secretary Goldberg \nsaid 37 years ago, we must recognize our responsibility as a humane \ngovernment, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment \n(#2359) proposed by Senators Conrad and Grassley which would tailor the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance program so that it helps farmers and \nfishermen--two groups that are not adequately assisted under the \ncurrent TAA program.\n  I voted for this amendment at the Finance Committee markup, and was \ndisappointed that it failed by a narrow margin. But I am pleased that \nSenators Conrad and Grassley persevered in pushing this important issue \nforward. I also want to thank the authors of this amendment for working \nwith my staff to ensure that the provisions cover fishermen in Alaska \nand Louisiana and other areas along with farmers in the Midwest because \nthese two groups face similar problems.\n  Finally, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, for accepting this \namendment today. I urge them to insist on retaining this language at \nconference with our House colleagues.\n  I have long been an advocate of opening markets abroad for U.S. \nexporters, and putting in place rules to facilitate trade between the \nnations. I voted for the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round. I support the \nFinance Committee managers' amendment to the underlying bill which will \nchange our focus in Africa from aid to trade, will give the Caribbean \nnations parity in their trade with the United States. In addition, I \nsupport reauthorizing two important programs; the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program and the Generalized System of Preferences program.\n  But even as we pursue liberalized trade initiatives, we must work \nharder to help Americans adjust to a changing business climate that is \noften affected by events half way around the World. For while we can \ntake pride in an historically low unemployment rate nationwide that \noccurred partly as a result of our open and innovative workplace and \ntrading rules, certain sectors and certain parts of the country are \nstill facing employment losses or income losses as a result of low \nworldwide commodity prices. Fishermen and Farmers fall in this \ncategory.\n  Let me just use one example. An Alaskan fishing Sockeye Salmon was \ngetting $1.18 per pound in 1996. But last year, that price had sunk to \n85 cents--a 28% drop, and a 17% drop over the five-year average. And \nthe drop came in the face of rising imports. Foreign imports of seafood \nhave steadily risen since 1992 while exports have steadily fallen over \nthe same period.\n  The current TAA program is better suited to traditional manufacturing \nfirms and workers, than to farmers and fishermen. When imports cause \nlayoffs in manufacturing industries, workers are eligible for TAA. In \nmy own state of Alaska, TAA has played an important role both in the \noil industry and for the seafood processors. But an independent \nfisherman does not go to the dock and receive a pink slip, he goes to \nthe radio and hears the latest price for salmon, and he knows that his \nfamily's livelihood is threatened. TAA has not been available in his \ncircumstances.\n  As the authors of this amendment have explained, the TAA for Farmers \nand Fishers would set up a new program where individual farmers could \napply for assistance if two criteria are met.\n  First, the national average price for the commodity for the year \ndropped more than 20% compared to the average price in the previous \nfive years.\n  Second, imports ``contributed importantly'' to the price reduction.\n  If these two criteria are met, fishermen would be eligible for cash \nbenefits based on the fishermen's loss of income. The cash benefits \nwould be\n\n[[Page S13669]]\n\ncapped at $10,000 per fisherman. Retraining and other TAA benefits \navailable to workers under TAA also would be available to fishermen \ninterested in leaving for some other occupation.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this change in the TAA program is long \noverdue. Again, I want to stress that the traditional TAA program still \nplays an important role, and I do not want to diminish its current \nrole--but to expand it. The TAA program averts the need for more money \nin unemployment compensation, welfare, food stamps and other \nunemployment programs--in short, it keeps Americans employed and able \nto support themselves and their families.\n  Let me end, Mr. President, by returning to a few points on the \nunderlying bill. It is unfortunate, in my view, that this might be the \nonly piece of trade legislation that we move this entire Congress.\n  As you might guess, trade with Africa and the Caribbean Basin \ncountries is not that important to Alaska. I am deeply disappointed \nthat we are not looking at a WTO agreement with China. I continue to \nbelieve that President Clinton made a mistake by rejecting the deal \nthat was put together in April, and might not ever get put back \ntogether in the same manner. I am also deeply disappointed that we have \nnot considered trade negotiating authority that would be a strong vote \nof confidence as our negotiators head to the Seattle Round.\n  Nevertheless, I commend the Chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, and the Ranking Member, Senator Moynihan, and our \nMajority Leader for bringing this legislation to the floor. Perhaps, if \nwe are able to move forward on this piece of legislation, the logjam \nwill be broken. Let's hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in view of the very persuasive arguments of \nmy two colleagues, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the prior \nconsent agreement regarding the Conrad-Grassley amendment, that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my chairman in saying this is a \nvaluable amendment. Having been involved in drafting the legislation in \n1962 which created the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, I think this is \nan important extension of the same principle.\n  It is altogether agreeable to this Senator. I hope there will be no \nobjection.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Thank me?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. All of you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2359) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their support of the amendment. We appreciate it very much.\n  I think this amendment is a matter of fairness. I deeply appreciate \nthe response today. I hope this will prevail through the conference. I \nhave the utmost confidence in the chairman's ability to persuade our \ncolleagues over on the House side of the merits of this amendment.\n  I again thank the chairman. I thank our ranking member, who all along \nhas recognized that this is a logical extension of trade adjustment \nassistance we provide other workers in our economy.\n  I thank also my cosponsor, Senator Grassley from Iowa. He and I have \nworked together closely not only on this amendment but many other \nmatters as well. I thank him very much for his leadership and support.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be made an original cosponsor of amendment \nNo. 2408 relating to anticorruption efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2406\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the trade benefits accrue to firms and workers \n                         in sub-Saharan Africa)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 2406.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2406.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Termination of benefits for sub-Saharan African countries.''.\n\n       (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     take effect on October 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, we have to keep asking ourselves the key \nquestion: Growth and opportunity for whom?\n  It is an important question because the Africa trade legislation we \nare now considering does not require that Africans themselves be \nemployed at the firms that are going to receive the trade benefits. In \nfact, AGOA, as it now stands, actually takes a step backwards for \nAfrica. The GSP program requires that 35 percent of a product's value \nadded come from Africa, but this legislation actually lowers the bar to \n20 percent.\n  Under this scheme, it is possible that a product would meet the 20-\npercent requirement and qualify for AGOA benefits. For example, if non-\nAfrican workers physically standing in West Africa simply sewed a \n``Made in Togo'' label on apparel and then shipped it to the United \nStates, that is all they would have to do. It makes something of a \nmockery of how this is supposed to help African countries and African \nworkers.\n  This plan undercuts the potential for trade to boost African \nemployment and encourages transshipment of goods from third countries \nseeking to evade quotas. As I said before on the other amendment, the \nU.S. Customs Service has determined that for every $1 billion of \nillegally transshipped products that enter the United States, 40,000 \njobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost.\n  So this amendment would also fight transshipment but in another way, \nrequiring that 60 percent of the value added to a product has to come \nfrom Africa. It is a significant improvement over the 20 percent of the \nbill. I think it is an appropriate improvement over the 35 percent of \nthe GSP standard.\n  This amendment also emphasizes African opportunities. It requires \nthat any textile firm receiving trade benefits must employ a workforce \nthat is 90-percent African. This doesn't mean that all 90 percent of \nthe people have to come from a particular African country where the \ncompany might be or the activity might be, but they do have to be \ncitizens of an African country.\n  This provision holds out an incentive to African governments, \nbusinesses, and civil society to develop their human resources. That \nwould not only be good for Africa; it would be good for America, as \nwell as our trading partners in the region gaining economic strength.\n  Without these amendments, this legislation offers neither growth nor \nopportunity to Africans themselves. In fact, unless the Senate makes \nthese changes, we will simply see a continuation of a disturbing trend.\n  In the first 4 years of this decade, corporate profits in Africa \naverage 24 to 30 percent compared with 16 to 18 percent for all \ndeveloping countries. But real wages in Africa continue to fall, as \nthey have for nearly three decades now. The number of African families \nunable to meet their basic needs has doubled. It would be irresponsible \nto pass an African trade bill that reinforced this dangerous disconnect \nbetween corporate profits and African wages.\n  I know my colleagues who support the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct do so because they genuinely want to engage with the continent. I \nshare their goal, and I believe this amendment would push U.S. Africa \npolicy in that direction by linking economic growth and human \ndevelopment protecting both African and American interests.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Feingold's \namendment which incorporates provisions of S. 1636, the HOPE for Africa \nAct.\n  Frankly, this legislation would be better described as the ``No \nGrowth and No Opportunity Act.'' Even a cursory reading of the \nprovisions reflect an intent to throttle any form of productive \ninvestment in Africa. Rather than offering the nations of sub-Saharan \nAfrica the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty on their own \nterms, this bill says Africa will have to do so on our terms or not at \nall.\n  Let me explain why.\n  The sponsors of the bill have made two principal arguments on its \nbehalf: First, that it would expand trade; second, that it would yield \nresponsible investment in Africa. In fact, the bill would have the \nopposite effect on both counts. The bill would actually impose greater \nrestrictions on trade with Africa than would currently be the case and \nwould actively discourage any form of private investment.\n  For example, under the current GSP program, the rules require that \nproducts from beneficiary countries must contain 35-percent value added \nfor the beneficiary country to qualify; and the HOPE for Africa bill \nwould raise that to 60 percent, which would effectively end any \nprospects for firms in African countries that hope to enter into \nproduction-sharing arrangements for the assembly of products in Africa.\n  Current law does not impose any requirement that all employees of an \nenterprise be from the beneficiary country for the company's product to \nqualify. But the HOPE for Africa bill would dictate that 90 percent of \nthe employees of any enterprise producing textile and apparel goods \nmust be citizens of beneficiary countries. In other words, no legal \nresidents or immigrants would be employed in these plants above a \ncertain set limit.\n  How, I wonder, would the U.S. Customs Service enforce these \nprovisions? Would U.S. Customs have to investigate and certify every \nplant in advance? Would Customs have to require reports on all new \nhires by the individual enterprise? Or would Customs have to be \ninvolved in the individual firm's hiring decisions from the start in \norder to be sure the firm was precisely at 90-percent employment from \nbeneficiary countries?\n  In short, the amendment does exactly the opposite of what it purports \nto do. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in response to the chairman's remarks, I \nbelieve those provisions would be enforceable. We already have a \nmechanism where an import's country of origin must be verified. The \nconsent must also be verified. I suggest we use the same mechanisms in \nplace to certify African value content. In fact, it was indicated under \nGSP that it is a 35-percent requirement and under this bill is a 20-\npercent requirement.\n  The question doesn't seem to be whether we can enforce it or identify \nit; the question seems to be, What should the percentage be?\n  In response to the broader point that somehow this is going to be \nunfair to the countries of Africa, it is just the opposite. What we are \ntrying to avoid\n\n[[Page S13671]]\n\nwith this amendment is, in effect, the exploitation of African \ncountries as a way for other countries to get away with something they \ncan do right now very easily; for example, the Chinese willingness here \nto use transshipment through African companies to undercut American \njobs. All we are trying to do is have a reasonable assurance, in two \nways, that Africans are actually having a chance to do the work and \nthey are actually contributing to the product.\n  A 60-percent requirement is not 100 percent, it is a reasonable \nlevel. It still leaves room for joint activities with other entities. \nAnd a 90-percent requirement is not restricted, as the chairman has \nsuggested, to one country, but 90 percent have to be African citizens \nof any one of the over 50 African countries. It still leaves a 10-\npercent possibility for workers from other countries. If we don't do \nthis, this proposal has nothing to do with making sure African workers \nget an opportunity to have a decent living and to have these economic \nopportunities. This bill has to be a two-way street at some level, Mr. \nPresident; it is not that now. This amendment is a good-faith effort to \nmake it more balanced and to be fairer to African workers. I strongly \nsuggest it is a modest step that needs to be taken to improve this \nbill.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I don't wish to suggest there is \nanything but good intentions behind all these measures. But to \nintroduce the idea of--is it citizenship we are talking about, \nancestry, or what? What is an African, sir? South Africa would be part \nof the arrangements in this African Growth Act.\n  Suppose there was a plant in Johannesburg that was owned by the \ndescendants of Dutch settlers who arrived in the 17th century; some of \nthe managers were Indian persons who had emigrated in the 19th century \nunder the British Empire--under the British Empire, people moved all \nover the world. We recently had the great honor of meeting, just off \nthe Senate Chamber, with heads of state from the Caribbean area, and \nthe President of Trinidad and Tobago is of Indian ancestry. That is \nvery normal. Indians moved to California, having gone to the British \nEmpire and gone to Canada and were coming down. And suppose there were \nZulu workers there--African, obviously, but they are more recent \narrivals than most.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I wish to ask a question. Our bill only provides that \n90 percent of the people who work in the firm have to be citizens of an \nAfrican country. It does not suggest in any way anything about their \nethnic or racial background. I am very sensitive to that. I wonder if \nthe Senator is aware that that is the only requirement, so anyone who \nis a citizen of any one of the African countries, regardless of their \nbackground, would be within the 90 percent.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am aware of that, and I recognize that is a very \nreasonable thought. But I do know, from some experience in that part of \nthe world, that citizenship is not a standard statutory entitlement of \nthe individual, as it would be--well, even in our country, if you come \nhere, you have to go through a great deal to become a citizen. If you \nare born here, you already are. That can be a very ambiguous situation, \nsir. I don't know.\n  May I ask my friend, are Mauritians Africans or Indians? One of the \nbig issues, I can say to the Presiding Officer, is that in Mauritius a \nconsiderable textile trade has developed with Mauritian sponsors and \nChinese migrant workers. Are Mauritians Africans?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If you are suggesting they are citizens of Mauritius, \nfor the purposes of this bill, they would certainly qualify as people \nwho could be counted within the 90 percent.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If you are on the Indian Ocean, how sure are you that \nyou are in Africa?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is the definition of African countries as set forth \nin the bill. I believe that would be in the list of countries.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I get to the point, and I don't make it in any hostile \nmanner. I just say the complexities of the world, just that part of it, \nare very considerable. I am reluctant to see such categories enter \ntrade law. No one has ever asked whether the products of the American \nclothing workshops in New York City were made by American citizens. \nThere surely would have been a time when the majority--or many of \nthem--were not American citizens at all. They would have come from what \nwould become Poland, and there was no concept of citizenship for the \noccupants of the shtetls. I just suggest there is considerable \nambiguity. I don't wish to press the matter.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in response to that, I recognize the \nargument regarding American history. Surely there is a different \nscenario when we talk about African countries.\n  The problem I am trying to address--and I appreciate the Senator's \npoint--is that we are fearful, with good reason, that African countries \nwill be used as a conduit to allow the kind of activity the Chinese \nentities obviously intend to pursue, which is to essentially run these \nproducts through an African country, stamp the label on it, not really \nlet Africans play a significant role in producing the product, and \nundercut our quota laws. That is the reason for doing this. I don't \nthink it is particularly difficult to administer or to do when we \nsuggest we are talking here about citizenship of an African country \nwithout any other criteria.\n  We do allow for migration in Africa. We allow for Africa seeking out \nopportunities where they find them. We are trying to make sure this is \nsome nexus between this legislation and the opportunities for Africans \nto benefit, as well as large corporations that may benefit. This is an \nattempt to make the bill better. I think it is one that is not too \ndifficult to achieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me join in with the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  One of the areas I am trying to find with respect to the amount of \nwork or the amount of production or percent of production of an \narticle, it was found by merely placing the label on the article \nbecause one had to unload, load back, and assimilate in a particular \nway in order to get the label. The mere labeling was considered to be \n20 percent. That would have complied with parts of this particular CBI/\nSub-Sahara bill.\n  The requirement of the Senator from Wisconsin at 60 percent makes \nsure we can't get this specious argument about the percentage and the \nextra work of loading and unloading and putting it through a different \nset of machinery, tools, adding a label. That constitutes 20 percent. I \nunderstand the intent is to get investment and jobs with respect to the \nCaribbean Basin and with respect to the sub-Sahara countries. There is \nno question it is well considered. It ought to be at least 60 percent, \nas called for by Senator Feingold's amendment.\n  With respect to my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from \nNew York, dramatically asking the question, Can anybody name a country \nwhere they don't want American investment? That is very easily done. Go \nto Japan. They started this. Companies still can't get investment there \nunless the investment doesn't pay off as an investment. Companies have \nto have a license technology, make sure the jobs are there, make sure \nthe profits stay there.\n  We have been trying to invade the Japanese market for 50 years \nwithout success. They have their Ministry of Finance. They have their \nMinistry of Industry and Trade (MITI). There is no question, companies \ncan't get in there.\n  Go to China. Ask Boeing how they got in China. Read the book ``One \nWorld Ready or Not.'' It was pointed out, 40 percent of the Boeing 777 \nparts are not made up in Seattle or anywhere in the United States; they \nare made by investments in China. How do those investments happen? They \nsaid yes, you\n\n[[Page S13672]]\n\ncan invest here if you license the technology, if you produce the parts \nand create the jobs here and keep your profits here. That is fine \nbusiness.\n  To the rhetorical question, Does anyone know of a country that \ndoesn't want the American dollar? That is what they are talking about. \nI can tell Members, as we look at the stock market, they are going from \nthe American dollar to the Japanese yen or to the Deutsche mark. We \nwill be devaluing that dollar shortly at the rate of $300 billion trade \ndeficit and $127 billion fiscal deficit. We did not run a surplus at \nthe end of September; we ran a deficit of $127 billion. That is \naccording to the Treasury's own figures we submitted.\n  Yes, I can answer that question readily. These countries don't want \ninvestment unless you can get what I am trying to get. I am trying to \nget the jobs. I am trying to get the investment.\n  Don't tell a southern Governor how to carpetbag. We have been doing \nthat for years on end. I know it intimately. I have traveled all over \nthis country trying to solicit and bring industry to South Carolina. I \nwas the first Governor in the history of this country to go to Latin \nAmerica, and later took a gubernatorial mission after the election in \n1960 with some 27 State Governors, trying to get investment into South \nCarolina. I traveled to Europe. I called on Michelin in June of 1960. \nNow we have beautiful plants and the North American headquarters of \nMichelin. We can go down the list.\n  We know how to do it, and the others are doing it to us. We \nunderstand that. However, there is a degree of takeover, so to speak, \nor export of these jobs. We cannot afford it, particularly in the \ntextile area. It will happen in all the other hard industries, as has \nbeen characterized by Fingleton, if this continues.\n  Rather than talk about the agriculture getting a special trade \nrepresentative--agriculture is never left out. The Secretary of \nAgriculture is always there, the special trade representative, the \nexport-import financing is there; everything is there for agriculture. \nI don't mind them putting this amendment on there, but it points up, if \nMembers get politically the right support, they can get their amendment \naccepted around here even though it is not germane and it is not \nrelevant.\n  However, if one gets a good amendment as required, as both the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member required in \nthe NAFTA bill, it was included in the NAFTA bill. Fortunately, the \nranking member did vote with us. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nwent along and supported the side agreements with respect to labor, the \nside agreement with respect to the environment, and the reciprocity \nfrom both Canada and Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has used his \nhour under cloture.\n  Mr. ROTH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are 4 minutes equally divided before the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2379\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware said this \namendment would discourage investments. The very same amendment was \nincluded at his behest in the Finance Committee on NAFTA. It has not \ndiscouraged investment whatever in Mexico. On the contrary, the \nKoreans, the Chinese, Taiwanese, the Americans, everyone is investing \nlike gangbusters down in Mexico.\n  That is what they talk about, the success of NAFTA. So this is worded \nto include the language exactly as they have included it in the NAFTA \nagreement. Could it be on labor rights that this body wants to put a \nstamp of approval on a situation such as the example I gave of a 13-\nyear-old young girl working 100 hours at 13 cents an hour until 3 in \nthe morning? Do we want that kind of thing going on?\n  I am sure we do not want to put the stamp of approval on the threats \nthey will be killed when they ask for certain labor considerations down \nin Honduras. I went through all of those particular examples.\n  We do not want to invest in scab labor. What we want to invest in is \nan opportunity and an improved lot with the Caribbean Basin Initiative \nhere. So it is, the amendment should not be tabled. It is in force, \nworking with respect to NAFTA. There is no reason why it cannot work in \nthis particular place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to table the \namendment. I do so for two reasons. First, as I have stated previously, \nthe goal of this legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the \nCaribbean, and Central America. This amendment would undermine that \neffort by requiring the difficult negotiations of side agreements that \nwould delay the incentive the bill would create. That, I argue, is of \nno help to these developing countries and will not lead to any great \nimprovement in their labor standards.\n  The second reason I oppose the amendment is that it essentially \ndepends on economic sanctions to work. Its threat is that the economic \nbenefits of the beneficiary countries will be cut off if the countries \ndo not comply with the terms of some agreement yet to be negotiated. \nThat not only undercuts the investment incentive by increasing the \nuncertainty of a country's participation in the program, but it also \ndoes little to raise labor standards. For that reason, I urge this \namendment be tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join the chairman in urging this \nmatter be tabled. We have a fine underlying bill and we hope to take it \nto conference with as little encumbrance as can be, certainly none to \nwhich there would be instant objection on the House side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, under the provisions of the previous \nconsent, I now move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe a vote is scheduled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator is correct.\n  There are 4 minutes evenly divided for debate prior to the vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment simply intends to try to \nmake sure that the African portion of this legislation does not become \na mechanism whereby governments or businesses from China, for example, \nship their goods through Africa as a way to evade American quotas.\n  This is another process called transshipment. During the debate, I \npointed out that on a web site of the Chinese Government, they \nessentially say this is exactly what they are going to do. It is what \nthey are already doing.\n  We have put some responsibility on importers. American importers will \nhave the benefit of this bill to make sure they vouch for the \nlegitimate content of this product having some characteristic of being \nactually from Africa. It is a very important provision to make sure \nthis bill has some balance and it doesn't threaten American jobs. The \nfigures I quoted indicate that for every $1 billion in illegally \ntransshipped goods, it costs about 40,000 American jobs in the textile \nand related areas.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment that opposes the practice of \ntransshipment I think every Member of this body would like to support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and \nask that it be tabled.\n  First, the Finance Committee bill already contains the specifically \nenhanced transshipment provisions beyond those contained in the House \nbill. The Finance Committee bill would suspend exporters and importers \nfrom the benefits of the program for 2 years if found to have \ntransshipped in violation of the rule.\n  Second, the Customs Service already has extensive power to combat \ntransshipment. Let me be clear what transshipment is. It is Customs \nlaw. Customs already has the enforcement power to address these \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining votes in \nthis series be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe chairman and note that this measure, among other things, provides \nfor up to 5 years imprisonment for a third dispute. We don't want to \ncriminalize international trade.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me add that the Senator from Wisconsin \nhas done nothing to address my concerns regarding the constitutional \ninfirmity of his amendment. As I have already stated, my colleague's \namendment would expose individuals to criminal and civil penalties \nwithout the due process required by the U.S. Constitution. That is \nsimply unconscionable.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to vote to table the amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to respond to both the chairman \nand the ranking member.\n  They have suggested, it seems to me, that somehow this provision \nautomatically involves imprisonment. That is simply not correct. Under \nthe first offense, there is only a civil penalty involved for the \nimporter in the amount equal to 200 percent of the declared value of \nthe merchandise. A second offense then would involve perhaps up to 1 \nyear of imprisonment. It is only in a third offense that it would be 5 \nyears.\n  It is simply not correct to suggest that if somebody makes a mistake \nonce, suddenly they are going to be imprisoned. It is not nearly as \nharsh as that. It is a reasonable series of penalties for people who \nare going to get enormous benefit under this legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I believe I said \nthe provision provided ``up to'' on the third event. But we will not \ndispute it. The facts are accurately stated by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table \namendment No. 2428. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2483\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Under the previous \norder, there are 4 minutes of debate equally divided for the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2483. The Senate will be in order. Who yields time? \nThe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this amendment is nothing more than the \nprevious amendment on side agreements on labor. This one would require \nthe side agreements with respect to the environment. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer knows I know the feeling of strength out on the west \ncoast for the environment. I have traveled up there, for example, in \nPuget Sound and have had the hearings with Dixie Lee Ray when she was \nthe oceanographer, John Linberg, and all the rest. I come back to the \nstatement by my distinguished ranking member quoted in the Wall Street \nJournal this morning----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we do not have order. We cannot hear the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators will take their conversations to \nthe Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As quoted in the morning Wall Street Journal, the \ndistinguished Senator Moynihan of New York said:\n\n       We were planning to spend a few days in Seattle, just \n     meeting people.\n\n  But if you could not get this bill passed, they would not have any \ncredibility.\n\n       I don't want to show my face.\n\n  I know in general the Democrats are considered prolabor and the \nRepublicans are considered generally as antilabor. But with respect to \nthe environment it has been bipartisan. There\n\n[[Page S13674]]\n\nwas no stronger protector of the environment than our late friend, John \nChafee of Rhode Island. He led the way for Republicans and Democrats. I \nwould not want to show my face in Seattle, having voted that you could \nnot even sit down, talk, and negotiate something on the environment, \nthe very same provisions that the chairman of the Finance Committee \nrequired in the NAFTA agreement. It is in the NAFTA agreement. I am \nonly saying, since we are going to extend NAFTA to the CBI, let's put \nthe same requirements there with consideration for the environment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I say that will teach me to ask for \norder when the Senator from South Carolina is speaking.\n  But we are required, as managers, to make the same point on this \nmeasure, this amendment, that we made on the earlier Hollings \namendment. This would require us to negotiate 147 environmental \nagreements around the world before any of the provisions of the African \nbill or the Caribbean Basin Initiative or the tariff preferences under \nthe Generalized System of Preferences can be extended.\n  NAFTA was a relatively simple three-party negotiation. We have very \nfew differences with Canada, and such as we had with Mexico were worked \nout. In so many of the countries we are talking about in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, the nation, the area, is an environmental disaster. That is why \nwe are trying to develop some trade, some economic influx--trade not \naid. We would not do it. What would be your standard for the Sudan? \nWhat would be your standard for parts of the Congo? What would you know \nabout the country with which you are negotiating?\n  These are terribly distressed regions. We have had three decades of \ndeclining income, of rising chaos. The best hopes are the countries \nthat want this agreement. We are not going to leave environment behind, \nbut we should move ahead on this measure. I think my chairman agrees \nwith me in this matter. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2483.\n  The yeas and nays have previously been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

There is now 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 2485.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, by this vote we will determine whether \nwe are for foreign aid or foreign trade. The truth is that the Marshall \nPlan in foreign aid is really a wonderful thing. We have defeated \ncommunism with capitalism. It has worked.\n  But now after 50 years, with running deficits in excess of $100 \nbillion for some 20 years, we are just infusing more money into the \neconomy than we are willing to take in. There was the deficit of $127 \nbillion here just at the end of September for the year 1999; otherwise, \nrunning a deficit in the balance of trade of $300 billion; then with \nour current account deficit totaling $726 billion in the last 7 years \nand our net external assets really in the liabilities over the last 7 \nyears from $71 billion to $831 billion.\n  We are going out of business. It would be a wonderful thing. But \nlet's have some reciprocity. All we are saying is, when we make an \nagreement, we take some of these particular regulations affecting, for \nexample, textiles--there is a whole book of them here--and if we lower \nours, let them lower theirs.\n  Cordell Hull, 65 years ago, with the reciprocal trade agreements of \n1934, is what got the country going again industrially, and that is \nwhat will get it going again if we obey the reciprocity that we \nincluded in NAFTA.\n  All I am trying to do, if we are going to extend NAFTA, let's have \nthe same reciprocity we had in NAFTA in these particular CBI \nagreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I do so for three \nreasons. The first reason, as I have stated previously, is that the \npurpose of this legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the \nCaribbean, and Central America by offering these poverty-stricken \ncountries a measure of preferential access to our markets.\n  This amendment would undermine that effort by making eligibility \nexplicitly dependent on the offer of reciprocal benefits to the United \nStates equivalent to those that the U.S. is entitled under NAFTA. This \nis a standard even the WTO members among the beneficiary countries \ncould not currently satisfy.\n  The second reason I oppose the amendment is that the Finance \nCommittee bill already instructs the President to begin the process of \nnegotiating with the beneficiary countries under both programs for \ntrade agreements that would provide reciprocal market access to the \nUnited States, as well as a still more solid foundation for the long-\nterm economic relationship between the United States and its African, \nCaribbean, and Central American neighbors.\n  Finally, let me point out that the bill does encourage reciprocity \nwhere it really counts in the context of this bill. By encouraging the \nuse of U.S. fabric and U.S. yarn in the assembly of apparel products \nbound for the United States, the bill establishes a solid economic \npartnership between industry in the United States and firms in the \nbeneficiary countries. That provides real benefits to American firms \nand workers in the textile industry by establishing a platform from \nwhich American textile makers can compete worldwide. That is precisely \nthe benefit our industry most seeks in the context of our growing \neconomic relationship with both regions.\n  In short, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment at the Justice Department's decision not to defend a law \nof Congress regarding voluntary confessions.\n  Last evening, the Justice Department responded to the petition for \ncertiorari from the Fourth Circuit Dickerson case, which had upheld 18 \nU.S.C. Section 3501, a law the Congress passed in 1968 to govern \nvoluntary confessions. The Department refused to defend the law, \narguing that it is unconstitutional under Miranda v. Arizona.\n  This position should not be surprising. Earlier, the Clinton Justice \nDepartment had refused to defend the law in the lower Federal courts. \nIt had prohibited a career Federal prosecutor from raising the statute \nto prevent Dickerson, a serial bank robber, from going free, and had \nactively refused to permit other prosecutors from using the statute. \nHowever, it had held out the possibility that it would defend the law \nbefore the Supreme Court. Indeed, prior to the time the Department was \nforced to take a position in the Dickerson case, the Attorney General \nand Deputy Attorney General had indicated to the Judiciary Committee \nthat the Department would defend Section 3501 in appropriate cases.\n  The Attorney General's refusal to enforce the law puts her at odds \nwith her predecessors. Former Attorneys General Meese, Thornburg, and \nBarr have informed me through letters that they did not prevent the \nstatute from being used during their tenures, and indeed, that the \nstatute had been advanced in some lower court cases in prior \nAdministrations. They added that the law should be enforced today. \nDuring a hearing on this issue in the Judiciary Criminal Justice \nOversight Subcommittee, which I chair, all the witnesses except one \nshared this view.\n  The position of the Justice Department is also contrary to the views \nof law enforcement groups, which believe that Miranda warnings normally \nshould be given but that we should not permit legal technicalities to \nstand in the way of an otherwise voluntary confession and justified \nprosecution. Most recently, according to press reports, even Federal \nprosecutors urged Justice officials to defend this law. It was all to \nno avail. In my view, the Department has a duty to defend this law, \njust as it should defend any law that is not clearly unconstitutional. \nEach court that has directly considered the issue has upheld the law. \nNevertheless, the Justice Department will not abide by its duty to \ndefend the statute, and I believe it is critical that the Congress file \nan amicus brief or intervene in the Supreme Court defending it.\n  In this case, the Justice Department has deliberately chosen to side \nwith defense attorneys over prosecutors and law enforcement. It has \ndeliberately chosen to side with criminals over victims and their \nfamilies. This is a serious error. The Department should not make \narguments in the courts on behalf of criminals. This is a sad day for \nthe Department of Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13675-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13675-S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THUGGERY IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn in the strongest \nmanner possible the anti-democratic violence that continues in Kosovo. \nThis violence takes many forms, the most widely publicized of which is \nattacks by ethnic Albanians on Serbs and other minority groups in the \nprovince. KFOR and the U.N. Mission must stamp out these attacks \nimmediately.\n  What has received less media attention is the intimidation, and \noccasional violence, within the ethnic Albanian\n\n[[Page S13676]]\n\ncommunity. Recently there were public threats against the lives of two \nof Kosovo's most respected journalists, Veton Surroi and Baton Haxhiu, \neditors of the newspaper ``Koha Ditore.''\n  On my trip to Kosovo eight weeks ago, I met with Mr. Surroi. He had \nalready spoken out against violence against Kosovo's Serbs and was \nalready receiving private threats as a result. Mr. Surroi is a worldly, \ncourageous democrat--exactly the sort of person that Kosovo needs to \nachieve genuine democracy.\n  During the same trip, I also met with Hashim Thaqi, political leader \nof the Kosovo Liberation Army. I told Mr. Thaqi that he and his forces \nwould have to submit unconditionally to civilian authority and respect \nthe rights of all political parties, ethnic groups, and individuals in \nKosovo.\n  With this as background, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nan open letter published in Kosova Sot on October 29, 1999 by James R. \nHooper, President of the Balkan Action Council, to Mr. Thaqi appear in \nthe Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. Hooper, incidentally, testified before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee earlier this year and is considered to be one of this \ncountry's most knowledgeable experts on the Balkans.\n  Mr. President, those of us in the Congress who supported the \nlegitimate rights of the people of Kosovo to escape the brutality of \nSlobodan Milosevic will not stand idly by and watch a Serbian \ntyrannical master be replaced by an ethnic Albanian one.\n  As Mr. Hooper's eloquent letter makes clear, Mr. Thaqi and the other \nleaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army must immediately and forcefully \nspeak out against the thuggery that is afflicting the province and take \nmeasures to eradicate it.\n  Mr. President, if they do not, they will lose the support of the \ninternational community. And without that support, they themselves have \nno political future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                                                 October 29, 1999.\n       Open Letter to Hashim Thaqi:  I am deeply troubled by the \n     public threats against Veton Surroi and Baton Haxhiu of Koha \n     Ditore that recently appeared in Kosovapress, the media organ \n     associated with your organization. Surroi and Haxhiu are \n     viewed in the United States and Europe as two of the most \n     prominent supporters of democracy and free speech in Kosovo. \n     If they are at risk, it means that Kosovo's hopes for \n     democracy and free speech are jeopardized as well.\n       Your unwillingness to immediately condemn such extreme \n     attacks on two outstanding representatives of Kosovo's civil \n     society suggests that you hold a vision of Kosovo's political \n     future in which those who democratically express differences \n     of opinion will not be tolerated, and dissent will be harshly \n     disciplined.\n       This in turn projects to your fellow citizens an anti-\n     democratic attitude that is intolerable. And it conveys the \n     impression to the international community that you and some \n     of your former KLA colleagues maintain a hidden agenda for \n     Kosovo that is far from democratic.\n       I want to make one thing absolutely clear: I am convinced \n     there will be no support among Kosovo's friends around the \n     world, including me, for the replacement of a Serbian \n     dictatorship by an ethnic Albanian copy. If Kosovo's future \n     is not to be democratic, then it will not likely be \n     independent either. Independence must be earned in the \n     democratic political arena as well as on the battlefield. \n     Support among the American people and their elected \n     representatives and government for the people of Kosovo would \n     disappear rapidly if Kosovo moved in non-democratic \n     directions.\n       Unfortunately, the actions of some who support you, and \n     your own apparent indifference and inaction in the face of \n     the killing of Kosovo citizens, are already jeopardizing the \n     continuation of that support. The pattern of violence against \n     Kosovo Serbs appears to reflect in part an organized effort \n     by some in the former KLA to expel all Serbs from Kosovo. The \n     murder of elderly Serbs and unarmed villagers evokes an \n     atmosphere of terror in which innocent minorities are \n     brutalized by those with the power to dispense victor's \n     ``justice.''\n       A Kosovo in which the rights of non-Albanian minorities are \n     routinely violated is not likely to prove respectful of \n     Albanians whose views do not fit those of the prevailing \n     forces. After all, this is the model Belgrade used for over \n     ten years. A mono-ethnic Kosovo forcibly cleansed of its \n     minorities through violence is unlikely to be a democratic \n     Kosovo.\n       While you have spoken out against the killings of ethnic \n     Serbs in the past, you have taken few serious steps to rein \n     in those who are organizing the violence. I strongly urge you \n     to take determined action to remove suspicions that you \n     condone the violence against Kosovo's non-Albanian minorities \n     and to condemn the threats to Veton Surroi and Baton Haxhiu.\n\n                                                 James Hooper,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                            Balkan Action Council.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13676-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am not going to ask for a recorded vote \nagainst S. 688, the re-authorization of the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation. But I want to make it clear that I am not stepping back \nfrom my philosophies on this issue.\n  During my campaign for the United States Senate, I stressed the \nthemes of balancing the budget, congressional reform, making government \nsmaller, and moving the power out of Washington and into the states and \nlocalities. That is why I introduced the ``Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation Termination Act.''\n  I still fee it is time to end this form of subsidies for large \ncompanies. I have never believed in giveaway programs. Whether you are \na farmer or a large corporation you should play by the rules of the \nfree market system. Less government should be in the motto of this and \nevery Congress.\n  OPIC may seem to have a good end goal but the problem is not the end \nbut the means. Basically this is an insurance program run by the \nFederal Government for corporations who want to invest in risky \npolitical situations. This leads to the question, ``Is this the \nappropriate role for government?'' I don't believe so. But I also \nunderstand that the time is not yet ripe for ending this program.\n  I have met with the President of OPIC, George Munoz. He and I have \nagreed that our problem is not a conflict of interest, not different \ngoals, and not a lack of proper communication. We merely have a \nfundamental philosophical difference. I believe free trade means free \ntrade, not ``more free than others.''\n  I am a free trader. I am a supporter of the GATT and NAFTA. I believe \nthat free trade is the best way to raise the living standards for all \nAmericans. We need to support policies that reduce trade barriers. OPIC \ndoes not reduce trade barriers for all companies to compete in the \nmarketplace. It is an income transfer program from U.S. taxpayers to a \nselected group of businesses. These subsidies may increase exports for \na few selected companies that have the political influence to secure \nthese loans, but it does little to expand the overall economic growth \nof this country.\n  OPIC's re-authorization will soon pass this Senate, but I wish it to \nbe known that I still recommend its termination. I continue to worry \nthat the majority of my colleagues will not fully understand the \ndetrimental potentialities of this organization until the American \ntaxpayer is stuck with a tremendous bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13676-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COSPONSORSHIP OF AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. ROBB.

A bill to provide for the transfer of public lands to \ncertain California Indian tribes; to the Committee on Indian affairs.\n\n\n                  california indian land transfer act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the California \nIndian Land Transfer Act, which would transfer to eight California \ntribes approximately 3,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \nland to be used for housing construction, grazing, resource protection, \nand non-gaming economic development.\n  The eight tribes are the Pit River Tribe (Modoc County), the Fort \nBidwell Indian Community (Modoc County), the Pala Band of Mission \nIndians (San Diego County), the Cuyapaipe Band of Mission Indians (San \nDiego County), the Manzanita Band of Mission Indians (San Diego \nCounty), the Barona Band of Mission Indians (San Diego County), and the \nMorongo Band of Mission Indians (Riverside County).\n  All of the parcels of BLM land are contiguous to existing reservation \ntrust lands and have been formally classified as suitable for disposal \nthrough the BLM land use planning process.\n  Many California Indian tribes now lack reservations of sufficient \nsize to provide housing or an economic base adequate to meet the needs \nof their members and their families. Other California Indian \nreservations have such poor quality lands that the tribal options for \neconomic development are extremely limited. This situation derives from \nthe complex history of federal-tribal relations in California. Instead \nof the approximately 8.5 million acres of land promised in the \ntreaties, the California tribes now reside on a little more than \n400,000 acres. Approximately one-third of California's 107 federally \nrecognized tribes have a land base of less than 50 acres; approximately \ntwo-thirds have a land base of less than 500 acres, leaving little \nopportunity for these tribes to develop viable communities and \neconomies where their members can live and work.\n  The counties in which these lands are located support the tribes' \nefforts to acquire these lands and have participated in the federal \nland planning process through which these parcels were identified and \nmade available for transfer to the tribes. This legislation also has \nthe support of the Administration. A similar bill, H.R. 2742, passed \nthe House of Representatives last Congress and was placed on the \nSenate's consent calendar but was never brought to a vote before \nadjournment. An earlier version of the bill suffered the same fate in \nthe 104th Congress and I am informed that the negotiations between the \nDepartment of the Interior and the Tribes for transfer of these lands \ndate back to 1994.\n  This legislation is the result of a multiyear cooperative effort by \nthe tribes, the Secretary, the BLM and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in \nconsultation with local country governments. This effort allows me to \npresent a model legislative blueprint for interagency transfer of \nfederal lands as a means of enhancing the extremely limited land and \nresources base of California's small tribes. The bill also stands as an \nexcellent example of federal, tribal, and local governmental \nconsultation and collaboration within the planning process for \ndisposition of federal lands that have been formally classified as \nsuitable for disposal. It is time for Congress to do its part and \nconclude this successful intergovernmental collaboration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport from the eight tribes and four counties affected by this \nlegislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1840\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``California Indian Land \n     Transfer Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

As you know, the Administration has twice \n     forwarded proposed legislation to Congress (in the 104th and \n     the 105th) to effect these land transfers which must be done \n     legislatively. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has worked \n     cooperatively for many years with the eight Tribes and the \n     local governments involved to see these transfers are \n     completed.\n       The tribes, acreages, and counties involved are as follows:\n       Barona, 5 acres, San Diego County:\n       Cuyapaipe, 1,360 acres, San Diego County;\n       Fort Bidwell, 300 acres, Modoc County;\n       Fort Independence, 200 acres, Inyo County;\n       Morongo, 40 acres, San Diego County;\n       Manzanita, 1,000 acres, San Diego County;\n       Pala, 60 acres, San Diego County; and\n       XL Ranch/Pit River, 562 acres, Modoc County.\n       In each of these cases the lands are surrounded by or \n     directly adjacent to the Tribes' existing reservations. The \n     tracts identified represent scattered, unmanageable tracts of \n     public lands that have been identified in our land use plans \n     for disposal. The Tribes have indicated these lands will add \n     to economic viability of their reservations and we are \n     pleased to assist them in this important endeavor.\n       We look forward to introduction of your legislation in the \n     106th Congress on this important public issue. Please let us \n     know if we can assist you in any way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Elaine Marquis-Brong\n     (For Al Wright, Acting State Director).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Resolution No. 99-34\n\n       Be it hereby Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors \n     affirms its earlier support (in Resolutions 95-29 and 96-39) \n     of the introduction of the California Indian Land Transfer \n     Act (copy attached), which would transfer approximately 860 \n     acres of public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of \n     Land Management to the United States of America in trust for \n     the Pit River Tribe (560 acres) and the Fort Bidwell \n     Community of Paiute Indians (300 acres) to be added to the \n     tribal trust lands of their respective reservations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Board of Supervisors,\n\n\n                                          County of Riverside,\n\n                                   Riverside, CA, August 31, 1999.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Suite 112, Senate Hart Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We are writing to convey our support \n     for the California Indian land Transfer Act (CILTA) and to \n     urge your support of this legislation. CILTA would transfer \n     to eight California Indian tribes a total of approximately \n     3,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to be \n     used for housing construction, grazing, resource protection, \n     and non-gaming economic development.\n       In our district this would mean the transfer of \n     approximately 40 acres, presently under the jurisdiction of \n     the Bureau of Land management to the United States of America \n     in trust for the Morongo Land of Mission Indians to be added \n     to the tribal trust lands of the Morongo Indian Reservation.\n       The current version of the CILTA passed the House of \n     Representative last year as H.R. 2742 and was placed on the \n     Senate's consent calendar, but was never brought to a vote \n     before adjournment. Last session was the second time that the \n     bill has passed the House without timely action in the \n     Senate.\n       California county governments have been supportive of the \n     tribes' past efforts to obtain additional lands for such uses \n     as housing, grazing, resource protection, and non-gaming \n     economic development. Moreover, county governments have had \n     varying degrees of involvement with the federal and planning \n     process through which these parcels were identified and made \n     available for transfer to the tribes.\n       CILTA has the unqualified support of the Administration, \n     which has invested considered time and effort in urging its \n     enactment. The Secretary of the Interior personally \n     transmitted the bill to the Congress last year with his \n     strong recommendation that it be enacted at the earliest \n     possible date. The Secretary remains similarly committed to\n\n[[Page S13681]]\n\n     supporting the bill's passage during the current session of \n     Congress.\n       CILTA is the result of a multi-year, cooperative effort by \n     the tribes, the Secretary, the BLM and the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs, in consultation with local county governments. It \n     presents a model legislative blueprint for inter-agency \n     transfer of federal lands as a means of enhancing the \n     extremely limited land and resource base of California's \n     small tribes. It also illustrates how federal, tribal and \n     local governmental consultation can successfully occur within \n     the framework of an existing federal planning process.\n       We hope this letter conveys our support for this important \n     legislation and urge you to support its passage.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                      Jim Venable,\n     Supervisor, Third District.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Resolution No. 99-170\n\n       Now, be it resolved by the Board of Supervisors of the \n     County of San Diego, supports the introduction of the \n     California Indian Land Transfer Act, which would transfer a \n     total of approximately 2,525 acres of public lands under the \n     jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management to the United \n     States of America in trust for the Barona (5.03 acres), \n     Cuyapaipe (1,360 acres), Manzanita (1,000.78 acres), and Pala \n     (59.20) acres) Bands of Mission Indians to be added to the \n     tribal trust lands of their respective reservations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Resolution No. 99-41\n\n       Whereas, on July 6, 1999, the Fort Independence Indian \n     Community asked the County to reiterate its support for the \n     California Indian Land Transfer Act, and explained the \n     Tribe's need for the additional land, the history of the land \n     proposed for transfer, and the Tribe's plans for development \n     and use of the lands; and\n       Whereas, this Board desires to both promote economic \n     development and enhance the quality of life within the County \n     and believes that the Tribe's proposed development could play \n     a vital role in these goals by improving the economic, social \n     and cultural health of both the Tribe and the County; and\n       Whereas, this Board desires to provide for the County \n     adequate housing, jobs, economic development, and \n     recreational and cultural amenities through a reasonable land \n     development plan that ensures the provision of necessary \n     public services and facilities and eliminates or mitigates \n     any potential negative impacts of such development; and\n       Whereas, the Tribe has notified the Board that it shares \n     these same concerns about their shared community; and\n       Whereas, the Board recognizes the Tribe's sovereignty; and\n       Whereas, the Tribe has expressed its desire to the Board to \n     work with the County in a government-to-government \n     relationship to ensure that Tribal development of the parcel \n     proposed for transfer will provide the community with \n     necessary housing and economic development without \n     compromising the environmental, health, safety or welfare \n     concerns of the region; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Inyo, \n     State of California, that it supports the California Indian \n     Land Transfer Act, and the included transfer to the Fort \n     Independence Indian Community of the 200-acre parcel of \n     Bureau of Land Management land which is contiguous to the \n     existing reservation, provided that the Fort Independence \n     Indian Community agrees with a Memorandum of Understanding, \n     which provides for a mutually agreeable method of dispute \n     resolution, to bring its proposed development plan back to \n     the County in order to discuss, on a government-to-government \n     basis, how applicable federal and tribal laws will address \n     the following issues/concerns, and, in those situations where \n     the County is of the opinion that federal and tribal laws do \n     not adequately address its concerns, to discuss what \n     standards and/or approaches the Tribe might incorporate into \n     its development plan or laws, looking to state and local laws \n     for guidance, so to address, to a reasonable extent, the \n     County's concerns:\n       (1) Building design and construction;\n       (2) Land use, planning and zoning;\n       (3) Health;\n       (4) Environmental health;\n       (5) Animal control;\n       (6) Streets, highways and roads;\n       (7) Environmental quality;\n       (8) Police protection;\n       (9) Fire protection;\n       (10) Water supply;\n       (11) Sewage disposal;\n       (12) School facilities;\n       (13) Funding for county-provided services; and\n       (14) Gaming.\n       Be it further Resolved, That the Clerk of the Board is \n     directed to distribute this Resolution to the Fort \n     Independence Indian Tribal Council, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, United States Senators Boxer and Feinstein, the \n     Governor of the State of California, representatives of Inyo \n     County in the United States House of Representatives and the \n     California Legislature; the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the \n     Bureau of Land Management.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1999.\n     San Diego County Board of Supervisors,\n     1600 Pacific Hwy, Room 335,\n     San Diego, CA.\n       Dear Supervisors: I am writing to you regarding the \n     transferal of surplus Bureau of Land Management land parcels \n     to the Barona, Cuyapaipe and Manzanita Bands of Mission \n     Indians in San Diego County. It is my understanding that the \n     Board of Supervisors will be considering a resolution to \n     support the introduction of the California Indian Land \n     Transfer Act (CILTA) in Congress to authorize this transferal \n     and I wanted to make you aware of my continued support for \n     this effort.\n       I firmly believe that this transferal will promote tribal \n     sovereignty while, at the same time, provide numerous \n     benefits to our San Diego county communities. As you may \n     know, I voted in favor of the CILTA when it passed the House \n     of Representatives on two separate occasions. Despite this \n     support, however, this legislation has failed to receive \n     adequate consideration in the Senate.\n       It is for this reason that I was pleased to learn that \n     Senator Barbara Boxer has expressed interest in reintroducing \n     the CILTA in the 106th Congress. Taking into consideration \n     the numerous endorsements this effort has received in the \n     past, coupled with the fact that these land parcels will be \n     used for ``non-gaming'' economic and community development, \n     it is my full intention to once again support this \n     legislation when it is considered by the House.\n       Thank you for your time and allowing me to express my \n     thoughts on this important issue. If you have any questions \n     regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me \n     directly, or Michael Harrison in my office at (202) 255-5672.\n       With best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Duncan Hunter,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Fort Independence\n\n\n                                           Indian Reservation,\n\n                               Independence, CA, October 13, 1999.\n     Re California Indian Land Transfer Act.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the Fort Independence \n     Community of Paiute Indians, I want to express our thanks for \n     your agreement to introduce the California Indian Land \n     Transfer Act, a bill that would transfer to eight California \n     Indian Tribes a total of approximately 3,500 acres of Bureau \n     of Land Management (BLM) land to be used for housing \n     construction, grazing resource protection and nongaming \n     economic development. Under the bill's provisions, our tribe \n     will acquire approximately 200 acres of BLM land. These lands \n     would be added to the tribal trust lands of the Fort \n     Independence Indian Reservation. We expect to use the land \n     for non-gaming economic development.\n       We sincerely appreciate your support for this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Wendy L. Stine,\n     Chairperson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Barona Band of Mission Indians,\n\n                                      Lakeside, CA, March 9, 1999.\n     Re Proposed Southern California Indian Land Transfer Act.\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer: By now you should have received the \n     letter of today's date from Stephen V. Quesenberry of \n     California Indian Legal Services, voicing the support of his \n     six tribal clients of the above proposed bill. The Barona \n     Band of Mission Indians is the seventh Californian tribe that \n     would benefit from this bill. We are writing to you \n     separately to add our support for the bill, which was passed \n     in the House in the last session, only to die from inaction \n     in the Senate. Because Congressman Young does not want to \n     introduce it in the House, where we expect little or no \n     opposition at all.\n       As for the fear that the Barona Band might use the land to \n     be acquired under this bill for gaming purposes, we have two \n     simple responses. First, the 5.03 acres that we would obtain \n     is far too small and far too remote to be used for this \n     purpose. Instead, we would use it for watershed, cattle \n     grazing, and wildlife habitat. This small parcel is over a \n     mile from the nearest paved road, across fairly rough \n     country. Second, the Barona Band already has a very \n     successful gaming enterprise on its primary reservation \n     adjacent to a country road, and therefore does not need any \n     further gaming locations. In addition, the bill itself \n     specifies that this land is not being transferred for gaming \n     purposes in any event.\n       Instead of lengthening this letter by repeating the \n     statements presented by Mr. Quesenberry on behalf of his \n     tribal clients, we will just adopt them as our own, and urge \n     you to introduce and vigorously support this non-\n     controversial bill on behalf of the Barona Band and other \n     California tribes which would benefit from it.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Clifford M. LaChappa,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Barona Band of Mission Indians,\n\n                                      Lakeside, CA, June 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: During the 105th Congress, Congressman \n     Don Young introduced the California Indian Land Transfer Act, \n     H.R. 2742, a bill that would transfer approximately 3,500 \n     acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to a number of \n     Indian tribes located in California, including\n\n[[Page S13682]]\n\n     5.03 acres for the Barona Band of Mission Indians. Attached, \n     please find a resolution recently adopted by the Barona Band \n     of Mission Indians Tribal Council urging you to sponsor \n     similar legislation in the United States Senate this year.\n       As you know, since the early 1930's, the Barona Band has \n     been located on approximately 5,500 acres in rural eastern \n     San Diego County and is home to approximately 300 people. We \n     came to this land after the City of San Diego bought our \n     reservation as a reservoir site and forced us to move. \n     Therefore, the passage of this bill is very important to our \n     history and our future.\n       As drafted, H.R. 2742 would place a number of restrictions \n     on the use of the new lands. Perhaps most noteworthy is the \n     provision baring the use of any such lands for gaming \n     purposes. Although as a sovereign government we object to any \n     restriction being placed on the use of our lands, we \n     understand that the political nature of this bill demands \n     such a restriction.\n       Finally, we are encouraged by the action taken by the San \n     Diego County Board when they too adopted a resolution in \n     support of the proposed legislation. We are hopeful that this \n     demonstration of government unity will give you the \n     encouragement necessary to carry this bill forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Clifford M. LaChappa,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Resolution No. 06-2299\n\n       Whereas: The Barona Band of Mission Indians is among the \n     104 Federally recognized Indian Tribes located in the State \n     of California; and,\n       Whereas: Indian Tribes located in California retain rights \n     to fewer than 500,000 acres of land, seventy-five percent of \n     which is held in Trust by the United States Government on \n     behalf of 14 tribes; and,\n       Whereas: The Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is \n     considering large scale transfers of trust lands to local \n     governments in California, and to the State of California; \n     and,\n       Whereas: The Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is \n     considering large scale transfers of trust lands to local \n     governments in California, and to the State of California; \n     and,\n       Whereas: California Indian Legal Services has been working \n     diligently over the past three years to secure passage of \n     Federal Legislation to transfer approximately 3,600 acres of \n     BLM trust land to 10 specific tribes; and,\n       Whereas: The Elected leaders of California have a unique \n     responsibility to help California tribes address the issue of \n     securing additional lands so that tribes may develop stronger \n     economies; and,\n       Whereas: On June 15th, the San Diego county Board of \n     Supervisors unanimously voted to support this transfer of \n     land; and, be it therefore\n       Resolved: That the Barona Band of Mission Indians urges \n     Senator Barbara Boxer and Senator Dianne Feinstein to sponsor \n     legislation to transfer such lands as identified by the \n     California Indian Legal Services from the BLM to benefit \n     California tribes and work for the passage of such \n     legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Barona Band of Mission Indians,\n\n                                   Lakeside, CA, October 14, 1999.\n     Re California Indian Land Transfer Act.\n\n     Hon.

It is our \n     understanding that your staff has been working on this matter \n     with Tribes and their representatives.\n       As you are aware, this proposed legislation is similar to \n     legislation that was previously enacted transferring other \n     Bureau of Land Management land to California Indian Tribes.\n       We appreciate your efforts in this area, as well as your \n     support of the Tribes in California on the range of \n     legislative issues and challenges that native Americans face.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          Mary Ann Martin Andreas,\n                                                      Chairperson.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1845. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe sale or transfer of a firearm or ammunition to an intoxicated \nperson; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    gun sales to intoxicated persons\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last July, when the Senate \nconsidered the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, I offered an \namendment to prohibit the sale of guns to people who were intoxicated.\n\n  State and local laws prohibit intoxicated people from operating a \ncar, a boat, a snowmobile, a plane, an all-terrain vehicle, or a \nbicycle. There is even one state law that prohibits an intoxicated \nperson from getting a tattoo. In addition, federal law prohibits an \nintoxicated person from enlisting in the military. And, federal gun \nlaws prohibit the sale of a gun to a drug user.\n  My amendment simply built on this record. All it said is that if you \nare intoxicated, you cannot buy a gun or ammunition. To me, it just \nmakes common sense that someone who is drunk should not be able to buy \na gun. And, the Senate agreed because my amendment was passed \nunanimously.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the conference committee dropped this \nprovision from the bill. I am extremely disappointed that such a \ncommon-sense proposal would be abandoned by the Senate leadership.\n  So, today, I am introducing--along with my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg--this very reasonable proposal as a free-standing bill.\n  Mr. President, guns and alcohol do not mix. A 1997 study in the \nJournal of American Medical Association found that ``alcohol and \nillicit drug use appear to be associated with an increased risk of \nviolent death.'' And as the two stories I want to share today \nillustrate, alcohol is also associated with an increased risk of \nserious injury.\n  The first story is about a woman by the name of Deborah Kitchen. She \nis a quadriplegic, and she got that way because her ex-boyfriend shot \nher.\n  On the day of the shooting, Deborah's boyfriend, Thomas Knapp, \nconsumed--by his own estimate--a fifth of whiskey and a case of beer. \nHe went to K-Mart in Florida to buy a .22-caliber rifle and a box of \nbullets. Mr. Knapp was so intoxicated that the clerk had to help him \nfill out the federal form required to purchase the gun. But he was \nstill able to buy the rifle.\n  Mr. Knapp then took that rifle, shot his ex-girlfriend Deborah \nKitchen, and left her a quadriplegic.\n  The second story is from Michigan. It involves an 18-year-old named \nWalter McKay, who had engaged in a day-long drinking spree and then \nwent and bought ammunition for his shotgun. He was so intoxicated that \nhe could not remember whether it was a man or woman who sold him the \nammunition and could not identify what he purchased.\n  He took those shotgun shells, loaded his gun, and intended to shoot \nout the back window of an acquaintance's truck. He was intoxicated. The \nshot missed, ricocheted off the wheel of the truck, and hit Anthony \nBuczkowski. Mr. Buczkowski had to have a finger amputated and his left \nwrist surgically fused.\n  Mr. Knapp and Mr. McKay could buy a gun and ammunition because it is \nnot--I repeat, not--against the law to sell a gun or ammunition to \nsomeone who is intoxicated.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, states and localities have all \nsorts of laws prohibiting people who are intoxicated from doing certain \nthings. But, I am unaware of a single state law that prohibits someone \nwho is drunk from buying a gun or ammunition.\n  It would be nice if states would act. But, gun sales are largely \nregulated at the federal level and involve federal licenses and federal \nforms. This is a federal responsibility, and there should be a federal \nlaw that stops this outrage.\n  That is what my bill does. If you are intoxicated, you would not be \nable to buy a gun or ammunition. It is very reasonable, and it will \nsave lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url":

Res. 216\n\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives were the \n     original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the \n     United States;\n       Whereas American Indian tribal governments developed the \n     fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of \n     powers that form the foundation of the United States \n     Government;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have \n     traditionally exhibited a respect for the finiteness of \n     natural resources through a reverence for the earth;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have served \n     with valor in all of America's wars beginning with the \n     Revolutionary War through the conflict in the Persian Gulf, \n     and often the percentage of American Indians who served \n     exceeded significantly the percentage of American Indians in \n     the population of the United States as a whole;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have made \n     distinct and important contributions to the United States and \n     the rest of the world in many fields, including agriculture, \n     medicine, music, language, and art;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives deserve to be \n     recognized for their individual contributions to the United \n     States as local and national leaders, artists, athletes, and \n     scholars;\n       Whereas this recognition will encourage self-esteem, pride, \n     and self-awareness in American Indians and Alaska Natives of \n     all ages; and\n       Whereas November is a time when many Americans commemorate \n     a special time in the history of the United States when \n     American Indians and English settlers celebrated the bounty \n     of their harvest and the promise of new kinships: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 1999 as \n     ``National American Indian Heritage Month'' and requests that \n     the President issue a proclamation calling on the Federal \n     Government and State and local governments, interested groups \n     and organizations, and the people of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today, along with \nthe Vice Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Inouye and \nmany of our colleagues, a Senate resolution that designates the month \nof November 1999, as `National American Indian Heritage Month.'\n  I feel it is appropriate and deserving to honor American Indians and \nAlaska Natives, as the original inhabitants of the land that now \nconstitutes the United States, with this November designation as \nCongress has done for almost a decade.\n\n[[Page S13686]]\n\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives have left an indelible imprint on \nmany aspects of our everyday life that most Americans often take for \ngranted. The arts, education, science, medicine, industry, and \ngovernment are areas that have been influenced by American Indian and \nAlaska Native people over the last 500 years. Many of the healing \nremedies that we use today were obtained from practices already in use \nby Indian people and are still utilized today in conjunction with \nwestern medicine.\n   Mr. President, many of the basic principles of democracy in our \nConstitution can be traced to practices and customs already in use by \nAmerican Indian tribal governments including the doctrines of freedom \nof speech and separation of powers. Our Founding Fathers benefited \ngreatly from the example of the Indian tribes in the early stages of \nour Nation.\n  The respect of Native people for the preservation of natural \nresources, reverence for elders, and adherence to tradition, mirrors \nour own values which we developed in part, through the contact with \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. These values and customs are \ndeeply rooted, strongly embraced and thrive with generation after \ngeneration of Native people.\n  From the difficult days of Valley Forge through our peace keeping \nefforts around the world today, American Indian and Alaska Native \npeople have proudly served and dedicated their lives in the military \nreadiness and defense of our country in wartime and in peace. In fact, \ntheir participation rate in the Armed Forces far outstrips the rates of \nall other groups in this Nation. Many American Indian men and women \ngave their lives selflessly in the defense of this Nation even before \nthey were granted American citizenship in 1924.\n  Many of the words in our language have been borrowed from Native \nlanguages, including many of the names of the rivers, cities, and \nStates across our Nation. Indian arts and crafts have also made a \ndistinct impression on our heritage.\n  It is my hope that by designating the month of November 1999, as \n``National American Indian Heritage Month,'' we will continue to \nencourage self-esteem, pride, and self awareness amongst American \nIndians and Alaska Natives of all ages. Many schools, organizations, \nFederal, State, Tribal and local governments can also plan activities \nand programs to celebrate the achievements of American Indians and \nAlaska Natives.\n  November is a special time in the history of the United States; we \ncelebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by remembering the American Indians \nand English settlers as they enjoyed the bounty of their harvest and \nthe promise of new kinships. By recognizing the many Native \ncontributions to the arts, governance, and culture of our Nation, we \nwill honor their past and ensure a place in America for Native people \nfor generations to come. I ask for the support of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for this resolution, and urge the Senate to pass \nthis important matter.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to and \nrecognize the contributions Native Americans and Indian tribes have \nmade in the United States and in particular in the State of Oregon. \nNative Americans have a unique and important relationship with the \nUnited States, and Indian tribes continue to persevere in upholding \ntheir sovereign governments, economies, culture and heritage. I am \npleased to join Senators Campbell and Inouye in submitting this \nresolution to designate this month as American Indian Heritage Month, \nand I appreciate their efforts on behalf of all Native Americans.\n  There are nine federally recognized tribes in the State of Oregon. \nEach of these tribes has successfully collaborated with State and \nFederal agencies and continues to develop active partnerships with the \nsurrounding communities.\n  Five of Oregon's tribes are located in Western Oregon: The \nConfederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, \nthe Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw, \nCoquille Indian Tribe, and the Cow Creek Band of Umpquas. Each of the \ntribes has made its own extraordinary contribution in Oregon and the \nPacific Northwest region. The five tribes of Western Oregon have been \nsuccessful in recent years in restoring their Federal recognition as \nIndian tribes, and they continue to work to stabilize and revitalize \ntheir social, cultural, and economic ties with the State and local \ncommunities.\n  There are four tribes located east of Oregon's Cascade Mountains. The \nConfederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, in Easter Oregon, have \nbeen successful in their conservation and restoration of salmon and \nwater back into the Umatilla River. The Confederated Tribes of Warm \nSprings, in Central Oregon, with their Kah-Nee-Ta Resort, have been \nmaking significant contributions to Oregon's tourism industry. The \nBurns Paiute and Klamath Tribes have renewed a foothold in the local \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I commend the contributions Native American people \nhave brought to my State and this nation. American Indian Heritage \nMonth is an important recognition to the accomplishments and \ncontributions of Native Americans in our country. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in support of this resolution and I look forward to its \nprompt consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13686-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 217--RELATING TO THE FREEDOM OF BELIEF, EXPRESSION, \n           AND ASSOCIATION IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Labor Deterrence Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS; PURPOSE; POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the \n     Child proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations on November 20, 1959, states that ``. . . the child \n     shall not be admitted to employment before an appropriate \n     minimum age; he shall in no case be caused or permitted to \n     engage in any occupation or employment which would prejudice \n     his health or education, or interfere with his physical, \n     mental, or moral development . . .''.\n       (2) Article 2 of the International Labor Convention No. 138 \n     Concerning Minimum Age For Admission to Employment states \n     that ``The minimum age specified in pursuance of paragraph 1 \n     of this article shall not be less than the age of compulsory \n     schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 \n     years.''.\n       (3) The new International Labor Convention addressing the \n     worst forms of child labor calls on member States to take \n     immediate and effective action to prohibit and eliminate such \n     labor. According to the convention, the worst forms of child \n     labor are--\n       (A) slavery;\n       (B) debt bondage;\n       (C) forced or compulsory labor;\n       (D) the sale or trafficking of children, including the \n     forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed \n     conflict;\n       (E) child prostitution;\n       (F) the use of children in the production and trafficking \n     of narcotics; and\n       (G) any other work that, by its nature or due to the \n     circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm \n     the health, safety, or morals of children.\n\n[[Page S13714]]\n\n       (4) According to the International Labor Organization, an \n     estimated 250,000,000 children under the age of 15 worldwide \n     are working, many of them in dangerous industries like mining \n     and fireworks.\n       (5) Children under the age of 15 constitute approximately \n     22 percent of the workforce in some Asian countries, 41 \n     percent of the workforce in parts of Africa, and 17 percent \n     of the workforce in many countries in Latin America.\n       (6) The number of children under the age of 15 who are \n     working, and the scale of their suffering, increase every \n     year, despite the existence of more than 20 International \n     Labor Organization conventions on child labor and national \n     laws in many countries which purportedly prohibit the \n     employment of under age children.\n       (7) In many countries, children under the age of 15 lack \n     either the legal standing or means to protect themselves from \n     exploitation in the workplace.\n       (8) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment, precarious \n     incomes, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers.\n       (9) The employment of children under the age of 15 commonly \n     deprives the children of the opportunity for basic education \n     and also denies gainful employment to millions of adults.\n       (10) The employment of children under the age of 15, often \n     at pitifully low wages, undermines the stability of families \n     and ignores the importance of increasing jobs, aggregated \n     demand, and purchasing power among adults as a catalyst to \n     the development of internal markets and the achievement \n     of broadbased, self-reliant economic development in many \n     developing countries.\n       (11) United Nations Children's Fund (commonly known as \n     UNICEF) estimates that by the year 2000, over 1,000,000 \n     adults will be unable to read or write at a basic level \n     because such adults were forced to work as children and were \n     thus unable to devote the time to secure a basic education.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to curtail the \n     employment of children under the age of 15 in the production \n     of goods for export by--\n       (1) eliminating the role of the United States in providing \n     a market for foreign products made by such children;\n       (2) supporting activities and programs to extend primary \n     education, rehabilitation, and alternative skills training to \n     child workers, to improve birth registration, and to improve \n     the scope and quality of statistical information and research \n     on the commercial exploitation of such children in the \n     workplace; and\n       (3) encouraging other nations to join in a ban on trade in \n     products described in paragraph (1) and to support those \n     activities and programs described in paragraph (2).\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to actively discourage the employment of children under \n     the age of 15 in the production of goods for export or \n     domestic consumption;\n       (2) to strengthen and supplement international trading \n     rules with a view to renouncing the use of under age children \n     in the production of goods for export as a means of \n     competing in international trade;\n       (3) to amend Federal law to prohibit the entry into \n     commerce of products resulting from the labor of under age \n     children; and\n       (4) to offer assistance to foreign countries to improve the \n     enforcement of national laws prohibiting the employment of \n     children under the age of 15 and to increase assistance to \n     alleviate the underlying poverty that is often the cause of \n     the commercial exploitation of such children.\n\n     SEC.   . UNITED STATES INITIATIVE TO CURTAIL INTERNATIONAL \n                   TRADE IN PRODUCTS OF CHILD LABOR.\n\n       In pursuit of the policy set forth in this Act, the \n     President is urged to seek an agreement with the government \n     of each country that conducts trade with the United States \n     for the purpose of securing an international ban on trade in \n     products of child labor.\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, Friday's Washington Post contained an \nexcellent op-ed piece by columnist Charles Krathammer arguing that, \ncontrary to claims now being made by senior Clinton Administration \nofficials, the recent defeat of the Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty is \nnot evidence of an emerging isolationist trend in the Republican party. \nI ask that the column be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                The Phony Battle Against `Isolationism'\n\n       After seven years, the big foreign policy thinkers in the \n     Clinton administration are convinced they have come up with a \n     big idea. Having spent the better part of a decade meandering \n     through the world without a hint of strategy--wading \n     compassless in and out of swamps from Somalia to Haiti to \n     Yugoslavia--they have finally found their theme.\n       National Security Adviser Sandy Berger unveiled it in a \n     speech to the Council on Foreign Relations last week. In true \n     Clintonian fashion, Berger turned personal pique over the \n     rejection of the test ban treaty into a grand idea: The \n     Democrats are internationalists, their opponents are \n     isolationists.\n       First of all, it ill behooves Democrats to call anybody \n     isolationists. This is the party that in 1972 committed \n     itself to ``Come home, America.'' That cut off funds to South \n     Vietnam. That fought bitterly to cut off aid to the \n     Nicaraguan contras and the pro-America government of El \n     Salvador. That mindlessly called for a nuclear freeze. That \n     voted against the Gulf War.\n       They prevailed in Vietnam but thankfully were defeated on \n     everything else. The contras were kept alive, forcing the \n     Sandinistas to agree to free elections. Nicaragua is now a \n     democracy.\n       El Salvador was supported against communist guerrillas. It, \n     too, is now a democracy.\n       President Reagan faced down the freeze and succeeded in \n     getting Soviet withdrawal of their SS-20 nukes from Europe, \n     the abolition of multiwarhead missiles, and the first nuclear \n     arms reduction in history.\n       And the Gulf War was fought, preventing Saddam from \n     becoming the nuclear-armed hegemon of the Persian Gulf.\n       ``The internationalist consensus that prevailed in this \n     country for more than 50 years,'' claimed Berger, \n     ``increasingly is being challenged by a new isolationism, \n     heard and felt particularly in the Congress.''\n       Internationalist consensus? For the last 20 years of the \n     Cold War, after the Democrats lost their nerve over Vietnam, \n     there was no internationalist consensus. Internationalism was \n     the property of the Republican Party and of a few brave \n     Democratic dissidents led by Sen. Henry Jackson--who were \n     utterly shut out of power when the Democrats won the White \n     House.\n       Berger's revisionism is not restricted to the Reagan and \n     Bush years. He can't seem to remember the Clinton years \n     either. He says of the Republicans, that ``since the Cold War \n     ended, the proponents of this [isolationist] vision have been \n     nostalgic for the good old days when friends were friends and \n     enemies were enemies.''\n       Cold War nostalgia? It was Bill Clinton who early in his \n     presidency said laughingly, ``Gosh, I miss the Cold War.'' \n     Then seriously, ``We had an intellectually coherent thing.\n\n[[Page S13718]]\n\n     The American people knew what the rules were.''\n       What exactly is the vision that Berger has to offer? What \n     does the Clinton foreign policy stand for?\n       Engagement. Hence the speech's title, ``American Power--\n     Hegemony, Isolation or Engagement.'' Or as he spelled it out: \n     ``To keep America engaged in a way that will benefit our \n     people and all people.''\n       Has there ever been a more mushy, meaningless choice of \n     strategy? Engagement can mean anything. It can mean \n     engagement as a supplicant, as a competitor, as an ally, as \n     an adversary, as a neutral arbiter. Wake up on a Wednesday \n     and pick your meaning.\n       The very emptiness of the term captures perfectly the \n     essence of Clinton foreign policy. It is glorified ad hocism.\n       It lurches from one civil war to another with no coherent \n     logic and with little regard for American national interest--\n     finally proclaiming, while doing a victory jig over Kosovo, a \n     Clinton Doctrine pledging America to stop ethnic cleansing \n     anywhere.\n       It lurches from one multilateral treaty to another--from \n     the Chemical Warfare Convention that even its proponents \n     admit is unverifiable to a test ban treaty that is not just \n     unverifiable but disarming--in the belief that American \n     security can be founded on promises and paper.\n       If there is a thread connecting these meanderings, it is a \n     woolly utopianism that turns a genuinely felt humanitarianism \n     and a near-mystical belief in the power of parchment into the \n     foreign policy of a superpower.\n       The choice of engagement as the motif of Clinton foreign \n     policy is a self-confession of confusion. Of course we are \n     engaged in the world. The question is: What kind of \n     engagement?\n       Engagement that relies on the fictional ``international \n     community,'' the powerless United Nations or the recalcitrant \n     Security Council (where governments hostile to our interests \n     can veto us at will) to legitimatize American action? Or \n     engagement guided by American national interests and security \n     needs?\n       Engagement that squanders American power and treasure on \n     peacekeeping? Or engagement that concentrates our finite \n     resources on potential warfighting in vital areas such as the \n     Persian Gulf, the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan Strait?\n       Berger cannot seem to tell the difference between \n     isolationism and realism. Which is the fundamental reason for \n     the rudderless mess that is Clinton foreign policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13718-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HELEN WESTBROOK\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto recognize an outstanding individual who will soon be retiring from \npublic service. Helen L. Westbrook currently works in the Office of the \nDeputy Under Secretary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. In December, she will complete a career that has \nspanned many years of distinguished service to our country.\n  This is a special occasion for me and the Kennedy family, as Helen is \ntruly one of our own. In 1955, as a Senator, my brother John F. Kennedy \nvisited Chicopee, Massachusetts, and delivered an address about a \nrecent visit he had made to Poland and Eastern Europe. Like many other \nyoung Americans of that time, Helen heard and heeded my brother's call \nto public service. She moved to Washington, D.C., and in January 1956, \nshe began work as a secretary in my brother's Senate office. Following \nthe 1960 election, Jack asked Helen to join his White House Staff, and \nshe served as a Secretarial Assistant in the Office of the President \nuntil January 1963.\n  Helen then decided she wanted to gain experience working overseas, \nand for the next year and a half, she served in our U.S. Embassy in \nRome She then returned to America, and at the request of Jackie \nKennedy, she came back to work with our family. For the next few years, \nshe served as an assistant to Jackie in New York City. She watched \nCaroline and John F. Kennedy, Jr. grow up, and went on to marry and \nraise a family of her own.\n  In 1992, Helen rejoined the Federal Government and started a career \nwith NOAA. She has been a good friend to Massachusetts and has called \nfor a balanced approach to fisheries management. She has been a \nskillful advocate for assistance to New England fishermen and coastal \ncommunities, and all of us who know her are proud of her achievements \nand her friendship.\n  Helen Westbrook is a kind, thoughtful person who truly cares about \npeople. She has brought professionalism, wisdom and dedication to each \nposition that she has held. She is a valued and loyal friend of the \nKennedy family.\n  We don't have enough Helen Westbrooks in government and in the world. \nShe is a shining example of the wonderful people who answered President \nKennedy's call to serve their country. I'm proud of her contribution to \npublic service, and I wish her well in her well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13718-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, \nTHE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR THE FISCAL \n                               YEAR 2000\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on October 20, 1999, the Senate \npassed the conference report for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, \nand State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2000. I thank the conferees for their hard work in putting \nforth this legislation which provides federal funding for fighting \ncrime, enhancing drug enforcement, and responding to threats of \nterrorism. This bill also addresses the shortcomings of the immigration \nprocess, funds the operation of the judicial system, facilitates \ncommerce throughout the United States, and fulfills the needs of the \nState Department and various other agencies.\n  For many years, I have tried to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending \nfrom the annual appropriations bills--with only limited success, I must \nadmit. Nonetheless, I will continue my fight to curb wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending, and I regret that I must again come forward this year \nto object to the millions of unrequested, low-priority, wasteful \nspending in this conference report. This legislation includes $535 \nmillion in pork-barrel spending. This is an unacceptable amount of \nmoney to spend on low-priority, unrequested, wasteful projects. \nCongress must curb its appetite for such unbridled spending.\n  Pork-barrel spending today not only robs well-deserving programs of \nmuch needed funds, it also jeopardizes social security reform, \npotential tax cuts, and our fiscal well-being into the next century.\n  The multitude of earmarks buried in this proposal will further burden \nthe American taxpayers. While the amounts associated with each \nindividual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken together, they \nrepresent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to low \npriority programs at the expense of numerous programs that have \nundergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. Congress and \nthe American public must be made aware of the magnitude of wasteful \nspending endorsed by this body.\n  For the Department of Commerce, there is $400,000 for swordfish \nresearch. For the Department of Justice, there is $1 million for the \nNevada National Judicial College. For the Department of State, there is \n$12.5 million for the East-West Center in Hawaii, and for the Small \nBusiness Administration, there is $200,000 for Rural Enterprises, Inc., \nin Durant, Oklahoma. I have compiled a list on my Senate website of \nthese examples and other numerous add-ons and earmarks in the report.\n  Mr. President, we must continue to work to cut unnecessary and \nwasteful spending so we can begin to pay down our debt and save \nbillions in interest payments. We have an obligation to ensure that \nCongress spends taxpayers' hard-earned dollars prudently to protect our \nbalanced budget and to protect the projected budget surpluses. The \nAmerican public cannot understand why we continue to earmark these huge \namounts of money to locality specific special interests at a time when \nwe are trying to cut the cost of government and return more dollars to \nthe people.\n  Mr. President, it is a sad commentary on the state of politics today \nthat the Congress cannot curb its appetite to earmark funds for \nprograms that are obviously wasteful, unnecessary, or unfair. \nUnfortunately, however, Members of Congress have demonstrated time and \nagain their willingness to fund programs that serve their narrowly \ntailored interest at the expense of the national interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13718-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13718-S13719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOWNRIVER GUIDANCE CLINIC TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, It is my great pleasure to \nrecognize and honor the Downriver Guidance Clinic as they celebrate \ntheir First Downriver Guidance Clinic Week November 7 through November \n13, 1999.\n\n[[Page S13719]]\n\n  For forty-one years the Downriver Guidance Clinic has been at the \nforefront of providing exceptional health care, mental health services \nand support to those people who are in need. The Downriver Guidance \nClinic has enhanced the quality of life for children, adults and \nfamilies in the Downriver community. Their programs have built \nfoundations of support for children with behavioral problems, first \ntime parents, teenage mothers, and adults who need help coping with \nunexpected changes in life.\n  What is truly remarkable about the Downriver Guidance Center are the \ninnovative and progressive programs they provide. The Opportunity \nCenter combines traditional therapy, volunteer mentoring, and other \nactivities to assist young people who need extra help interacting with \nparents, teachers and peers. Their Center for Excellence focuses on \nevaluating and assessing programs as a means for improved services. The \nDownriver Guidance Center programs continue to reach out to the \ncommunity by providing employment programs that help ease chronically \nunemployed people into the workforce. The Center also provides an early \nchildhood development which encourages good emotional and physical \nhealth ensuring that children enter school ready to learn.\n  The accomplishments and work of the Downriver Guidance Center are to \nbe commended. Their impact on the Downriver Community of the future is \nimmeasurable. I applaud the Downriver Guidance Center for all the help \nthey give others as they strive to meet the ever changing needs of the \ncommunity they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13719-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1883\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1844 introduced earlier \ntoday by Senators Roth, Moynihan, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1844) to amend Part D of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act to provide for an alternative penalty procedure \n     with respect to compliance with requirements for a State \n     disbursement unit.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Support \nMiscellaneous Amendments of 1999. This legislation is co-sponsored by \nSenators Moynihan, Voinovich, Feinstein, Roberts, Boxer, Enzi, Thomas, \nGramm, and Kerrey.\n  This bill would provide a more appropriate penalty for States that \nhave not met the deadline for establishing a State Disbursement Unit \n(SDU). The 1996 welfare reform law (P. L. 104-193) made a number of \nimportant changes to the nation's child support system, including a \nrequirement that States establish and operate a State Disbursement Unit \n(SDU) to receive child support payments and distribute the money in \naccord with State child support distribution rules. In general, States \nhad until October 1st of this year to establish an SDU.\n  States that have not met this deadline will lose all Federal funds \nfor the administration of their child support enforcement programs, and \nalso may be in jeopardy of losing Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies (TANF) funds.\n  Although most States have met the deadline, for various reasons about \nseven States may not. This bill provides that States may apply for an \nalternative smaller, graduated penalty, as described in the \n``Description of the Child Support Miscellaneous Amendments of 1999.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a description of the bill \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROTH. Moreover, this legislation provides that any penalty will \nbe waived if a State establishes an SDU within six months of the \noriginal deadline, that is, by April 1, 2000. If a State misses the \nApril 1st date but establishes an SDU within a year of the deadline, \nthat is, by September 30, 2000, the penalty shall be limited to one \npercent of child support funds for the fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, in my view this alternative penalty system is more \nsuitable for technology-related program requirements, where States may \nbe moving towards compliance but need additional time. Indeed, the \nproposed legislation follows similar changes made last year in \nproviding an alternative penalty for States that did not meet the \ndeadline for establishing an automated statewide data system for child \nsupport. In this regard, the proposed legislation would provide for a \nsingle penalty for a State that does not meet either the automated data \nsystem or SDU requirements.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found this legislation has no \ncost.\n  I urge the support of all Senators.\n\n[[Page S13721]]\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n   DESCRIPTION OF THE CHILD SUPPORT MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       The 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193) required States \n     to establish and operate a State Disbursement Unit (SDU) to \n     receive child support payments and distribute the money in \n     accord with State child support distribution rules. The SDU \n     may be operated by a single State agency, two of more State \n     agencies under a regional cooperative agreement, or by a \n     contractor responsible to the State agency. Alternatively, \n     the SDU may be established by linking local disbursement \n     units, such as counties, under an agreement with the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services. States that processed \n     receipt of child support payments through their courts at the \n     time of enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law enacted had \n     until October 1, 1999, to operate an SDU. States that did not \n     process child support payments through the courts were \n     required to be operating an SDU by October 1, 1998.\n       The penalty for not meeting the SDU requirement is the loss \n     of all Federal child support payments. States receive Federal \n     funds for child support enforcement administration according \n     to a matching formula. Furthermore, if a state cannot certify \n     that it has an approved child support enforcement plan--\n     including an SDU--when it renews its Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families (TANF) plan (i.e., every 27 months), it is not \n     eligible for TANF funds.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       States not operating an approved State Disbursement Unit \n     (SDU) by October 1, 1999, may apply to the Secretary for an \n     alternative penalty. To qualify for the alternative penalty, \n     the Secretary must find that the State has made and is \n     continuing to make a good faith effort to comply, and the \n     State must submit a corrective plan by April 1, 2000. If \n     these conditions are fulfilled, the Secretary must not \n     disapprove the State child support enforcement plan. Instead, \n     the Secretary must reduce the amount the State would \n     otherwise have received in Federal child support payments by \n     the alternative penalty amount for the fiscal year.\n       The alternative penalty amount is equal to: 4 percent of \n     the penalty base in the first fiscal year; 8 percent in the \n     second fiscal year; 16 percent in the third fiscal year; 25 \n     percent in the fourth fiscal year; and 30 percent in the \n     fifth and subsequent fiscal years. The penalty base is \n     defined as the Federal administrative reimbursement for child \n     support enforcement (i.e., the 66 percent Federal matching \n     funds) that otherwise would have been payable to the State in \n     the previous fiscal year.\n       If a State that is subject to a penalty has an approved SDU \n     on or before April 1, 2000, the Secretary shall waive the \n     penalty. If a State that is subject to a penalty achieves \n     compliance after April 1, 2000, and on or before September \n     30, 2000, the penalty amount shall be 1 percent of the \n     penalty base.\n       In addition, the Secretary may not impose a penalty against \n     a State for a fiscal year for which the State has already \n     been penalized for noncompliance with respect to the \n     automated data processing system requirement, as provided \n     under Section 455 of the Social Security Act.\n       The loss of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block \n     grant funds by a State for failure to substantially comply \n     with one or more of the IV-D requirements is not applicable \n     with respect to the SDU requirements (or the automated \n     systems requirement).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       October 1, 1999.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \ntechnical, yet necessary, legislation, the Child Support Miscellaneous \nAmendments of 1999. We live in a nation with an ever-increasing number \nof single mothers. About one-third (32.8%) of all children born in the \nUnited States last year were born outside of marriage. At a minimum, we \nneed a comprehensive and effective child support system to see to it \nthat non-custodial parents--often fathers--provide for these children.\n  Maintaining a central unit for disbursing and collecting child \nsupport payments in each state is essential. This eases the burden on \nthe business community, whose cooperation we need. Unfortunately, a \nhandful of states appear to have missed the statutory deadline for \nhaving such a central unit in operation. Under current law, all Federal \nfunding for the child support programs in these states will be \nwithdrawn.\n  This is too harsh of a penalty. States are missing the deadline \nbecause they are simply behind schedule in their procurement effort or \nbecause of a broader failing in the computer systems undergirding their \nchild support programs. This legislation would provide an alternative, \nmore modest, financial penalty for those states which are late in \nmeeting the deadline. For those states suffering a general failure of \ntheir child support computer systems it would not impose a penalty \nbecause those states have already been penalized.\n  I thank the Chairman for his work on this matter, simple one of \nreasonable program administration.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as an original cosponsor of the \nChild Support Miscellaneous Amendments of 1999. This bill will provide \nstates, such as Indiana with additional time to either obtain a waiver \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services or comply with the \nstate disbursement unit requirement without being penalized. It is \nimportant that states are provided with sufficient time to determine \nwhat system will allow them to collect and disburse child support \npayments most efficiently.\n  For many states the most economical and administratively efficient \nmeans of delivering and collecting child support payments is to comply \nwith the requirement and create a central state disbursement unit. \nHowever, the Department of Health and Human Services has recognized \nsome exceptions to that general rule and granted those states a waiver. \nThe State of Indiana has applied for a waiver but is awaiting the \nSecretary's determination of whether or not to grant the waiver \nrequest. This legislation will allow Indiana, and the other states in a \nsimilar predicament, the time they need to determine what system works \nbest for them. In addition, the penalty these states face will be \nreduced. States will not be in jeopardy of losing all of their \nadministrative dollars for child support collection.\n  Without this legislation, the State of Indiana could lose as much as \n$33.5 million, undermining the state's ability to collect child \nsupport. While child support collection affects the budgets of the \nFederal and State Governments, it most importantly affects the children \nfor whom it is intended. The system was designed so children would at \nleast have the economic support of both their parents.\n  It is important that Congress continue to find ways to collect child \nsupport owed to children from noncustodial parents. Child support \nadministrative dollars help states accomplish that goal.\n  There are other steps Congress can take to reconnect noncustodial \nparents with their children and encourage them to pay child support. As \nwe continue to discuss the intricacies of child support collection, the \nneed for a child to have the emotional and financial support of both \nparents should be incorporated into the discussion. I look forward to \nhaving that discussion in the near future.\n  I thank Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for their leadership on \nthis issue and for acknowledging the need to provide states with more \ntime to implement a child support collection and disbursement system \nthat works. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1844) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1844\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Mr. President, I am on the floor tonight for what is \nreally the 10th time in recent days to talk about the need for decent \nprescription drug coverage for the Nation's elderly citizens. There is \none bipartisan bill now before the Senate. It is the Snowe-Wyden bill. \nI believe so strongly in this issue because of what I am hearing from \nsenior citizens in my home State and now, frankly, from across the \nUnited States.\n  What I have decided to do, as part of the effort to advance the \nprospect of dealing with this issue and dealing with it on a bipartisan \nbasis, is to come to the floor as frequently as I can in the hectic \nSenate schedule to read from some of these bills I am getting from the \nNation's senior citizens.\n  As you can see in the poster next to us, on behalf of the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation, I am urging seniors to send in copies of their \nprescription drug bills directly to us at the United States Senate, \nWashington, DC 20510, because I would like to see the Senate deal with \nthis issue and not just put it off because some are saying it is too \ndifficult and too hard to deal with in this contentious climate. I \nbelieve Members of the Senate are sent here to deal with tough issues. \nThis is one that would meet an enormous need.\n  For a number of years before I was elected to the Congress, I served \nas director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. The need for coverage of \nprescription drugs was extremely important back then. It was always a \nbig priority for senior citizens.\n  Frankly, it is much more important today because so many of the drugs \nthat are available now are preventive in nature. They help keep seniors \nwell. They help us to hold down the cost of medical care in America. A \nlot of these drugs today, the blood pressure medicine, the cholesterol \nmedicine, keep seniors well and keep us from needing much greater sums \nof money to pick up the cost of tragic illnesses.\n  Last week, I cited as one example an important anticoagulant drug. \nThis is a drug that can be available to the Nation's seniors for \nsomewhere in the vicinity of $1,000 a year. But if a senior gets sick, \nif a senior suffers a debilitating stroke, the expenses associated\n\n[[Page S13726]]\n\nwith that treatment can be more than $100,000. Just think about that--a \nmodest investment in decent prescription drug coverage for the Nation's \nelderly people, an anticoagulant drug that costs $1,000 a year can help \nsave $100,000 in much more significant medical expenses.\n  As the President knows, we have a real challenge in terms of ensuring \nthe stability of the Medicare program. The Part A program, the \ninstitutional program, is the one that is going to escalate in cost if \nwe can't do more to make prescription drug coverage a significant part \nof outpatient benefits for the Nation's seniors.\n\n  I am very hopeful this Senate will act on this issue. I believe this \nis the kind of issue that could be a legacy for this session of \nCongress.\n  All over the Nation, seniors are telling us now they cannot afford \ntheir prescription medicine. I am going to read from three more letters \nI have recently received from folks at home. The first is from an \nelderly woman in Toledo, OR. She writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Wyden, I am an 81-year-old widow. My only \n     income, Social Security, allows me to pay for glaucoma, \n     angina, high blood pressure, all of which I have problems. I \n     am taking eight prescription medications daily. My Medicare \n     supplement insurance doesn't cover medication.\n\n  For just 1 month for those medicines, she has to spend $166. On top \nof that, she reports that every other month she has to spend a little \nover $62 for a small bottle of eye drops. As she says:\n\n       That adds up to a lot. If I don't use the eye drops, I go \n     blind. And if I don't use the other medications, I will have \n     a stroke, a heart attack or both. Myself, and I am sure many \n     others, are in exactly the same boat.\n\n  She, as part of her letter, encloses a copy of her bills.\n  Now, this isn't the kind of thing we might hear from some Washington, \nDC, think tank that is putting out reports about whether or not this is \na serious problem and whether or not seniors really need this \nprescription drug coverage. This is a real live case. This isn't an \nabstract kind of matter. This is an 81-year-old widow in the State of \nOregon who is taking eight prescriptions a day, spending from a modest \nfixed income $166 a month for those eight prescriptions. Every other \nmonth, on top of that, she has to pay for her eye drops. It is very \nclear that if she doesn't get those medicines, she is going to have the \nmuch more serious problems--heart attacks and strokes--that are so \ndebilitating to older people.\n\n  Another letter that I got in the last couple of days comes from \nMedford, OR, from seniors there who discussed the question of \nprescription drug coverage there at the senior citizens center. They \nsaid:\n\n       We are glad you are launching a movement to gain support \n     for prescription drug coverage for seniors. They hope it goes \n     through. Enclosed you will find a computer printout of the \n     amounts I spend on prescriptions and drugs. More than 10 \n     percent of our annual budget is used to defray prescription \n     costs. That does not include the miscellaneous items related \n     to drug purchases.\n\n  She sent me this, and I will hold up a copy of it. It is an example \nof the kind of information we are getting. She actually sent us an \nenumerated copy of the prescription bills that she is paying at home in \nMedford, OR. These are not isolated cases. I have been on the floor \nnow, this is the tenth occasion, taking three or four of these cases \nevery single time. I hope seniors and families who are listening \ntonight will look at this poster and see we are urging that they send \nin copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators here in \nthe U.S. Senate in Washington, DC, because I am hopeful that this can \nprick the conscience of the Senate and bring about constructive action \nbefore this session is over.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. Fifty-four Members of this \nbody have already voted for this bill. We have a majority in the Senate \non record on behalf of the funding mechanism that we envisage in our \nlegislation. We use marketplace forces. I am not talking about a price \ncontrol regime or about a one-size-fits-all approach to Federal health \ncare; it is one that is very familiar to the Presiding Officer and to \nall our colleagues. It is really a model based on the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is called SPICE. It \nstands for the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is \nbipartisan. We do think it would help create choices, options, and \nalternatives for the Nation's older people.\n  I am very hopeful this Senate will say we cannot afford to duck this \nissue. I am often asked whether we can afford to cover prescription \nmedicine for the Nation's older people. I am of the view that we cannot \nafford not to cover prescriptions, because what we are going to save as \na result of these medicines of the future, and the breakthroughs that \nwe are achieving in terms of preventive care and wellness, is going to \nfar exceed the costs that might be incurred as a result of debilitating \nillnesses that seniors will suffer if they can't get the medicine. As \npart of this effort to get bipartisan support for the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation, I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate and \nreading from these letters.\n  Before I wrap up tonight, I wish to bring up one other case that I \nthought was particularly poignant. This also was a letter from an \nelderly person in Medford. Her Social Security monthly income was $582. \nOver the last few months, she spent over $700 on her prescription \nmedicine, and every 3 months, in addition, she has to pay for her \nhealth insurance plan, which doesn't seem to cover many of the health \ncare needs that she has.\n  Just think about that. With a monthly Social Security income of $582, \nover recent months she spent more than $700 on prescription drugs. Her \nprivate policy doesn't cover many of her health care needs. She also is \nsending me copies of her bills in an effort to get the Senate to see \nhow important this issue is.\n  Members of the Senate, I know, care about older people; a number of \nthem have come up to me while I have been on the floor these last \ncouple of weeks talking about this issue and said: You are right; we \nneed to act on it. It is hard to see what is actually holding up the \neffort to go forward in the Senate.\n  This is the last period before the year is out. Certainly we can come \ntogether as a body and get ready to address this issue early next year. \nWe have a majority in the Senate on record and voting for a specific \nplan to fund this benefit. It is based on a model that uses marketplace \nforces that ought to be appealing to both sides of the aisle. It is a \nmodel with which Members of Congress are familiar because of the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is the basis of the Snowe-\nWyden legislation. It is hard to see what is really holding up the \neffort to win passage of this important legislation.\n  I guess part of the problem is that some of the political \nprognosticators say it is a difficult issue, that both sides are just \ngoing to fight it out on the campaign trail, and we can just wait until \n2001 to actually take action on it.\n  When I hear from seniors at home, such as the letter I raised first \nfrom the elderly widow in Toledo who has eight prescriptions and pays \nmore than $165 a month for her prescriptions, and folks in Medford who \nare on a small monthly income and spending a significant portion of it \non prescription drugs, I don't think those people can afford to wait \nuntil after the 2001 election. Frankly, I think they expect us to deal \nwith the concerns they have, and to deal with them now.\n  It is essentially one full year before there is another election. \nThere is plenty of time to go out and campaign and have the vigorous \ndiscussion of the issues in the fall of 2000. But what we ought to do \nnow is to act in a bipartisan way. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is that \nkind of effort. Senator Snowe and I have said we are going to set aside \nsome of the partisan bickering that has surrounded health care in this \nsession of the Senate in years past; we are going to move forward and \ntry to make sure seniors get some help.\n  I hope families and seniors who are listening tonight will look at \nthis poster. We are urging that seniors send copies of their \nprescription drug bills directly to each of us in the Senate here in \nWashington, DC, and help us in the Senate to come together and deal \nwith the issue that is of such extraordinary importance to our \nfamilies.\n  There are a variety of ways this issue could be addressed. I think \npersonally the Snowe-Wyden legislation, because it is bipartisan and \nbecause more than half of the Senate has voted for a plan to fund it, \nis the way to go. But I am sure there are other kinds of ideas.\n\n[[Page S13727]]\n\n  When seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills as we \ntry to get action on this issue, I hope they will also let us know \ntheir ideas about legislative approaches, be it support for Senator \nSnowe, the Snowe-Wyden legislation, or other kinds of approaches. But \nwhat to me is unacceptable is just ducking. I do not think there is any \nexcuse for inertia on this issue. I think it is time for the Senate to \nsay we cannot afford, as a nation, to see seniors suffer the way they \ndo when they cannot get prescription drug coverage.\n\n  Just as important as the questions of fairness for seniors, it seems \nto me, are the questions of economics. From an economic standpoint, the \nneed to cover some of these prescription drugs for seniors looks to me \nlike a pretty easy call. With a modest investment, we can save a whole \nlot of expense that comes about when they suffer strokes and heart \nattacks and the like when they cannot get their medicine.\n  So I hope in the days ahead, Members of the Senate, in senior centers \nand medical facilities and other places where we all go to visit, will \ntake the time to talk to some of the folks at home about the need for \nprescription drug coverage and discuss ways we can actually get this \nbenefit added in this session of the Senate. Too many of our seniors \nnow cannot afford their medicine. That is what these bills are all \nabout. What these bills and these letters I am getting from seniors at \nhome in Oregon are all about is that they cannot afford their medicine. \nThese are the people who are told by their doctors to take three \nprescriptions; they cannot afford to do that and they end up taking two \nprescriptions. Then they cannot afford to do that; then it is one. \nPretty soon, sure as the night follows day, they get sicker and they \nneed institutional care. That is, obviously, bad for their health and \nit is also bad for the Nation's fiscal health. So I intend to keep \ncoming back to the floor of the Senate.\n  Since my days with the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon, I felt this \nwas an important benefit for the Nation's older people. All these \nletters I am receiving as a result of folks sending in copies of their \nprescription drug bills, if anything, just reaffirms to me how \nimportant it is that the Senate act on this issue, and do it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Let's show seniors, let's show the skeptics we can come together \naround this important priority. This is not a trifling matter. This is, \nfor many, many seniors, their big out-of-pocket expense. Many of them \ndo not have private health insurance that covers it. Many of them are \nsimply falling between the cracks in terms of meeting their health care \nexpenses. For many elderly people, as a result of escalating health \ncosts, they are paying more proportionally out of their own pocket \ntoday than they were back when Medicare began in 1965. That should not \nbe acceptable to any Member of the Senate.\n  I intend to come back to the floor again and again and again until \nthis Senate, on a bipartisan basis, looks to addressing this \nprescription drug coverage. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. \nIt uses marketplace forces. We reject the kind of price control regimes \nothers may wish to pursue. I am hopeful we can get action on this issue \nbecause, for the millions of seniors who cannot afford their \nprescriptions, the Senate's willingness to tackle this issue, and do it \non a bipartisan basis and get some relief for the seniors, will help \ninstill a sense of confidence, a sense that the Senate is listening to \nthem, hearing them, and is willing to respond to their most significant \nneeds.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/02/senate-section/article/S13727-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
