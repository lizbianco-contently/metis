Mr. President, I rise today with deep admiration and \npraise for an integral presence within America's diverse society--Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders. Every May, during Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month, we commemorate the major contributions made by \nthis small, but by no means insignificant part of the U.S. population.\n  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, both in the aggregate and in \ngroups of distinct and unique ethnic origin, comprise a growing force \nin our citizenry. Whether their ancestry is Chinese, Japanese, \nFilipino, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Laotian, Hmong, or other \nAsian American, or Native Hawaiian, Chamorro, Samoan, Micronesian, \nTongan, Fijian, or other Pacific Islander American, they are a vibrant \npart of our society. If one could see numbers about each of the \ndistinct peoples in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, \nthey would observe that we make up one of the fastest growing segments \nof the population. Our reach in communities across America is \nincreasing. Asian Pacific Americans should not be thought of as located \nonly in a few select states such as Hawaii or California. We have \nmigrated over time from various points of origin in the U.S. to all \nparts of the country and have come to contribute to local business, \neducation, and politics in every state.\n  Nearly 11 million Asian and Pacific Islanders lived in the U.S. in \nabout 2.5 million families, according to last year's estimates. About \nfour-fifths of these families were headed by married couples. \nFurthermore, the Census Bureau projects that the Asian and Pacific \nIslander population will more than triple to nearly 38 million by the \nmiddle of this new century, climbing from four to nine percent of the \nAmerican population. This growth in the number of Asian Pacific \nAmericans will be felt across the country, and more light will be shed \non the multifaceted strengths and varied needs of Asian Americans and \nPacific Islanders.\n  President Clinton recognized the importance of increasing awareness \nabout Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders when he signed Executive \nOrder 13125 in June, 1999. The Executive Order established the White \nHouse Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders with the goal \nof improving the quality of life for this population by increasing \ntheir participation in Federal programs. Such programs include those \nrelated to health, human services, housing, education, labor, \ntransportation,\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\neconomic development, and community development programs--encompassing \nthose which currently serve this population and those which may not \nhave served this population in the past.\n\n  I am happy to say that the Initiative is marching onward through \nhigh-level, interagency meetings involving all major agencies in the \nExecutive Branch, and the establishment of the President's Advisory \nCommission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The Commission \nwill be sworn in later this week and includes 15 members representing \nvarious interests and diverse segments of the Asian American and \nPacific Islander community. It will be chaired by an esteemed \ncolleague, former Congressman Norman Mineta, and will include \nrepresentatives such as Haunani Apoliona from my State of Hawaii. I \nhope that now and in the next Administration, the Initiative and the \nCommission will continue to work hand-in-hand toward: increased \nresearch and data collection; private sector, public sector and \ncommunity involvement; and, development, monitoring, and coordination \nof Federal efforts toward improved quality of life for Asian Americans \nand Pacific Islanders.\n  There is clear evidence to show that this type of Federal attention \nis needed. As stated in the Presidential Proclamation for Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month 2000, despite many successes, the needs in the \ncommunity still continue to be great:\n\n       While many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders today are \n     thriving, others are still struggling to overcome obstacles. \n     Because of oppression in their countries of origin, some new \n     immigrants have arrived without having completed their \n     education; once here, some have encountered language and \n     cultural barriers and discrimination. Pacific Islanders, too, \n     must overcome barriers to opportunity caused by their \n     geographic isolation and the consequences of Western \n     influences on their unique culture. For these and other \n     reasons, too many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face \n     low-paying jobs, inadequate health care, and lack of \n     educational opportunity.\n\n  The Initiative, Advisory Commission, and the Asian American and \nPacific Islander community have much work to do in these areas. I urge \nthat the proper resources and attention continue to flow to support \nthis combined effort.\n  Mr. President, within this Federal effort, I cannot underscore enough \nhow much we need to focus on improving data collection for the Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander community. The tremendous diversity in \nthe community poses challenges that have produced data and statistics \nthat are inadequate. Most data collection tends to lump the various \nAsian American and Pacific Islander ethnicities together in a \nsingle category, swallowing up numbers for each distinct group and \nfailing to present an accurate picture of the services needed.\n\n  For example, the respected organization, the College Board, produced \na report regarding minority achievement in higher education. The report \nfailed to include Asian Pacific Americans because we were considered to \nbe over-represented in higher education. Unfortunately, in the making \nof the report, differences between individual groups within the \ncommunity were ignored. For example, higher educational attainment is \ngreater for groups like Japanese and Chinese Americans than it is for \nAmerican Samoan and Southeast Asian Americans. Statistics such as these \nmust be brought to light so that educational agencies and institutions \nknow to which groups they should target their limited resources. \nThankfully, Congressman Robert Underwood, the Chairman of the \nCongressional Asian Pacific Caucus, worked to counter this problem and, \nin the end, reached an agreement with The College Board to work \ntogether and analyze disaggregared data for the population.\n  As another example of data collection challenges, I have worked on \nOffice of Management and Budget Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, \nwhich governs the racial and ethnic data collection by Federal \nagencies. In 1993, I began efforts to change the Directive so that \nNative Hawaiians would be disaggregated from the Asian Pacific Islander \ncategory. My main concern was that Native Hawaiians, as an indigenous \npeople were being classified with populations that had immigrated to \nthe U.S., thereby creating the misperception that Native Hawaiians were \nimmigrants rather than the indigenous peoples of Hawaii.\n  I finally succeeded in 1997, when OMB Policy and Statistical \nDirective No. 15 was revised. Native Hawaiians were disaggregated from \nthe Asian Pacific Islander category and a new category entitled, \n``Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders'' was created. That was \none step toward fixing inaccuracies in data collection. Agencies have \nuntil January 1, 2003 to make all existing recordkeeping or reporting \nrequirements consistent with its standards. However, provisions of the \nrevised directive took effect immediately for all new and revised \nrecordkeeping or reporting requirements that include racial and/or \nethnic information. It is my understanding that only the Department to \nHealth and Human Services has established a policy with respect to the \nrequirements of OMB Directive 15. I have encouraged all Federal \nagencies to actively work to implement this Directive, especially in \ncollaborative efforts with the White House Initiative and President's \nAdvisory Commission.\n  As a further example, on March 14, 2000, I hosted a forum to discuss \nCensus 2000 and its impact on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in \nHonolulu. The forum included panel members from the Federal government, \nCongress, and Native Hawaiian, Samoan, and Chamorro community \norganizations. The issue which generated the most concern regarding \nCensus 2000 was the application of multiracial reporting. This issue is \none of particular sensitivity in Hawaii, where a large percentage of \nthe population has multiethnic backgrounds.\n\n  In Hawaii, it is very common for individuals, when asked for their \nethnicity, to list their entire ethnic background. Only when asked \nwhich ethnicity the individual most identifies with will the individual \nlimit the answer to one ethnic background. Furthermore, it was revealed \nthrough forum discussion that there is no resolution as to how data \nwill be reported for those who check off more than one race on the 2000 \nCensus form. This raises the fear that the final counts of various \nPacific Islander populations--such as the Native Hawaiian population--\nwhere multiple-race backgrounds are common, would be inaccurate. \nStatisticians verify that this has enormous effect on smaller \npopulations.\n  I am continuing to work on this problem because of the tremendous \nimpact that Federal data has in its use in deciding funding and \nparticipation in thousands of Federal, state and local programs. \nInaccurate data means that many individuals will not be served, and we \nmust do what we can to prevent this from happening. We must work on \nthese and other issues facing the Asian American and Pacific Islander \ncommunity, just as we do for issues facing our country's other \npopulations, because it is part of our responsibility to keep each part \nof our diverse America as strong as it can be.\n  Mr. President, I recently introduced related legislation that would \nallow us to take a broader look at, and emphasize the heterogeneous \nnature of, America. S. 2478, or the Peopling of America Theme Study Act \nof 2000, takes pride in America's diversity by authorizing the \nSecretary of the Interior to identify regions, areas, districts, \nstructures and cultures that illustrate and commemorate key events or \ndecisions in the peopling of this country. I hope that this effort will \nprovide a basis for the preservation and interpretation of the complex \nmovement of people, ideas, and cultures to and across the American \ncontinent that resulted in the peopling of the nation, and the \ndevelopment of our unique, pluralist society--one that Asian Americans \nand Pacific Islanders are fully a part.\n  The bill encourages development of preservation and education \nstrategies to capture elements of our national culture and history such \nas immigration, migration, ethnicity, family, gender, health, \nneighborhood, and community. The prehistory and the history of this \nnation are inextricably linked to the mosaic of migrations, \nimmigrations and cultures that has resulted in the peopling of America. \nAmericans are all travelers from other regions, continents and islands, \nand I feel we need a better understanding and appreciation of this \ncoherent and unifying\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\ntheme in America. This is the source of our nation's greatness and \nstrength. Our rich American heritage includes the traditions, cultures, \nand contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, both as a \ngroup and as individuals.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my statement with a note of \npraise and congratulations to some of the members of the Asian Pacific \nAmerican community most deserving of recognition. President Clinton \nrecently approved the Army nominations of 21 Asian Pacific American \nWorld War II veterans to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. This \nconcluded a review that I requested of service records of Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islanders who received the Distinguished Service \nCross during World War II. The approval of the Medal of Honor for these \n21 men who served with valor in World War II--19 from the 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team and 100th Infantry Battalion--is long overdue \nrecognition of the heroic service and bravery displayed by these Asian \nAmerican soldiers and their comrades in arms. As we honor these \npatriots, including my colleague Senator Daniel Inouye, let us also \nremember the thousands of young men, living and deceased, whose \ncourage, sacrifice and spirit proved that patriotism is a circumstance \nof the heart, not a consequence of the skin.\n  The 100th/442nd fought with incredible courage and bravery in Italy \nand France. Its members won 1 Medal of Honor, 53 DSCs, and more than \n9,000 Purple Hearts. The unit itself won 8 Presidential Unit Citations. \nThe fact that the 100th/442nd saw such fierce and heavy combat, yet \nreceived only one Medal of Honor award, and then only posthumously and \ndue to congressional intervention, raised serious questions about the \nfairness of the award process at that time. Unfortunately, Asian \nPacific Americans were not accorded full consideration for the Medal of \nHonor at the time of their service. A prevailing climate of racial \nprejudice against Asian Pacific Americans during World War II precluded \nthis basic fairness, the most egregious example being the internment of \n120,000 Japanese Americans. The bias, discrimination, and hysteria of \nthat time unfortunately has an impact on the decision to award the \nmilitary's highest honor to Asians and Pacific Islanders.\n  I commend Secretary Caldera and all the Army personnel who conducted \nthe DSC review in a thorough and professional manner. They carried out \nthe difficult task of identifying and reconstructing the records of \nmore than one hundred veterans with diligence, sensitivity, and \ndispatch. The stories documented for each of the 104 DSC recipients \nwill astonish and humble all who read them and underscore our faith in \na nation that produces such heroes.\n  As the only Chinese American in this body and the sole Native \nHawaiian in the Congress, I am proud of the legacy that we as Americans \nare leaving for the world. I am proud of our great country, and I am \nproud of the citizens that make our country great--including our \nnation's Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. We have much to \ncelebrate during Asian Pacific Heritage Month 2000.\n  Mr. President, thank you again for this opportunity, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month. In 1992, President Bush signed into \nlaw legislation designating May as Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth to celebrate the contributions the Asian American and Pacific \nIslander communities have made to our country.\n  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been instrumental in the \ndevelopment of the American landscape for more than a century. The \ndiversity within the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities \nexemplifies the richness of our multicultural country, celebrated \nthrough Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.\n  Valuing family, cultural heritage, and commitment to society, Asian \nAmericans and Pacific islanders have built strong communities \ncontributing to our dynamic society and adding strength to the \nfoundation of our country. With strong values, Asian Americans and \nPacific Islanders have succeeded in many facets of life including \nscience where Dr. David Ho was celebrated as Time Magazine's 1996 Man \nof the Year; the arts, with fashion designer Vera Wang, writer Amy Tan, \nand actress Ming Na-Wen; sports with ice skaters such as Kristi \nYamaguchi and Michelle Kwan and football legend Junior Seau; in the \nmilitary where General Eric Shinseki is the Chief of Staff for the U.S. \nArmy; and politics where there are two Pacific Islander Governors and \nwhere I am joined by six other Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders \nserving in Congress, and where a record number of Asian American and \nPacific Islanders are serving as Administration appointees in some of \nthe highest offices of government. This list is by no means exhaustive, \nit only scratches the surface of the contributions Asian American and \nPacific Islanders have made to our country. Asian Pacific American \nHeritage Month allows us to pay tribute to the commitment and \ncontributions these men and women have made to their communities and to \nour country.\n  The growth of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, \nalong with the achievements we have gained, have brought Asian American \nand Pacific Islander issues to the forefront of American politics. Last \nJune, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13125 establishing the \nWhite House Asian and Pacific Islander Initiative seeking to improve \nthe quality of life for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders through \nincreased participation in federal government programs where they are \nmost likely to be under-served. I commend the President for this \nInitiative and optimistically look forward to the progress this \ncommission will achieve, under the chairmanship of Mr. Norman Mineta, \nto highlight and challenge issues pertinent to Asian Americans and \nPacific Islanders.\n  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made considerable \ncontributions to our nation. I am pleased that through Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month the various histories, cultures, triumphs, and \nhardships of all Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders can be \ncelebrated, honored, and remembered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each May, hundreds of civic organizations, \ncommunity groups, students, and public agencies around the nation \norganize events to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. \nThroughout the month of May, we salute the profound contributions that \nAsian Pacific Americans have made in all areas of life in the United \nStates. From the arts and sciences to politics and education, their \naccomplishments have helped shape our culture and build our nation.\n  In my home state of California, May brings major events celebrating \nAsian Pacific American culture in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, \nSan Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego. For more about these events and \nother interesting information, I invite everyone to consult my special \nAsian Pacific American Heritage Month web page at http://\nboxer.senate.gov/apa/index.html.\n  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month originated in 1977, when \nRepresentatives Norman Mineta and Frank Horton introduced a resolution \ncalling on the President to proclaim the first ten days of May as \nPacific/Asian Heritage Week. Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga \nintroduced similar legislation in the Senate. The following year, \nPresident Jimmy Carter signed a Joint Resolution proclaiming Asian/\nPacific Heritage Week. The celebration was significantly expanded in \n1992, when May was officially designated Asian Pacific American \nHeritage Month by an Act of Congress.\n  The term ``Asian Pacific American'' denotes scores of Asian and \nPacific Island ethnic groups with diverse languages, culture, and \nhistory. Asian Pacific American Heritage Month offers every American an \nopportunity to learn more about these peoples, who have woven so many \nbeautiful threads into the tapestry of American life. During the month \nof May and throughout the year, I hope that every American will take a \nmoment to learn and appreciate more about the rich traditions and major \nachievements of Asian Pacific Americans.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3934-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3934-S3937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY REFORM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have with me an investigative article \nfrom the May 15, 2000 issue of Time magazine, the title of which is \n``Soaked by Congress, Lavished with campaign cash, lawmakers are \n`reforming' bankruptcy--punishing the downtrodden to catch a few \ncheats,'' by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, who are well known \nfor their investigative journalism--some of the best investigative \njournalism in the country.\n  Mr. President, I thank these two journalists for the work they have \ndone over the years. I used to assign their books to classes, and I \nthink it is very good investigative journalism.\n  Let me read from one part of this lengthy article. I sent a copy of \nthis out to colleagues. I commend this piece to all of them.\n       Under the legislation before Congress, new means tests \n     would force more borrowers into Chapter 13--leading to still \n     more failures--and would eliminate bankruptcy as an option \n     for others. For this second group, life will be especially \n     bleak. Listen to their future as described by Brady \n     Williamson, who teaches constitutional law at the University \n     of Wisconsin in Madison and was chairman of the former \n     National Bankruptcy Review Commission, appointed by Congress \n     in 1995: ``A family without access to the bankruptcy system \n     is subject to garnishment proceedings, to multiple collection \n     actions, to repossession of personal property and to mortgage \n     foreclosure. There is virtually no way to save their home \n     and, for a family that does not own a home, no way to ever \n     qualify to buy one.'' The wage earner will be ``faced with \n     what is essentially a life term in debtor's prison.''\n  Brady Williamson, who teaches constitutional law at the University of \nWisconsin, is joined by law professors all across the country in their \nstrong critique in, I would really say, condemnation of this bankruptcy \nbill. Again, he was the chairman of the former National Bankruptcy \nReview Commission, which was appointed in 1995.\n  The reason I mention this is that I want to take a few minutes to \ntalk about this bill.\n  When there was an effort to separate this bankruptcy bill out from \nminimum wage legislation, I opposed it. I opposed the unanimous consent \nagreement. Senator Feingold was out here on the floor with me. We did \nthis because we believe this piece of legislation deserves more \nscrutiny, albeit it passed by a big margin in the Senate. But I am \ntelling you that many colleagues, I think, had no idea of some of the \nprovisions that were in this legislation--some really egregious \nprovisions. We have learned something about what many of us call the \npension raid, which basically for the first time would enable these \ncreditors, as a condition for making the loan, to call upon borrowers \nto say, look, you can also put a lien on my pension. That has never \nbeen done before.\n  But there are other egregious provisions as well. I again point out \nthat last week Time magazine published this investigative article \nentitled ``Soaked by Congress,'' written by Donald Barlett and James \nSteele.\n  I think this is a true picture of who files for bankruptcy in \nAmerica. You will find a far different profile of who the people are \nthan from the skewed version that was used to justify this ``bankruptcy \nreform bill'' passed by the House and the Senate.\n  I would like to give my colleagues an example of the kind of families \nwe are talking about--working families, hard-pressed families, crushed \nby debt, people who need a fresh start.\n  Tomorrow, Senator Kennedy will be coming with other Senators --I will \njoin them--in speaking about this bill as well. Since I came to this \nfloor and I objected to any unanimous consent agreement to separate \nthis bankruptcy bill, passing it and moving it forward, and since I \nhave done everything I know how as a Senator to stop this bill, I want \nto discuss why.\n  First, I will talk about this legislation from the perspective of \nordinary people, people who don't have a lot of money--not the big \nbanks and not the big credit card companies that have been running the \nshow on this legislation.\n  I will read the beginning of this article by Bartlett and Steele:\n\n       Congress is about to make life a lot tougher--and and more \n     expensive--for people like the Trapp family of Plantation, \n     Fla. As if their life isn't hard enough already. Eight-year-\n     old Annelise, the oldest of the three Trapp children, is a \n     bright, spunky, dark-haired wisp who suffers from a \n     degenerative muscular condition. She lives in a wheel-chair \n     or bed, is tied to a respirator at least eight hours a day, \n     eats mostly through a tube and requires round-the-clock \n     nursing care. Doctors have implanted steel rods in her back \n     to stem the curvature of her spine.\n       Her parents, Charles and Lisa, are staring at a medical \n     bill for $106,373 from Miami Children's Hospital. then there \n     are the credit-card debts. The $10,310 they owe Bank One. The \n     $5,537 they owe Chase Manhattan Bank. The $8,222 they owe \n     MBNA America. The $4,925 they owe on their Citibank Preferred \n     Visa card.\n       The $6,838 they owe on their Discover card. The $6,458 they \n     owe on their MasterCard. ``People don't understand, unless \n     they have a medically needy child, these kinds of \n     circumstances,'' says Charles Trapp, 42, a mail carrier.\n\n  Most of the people who file for bankruptcy under chapter 7 for a new \nstart, about 40 percent-plus, are people who have been put under \nbecause of a medical bill. The studies don't talk about a lot of abuse. \nThey mention 3, 4 or 5 percent of the people at most abusing this \nsystem. Most of the people in the country who do have to start over \nfind themselves in these awful situations because there has been a \ndivorce and now there is a single parent or because people have lost \ntheir jobs or because people face catastrophic medical bills. We are \ngoing to punish these families?\n  The figures on the amount of money pouring in, let me be clear, are \nnot on one to one. I am not going to stand here and say every single \nSenator who disagrees with me on this disagrees with me because they \nreceived a lot of money from big credit card companies. Then someone \ncan turn around, and I know the presiding Chair will agree, and say \nevery position you take is based on money you have received. That is \nsimply an analysis that should be unacceptable. I will not do that. It \nis not fair to people I serve with and I don't believe it.\n  However, from an institutional view of who has power and who doesn't \nhave power in America, we see an industry that has a tremendous amount \nof clout, that certainly contributes a lot of money--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--that has the lobbyists, is certainly well connected \nand, of course, the people whom we are talking about, such as the Trapp \nfamily, don't have the same kind of connections.\n  We are, I think, about to do something very egregious to these \nfamilies. Yesterday was Mother's Day--Sheila and I marched in the \nMillion Mom March and were proud to do so--so I'd like to read from a \nletter signed by 70 scholars at our Nation's law schools who are \nopposed to this legislation about how this bill will affect mothers. \nThey write directly to this issue of how low-income, women-headed \nhouseholds will be devastated by this bankruptcy bill.\n       As the heads of the economically most vulnerable families, \n     they have a special stake in the pending legislation. Women \n     heads of households are now the largest demographic group in \n     bankruptcy, and according to the credit industry's own data, \n     they are the poorest. The provisions in this bill, \n     particularly the provisions that apply without regard to \n     income, will fall hardest on them. A single mother with \n     dependent children who is hopelessly insolvent and whose \n     income is far below the national median income still would \n     have her bankruptcy case dismissed if she does not present \n     copies of income tax returns for the past three years--even \n     if those returns are in the possession of her ex-husband. A \n     single mother who hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment \n     plan would be forced to pay every penny of the entire debt \n     owed on almost worthless items of collateral, such as used \n     furniture or children's clothes, even if it meant that \n     successful completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n  I don't think the choices in this debate could be stated any more \nstarkly. The core question is, Are we on the side of these big credit \ncompanies and these banks or are we on the side of too many women in \nthis country struggling to support their families?\n  I will mention a few other provisions in this legislation that are \npunitive. I already mentioned the pension grab. People didn't even seem \nto know about that provision. That is being reworked. Good. I want to \nsee the bill improved, although a wise proverb comes to mind: Never put \ngood stitching in a rock cloth.\n  I think this bill is fundamentally flawed--not the Senators who \nsupport\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\nthe bill, the bill. Section 102 of this bill removes the ability of a \ndebtor to seek sanctions against a creditor who brought coercive, \nfrivolous claims against the debtor, as long as the claim in question \nis less than $1,000. If someone has a loan for less than $1,000, a \ncreditor can intimidate and threaten legal action, even if he doesn't \nintend to take legal action with impunity.\n  Section 105 imposes mandatory credit counseling on debtors before \nthey can seek bankruptcy relief at the debtors' expense--as if the \ndebtors have the money for this. This is regardless of whether the \nbankruptcy would be the result of simple overspending or the result of \nunavoidable expenses such as catastrophic medical expense. There is no \nwaiver of this requirement. People can end up being evicted.\n  Section 311 ends the practice of stopping eviction proceedings \nagainst tenants who are behind on rent who file for bankruptcy. This is \ncritical for tenants under current law.\n  I could go on and on.\n  I speak from the Senate floor to the people in the country. This is a \nreform issue. I talked about who has the clout in America and who \ndoesn't. At one time, there was a bill that came to the floor of the \nSenate, a much better bill, that I voted against. It was a 99-1 vote. I \nthought that bill was too harsh and too punitive, but most of my \ncolleagues disagreed. People had done good work on it.\n\n  Now this bill that passed the United States, it is as Barlett and \nSteele pointed out in their very important piece, it is completely one \nsided. There is no call for accountability or responsibility on the \npart of the creditor, credit card companies. There are harsh \nprovisions, many of which--most of which--all of which, frankly, \ndisproportionately affect low-income people, moderate-income people, \nwomen, working families, you name it, based upon the assumption that \nmost people who file for bankruptcy abuse the system--which is not \ntrue. Most people are put under because of a medical bill or they have \nbeen out of work or because there is a divorce. This bill is just a \ncarbon copy of what this credit card industry wants.\n  I objected to the unanimous consent agreement to try to move this \nbill, first to decouple it from the minimum wage and then to try \nbasically to move it through. I do not want to. I want to try to stop \nthis piece of legislation. Because different Senators are entitled to \ntheir own viewpoint, I will be pleased, as we get a chance to really \nlook at the provisions of this legislation carefully, as in the case of \nthis Barlett and Steele piece, and if this bill comes back before the \nSenate and we have the debate, I will be willing to agree to time \nlimits on amendments--you name it. But we need to have a thorough \ndebate on this bill. I am not going to let it go through by unanimous \nconsent or continue in any way, shape, or form.\n  The effort that is underway is to take this legislation and put it \ninto an unrelated bill; the e-signatures bill is the latest, the effort \nto take this bankruptcy--quote, reform--bill and put it into the \nconference committee on e-signature legislation. It has nothing to do \nwith e-signature legislation. Then the effort is to bring the \nconference report back to the Senate where it cannot be amended and can \nbe only voted up or down.\n  It is clever enough, but the truth of the matter is, again, my goal \nin life is to have people interested in politics, public affairs. Even \nif they vote Republican, I am all for them if they are interested in \npublic affairs. That is my view. I just don't want people opting out \nand being disillusioned and becoming cynical because then I think our \ncountry suffers, I think representative democracy suffers. That is what \nI believe in more than anything else.\n  This is a reform issue. People hate this. They hate the way this \nprocess works, where you can take a bill and now put it into a \ncompletely unrelated piece of legislation, outside the scope of the \nconference committee, tuck it in, do it at midnight, do it late at \nnight, do it when people cannot see it, do it in whatever way you can, \nin the most private way possible, and then just try to push it through. \nIt is a neat parliamentary technique, it is a neat trick through this \nprocess, this legislative process. But it is an outrage.\n  I do not think Senators should support this. I certainly am going to \nchallenge this question on the scope of conference. I think we had a \nruling on this which was an unfortunate ruling. We will have to go back \nthrough that. There are other Senators, Senator Harkin, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Kennedy--a number of others--just to mention a few \nwho I think feel very strongly about this. The more Senators really \nknow what is in this piece of legislation, the more Senators who read \nthis investigative report in Time magazine, the more Senators are going \nto be worried about this. They are going to be worried about this \nlegislation going through in this form.\n  There are good Senators who have worked on this legislation, some I \nconsider to be some of the best. But this legislation is fundamentally \nflawed. I speak about it today. I am going to continue to do everything \nI can to stop it. I want people in the country to know what the effort \nis right now, which is to put this piece of legislation into an \nunrelated conference report.\n\n  I want to make it clear on the floor of the Senate that everything I \nknow how to do as a Senator, to insist that this bill goes back in the \nregular order and comes back through this legislative process--which \nwill give us an opportunity to look at other provisions we did not know \nwere in this bill, such as the pension grab amendment--is what I insist \non. I think other Senators feel the same way.\n  I do not believe Senators, Democrats or Republicans alike, whether \nthey agree or disagree on this particular piece of legislation--I do \nnot think they should accept the proposition we can just put it into an \nunrelated conference report. We are heading nowhere good if we start \ndoing that with different pieces of legislation. We are heading nowhere \ngood as a legislative body. It is the wrong way to legislate. It is the \nwrong way to conduct our business.\n  Then the question is, Paul, do you have a right to just come out here \nand object to a unanimous consent agreement?\n  Yes, I do. We had a minimum wage and we had a bankruptcy bill tied \ntogether, and there were tax cuts included with minimum wage \nprovisions. But tax measures need to originate in the House of \nRepresentatives under the Constitution and the Senate leadership knows \nthat. If that mistake was made--to unconstitutionally add the tax \ncuts--and I oppose this bill and, by our own rules, it requires \nunanimous consent to correct the mistake, of course I have a right to \nobject, especially if I think this is an egregious piece of legislation \nwhich hits hard at the most vulnerable, low-income citizens in the \nUnited States of America. Of course I have the right to do that.\n  I say to the majority leader, if he wants to bring this bill back on \nthe floor, let's have at it. We will even have some time agreements on \nsome amendments. But we will have a thorough debate on this, and I will \nhave a chance to point out many egregious provisions in this \nlegislation in a way we were not able to last time. Then we will see \nwhere we go.\n  But if this gets put into a conference committee--and I hope there is \nenough pressure from other Senators and I hope there is enough pressure \nfrom the public that this does not happen. That is the best outcome. I \nhope the journalists will write about this piece of legislation and \nwill write about what could very well happen here because I think it is \nindicative of what does not work well here in the legislative process.\n  If this gets folded into a conference report, I have no doubt a \nnumber of Senators--we will do everything we can to hold it up in every \nway possible. But my hope is we do this the right way and not the wrong \nway. The right way is, let's have a little bit more of a focus and a \nlittle more spotlight on this piece of legislation.\n  To reiterate, I wanted to take just a few minutes today to talk about \nthe so-called bankruptcy ``reform'' bill which some Members of this \nbody are trying to force down the throat of working families. As I hope \nmy colleagues are aware, as I speak here today this punitive \nlegislation is being negotiated by a small group of staff working for a \nhandful of members in a secret ``shadow'' conference. Their plan is to \nattach this legislation to an unrelated conference report and pass the \nbill with minimal public scrutiny.\n  When you really look at what's in this bill, and what's driving this \nbill,\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\nit's really not surprising that some of my colleagues have been trying \nto do this behind closed doors. But recently, there has been an \nincreasing drum beat of outrage and attention from outside Congress \nboth on the bill itself and the desperate tactics being used to pass \nit. As I said, last week Time magazine published an investigative \narticle about the bill, entitled ``Soaked by Congress,'' The article, \nwritten by reporters Dan Bartlett and Jim Steele, is a detailed look at \nthe true picture of who files for bankruptcy in America. You will find \nit far different from the skewed version that was used to justify the \nbankruptcy ``reform'' bill passed by the House and Senate.\n  Last week I sent a dear colleague around with a copy of the article. \nI hope all my colleagues saw it. Tomorrow I believe a group of Senators \nwill speak in the morning about this article, but I'd like to talk \nabout it this afternoon for just a few minutes in the hope that some of \nyou will take another look at this bill, take another look at what it \nwill do to working families, folks crushed by debt, folks who need a \nfresh start. I want my colleagues to look at this bill from the \nperspective of ordinary folks--not the big banks and credit card \ncompanies.\n  I'd like to read the beginning of the article, it begins:\n\n       Congress is about to make life a lot tougher--and more \n     expensive--for people like the Trapp family of Plantation, \n     Fla. As if their life isn't hard enough already. Eight-year-\n     old Annelise, the oldest of the three Trapp children, is a \n     bright, spunky, dark-haired wisp who suffers from a \n     degenerative muscular condition. She lives in a wheelchair or \n     bed, is tied to a respirator at least eight hours a day, eats \n     mostly through a tube and requires round-the-clock nursing \n     care. Doctors have implanted steel rods in her back to stem \n     the curvature of her spine.\n       Her parents, Charles and Lisa, are staring at a medical \n     bill for $106,373 from Miami Children's Hospital. Then there \n     are the credit-card debts. The $10,310 they owe Bank One. The \n     $5,537 they owe Chase Manhattan Bank. The $8,222 they owe \n     MBNA America. The $4,925 they owe on their Citibank Preferred \n     Visa card. The $6,838 they owe on their Discover card. The \n     $6,458 they owe on their MasterCard. ``People don't \n     understand, unless they have a medically needy child, these \n     kinds of circumstances,'' says Charles Trapp, 42, a mail \n     carrier.\n\n  Now I ask my colleagues, is there one thing in this bill that would \nhave helped this family head off bankruptcy? Absolutely not, this bill \nwould simply make it harder for them to get the relief they needed to \ntake care of themselves and their daughter. Why aren't we talking about \nwhat could have kept this family out of bankruptcy? What does this bill \ndo to help a woman or man who wants to educate themselves so they can \nearn a better living for their family? What does this bill do to keep \nordinary folks from being overwhelmed by medical expenses? What does \nthis bill do to promote economic stability for working families? \nShouldn't the goal be keeping families out of circumstances where they \ncan't pay their debts instead of punishing them once it's too late? I \nbelieve if my colleagues really wanted to reduce the number of \nbankruptcies they would focus more on providing a helping hand up \nrather than removing the safety net. If they really wanted to tackle \nbankruptcy, they would take on the credit card companies and their \nabusive tactics.\n  Yesterday was Mother's Day Mr. President, I would like to read from a \nletter, signed by approximately 70 scholars at our nation's law \nschools, who are opposed to this legislation. They write directly to \nthis issue of how low income women headed households will be devastated \nby this legislation:\n\n       As the heads of the economically most vulnerable families, \n     they have a special stake in the pending legislation. Women \n     heads of households are now the largest demographic group in \n     bankruptcy, and according to the credit industry's own data, \n     they are the poorest. The provisions in this bill, \n     particularly the provisions that apply without regard to \n     income, will fall hardest on them. A single mother with \n     dependent children who is hopelessly insolvent and whose \n     income is far below the national median income still would \n     have her bankruptcy case dismissed if she does not present \n     copies of income tax returns for the past three years--even \n     if those returns are in the possession of her ex-husband. A \n     single mother who hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment \n     plan would be forced to pay every penny of the entire debt \n     owed on almost worthless items of collateral, such as used \n     furniture or children's clothes, even if it meant that \n     successful completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n\n  I don't think the choices in this debate can be made any more stated \nany more starkly. The core question is this: Will colleagues be on the \nside of these women, struggling to raise their families? Or do they see \nthese women as the banks and credit card companies do: just an economic \nopportunity ripe for exploitation?\n  A constituent from Crystal, Minnesota wrote to my office last July to \ntell me about her experience with bankruptcy. Her life was very much \nlike any of ours until an injury forced her to leave the financial \nsecurity of her factory job. She worked multiple minimum wage jobs for \nseveral years as her marriage fell apart and her daughter began a \ndescent into deep clinical depression. In the meantime, she enrolled in \ncomputer school so that she could pursue a career that would give her \nand her daughter a stable income. She purchased a computer on credit so \nshe could spend more time working at home. In time, the payments on the \ncomputer, her mortgage and her daughter's medical bills became too \nmuch, and she fell behind on debt payments. When creditors approached \nher, she tried to work out a repayment schedule that she could meet. \nSome were willing to do so. However, she says in her letter:\n\n       What I want you to know specifically is that this one \n     credit card company would not offer any reductions in the \n     interest rate, demanded over one quarter of my entire monthly \n     income, did not care if I could not meet my payments for the \n     most basic requirements of human existence, suggested that I \n     use a food shelf, and they refused to acknowledge that my \n     child was suicidal and that their harassing phone calls to my \n     house nearly caused her to overdose on the only non-\n     prescription pain relievers that I could have for myself.\n\n  So she filed for bankruptcy. She has begun to rebuild her life and \nshe ended her letter by saying:\n\n       Please to not vote for Senate Bill 625 or any other bill \n     that makes bankruptcy harder for people who find themselves \n     caught in the unforeseen predicaments of life for which they \n     have no control. It is not fair to pass a bill that helps the \n     credit card companies by hurting people like me without \n     forcing them to look at what they are doing, and how they \n     respond. They have many options that could be used without \n     creating the emotional trauma that forces hard working people \n     to choose the relief of bankruptcy.\n\n  What the Bartlett and Steele article makes very clear is that these \nstories are typical in our bankruptcy courts today. And what does this \nbill do to these folks? It makes it more difficult to file, harder to \nget a fresh start, allows them to discharge less debt. Forces them to \npay more in attorney's fees or maybe make an attorney cost \nprohibitive--but not for the big banks. It forces families into Chapter \n13 which \\2/3\\ which of all debtors currently fail to complete because \nof economic circumstances. This legislation allows them to be \nvictimized by coercive debt collectors and abolishes critical tenant \nprotections.\n  This is reform?\n  Let me be clear: The bankruptcy bills passed by House and Senate are \nill-conceived, unjust, and imbalanced. They impose harsh penalties on \nfamilies who file for bankruptcy in good faith as a last resort, and \naddress a ``crisis'' that is self-correcting. They reward the predatory \nand reckless lending by banks and credit card companies which fed the \ncrisis in the first place, and it does nothing to actually prevent \nbankruptcy by promoting economic security in working families.\n  Here are just a few of the punitive provisions in the Senate passed \nbankruptcy bill:\n  No. 1. Section 102 of the bill would remove the ability to a debtor \nto seek sanctions against a creditor who brought coercive, frivolous \nclaims against a debtor--as long as the claim in question is less than \n$1000. So in other words, as long as the loan was for less than $1000, \na creditor may intimidate the borrower or threaten legal action it \ndoesn't intend to take (all illegal under current law).\n  No. 2. Section 105 imposes mandatory credit counseling on debtors \nbefore the can seek bankruptcy relief--at the debtors expense. This is \nregardless of whether the bankruptcy would be the result of simple \noverspending or something unavoidable like sudden medical expenses. \nThere is no waiver of this requirement if the debtor needs to make an \nemergency bankruptcy filing to stave off eviction or utility shutoff.\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\n  No. 3. Section 311 will end the practice under current law of \nstopping eviction proceedings against tenants who are behind on rent \nwho file for bankruptcy. This is a critical right of tenants under \ncurrent law.\n  No. 4. Section 312 will make a person ineligible to file for Chapter \n13 bankruptcy if he or she has successfully emerged from bankruptcy \nwithin the past 5 years--even if it was a successful chapter 13 \nreorganization where the debtor paid off all their creditors.\n  No. 5. The bill's new reporting, filing and paperwork requirements \nwill make bankruptcy process more onerous than ever before--expensive \nlegal expertise will be more necessary, a burden which low and moderate \nincome families with high debt loads can ill afford. But several \nsections of the bill create a variety of disincentives for attorneys to \nrepresent consumers in bankruptcy. The results of these provisions will \nbe that some attorneys will leave the practice of consumer bankruptcy, \nand others will have to raise their fees to account for the increased \nexpenses and risks involved. This in turn will lead to more consumers \nbeing unable to afford an attorney and either obtaining no relief or \nfalling prey to nonattorney petition preparers who provide services \nwhich are usually incompetent and often fraudulent.\n  No. 6. The means test to determine which debtors can file Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy--as opposed to Chapter 13--is inflexible and arbitrary. It \nis based on IRS standards not drafted for bankruptcy purposes that do \nnot take into account individual family needs for expenses like \ntransportation, food and rent. It disadvantages renters and individuals \nwho rely on public transportation and benefits higher income \nindividuals with more property and debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3937-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CAPITOL HILL POLICE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to very briefly mention \nanother matter since I have the floor. I think the Senate is going to \nbe united. This I hope will be less of a battle than on the horrible \nbankruptcy bill, credit card company bill, big banker bill. This is the \nweek where we honor law enforcement. I said it last week. I will say it \none more time. I say it to the Presiding Officer. I say it to every \nSenator.\n  You should, if you get a chance, talk to some of the Capitol Hill \npolice officers at the different stations here on the Senate side. You \nwill be really troubled by how demoralized they feel and also how angry \nthey are. I have never seen anything like this, and I have been here \n9\\1/2\\ years. I have never seen anything like this.\n  Sheila and I are pretty good friends socially and in other ways with \nsome of the police officers. I am sure some of the Senators are. They \nare just livid. In July, 2 years ago, we lost two fine officers, and \nafter all the concern that was professed, they cannot believe, in light \nof that and in light of the fact that we do not have two officers on \nevery post where we need two officers just for security reasons for the \npublic, for us--and I would argue just as important for them--that not \nonly are we not living up to that commitment and doing what we need to \ndo--the Sergeant at Arms on the Senate side, Jim Ziglar, has been \nterrific on this and Senator Bennett, the Republican chair of the \nappropriations legislative subcommittee; his subcommittee has been \nterrific on this--these police officers cannot believe what the House \nof Representatives has done.\n  It is unbelievable. What the House of Representatives has done is to \ncall for fairly dramatic--I don't have the figures. I don't know if the \nfigures are so important. They are calling for dramatic cuts in the \nbudget so we will have hundreds fewer, 400 fewer, police officers.\n  I will say to some of the Representatives on the House side, and in \nparticular I am going to say it to the Republicans because on this one \nthere seems to be a pretty major party split where the Democrats have \nexpressed a lot of indignation, where Congressman Hoyer and Congressman \nObey spoke up rather strongly about this, in all due respect, do we \nneed to wait for this to happen again where we only have two police \nofficers at the memorial post over the weekend, with long lines of \npeople, and one person shows up who is deranged, and those two officers \ncannot possibly handle that situation when there are all sorts of other \npeople coming through the line, and you have to check baggage and check \nwhat people have and you have to be talking to people and keep your eye \non so many different people, and it cannot therefore be prevented or \navoided, and we lose more? What are you waiting for?\n  It is absolutely outrageous. I say to the police union, the officers' \nunion, which is a fine union, whatever the union decides to do is what \nthe union decides to do, but I would not blame this union if the police \nofficers do not express clearly their indignation.\n  I cannot believe this was done. As I said last week, it is one of the \nmost unconscionable, one of the worst things that has been done in the \nCongress since I have been here. I really believe that.\n  I say to Senators, when this appropriations bill comes to the floor, \nI know Senator Reid, who is a former Capitol Police officer, and I know \nI will be out here and others will be, too, with an amendment that will \nget the funding up. All of us will agree, Republicans and Democrats, \nthat we are in good shape on the Senate side, and I am proud of that.\n  I say to the Chair, what I would rather not see is two different \noperations where on the Senate side we have the funding and do what we \nneed to do to make sure these officers are given the resources for \ntheir own security, much less the security of the public, and then on \nthe House side, they have a completely different situation.\n  I wanted to bring this to the attention of my colleagues because we \nare going to have a very strong showing on the Senate side. I do not \nbelieve it is posturing just to show one is on the side of the police \nofficers. People feel strongly about it in the Senate.\n  We went through far less than the families of Agent Gibson and \nOfficer Chestnut. We went through a living hell here. We do not want it \nto happen again. We do not know whether we can prevent it from \nhappening again, but we certainly ought to do everything we can. \nCutting 400 police officers is not doing everything we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3937-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3937-S3938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AGRICULTURE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is interesting the Senator from \nKansas is in the chair because I know we are in agreement on this, but \nI at least want to make the appeal to my colleagues that, for my own \npart, I believe it is good that in our budget resolution we made \nallowance for additional funding for help and assistance to farmers. It \nwas somewhere close to $7 billion.\n  My hope is we will not do this in the process of an emergency \nappropriations bill; that we will give care to how we allocate this \nmoney, how we get assistance out to farmers. My fear is--and maybe it \nwill be a good arrangement--that if we double AMTA payments and put it \ninto the conference report to accompany the crop insurance bill, we \nwill have lost our opportunity to have hearings in the Ag Committee and \nhave some focus, some substantive discussion, some careful discussion \nabout how we can make sure we target the assistance to those producers \nthat need it the most.\n  I voted for AMTA payments. I am not intellectually arrogant. I \nfigured, what help we could get the people, get it. I had an \nuncomfortable feeling that some of the landowners who were not even \nfarmers and some of the largest operators least in need were getting \nmore than they needed. The flip side was the people who needed help the \nmost were not getting it. I do not want an inverse relationship of \nassistance to need. Some, regarding the AMTA payments, suggest that is \nwhat is happening.\n  At a minimum, I say to my colleagues, we should, between now and the \nend of June--we have time--have some hearings in the Ag Committee. We \nshould have some careful discussion and deliberation about how we get \nthis assistance out to family farmers. It should be more targeted than \nthe AMTA payments have been. I do not believe it is appropriate, again, \nto deal with such an important issue and such an important question by \nputting it into another conference report, this particular one being on \ncrop insurance.\n  When we went through the budget process and allocated this money, we \nwere making a statement that we did\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\nnot want to be forced into a situation of one more time getting \nemergency funding out there without any deliberation as to how. I \nthought this meant we were, on the part of the authorization committee, \nSenator Lugar's committee, going to have hearings and an opportunity \nfor Senators and people from the countryside to talk about the best way \nto get this assistance out to the countryside to help the people most \nin need.\n  It looks to me, again, that we may be making an end run around that \nprocess, and that is a mistake. I speak out for the hearings. I speak \nout for deliberations. I speak out for doing something about the price \ncrisis other than every year just getting money out to people. Most of \nthe producers in the country would far rather get a decent price. That \nis a whole other discussion and debate which I hope we will have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between 2 and 3 o'clock shall be \nunder the control of Senator Thomas from Wyoming, or his designee.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3938-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3938-S3940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today Gov. George W. Bush set forth some \nideas addressing the issue of Social Security. It is my understanding \nthat the Vice President is also going to discuss this issue today, \nalthough he has, before today, made a number of comments in this area.\n  I have spent a considerable amount of my time over the last 7 years I \nhave served in the Senate working on the issue of Social Security, \nworking on it in a bipartisan manner, trying to develop a coalition in \nthis Senate to move toward resolution of what I consider to be one of \nthe most significant public policy matters we have confronting us.\n  Let me define the problem so we understand what we are working with \nand what the concerns are. Today, the Social Security system is running \na very aggressive surplus. In other words, it is taking in more money \nthan it is paying out. The Social Security system is on a dollar in/\ndollar out basis. In other words, there is no asset value that is \nplaced somewhere. There are not a set of dollars saved to pay your \nSocial Security benefit. The dollar raised today pays the benefit that \nis incurred today. The younger worker who is paying Social Security \ntaxes today is paying for the older worker who is retired today.\n  We have the baby boom generation working today at its maximum earning \ncapacity, and because we have a larger younger generation than the \ngeneration that is retired, we are now running a surplus. In other \nwords, more money is being taken in to pay for the benefits than is \nbeing spent on the benefits. That extra money is being borrowed by the \nFederal Government. It is being used basically to operate the day-to-\nday activities of the Federal Government. In exchange for that, a note \nis given back to the Social Security trust fund.\n\n  Alternatively, the money is being used to buy down the debt of the \nFederal Government--the public debt in many instances--and that money \nis then basically returned to the marketplace in the form of proceeds \ngoing into the capital markets because we no longer have the Federal \nGovernment borrowing those moneys from the capital markets but, rather, \nthe money is no longer needed by the Federal Government and, therefore, \nthe capital markets are free to create more activity for a stronger \ncapital market.\n  The problem is, the baby boom generation today is generating the huge \nsurplus in Social Security funds and is going to start retiring in the \nyear 2008. When that generation starts to retire, the demographics of \nthe situation change radically. The Social Security system was always \nperceived as a pyramid. It was always believed there would be a larger \nworking generation than the retired generation. The retired generation \nat the top of the pyramid would be smaller and the working generation \nat the bottom of the pyramid would be larger.\n  Because the postwar baby boom generation is so large, it is that \nunique generation that has changed this country in every decade and \nforced the country to build all sorts of elementary schools in the \n1950s and created the disruption to a large degree in the 1960s. It has \ngone through the pipeline and has changed the system in every \ngenerational phase. When that generation retires, we go from a pyramid \nto almost a rectangle. Instead of having 3.5 people working for every \none person retired by the year 2015, we only have two people working \nfor every one person retired. The system comes under a huge strain. The \nbenefits don't change--or there is no plan to change them--and \ntherefore all the folks who are retired have to be supported by a \nyounger generation, which is a smaller generation, but they have to \nsupport them again with the tax dollars earned by that generation.\n  As we look into the future--and we don't have to look very far; it \nbegins in 2008--we see as we head into the second decade of this new \ncentury, the next generation, our children and their children are going \nto be subjected to a huge cost, a huge tax increase, in order to \nsupport the retirement of the baby boom generation. This escalates \nrather dramatically through the year 2045.\n  There are Members who think something should be done, that we should \nnot pass this huge burden on to the next generation; that we, as a baby \nboom generation, have an obligation to get ourselves and our Nation \nready for the retirement of our generation.\n  As I said, we worked across the aisle for the last few years to try \nto develop policies to address this problem. Dramatic progress has been \nmade. There are at least four or five major initiatives in this Senate \ntoday which legitimately address the issue of making the Social \nSecurity system solvent for 100 years. One of them happens to be one \nwhich I worked on with Senator Breaux, Senator Kerrey, Senator \nThompson, Senator Thomas, Senator Grassley, and Senator Robb. It is \nbipartisan and crosses philosophical spectrums.\n  Our proposal, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office and by the \nSocial Security actuaries, makes the system solvent for the next 100 \nyears. It does it without any tax increase of any significance.\n  In order to accomplish this type of a change, we have to have \ncomprehensive reform. We cannot do it piecemeal; we have to do the \nwhole system. We can't just simply pick out one point in the system and \ntry to change that and expect to address the system so it becomes \nsolvent, so we do not put a huge burden onto our children's backs in \nnew taxes, or additional tax increases.\n\n  We have tried to draw into this debate, to get this process moving, \nthe White House and the President, but we have had singularly little \nluck in doing that. Regrettably, although this administration has \noccasionally talked about Social Security reform, and the President in \nhis State of the Union even said this would be one of his primary goals \nin his waning years in office, it has done virtually nothing and, in \nfact, has put out proposals that would dramatically cause the situation \nto deteriorate, especially for the younger generation, in the form of \nmajor tax increases.\n  Today, Governor Bush has put forth a proposal. Regrettably, the \nresponse by Vice President Gore, up until today--and I suspect he will \nnot change his tune today--and the response of the White House, has \nbeen to essentially take the old time school approach of attacking it \nin the most demagogic terms, saying the proposal is going to end Social \nSecurity; it is going to put at risk recipients who are presently \nbenefiting from Social Security, and that it is a proposal which \nundermines this critical national program of Social Security.\n  The Vice President has used terms such as ``risky'' to describe it. \nHe has used terms such as ``inappropriate.'' He has used terms--\n``smug,'' I think is one term, and other terms which try to demonize \nthe proposal in a way that is\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nnot constructive. So let's look at the proposal because I think it is \nimportant to think about this. What Governor Bush has suggested is \nthis.\n  First, we recognize anybody who is on the Social Security system \ntoday, or about to go on the Social Security system soon, should have \ntheir benefits locked in place and the structure of the system \nmaintained exactly as they receive it; there should not be any change \nat all for those folks. So any senior citizen today or anybody who is \nabout to go on the system, anybody 55 years or older, I believe, has no \nconcern here. Essentially the proposal says you will be held harmless. \nNothing is going to impact your way of life as it relates to Social \nSecurity. Yet it is very obvious the Vice President is trying to scare \nsenior citizens and is saying the proposals coming from Governor Bush \nwill in some way affect their benefit structure when Governor Bush is \nsaying specifically it will not.\n  Second, Governor Bush suggested we set up a bipartisan commission to \ntake a look at this, a proposal that has been put forth by Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Kerrey and Senator McCain, I think. It is not a \nbad idea because this needs to be done in a bipartisan way, and we have \nworked very hard on the bipartisan process in this Senate, so that \nmakes sense.\n  Third, the Governor suggested we take a look at what is known as \npersonal savings accounts. This is an idea whose time has come, in my \nopinion. Why? First, let's talk about what personal savings accounts \nare in the context of Social Security reform.\n  There are three ways you can address Social Security and make it \nsolvent, only three ways. One, you can raise taxes. That is the \nClinton-Gore proposal. In fact, under the Gore-Clinton proposal, there \nwill have to be a tax increase each year going forward on working \nAmericans in order to support retired Americans. That goes up and goes \nup, I think, until it is $1 trillion around 2035. That is their \nproposal: Raise taxes on Americans in the outyears. Just do not tell \nAmericans that is what is going to happen to them.\n\n  The way they do not tell you is they say we are going to use the \ninterest on the Social Security to pay down the debt, which is \noccurring today because we are returning a surplus; we are going to use \nthat interest to extend the life of the trust fund. That is a paper \ngame, the bottom line of which is a tax increase that hits $1 trillion \nby the year 2035. Why is that?\n  Just to make an aside for the moment, so people understand what the \nVice President is proposing: There are no assets in the Social Security \ntrust fund other than Government bonds. What do Government bonds do? \nGovernment bonds are a claim on the taxpayers of America to be paid. It \nis an IOU from the taxpayers to the trust fund. It says we, the \ntaxpayers of America, owe you this money. When you need this money, \nwhen that baby boom generation retires, then we, the taxpayers, of \nAmerica will pay it.\n  Who is ``we''? We are the younger generation. The ``we'' in that \nsentence is my children and their children, your children and \ngrandchildren who will be working then. They will get stuck with the \nIOUs that Vice President Gore wants to stick them with, with his little \ngamesmanship of transferring interest, which is purely a paper \ntransaction, creating absolutely no assets in the trust fund. All it \ndoes is create an IOU which has to be paid by the younger generation. \nThese kids sitting right here as pages are going to pay that IOU.\n  It means their taxes on Social Security will not be 12 percent of \ntheir payroll; it will be somewhere in the vicinity of 18 percent of \ntheir payroll. As I said, it will amount to about a $1 trillion tax \nincrease on working Americans by the year 2035. That is the Vice \nPresident's proposal: Raise taxes but do not tell anybody it is coming. \nUse this little euphemism: We are going to transfer the savings on \ninterest over to the trust fund, which means we are going to create a \nmassive tax burden on the next generation in the outyears in order to \npay for the benefits of this generation of which I am part, the baby \nboom generation. But do not tell anybody about that. Just use the term, \n``We are going to transfer the savings from interest.'' ``We are going \nto transfer the savings from interest on Social Security'' sounds \ngood--do that by paying down the Social Security funds, and that \nsavings means we will extend the life of the trust fund.\n  That means nothing. It simply means we are going to end up increasing \ntaxes and having more IOUs our younger generation has to pay. So that \nis the first way you can do it; you can raise taxes--the Vice \nPresident's proposal.\n  The second way you can address the issue is to reduce benefits. There \nis not much incentive for reducing benefits in our society. People do \nnot like that idea in a democracy. In fact, the Vice President not only \nis not going to reduce benefits; he is already suggesting we increase \nbenefits. The only specific proposals he has made on Social Security is \nwe raise benefits in two different accounts. It happens to be both \nthose proposals to raise benefits make some sense, but they have to be \ndone in the context of the entire structure. There has to be some \ntradeoff. If you are going to raise those benefits, there has to be \nsome adjustment in the other benefit side or else you significantly \nincrease the liability to the trust fund, which means once again you \nraise the taxes on the next generation to pay for those benefits, that \nyounger generation. So he has raised benefits. That is not the way to \nsolve it.\n\n  The third way he can address it--remember, you can address it by \nraising taxes on the younger generation that is earning the benefits \nfor the older generation that is receiving the benefits, or the third \nway is you can prefund the liability. That is what personal savings \naccounts do, prefund the liability. By prefunding the liability, we \nmean you actually create an asset which is owned, actually physically \nowned by the person who is going to retire, which is not a debt \ninstrument of the Federal Government. It is not an IOU that has to be \npaid for out of taxes, necessarily. It can be stocks or bonds--some of \nthe bonds could be U.S. Government bonds--but it would be an asset \nowned by the individual. What does that do?\n  Today, if you are in the Social Security system and you happen to \ndie, unfortunately, before you reach retirement age--say you die and \nyou are 59 years old and you do not have a spouse or any children. \nEverything you paid into the Social Security system is lost. You paid \nin for years and years and years and your estate does not get anything \nfrom it. It is gone; it just dissipates into the system. Somebody else \nbenefits from all those taxes you paid. You have no asset value.\n  Even if you have a spouse and you die before you retire at 62 or 65, \nor even if you die soon after that, the benefits that spouse gets as a \nresult of your death, as a result of your Social Security payment, is \nreally minimal--very, very small--compared to the amount of taxes you \nactually paid in to Social Security. So there is nothing physically \nthere that you own. You have an obligation from the Federal Government \nto support you at a certain level after you retire, but you have no \nasset value.\n  What a personal account does is it allows you to take a small portion \nof the taxes you are paying in to Social Security--and it is a very \nsmall portion. Under the plan that we have, it is 2 percent. Of the \n12.4 percent of taxes you presently pay in Social Security, you would \nget to put 2 percent of those taxes into some sort of savings vehicle \nwhich you would own. You would physically own it. It might be stocks; \nit might be bonds, but you would physically own it. It could not be \nplaced in those vehicles and then be speculated with; it would follow \nthe course of what we call the thrift savings vehicle. That vehicle \nwould require the Social Security trustees to basically set up the \ninvestment vehicles in which you could invest.\n  One would be limited in how one could invest that money. They could \nnot speculate with it. They would have to put it into basically large \nmutual funds which would be approved by and would be under the \nfiduciary control of the Social Security trustees.\n  Mr. President, I note it is 3 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed for another 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a person would have this asset called a \npersonal account which they would have to invest in three, four, five, \nor six different\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\nfunds set up under the auspices of the Social Security Administration. \nThe asset would be owned by that person. If they were to die at 45 or \n59 or even 66, their estate would receive the asset held in that \naccount and it would go to their wife, husband, children, or to \nwhomever they wanted it to go.\n  Equally important, the rate of return on personal accounts would \ndramatically exceed what one gets under the Social Security system \ntoday. A person who is today beginning in the workplace, who is about \n22 or 25 years old, is going to pay more, if they are an African \nAmerican, into the trust funds than they will ever receive from the \ntrust funds. In other words, they get zero rate of return.\n  If one happens to be a typical, average American, their rate of \nreturn in the Social Security trust funds, if they are in their \ntwenties today, is about 1.4 percent. If they are in their thirties, it \nmight get up to 2 percent. If they are in their forties, it might reach \n2.5 percent--might. It is a terrible rate of return under the Social \nSecurity system. People are paying all these taxes and getting \nvirtually nothing in return.\n  Under a personal account--remember, it is only a small percentage of \none's Social Security tax which is going to be invested in this \npersonal account--one will own the asset; plus, the average rate of \nreturn over any 20-year period, including the Depression, of investment \nin the stock market exceeds 5 percent. Since I am talking about a 20-\nyear period, not a 4-month period or a 5-month period or a 1-year \nperiod or 3-year period, one can be pretty sure the rate of return on \nthe personal account is going to be at least twice the rate of return \non the taxes that person is paying into the Social Security fund \ngenerally.\n  That is called prefunding liability. In other words, we are going to \ngive a person the opportunity as a citizen, especially a younger \ncitizen--people over 55 are not going to be affected by this at all--to \nactually own an asset and have that asset grow at a rate that is at \nleast twice the rate of their investment in Social Security. Then when \nthey retire, that asset will be physically there to benefit them in \ntheir retirement. The liability that is owed to that person by the \nFederal Government will have actually been prefunded. There are many \nways we can talk about that, but it gets into some complexities I do \nnot have time for now.\n  Essentially, what it means is that the younger generation, instead of \nhaving to pay a huge tax increase to support retirement, is going to \nactually be creating assets which give them, when they retire, a rate \nof return which will be significantly or at least as good as what they \nwould get under Social Security without having to pay all these new \ntaxes. It is a way of keeping the system solvent and, at the same time, \nmaintaining a benefit structure that is reasonable and, at the same \ntime, not dramatically increasing taxes.\n\n  What we have is a pretty simple debate, in real terms, between the \nVice President and Governor Bush. The Vice President does not want to \ntell people the younger generation is going to get hit with a huge \nburden of new taxes under his plan, and he does not want to tell us how \nhe is going to address the Social Security system and reform it in the \noutyears. Governor Bush, on the other hand, is willing to step forward \nand put some interesting and innovative ideas on the table to address \none of the most critical issues that will face our country over the \nnext 30 or 40 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Montana.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n2521, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2521) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am reluctant to proceed on this bill, \nalthough I think we will hold it. My ranking member, Senator Murray \nfrom Washington, will not be back in town until 5 o'clock this \nafternoon. This was the weekend her son was married in Seattle. She is \nreturning from her State. I have no comments to make. If Senators want \nto make comments on the bill, they are free to do so. In the meantime, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthe Senate once again on the subject of military construction projects \nadded to an appropriations bill that were not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense. This bill contains almost $900 million in \nunrequested military construction projects.\n  What makes this bill even more offensive than most pork-laden \nmilitary construction bills is the fact that, while the Senate is \nwilling to act swiftly to approve these pork-barrel projects, we have \nfailed to act to end the disgraceful situation of more than 12,000 \nmilitary families forced to use food stamps to make ends meet. For the \nsecond year in a row, Congress is on the verge of spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for purely parochial reasons, while rejecting a \nproposal that would cost just $6 million per year to take care of those \nmilitary families most in need.\n  I am appalled at the extraordinary and inexplicable resistance I have \nencountered to enacting legislation to get these brave young men and \nwomen and their families off food stamps. I am ashamed that the Senate \nwould put hometown construction projects ahead of desperately needed \nrelief for our most junior enlisted personnel.\n  I appreciate the Senate's unanimous expression of support during \nconsideration of the budget resolution for additional funding for food \nstamp relief in the defense budget, and I hope my colleagues will \nreiterate that support when I offer an amendment to the defense \nauthorization bill to end the food stamp Army once and for all.\n  Every year, I come to the Senate floor for the express purpose of \nhighlighting programs and projects added to spending bills for \nprimarily parochial reasons. While I recognize that many of the \nprojects added to this bill may be worthwhile, the process by which \nthey were selected violates at least one, if not several, of the \ncriteria set out several years ago to limit just this sort of wasteful \nspending.\n  I will address the Kosovo language included in this bill at another \ntime. Suffice to say for now that this language, grounded though it may \nbe in an understandable frustration with the Administration and our \nallies' handling of that contingency, represents foreign policy making \nby Congress at its worst. This language, certain to prompt a veto of \nthe bill, constitutes a highly questionable approach to solving the \nproblem of burden-sharing and sets a precedent that will damage our \ncredibility abroad for years to come.\n  Particularly objectionable, apart from the obvious funding issues \nalready alluded to, is the addition to this bill of funding provisions \nand legislation having nothing to do with military construction and \nclearly not an emergency requiring immediate redress. In this regard, \nnote must be made of Section 2109, which legislates a funding profile \nfor a ship that has not been requested by the Navy and that cannot be \nbuilt under the expedited process the ship's congressional sponsor \nseeks to impose. The $8 million added by the Appropriations Committee \nfor the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, with the proviso that the \nfunds be designated as an ``emergency requirement''--$8 million for the \nyear 2002 Olympics designated as an ``emergency''? It continues to \nstagger the imagination. It compels a reference to\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\nthe old Yogi Berra malapropism about experiencing deja vu all over \nagain.\n\n  I am also at a loss as to the rationale for including in this bill \ncertain site-specific earmarks like the $300,000 to transfer excess \nhousing to Indian tribes of North and South Dakota. And mention should \nbe made of the usual Buy America restrictions included in the bill, \nwith a notable exception when it is in the interest of important \nMembers of Congress. Section 112, for example, prohibits the use of \nfunds in the bill to award contracts worth more than $1 million to \nforeign contractors, except when a Marshallese contractor is seeking \ncontracts at Kwajalein. The $7 million in the bill ``to ensure the \navailability of biometrics technologies'' will require more research.\n  It will be very interesting to discover the motivation behind that \nlittle phrase.\n  I would like to point out that the report on this bill was filed \nlate, and thus the information available to Senators about specific \nprojects included in this bill is somewhat limited.\n  We get into an interesting habit of taking up legislation around here \nwithout a report available for the Members to read. If history is any \nguide, however, skepticism regarding many items added to this bill is \nwarranted. Enough is known about the process by which appropriations \nbills are put together to justify continued outrage at abuse of the \nsystem to satisfy parochial considerations.\n  Mr. President, the abuse of the Future Years Defense Plan as a \ncriteria for adding projects to military spending bills is seriously \nout of control. Witness, for example, the number of projects in this \nbill that are in the fourth or fifth year of the FYDP and that have had \nno design work done. At least 17 such projects were added to the bill. \nWhile they are listed as executable, should we really be advancing \nunrequested projects by four and five years at the same time we \ncontinue to ignore the disgrace of 12,000 military families on food \nstamps?\n  It was interesting to see, Mr. President, that the authorization bill \nfor military construction includes a provision equating the term \n``Readiness Center'' to the term ``Armory.'' We all enjoy semantic \ngamesmanship now and again, but if we are going to continue to funnel \nmoney back home to National Guard Armories, let's just say so. Let's \nnot exploit the legitimate issue of military readiness that we are \nfinally focused on in order to conduct the same old pork-barrel \nspending practices that are as much a part of this institution as the \ncollegial colloquialisms that characterize our demeanor on the Senate \nfloor.\n  There are 28 members of the Appropriations Committee. Only two do not \nhave projects added to the appropriations bill. I wonder what happened \nto the other two. Perhaps the manager of the bill can tell us what \noccurred there.\n  Those numbers, needless to say, go well beyond the realm of mere \ncoincidence. Of 145 projects added to this bill, 111 are in states \nrepresented by Senators on the Appropriations Committee, totaling over \n$700 million. The $12 million added to the bill for the first phase of \nan access road in Hawaii, the $25 million added for a Joint Mobility \nComplex in Alaska, the $4 million added for Army National Guard parking \nin Kentucky, the $14 million added for a fuel cell maintenance dock in \nLouisiana, the $4.5 million added for an Army National Guard \nadministration building in Nevada, the $10 million added for an Army \nNational Guard Readiness Center (read: Armory) in North Dakota, the $10 \nmillion added for the first phase of a base civil engineer complex in \nSouth Dakota, and the $1.4 million for channel dredging in Mississippi, \nare just a handful of the projects added by members that were not in \nthe budget request. Forts Richardson and Wainwright, both in Alaska, \nfared particularly well, the latter receiving $300,000 for a trail and \n$900,000 for a biathlon live fire course--which could only be \nconsidered a close cousin to the previously mentioned money for the \nupcoming Winter Olympics.\n  Yet, many of the Senators whose projects are included in this bill \ncontinue to oppose spending just $6 million a year to remove military \nfamilies from the rolls of those eligible for food stamps. If I sound \nrepetitive, Mr. President, it is out of frustration--frustration at the \nability of my colleagues to close their eyes to the disgraceful plight \nof thousands of our enlisted personnel who don't make enough money to \nfeed themselves and their families.\n  I believe I have made my point. As usual, I labor under no illusions \nregarding the impact my comments will have on the way we do business \nhere. I have in the past attempted legislative recourse to pork-barrel \nspending, and I will do so again. But the history of votes on such \nefforts causes me to exercise that right sparingly. My self-restraint \nis simply an acknowledgment that I represent a small minority of this \nbody. Wasteful and unnecessary spending continues because most Members \nof Congress truly believe that it is one of their primary reasons for \nbeing here. I submit, Mr. President, that a wide line exists between \nserving one's constituents in the context of our nation's best \ninterests and simply funneling money back home because that's how we \nremind our constituents to vote for us again.\n  About 2 weeks ago, there was a study completed concerning the \ndeplorable state of the U.S. Army. More captains are leaving the U.S. \nArmy than at anytime in history. We will shortly have a Senate \nauthorization bill, as well as this and other appropriations bills. \nThey don't address this problem. I can guarantee those captains aren't \nleaving the Army because they need $12 million for the first phase of \nan access road in Hawaii, or $25 million for a joint mobility complex \nin Alaska, or $4 million for Army National Guard parking in Kentucky.\n  If the Republican leadership and the chairmen of these committees \ncontinue to spend taxpayers' dollars in this profligate manner, sooner \nor later the American people will repudiate those actions. I hope it \nwill be sooner rather than later.\n  The thing that is particularly appalling to me is that this \nappropriations profligate spending of unauthorized, unnecessary, \nwasteful pork barrel spending continues at a greater rate every year \nthan the previous year. It will stop sooner or later. I believe it will \nstop sooner because this bill is a classic example of the abrogation of \nour responsibilities to average taxpayers, those who are not \nrepresented here in Washington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, getting old is probably the most \nuniversal experience no one really likes to talk about. Sure, people \ntalk about minor aches and pains, but the big topics are unmentionable. \nThey include paying for a funeral, preparing for a nursing home stay, \nor getting checked for prostate problems. These things make people \nuncomfortable, but they really should not. Consider Katie Couric's \ncomment about colon cancer. She said, ``Some people find the procedures \nlike . . . colonoscopies unappealing. I can tell you they are all much \nmore appealing than dying of this disease.''\n  In honor of Older Americans Month, I encourage aging adults--and that \nmeans all of us--to mention the unmentionable, and to think the \nunthinkable. Once you get these chores done, the rest of your years \nwill be a day in the country. Here are 10 Smart Things to Do While You \nAge:\n  1. Secure your retirement income. One financial planner said saving \nfor\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\nretirement is ``like pushing a ball up a hill. The longer you wait, the \nsteeper the hill (seems).'' Yet 56 percent of U.S. households do not \nsave enough for retirement. What should you do? The experts advise \ndeveloping a financial plan and sticking to it. Save $25 a week for 40 \nyears with 5 percent interest. You will have $165,000. Before you \ndecide how much to set aside, think about how much you will need to \nmaintain a standard of living.\n  My own advice is do not overrely on Social Security. Think of it this \nway, a solid retirement plan is a three-legged stool of Social \nSecurity, retirement savings, and a pension. Look carefully at your \npension plan, too. Make sure you understand what's coming to you, and \nwhen.\n  2. Think about where you would like to live, and how. Do you dream of \nstaying in the same town or city for the rest of your life? If \nnecessary, could you modify your home to accommodate you as you get \nolder? Would you like to move closer to friends and family? Would you \nlike a condo on the beach in Florida or an assisted living facility, \nwhere you pay people to do your laundry and cook your meals? This item \ngoes hand-in-hand with financial planning. The more retirement income \nyou have, the more housing options you have.\n  3. Get preventive health checks, exercise, and eat well. Preventive \nhealth checks are getting easier all the time. Increasingly, they are \navailable through insurance coverage. Medicare covers vaccinations, \nmammograms and screenings for colon and prostate cancer, diabetes and \nother illnesses. Unfortunately people often do not take advantage of \nthe health screenings available to them. Only one of eight older people \ngets the recommended testing for colon cancer. This is a shame, when \nyou consider that colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of \ncancer death.\n  More than half of all Americans do not get the exercise they need. \nGenerally, the older people get, the less they exercise. Of course, \nsome people have physical limitations that prevent such activities, but \nthose who can exercise should, and at any age, doctors say. Exercise \ncan help stave off heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes and high blood \npressure. A good diet carries many of the same benefits\n\n  4. Write a will or living trust. Either of these documents delineates \nhow you'd like your property distributed after your death. If you die \nwithout a will, the State will distribute your property for you. The \nresult may be contrary to your wishes. It is best to write a will or \nliving trust well before old age. That way, your spouse and children \nwill be provided for if you face an untimely death. More than 40 \npercent of people 35 or older do not have any kind of legal document \ndetermining how their belongings will be distributed after they die.\n  5. Consider long-term care insurance. Many people do not realize that \nnursing homes are very expensive. Most nursing home residents do not \npay out of their pockets for long. They spend down their assets to \nbecome qualified for Medicaid, which then picks up the tab. Spending \ndown assets means giving up almost everything, including a house. Long-\nterm care insurance is an option for covering long-term care expenses. \nThe earlier you buy the insurance, the less expensive your premiums. I \nhave sponsored legislation that would establish a tax deduction to \nencourage the purchase of long-term insurance.\n  6. Plan your funeral and burial or cremation. The national average \ncost for a funeral, burial and monument is $7,520. These costs can be \nmuch lower, but they can be much, much higher. The average mark-up on \ncaskets is high. The latest estimated mark-up is 500 percent. Some are \nmarked up as high as 2,000 percent. The high costs, and the presence of \nsome bad applies in this industry, build the case for arranging a \nfuneral early. It is hard to comparison-shop when you are grieving. If \nyou plan ahead, you can call funeral homes for the best price. Of \ncourse, planning ahead has its pitfalls. Be sure you tell your family \nmembers about prearrangements, and give them all the relevant \npaperwork. That way, your family can verify that your contract is \nfulfilled after you're gone.\n  7. Think about whether a family member will care for you, or vice \nversa. Unpaid family caregivers keep millions of people at home and out \nof nursing homes. More than 22 million households have a caregiver who \nis age 50 or older. The majority are women. Caregiving takes a large \ntoll, both financially and emotionally. I am working to provide more \nresources to family caregivers, including a $3,000 tax credit that \nwould help them cover their expenses.\n  8. Decide how long you will work. Until recently, people who worked \npast age 65 lost Social Security benefits if they made more than \n$17,000 a year. Congress just repealed that penalty for people ages 65 \nto 69. This likely will cause many Americans to rethink whether they \nwill work past age 65, either part-time or full-time. Choosing the best \nage at which to retire is an important financial decision.\n  9. Determine your treatment at the end of life. In a living will, \nwhich, or course, is completely different from an estate-planning will, \nyou direct how your doctor should administer life-sustaining treatment \nif you are unable to decide for yourself. A living will guides your \ntreatment if you are terminally ill, irreversibly unconscious, or in a \npersistent vegetative state.\n  10. Enjoy yourself. You have worked hard to stay financially fit and \nphysically healthy. The opportunities for older Americans are greater \nthan ever before. You can work well into your eighties and nineties if \nyou choose. You can become a competitor in the Senior Olympics. You can \nwrite a book, volunteer with your church, or teach people how to read. \nSurf the Internet. E-mail your grandchildren. Take advantage of the \ninsight and depth that inevitably come with aging. Someone once said, \n``Being a fun person is the hallmark of true maturity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3942-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 12 \nas Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunctions Syndrome [CFIDS] Awareness \nDay as well as the efforts of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] \nAssociation of the Lehigh Valley in fighting this disease.\n  CFIDS, also known as CFS, is a complex illness which effects multiple \nsystems of the body. The syndrome is characterized by neurological, \nrheumatological, and immunological problems; incapacitating fatigue; \nand numerous other symptoms. Over 800,000 Americans of all ages, races, \nand socioeconomic classes suffer from this often debilitating disease. \nTragically, persons with this syndrome can experience symptoms \nsufficient to deprive them of opportunity for gainful employment.\n  CFIDS is often misdiagnosed because it is frequently unrecognized and \ncan resemble other disorders. Therefore, it is imperative that \neducation and training of health professionals regarding CFIDS be \nexpanded and that there be greater public awareness of this serious \nhealth problem. While there has been increased activity at the \nnational, state, and local levels, and in private\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\nresearch institutions, more must be done to support patients and their \nfamilies.\n  The CFS Association of the Lehigh Valley works to encourage further \nresearch to conquer CFIDS and related disorders, and to inform and \nempower those affected by the disorder until a cure is found. The \nassociation, a member of the CFIDS Support Network of the CFIDS \nAssociation of America, is celebrating their eight year of service to \nthe CFIDS community and has participated in May 12 activities since \n1993. Moreover, the association has been awarded the CFIDS Support \nNetwork Action Award for ``Excellence in Service in the Area of CFIDS \nAwareness Day'' in 1996 and for ``Excellence in Commitment and Other \nService to the CFIDS Community in the Area of Public Policy'' in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the CFS \nAssociation of the Lehigh Valley for its efforts, and in recognizing \nMay 12th as CFIDS Awareness Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3943-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING K.S. OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I would like to \nrecognize and celebrate the recent expansion of K.S. of West Virginia. \nIt seems like just a short time ago, in August of 1995 to be precise, \nthat I had the privilege of announcing that this Japan-based company \nwould be moving to Ravenswood, West Virginia.\n  Remarkable things have happened since that day almost five years ago. \nAt that time, just two Japanese firms called West Virginia home. Today, \nI am honored to say that seventeen Japanese companies are thriving in \nour state, creating good paying jobs that support both families and \ncommunities.\n  K.S. of West Virginia has played an important role in that success, \nand I would like to personally extend my gratitude to the Kato family \nfor their unwavering support and belief in us. Our efforts in Japan \nwould surely suffer were it not for the positive voices of our friends \nhere at K.S. Indeed, Mr. Kato's enthusiasm and excitement about West \nVirginia is unmistakable and contagious. West Virginia has found a \nvaluable ally and a good friend in Mr. Kazuo Kato, and his tireless \nwork continues to be appreciated.\n  Too often in this country we have witnessed the destruction of \nfamilies and whole communities as the result of the corporate \nphilosophy of the bottom line. However, companies like K.S. of West \nVirginia, who recognize the importance of their employees and \ncommunities, demonstrate that compassion and sound judgement are the \nreal keys to success. K.S. is an example of the kind of company that \ntruly deserves our praise and support.\n  There is no clearer example of this than an issue Mr. Kato and I have \nbeen working on over the past year. As the leader of K.S., Mr. Kato \nfaced a difficult situation with costly ramifications. Yet, instead of \nmaintaining the status quo, Mr. Kato made a series of innovative \ndecisions that will have far-reaching effects for both K.S., and the \nU.S. steel industry.\n  Not only a leader in the business world, K.S. has shown leadership in \nthe West Virginia community, as well. Companies like K.S., who believe \nthat their success is measured not just by overall profit margins, but \nby the amount that is shared with the people who make them profitable, \nteach us a valuable lesson in management, ethics, team work and mutual \nrespect. This philosophy is as ancient as Confucius or the Bible, and \nas relevant as the news you read in this morning's paper.\n  Indeed, there are 115 individuals who have contributed to the \nprosperity of K.S. of West Virginia. Their hard work is not taken for \ngranted, and as this company grows, so does the value of their loyalty. \nWe are blessed in West Virginia to have parents and grandparents who \ntaught their children that by working hard and playing by the rules a \nperson can be successful--each employee at K.S is a reflection of this \ntradition and a credit to our State.\n  As part of his core teaching, Confucius emphasized that people in \npositions of leadership have a sacred obligation to serve those who \nhave entrusted them with power. If this power is abused, then the \nentire system would break down, dooming any enterprise. Thus, I am \nproud to add my voice to the collective celebration of the success we \nare witnessing at K.S. of West Virginia. To Mr. Kato and his family, \nand all the members of K.S. of West Virginia, I extend my thanks and \ncongratulations. You have demonstrated that by working together, \nunattainable dreams can become reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3943-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE RETIREMENT OF MS.

During her time at St. Jude, \nMs. Huvaere has constantly been a light in the lives of her students \nand her fellow staff members, and her dedication to them and to her \nprofession has truly been remarkable.\n  Ms. Huvaere was born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, on October 11, 1938. \nShe attended St. Ambrose School for both grade school and high school. \nAfter graduating from St. Ambrose, Ms. Huvaere worked for a year at Bon \nSecours Hospital, and then entered the Adrian Dominican Order. After \ntwo years, she left to attend Siena Heights University in Adrian, \nMichigan. She began teaching at St. Jude upon receiving her bachelor's \ndegree from Siena Heights in 1961.\n  In her 39 years at St. Jude School, Ms. Huvaere has taught the third, \nfifth and sixth grades. Her dedication to her students is surpassed \nonly by her dedication and love for her family. One of her greatest \nmemories came in 1986, when her father, who was ill at the time, was \nable to partake in a celebration marking her 25th year at St. Jude.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Huvaere has touched many lives during her thirty-\nnine years of teaching, and has been a role model to many children in \nthe State of Michigan. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I \ncongratulate Ms. Huvaere on a wonderful career, and wish her the best \nof luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3943-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE GRAND OPENING OF ``A TEST OF A NATION: THE HONOR OF A COUNTY''\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on May 19, 2000, the Barry County \nParks and Recreation Commission will unveil a brand new exhibition at \nHistoric Charlton Park Village, Museum and Recreation Area in Hastings, \nMichigan. The exhibition is entitled ``A Test of a Nation: The Honor of \na County,'' and is a tribute to the soldiers that Barry County sent off \nto battle during the Civil War, and also to their families. I rise \ntoday, Mr. President, in honor of this special occasion.\n  During the Civil War, Barry County, at the time populated by less \nthan 15,000 people, contributed 1,632 men to the Union Army, the \nhighest percentage of citizens per county in the State of Michigan. The \nnew exhibition illustrates what life was like for these men out in the \nfield, and for their loved ones at home. Part of the grand opening \ncelebration on May 19, 2000, will be educational programs on the topic \nof the Civil War.\n  The exhibition was made possible in part by funds from a Michigan \nArts, Cultural and Quality of Life Grant. On September 1, 1999, \nHistoric Charlton Park received $339,000 to remodel and expand the \nmuseum. ``A Test of a Nation: The Honor of a County'' marks the \ncompletion of the first phase of the project.\n  Mr. President, it goes without saying that the Civil War is one of \nthe most important events in American History, and perhaps the most \nimportant. I applaud all of the people whose efforts made this \nexhibition possible, for with these efforts they have allowed \nindividuals of all ages an opportunity to experience a little part of \nthat history. They have given them a chance to see what life was like \nfor the men, women and children of Barry County who played an important \nrole in keeping our nation together.\n  On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Historic \nCharlton Park Village on the opening of ``A Test of a Nation: The Honor \nof a County.'' It is truly an important exhibition, and I know that the \npeople of Barry County will greatly appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3944-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n       THE FRIENDS OF THEODORE ROETHKE HISTORIC MARKER DEDICATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on May 18, 2000, The Friends of \nTheodore Roethke, a group dedicated to maintaining the legacy of the \ngreat poet, will unveil a historic marker in his honor on the lawn of \nhis childhood home at 1805 Gratiot, Saginaw, Michigan. I rise today, \nMr. President, in honor of this special occasion.\n  Mr. Roethke was born in Saginaw in 1908, the son of Otto and Helen \nHuebner Roethke. He attended the University of Michigan and Harvard \nGraduate School, and later was a professor at Lafayette College in \nPennsylvania, Michigan State University, Penn State University, \nBennington College in Vermont, and the University of Washington in \nSeattle.\n  Before his death on August 1, 1963, Mr. Roethke received many awards \nfor his poetry. In 1954, he became the first Michigan man to win the \nPulitzer Prize for his collection of poems entitled The Waking. And in \n1959, he received the Bollingen Prize and a National Book Award for \nanother collection of poems entitled Words of the Wind. Some of his \nother works include The Lost Son, Praise to the End!, and I Am! Says \nthe Lamb.\n  In 1998, the Friends of Theodore Roethke purchased both Roethke homes \nin Saginaw, Michigan, with a mission to promote, preserve and protect \nthe literary legacy of the great poet by restoring his family \nresidences for cultural and educational opportunities. Since the group \npurchased the homes, they have written grants for educational writing \nworkshops combining Saginaw public and Saginaw Township students, \noffered tours for students and teachers, purchased some of the original \nRoethke furnishing, opened the houses to working writers, and made some \nmuch needed repairs, such as a new furnace and asbestos removal.\n  Mr. President, I applaud The Friends of Theodore Roethke for their \nwonderful efforts to keep alive the legacy of Michigan's only Pulitzer \nPrize winning poet. I am sure that the unveiling of this historic \nmarker is only the first of many tributes. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate The Friends of Theodore Roethke on \nthe dedication of this historic marker, and wish President Annie \nRansford and the rest of the organization continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3944-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF MS.

Ms. \nPalmeri served the County of Wayne, Michigan, for 32 years, and has \nbeen chosen by her peers to posthumously receive the coveted Court \nClerk of the Year Award, which will be presented to her family this \nweek.\n  Ms. Palmeri was born in St. Mary's Hospital in Detroit in 1939, and \nwas a lifelong resident of the city of Dearborn, Michigan.

In June of 1967, Ms. Palmeri became a typist at the \nCounty of Wayne Department of Civil Service, thus beginning a thirty-\ntwo year career of public service.\n  A few years later Ms. Palmeri was transferred to the County Clerk's \nOffice, where she worked in numerous offices prior to becoming a Court \nClerk, including the Record Room and as Supervisor of the Appeals \nDepartment. Ms. Palmeri ultimately worked as a Court Clerk for many \nprominent judges, including the Honorable Henry J. Szymanski, the \nHonorable William J. Cahalan, and the Honorable Pamela R. Harwood.\n  In addition to her work, Ms. Palmeri enjoyed many hobbies, including \nbowling, ceramics, crocheting, knitting and crewel embroidery. She was \nboth a terrfic seamstress and a wonderful cook. She also loved to play \ncards, work on crossword puzzles, and play board games. She was also an \nactive member of St. Alphonseus Catholic Church in Dearborn, Michigan. \nMs. Palmeri is survived by her husband of thirty years, Frank, and \ntheir three children, Christopher, Cindy and John.\n  Mr. President, I am glad that the County of Wayne has chosen to honor \nMs. Palmeri's many years of service by presenting her family with the \nCourt Clerk of the Year Award. She was a hard worker who truly cared \nfor the people around her, and her warm and generous personality is \ndeeply missed by the entire Dearborn community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3944-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3944-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3944-S3945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nA DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED THE ``CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY \n     COMMISSION ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2000--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 104\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit today for immediate consideration and prompt \nenactment the ``Consumer Product Safety Commission Enhanced Enforcement \nAct of 2000.'' This legislative proposal would increase the penalties \nthat the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) could impose upon \nmanufacturers, distributors, and retailers of consumer products who do \nnot inform the CPSC when the company has reason to believe it has sold \na product that does not meet Federal safety standards or could \notherwise create a substantial product hazard. The proposal would also \nimprove product recalls by enabling the CPSC to choose an alternative \nremedy in a recall if the CPSC finds that the remedy selected by the \nmanufacturer is not in the public interest.\n  Under current consumer product safety laws, manufacturers, \ndistributors, and retailers of consumer products are required to inform \nthe CPSC whenever they have information that one of their products: (1) \nfails to comply with a CPSC product safety standard; (2) contains a \ndefect that could create a substantial product hazard; or (3) creates \nan unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. After a company \nreports this information to the CPSC, the CPSC staff initiates an \ninvestigation in cooperation with the company. If the CPSC concludes \nthat the product presents a substantial product hazard and that a \nrecall is in the public interest, the CPSC staff will work with the \ncompany to conduct a product safety recall. The sooner the CPSC hears \nabout a dangerous product, the sooner the CPSC can act to remove the \nproduct from store shelves and inform consumers about how to eliminate \nthe hazard. That is why it is critical that companies inform the CPSC \nas soon as they are aware that one of their products may present a \nserious hazard to the public.\n  Unfortunately, in about half the cases involving the most significant \nhazards--where the product can cause death or serious injury--companies \ndo not report to the CPSC. In those cases, the CPSC must get safety \ninformation from other sources, including its own investigators, \nconsumers, or tragically, from hospital emergency room reports or death \ncertificates. Sometimes years can pass before the CPSC learns of the \nproduct hazard, although the company may have been aware of it all \nalong. During that time, deaths and injuries continue. Once the CPSC \nbecomes aware of the hazard, many companies continue to be \nrecalcitrant, and the CPSC staff must conduct its own independent \ninvestigation. This often includes finding and investigating product \nincidents and conducting extensive laboratory testing. This process can \ntake a long time, which means that the most dangerous products remain \non store shelves and in consumers' homes\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nlonger, placing children and families at continuing risk.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission can currently assess civil \npenalties against companies who fail to report a dangerous product. \nCriminal penalties are also available in particularly serious cases. In \nfact, in 1999, the CPSC assessed 10 times the amount of civil penalties \nassessed 10 years ago. But, even with this more vigorous enforcement, \ntoo many companies still do not report, especially in cases involving \nserious harm.\n  This legislative proposal would enhance the CPSC's civil and criminal \nenforcement authority. It would provide an added incentive for \ncompanies to comply with the law so that we can get dangerous products \nout of stores and consumers' homes more quickly.\n  My legislative proposal would also help to make some product recalls \nmore effective by allowing the CPSC to choose an alternative remedy if \nthe CPSC finds that the manufacturer's chosen remedy is not in the \npublic interest. Under current law, a company with a defective product \nthat is being recalled has the right to select the remedy to be offered \nto the public. My proposal would continue to permit the company to \nselect the remedy in a product recall. My proposal would also, however, \nallow the CPSC to determine--after an opportunity for a hearing--that \nthe remedy selected by the company is not in the public interest.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission helps to keep America's \nchildren and families safe. This legislation proposal would help the \nCPSC be even more effective in protecting the public from dangerous \nproducts. I urge the Congress to give this legislation prompt and \nfavorable consideration.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \nThe White House, May 12, 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3945-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-8934.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income of individual taxpayers discharges of indebtedness \nattributable to certain forgiven residential mortgage obligations; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                mortgage cancellation relief act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncorrect an inequity in the tax code which can hurt homeowners who sell \ntheir homes at a loss. I am delighted to be joined by Senator Hatch in \nintroducing this legislation.\n  We all know someone who, for whatever reason, has wound up selling \ntheir home at a loss. In these situations, where the value of a home is \nless than the outstanding loan on that home, a mortgage lender will \nsometimes forgive all or part of the outstanding mortgage balance. \nUnder current law, the amount forgiven is counted as taxable income to \nthe seller.\n  This doesn't make any sense, particularly since gains on a principal \nresidence are tax exempt up to $500,000. The legislation we are \nintroducing today will fix this problem by exempting taxpayers from \nincluding in ordinary income mortgage amounts forgiven by the lender on \na principal residence, provided the proceeds of the home sale won't \nsatisfy the qualified outstanding mortgage.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is targeted to protect \nagainst any abuse and we expect the cost to be very low over a 10-year \nperiod. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to urge my \ncolleagues to support a bill, the Mortgage Cancellation Act of 2000, \nthat I am introducing along with Senator Kerrey. This bill would fix a \nflaw in the tax code that unfairly harms homeowners who sell their home \nat a loss.\n  Often, homeowners who must sell their home at a loss are able to \nnegotiate with their mortgage lender to forgive all or part of the \nmortgage balance that exceeds the selling price. However, under current \ntax law, the amount forgiven is taxable income to the seller.\n  For example, suppose a young family purchased their home for $150,000 \nwith a $130,000 mortgage, $120,000 of which is still outstanding. Let \nus also assume that there is an economic downturn that has both \ndecreased the value of the house to $110,000 and put this family in \nfinancial distress because the primary wage earner has lost his or her \njob. Because the family is no longer able to meet their mortgage \npayments, they are forced to sell their home for $110,000, $10,000 \nbelow the value of the mortgage, with the condition that the lender \nwill forgive this difference. Unfortunately, under current tax law, \nthis family will have to recognize this $10,000 difference as taxable \nincome at a time when they can least afford it. This is true even \nthough the family suffered a $40,000 loss on the sale.\n  Mr. President, I find this predicament both ironic and unfair. If \nthis same family, under much better circumstances, was able to sell \ntheir house for $200,000 instead of $110,000, then they would owe \nnothing in tax on the gain under current tax law because gains on a \nprincipal residence are tax exempt up to $500,000. I believe that this \ndiscrepancy creates a tax inequity that begs for relief.\n  Finally, I want to stress that now is the time to address the \ninequity, while the economy is healthy, instead of waiting for the next \nrecession, when this problem will be much more common. Luckily, the \nproblem addressed by this bill is not widespread in our country right \nnow. However, a few years ago, many families in my home state of Utah \nsuffered losses on the necessary sale of their homes, and had to pay \ntaxes on the canceled mortgage debt. Families in other areas of our \nnation experienced similar problems.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Kerrey \nand me in support of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2556.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n247, and the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 247) commemorating and acknowledging \n     the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who \n     have lost their lives while serving as law enforcement \n     officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we need to do a better job supporting our \nfederal law enforcement officers and our State and local law \nenforcement officers. This is National Police Week and today was the \nNational Peace Officers' Memorial Service in which we remembered \nanother 139 federal, State and local officers who died in the line of \nduty. I commend Senator Campbell for introducing S. Res. 247 back in \nJanuary. I am sorry that the Judiciary Committee did not take it up and \nreport it before today, but am supportive of his efforts and agreed to \ndischarge the Committee, so as not to miss today's activities.\n  As someone who served in law enforcement for 8 years as the \nChittenden County State's Attorney, I respect and admire those who \ndevote their careers to public safety. I took issue with the extreme \nrhetoric that some have recently used to attack our Federal law \nenforcement officers who helped return Elian Gonzalez to his father.\n  For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives was quoted as calling the officers of the U.S. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the \nU.S. Marshals Service: ``jack-booted thugs.'' And the Republican Mayor \nof New York City, who is seeking election to this body, called these \ndedicated public servants: ``storm troopers.'' This extreme rhetoric \nonly serves to degrade federal law enforcement officers in the eyes of \nthe public.\n  Let none of us in the Congress, or who are seeking to serve in \nCongress, contribute to an atmosphere of disrespect for law enforcement \nofficers. No matter what your opinion of the law enforcement action in \nSouth Florida, we should all agree that these law enforcement officers \nwere following orders and putting their lives on the line, which they \ndo everyday. Let us treat law enforcement officers with the respect \nthat is essential to their preserving the peace and protecting the \npublic.\n  This harsh rhetoric by Republican public officials reminds me of \nsimilar harsh rhetoric used in April 1995, when the NRA sent out a \nfund-raising letter calling federal law enforcement officers ``jack-\nbooted thugs'' who wear ``Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper \nuniforms.'' President George Bush was correctly outraged by this NRA \nrhetoric and resigned from the NRA in protest. President Bush wrote to \nthe NRA: ``Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own \nsense of decency and honor.  . . . It indirectly slanders a wide array \nof government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and \nnight, laying their lives on the line for all of us.'' I praised \nPresident Bush in 1995 for his actions and again recently.\n  President Bush was right. This harsh rhetoric of calling federal law \nenforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' and ``storm troopers'' \nshould offend our sense of decency and honor. It is highly offensive \nand did not belong in any public debate on the reunion of Elian \nGonzalez with his father, either. We are fortunate to have dedicated \nwomen and men throughout Federal law enforcement in this country who do \na tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of \nthe hard-working public servants that make up the federal government, \nwho are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. These are people \nwith children and parents and friends. They deserve our respect, not \npersonal insults.\n\n  In countless incidents across the country everyday, federal law \nenforcement officers, who are sworn to protect the public and enforce \nthe law, are in danger. These law enforcement officers deserve our \nthanks and our respect. They do not deserve to be called ``jack-booted \nthugs'' and ``storm troopers.''\n  I went to the Senate floor in the wake of those comments to join the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association in condemning these \ninsults against our nation's law enforcement officers. Any public \nofficial who used this harsh rhetoric owes our Federal law enforcement \nofficers an apology. I regret that members of the majority party have \nnot followed President Bush's example and, likewise, condemned that \nextreme rhetoric.\n  This week is an annual occasion in which we pause to remember the \nfederal, State and local officers who gave their lives in the line of \nduty over the past year. It is a difficult week and an important week. \nIt should be a productive week, as well.\n  I said last week at the Judiciary Committee Business Meeting that the \nCommittee should be taking up and reporting S. 2413, the bill that \nSenator Campbell and I introduced to improve our Bulletproof Vest Grant \nPartnership Act by reauthorizing the program for another 3 years, \nraising the annual appropriation to $50 million and guaranteeing to \njurisdictions with populations less than 100,000 a fair share of these \nresources. This program has been\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nvery helpful in offering federal assistance to help protect State and \nlocal officers in concrete ways. It is an extraordinarily successful \nprogram and it should be extended and expanded. I thank President \nClinton for his support and for calling for enactment of this measure \nduring his remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service \ntoday. I hope that when the Committee meets later this week, Senator \nHatch will see fit to include this measure on the agenda and that the \nCommittee will act favorably on it.\n  In addition, I look forward to enacting additional measures that \nprotect and assist State and local law enforcement. In particular, I \nwas extremely disappointed last year when an anonymous Republican \nobjection prevented S. 521, my bill to improve the Bulletproof Vest \nGrant Partnership Act, from passing. This bill would allow the Attorney \nGeneral to waive or reduce the matching fund requirement for assisting \npoor and rural law enforcement units to provide this life-saving \nequipment to officers and prevent injury and death. I cannot understand \nwhy anyone would want to oppose that effort.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that the Congress has not taken final \naction on the Public Medal of Valor Act, S. 39, championed by Senator \nStevens. The awarding of a medal for extraordinary valor shown by law \nenforcement officers every year would be a good way to draw attention \nto the service provided every day by officers all across this country. \nThat bill passed the Senate a year ago by unanimous consent. I \ncosponsored the bill along with 28 others. For the past year, the House \nhas not found the time to pass it. Today the President announced that \nhe will explore ways to proceed to honor valor by our public safety \nofficers through executive action if Congress continues to stall action \non this bill. I hope that Congress will finally act on S. 39 this week \nand send it to the President for his signature.\n  These are just a few of the important legislative matters that the \nCongress should address to help our federal and state law enforcement \nofficers. We should strive for constructive action rather than half-\nbaked rhetoric.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today to honor Federal, State and \nlocal law enforcement officers who work to protect and serve the public \non a daily basis. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 247, which \ndesignates today as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and recognizes law \nenforcement officers killed or disabled in the line of duty.\n  During National Police Week, law enforcement officers in all fifty \nstates will pay tribute to their fellow officers who lost their lives \nin the line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial Fund, approximately 130 law enforcement officers lost their \nlives in 1999 while protecting the public. In my home state, 187 \nMinnesota law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty since \n1914. Most recently, the name of Minnesota State Patrol Corporal \nTimothy Bowe was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial. Sadly, more than 14,000 law enforcement officers paid this \nultimate sacrifice during the 20th Century. I am honored to pay tribute \nto the men and women who demonstrated extraordinary bravery while \ncaring for our families and communities.\n  I would also like to note the extraordinary sacrifice of families who \nhave lost a son, daughter, spouse, parent, or relative who was slain \nwhile performing their police duties. We honor the memory of these \nofficers by providing for the families that they have left behind. When \nI think about these families, I am reminded of the inscription on the \nwall of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial--``In valor \nthere is hope.''\n  I am very pleased that the Senate is continuing its efforts to \nprovide support for the families of law enforcement officers killed in \nthe line of duty. Specifically, I have cosponsored S. 1638, legislation \nintroduced by Senator John Ashcroft that would retroactively provide \nfinancial assistance for higher education to the spouses and children \nof federal, state, and local law enforcement officers killed in the \nline of duty. Current law provides that the dependants of federal law \nenforcement officers killed in the line of duty after May 1, 1992, are \neligible for this assistance. Dependants of state and local law \nenforcement officers killed in the line of duty after October 1, 1997, \nare also eligible. This legislation would change these dates to May 1, \n1978, for federal law enforcement officers and October 1, 1978, for \nstate and local law enforcement officers.\n  This important legislation, endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police \nand the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, builds upon \npolice benefits legislation that passed the 104th and 105th Congress \nwith my strong support. Since 1995, we have enacted the Federal Law \nEnforcement Dependants Assistance Act of 1996, the Public Safety \nOfficers Educational Assistance Act of 1998 and the Care for Police \nSurvivors Act of 1998. These laws help to support the families of our \nlaw enforcement officers and keep alive the memory of these brave and \nheroic men and women.\n  During National Police Week, I join all Minnesotans in honoring the \nmemory of slain law enforcement officers and their contributions to \npromoting public safety throughout our communities.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and, finally, that any statements in \nrelation to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 247) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 247\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of this country is \n     preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     in their capacity as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are the front line in preserving our \n     children's right to receive an education in a crime-free \n     environment, which is all too often threatened by the \n     insidious fear caused by violence in schools;\n       Whereas 134 peace officers lost their lives in the \n     performance of their duty in 1999, and a total of nearly \n     15,000 men and women have now made that supreme sacrifice;\n       Whereas every year 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 \n     officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the \n     line of duty; and\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2000, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in our Nation's Capital to join with \n     the families of their recently fallen comrades to honor them \n     and all others before them: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2000, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I welcome our law enforcement officers to \ntown. There are quite a few of them. They have a memorial at Judiciary \nSquare here in town. They are acknowledging those young men and women \nwho have fallen in the line of duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3950-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3950-S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Madam President, Senator Leahy has an amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] for Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3147.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 10, strike ``May 1, 1978'' and insert \n     ``January 1, 1978''.\n       On page 2, line 12, strike ``October 1, 1978'' and insert \n     ``January 1, 1978''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know that Senator Robb strongly \nsupports this bill and I was glad to work with him and Senator Ashcroft \nto expedite Judiciary Committee action in February and finally to \nachieve Senate consideration today.\n  I support extending the educational assistance benefits to the \nfamilies of public safety officers who died in the line of duty. I \nsupported those efforts when we acted for federal officers' families \nback in 1996 and when we extended those benefits to State and local \nofficers' families in 1998.\n  A number of us joined with Senator Specter and Senator Kohl back in \n1996 to pass the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act. Our \nefforts grew out of the Ruby Ridge investigation and our shared concern \nto help the family of U.S. Marshal Bill Degan and the families of \nothers killed in the line of duty.\n  At the time we were unable to gain the consensus needed to authorize \nthese education benefits to State and local law enforcement officers. \nSome thought that would cost too much. We came back in 1997 and 1998 \nand were able to pass the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits \nAssistance Act to extend these educational benefits to State and local \npublic safety officers. We were led in that effort by Senators Specter \nand Biden.\n  I am delighted to see these benefits expanded further by extending \nthem retroactively by this bill, S. 1638. We were told in February that \nthe estimated cost of this expansion would be $125 million. Since then \nwe have received a significantly revised estimate from the CBO greatly \ndiminishing the estimated costs. I do not know whether CBO was wrong in \nFebruary or is wrong now, but I commend Senator Ashcroft and all the \nsponsors of this measure for their willingness to make this investment \nand authorize these payments.\n  I have said that rather than move the eligibility dates back \napproximately between 14 and 19 years, we should consider removing them \naltogether. I do not want some to be penalized by the arbitrary \nselection of the eligibility date. In this regard I have urged an \namendment to take the eligibility dates back to at least January 1978, \nin order to cover at least one, and possibly more, Vermont families who \nsuffered the loss of a family member who was a public safety officer \nearlier that year. The family of Arnold Magoon, a Vermont game warden, \nshould not be penalized again because he died on April 27 and not after \nMay 1 or October 1 of 1978.\n  I said in February when the committee considered this measure that I \nwould be working to speed its passage and to help it achieve its goal \nof making these assistance payments as comprehensive as possible. As \nsoon as the majority got around to suggesting consideration of this \nmatter on Wednesday, May 10, I cleared it for consideration so that we \ncould proceed.\n  In addition, I look forward to enacting additional measures that \nprotect and assist State and local law enforcement. In particular, I \nwas extremely disappointed last year when an anonymous Republican \nobjection prevented S. 521, my bill to improve the Bulletproof Vest \nGrant Partnership Act, from passing. This bill would allow the Attorney \nGeneral to waive or reduce the matching fund requirement for assisting \npoor and rural law enforcement units to provide this life-saving \nequipment to officers and prevent injury and death. I cannot understand \nwhy anyone would want to oppose that effort.\n  This year, in addition, I have joined again with Senator Campbell to \nintroduce S. 2413 to improve our Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act \nby reauthorizing the program for another 3 years, raising the annual \nappropriation to $50 million and guaranteeing to jurisdictions with \npopulations less than 100,000 a fair share of these resources. Senator \nHatch has joined us as a cosponsor of our measure.\n  I hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will act on these \nmeasures without additional delay, as well.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Madam President, last Tuesday, the Senate suspended \nconsideration of the education bill. I hope that our Republican friends \nhave just temporarily suspended the bill, and not expelled it. We owe \nit to the nation's schools, students, parents, and communities to \ncomplete action on this priority legislation.\n  So far, we have considered only eight amendments to the bill over six \ndifferent days.\n  When the bankruptcy bill was on the floor, our Republican colleagues \ndid everything they could to satisfy the credit card companies. That \nbill was debated for 16 days, and 67 amendments were considered.\n  Obviously, when the credit card companies want a bill, our Republican \nfriends put everything else aside to get it done. But when it comes to \neducation, the voices of parents and children and schools and \ncommunities go unheard.\n  We should be debating education. It's a top priority for parents. \nIt's a top priority for communities. It's a top priority for the \ncountry. And, it should be a top priority for Congress.\n  It is wrong for the Senate to leave the nation's schools with so much \nuncertainty about whether and when they will get urgently needed help \nto ensure better teachers, modern schools, smaller classes, and safe \nclassrooms.\n  Democrats are ready to debate and address these issues now, and \nfinish Senate consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. But, we have no assurance from the Republican majority that we \nwill be able to do so.\n  Clearly, there are strong disagreements about how to address the \nissue of education reform. But, we should all agree to make it a top \npriority for final action.\n  Republicans have made block grants the centerpiece of their education \nproposal. But, block grants are the wrong approach. They undermine the \ntargeting of scarce resources to the highest education priorities. They \neliminate critical accountability provisions that ensure better results \nfor all children. The block grant approach abandons the national \ncommitment to help the nation's children obtain a good education \nthrough proven effective reforms of public schools.\n  The lack of commitment by our Republican colleagues to genuine \neducation reform is also clear in the recent actions by the Senate and \nHouse Appropriations Committee.\n  Both bills eliminate critical funding for reducing class size and \nimproving teacher quality. Instead, they put some of those funds into \nthe title VI block grant.\n  Both bills do nothing to guarantee communities help for modernizing \ntheir school buildings.\n  Both bills eliminate critical funding for helping states to increase \naccountability for results and turn around schools that aren't getting \nresults.\n  At the same time that they expand support for block grants and \neliminate support for greater accountability, Republicans are cutting \nfunds to communities to improve education. Under the President's budget \nrequest, communities would have received a total of $4.05 billion in \nthe coming fiscal year to reduce class size, modernize school \nbuildings, and improve teacher quality. The Republican bill block \ngrants these programs and cuts total funding by $2 billion below the \nPresident's request in the House and $500 million below the President's \nrequest in the Senate.\n\n  Under the Republican block grant scheme, communities get less aid and \nparents get no guarantee that their children's classes will be smaller, \nthat their teachers will be better qualified, or that their schools \nwill be safe and modern.\n  Block grants are the wrong direction for education and the wrong \ndirection for the nation. They do nothing to encourage change in public \nschools.\n  In the Republican ESEA bill, states are not held accountable for \neducational results until after 5 years. By that time, many students \nwill have lost five years of potential gains in student achievement.\n  Block grants also leave the door open for needless waste and abuse. \nThey provide no focus on proven effective strategies to help schools. \nSenator DeWine, in urging increased accountability, pointed out the \npoor history of states and local school districts in spending Safe and \nDrug-Free Schools and Communities funds. He characterized those dollars \nas being ``raided'' for pet projects or to support ineffective methods.\n  Under block grants, school districts and schools can use scarce \npublic tax dollars to support fads and gimmicks, with no basis in \nresearch or proven practice. They can even use the funds to support the \nfootball team, buy computer games, or buy new office furniture, if they \ndecide that these uses serve so-called ``educational purposes.''\n  In short, block grants provide no assurance that federal education \nfunds will be used where they're needed most--to improve instruction \nand teacher quality, strengthen curriculum, reduce class size, provide \nafter-school learning opportunities, or support other proven strategies \nfor helping all students reach high standards.\n  The Republican block grant also undermines local control, because it \nconcentrates educational decision-making at the state level. By \nauthorizing the state to decide whether it will enter into a \nperformance agreement, the Republican bill gives the state ultimate \nauthority to determine the parameters of the agreement, including which \nschools and which school districts will receive funds, and how funds \nmay be spent. Far from giving local districts flexibility, as the \npolicies and waiver provisions under current law do, the Republican \nblock grants will increase the power of governors over local education \npolicy at the expense of local districts, local school officials, and \nparents.\n  The American people want a strong partnership that includes the \nimportant involvement of parents, local school boards, local community \nauthorities, States, and the Federal Government. We are not looking to \ntake over education. We are saying that educating the nation's children \nis a top national priority, and Congress ought to be a strong partner \nin efforts to improve education.\n  The Republican proposal says there will only be one member in the \neducation partnership, and that will be the State. It won't be the \nlocal community or parents, because they give all of the funds to the \nStates. Then the States make the judgment about how it is going to go \ndown to the local level.\n  Parents want a guarantee that, with scarce resources, we are going to \nhave accountability for results and for getting national priorities. \nThey know and we know small class sizes work. We guarantee there will \nbe a well-qualified teacher in every classroom.\n  We guarantee more afterschool programs, which are absolutely \nessential to help and assist children and enhance their academic \nachievement and accomplishment.\n  We guarantee strong accountability provisions.\n  We guarantee resources for technology in schools so we can eliminate \nthe digital divide, as Senator Mikulski speaks to with great knowledge, \nawareness, and, correctness.\n  But all of those efforts I have just mentioned are at risk with the \nproposal of the Republicans to just provide a blank check to the States \nand let the States work out what they might.\n  The Republican block grant approach abdicates our responsibility to \ndo all we can to improve the current federal efforts. All that the GOP \napproach does is hand off the many current problems to states and local \ncommunities to solve.\n  Block grants are particularly harmful, because they abdicate our \nresponsibility to help those most in need, such\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nas homeless children, migrant children, and immigrant children. States \nrarely spend their own funds to help these children now--and they won't \ndo it under a block grant. These children need targeted federal \nassistance to help them succeed in school.\n  Prior to the time the Federal Government provided targeted programs \nfor the homeless under the McKinney Act, the Emergency Immigrant \nEducation program, and the Migrant Education program, these children \nwere not getting the help they needed.\n  State help for these children is virtually nonexistent. The only help \nand assistance for any of these children is the assistance provided in \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But the Republican bill \nwipes out these programs.\n  The parents of migrant children are among the most industrious, yet \nneglected, populations in the country. Poverty, mobility, health \nproblems, isolation from the larger community are characteristics \ncommon to migrant families. In the 1997 to 1998 school year, an \nestimated 752,000 migrant children were counted as eligible for the \nMigrant Education Program. That would be block granted under the \nRepublican blank check approach. Obviously, the States didn't worry \nabout the problems of migrant children because they were here today and \ngone tomorrow. That has been the history. We are talking 752,000 \nchildren who are going to be cast adrift.\n  We had seen important progress, as I mentioned in the debate last \nweek, where those working on the education of migrant children have \nworked out a process where they were able to get children's school \nrecords, provide some waivers that were essential to get children \nenrolled in the schools. We are having at least some positive impact in \nhelping meet the needs of some of these children. With a block grant \nthat goes to the States, that effort will be ended. Without the Federal \nMigrant Education Program, there are few incentives for schools to \nimplement a means for improving instruction for migrant children.\n\n  The Republican block grant bill also wipes out assistance for the \nhomeless children. Nationwide, homeless children are isolated and often \nstigmatized. They face significant barriers to obtain adequate services \nof all kinds, including education. According to the December 1999 \nreport of the Interagency Council on the Homeless, most homeless \nchildren are young, 20 percent are age 2 or younger; 22 percent are age \n3 to 5; 20 percent are age 6 to 8; and 33 percent are between 9 and 17.\n  According to a 1990 report from the Better Homes Fund, a nonprofit \ncharity dedicated to helping homeless families, homeless children face \nextremely stressful situations. Each year, 90 percent of homeless \nchildren move up to three times; 40 percent attend two schools; 38 \npercent attend three or more schools; 21 percent of homeless children \nnationwide repeat a grade due to homelessness, compared with only 5 \npercent of other children; 14 percent of homeless children are \nsuspended from school, double the rate of other children.\n  This is what the National Coalition on Homeless says: The Federal \nprogram requirements that accompany McKinney funds focus upon State \nresponsibility to ensure equal opportunity for homeless children and \nyouth. They set forth the rights of homeless children to receive the \nsame educational opportunities as their nonhomeless peers.\n  Under the Republican proposal, States that opt for the block grant \nwould no longer have to follow these programs. Without the McKinney Act \nrequirements, homeless children and youth are shut out of school again, \ndestroying their chance for school success. It is wrong for Congress to \nturn its back on these children.\n  Finally, the block grant ignores the pressing needs of immigrant \nchildren. In 1997, the foreign-born population in the United States was \n25.8 million, the largest in the Nation's history. In fiscal year 2000, \nStates reported that more than 864,000 recent immigrant students were \nenrolled in schools, with an increase of these students of 55,000 over \n1995. Large numbers of immigrant students traditionally have been \nenrolled in schools in seven States: Arizona, California, Illinois, \nFlorida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. However, with the increase of \nimmigrant students in other States, the percentage in these States has \nfallen from 80 percent in 1995 to 71 percent in 2000.\n  This year, a number of other States reported a dramatic increase in \nthe recent immigrant student enrollment: Connecticut, up 72 percent; \nGeorgia, up 39 percent; Louisiana, up 34 percent; Michigan, up 35 \npercent; Missouri, up 50 percent; Oregon, up 28 percent; Tennessee, up \n33 percent; Utah, up 38 percent. Immigrant students, particularly those \nwith limited-English proficiency, are at significant risk of academic \nfailure. Among all youth ages 16 through 24, immigrants are three times \nmore likely to be drop outs than native born students.\n  Our overall goal in this legislation should be to write an education \nguarantee to parents, children, and schools, a guarantee that we will \nwork with them to improve their schools and ensure every student \nreceives a good education. We want to guarantee a qualified teacher is \nin every classroom. We want to guarantee small class sizes. We want to \nguarantee modern and safe schools. We want to guarantee afterschool \nopportunities for children to help them succeed in school and stay off \nthe street. We want to guarantee the parents have more opportunities \nfor significant improvement in their public schools. We want to \nguarantee a good education for homeless children, migrant children, and \nimmigrant children. We want a guarantee that States, districts, and \nschools are held accountable for results. We want to guarantee parents \nthat their children are free from guns in their schools.\n\n  Yesterday, to celebrate Mother's Day, hundreds of thousands of \nmothers from across the United States marched on the Nation's Capital \nto insist we do more to protect children from the epidemic of gun \nviolence that continues to plague our country. The Million Mom March \nhas focused the attention of the entire country on this critical \nchallenge. The question now is whether Congress will at long last end \nthe stonewalling and act responsibly on gun control.\n  For many months, Democrats have continued to ask the Republican \nleadership for immediate action on pending legislation to close the \nloopholes in the Nation's gun laws, but every request so far has been \ndenied. In fact, as a conferee on the juvenile violence legislation, in \n8 months in caucus, we have had 1 day of meetings. The reason is \nbecause, evidently, the leadership is sufficiently concerned that \nperhaps as a result of a conference between the House and the Senate we \nmight pass sensible and responsible legislation that deals with gun \nshow loopholes in our present laws.\n  Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of mothers from across the United \nStates marched on the Nation's Capital to insist that we do more to \nprotect children from the epidemic of gun violence that continues to \nplague our country. The Million Mom March has focused the attention of \nthe entire country on this critical challenge. The question now is \nwhether Congress is willing at long last to end the stonewalling and \nact responsibly on gun control. For many months, Democrats have \ncontinued to ask the Republican leadership for immediate action on \npending legislation to close the loopholes in the Nation's gun laws, \nbut every request has been denied.\n  Each day we fail to act, the tragic toll of gun violence climbs \nsteadily higher. In the year since the killings at Columbine High \nSchool in Colorado, 4,560 more children have lost their lives to \ngunfire, and countless more have been injured. It is inexcusable that \nthe Republican Congress continues to block every attempt to close the \ngaping loopholes that make a mockery of the Nation's current gun laws. \nThe guns used to kill 9 of the 13 people murdered at Columbine High \nSchool were purchased at a gun show. The woman who bought the guns for \nthe two young killers said she never would have purchased the weapons \nif she had to go through a background check.\n  Perhaps six year old Kayla Rolland in her first grade class in Flint, \nMichigan, would be alive today, if the gun her classmate used to kill \nher had a child safety lock on it. If Congress had listened after the \nschool killing in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997--or Jonesboro, \nArkansas in 1998--or Columbine High School in 1999--thousands\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nmore children would have been alive to celebrate Mother's Day \nyesterday.\n  By refusing to learn from such tragedies, we condemn ourselves to \nrepeat them. How many wake-up calls will it take before Congress \nfinally stops kowtowing to the National Rifle Association and starts \ndoing what is right on gun control?\n  The evidence is all around us that more effective steps are needed to \nprotect schools and children from guns. In a survey of over 100,000 \nteenagers conducted last month, 30 percent said they could get a gun in \na few hours--and 11 percent said they could get a gun in one day. Four \nin ten of these teenagers said there are guns in their homes; more than \nhalf say they have access to those weapons themselves. The fact is \nthere are more than a million children returning home today to homes \nwhere there are guns that are loaded and unlocked.\n  No other major nation on earth tolerates such shameful gun violence. \nAccording to a study by the Centers for Disease Control in 1997, the \nrate of firearm deaths among children 0-14 years old is nearly 12 times \nhigher in the United States than in 25 other industrial countries \ncombined.\n  In fact, I heard it said best from a person who was out marching \nyesterday on The Mall for the Million Mom March. She was asked about \nthe presence of guns in our society and responded that only the United \nStates and the IRA allow virtually unlimited access to guns. At least \nthe IRA are preparing to turn theirs in.\n  At the very least, Congress owes it to the nation's children to take \nstronger steps to protect them in their schools and homes.\n  Gun laws work. Experience is clear that tough gun laws in combination \nwith other preventive measures have a direct impact on reducing crime. \nIn Massachusetts, we have some of the toughest gun laws in the country. \nWe have a ban on carrying concealed weapons. A permit is required to do \nso. Local law enforcement has discretion to issue permits, and an \nindividual must show a need in order to obtain the permit. We have a \nminimum age of 21 for the purchase of a handgun. We have increased \npenalties for felons in possession of firearms. We have an adult \nresponsibility law. Adults are liable if a child obtains an improperly \nstored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself or any other person. \nWe require the sale of child safety locks with all firearms. We have a \nGun-Free Schools Law. We have a licensing law for purchases of guns. We \nhave enhanced standards for the licensing of gun dealers. We have a \nwaiting period for handgun purchases. It takes up to 30 days to obtain \na permit. We have a permit requirement for secondary and private sales \nof guns. We have a ban on the sale of Saturday Night Specials. We have \na requirement for reporting lost or stolen firearms.\n  As Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans testified last year in the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, ``Any \nsuccessful approach to youth violence must be balanced and \ncomprehensive. It must include major investments in prevention and \nintervention as well as enforcement. Take away any leg and the stool \nfalls.''\n  Commissioner Evans also stated that to be effective, efforts must be \ntargeted and cooperative. Police officers must be able to work closely \nwith churches, schools, and health and mental health providers. After-\nschool programs are essential to help keep juveniles off the streets, \nout of trouble, and away from guns and drugs.\n  There are partnerships between the Boston Public Schools and local \nmental health agencies. School districts are employing mental health \nprofessionals. Teachers and staff focus on identifying problems in \norder to prevent violence by students. The Boston police work actively \nwith parents, schools and other officials, discussing incidents in and \nout of school involving students. The Boston Public Health Commission \npromotes programs by the Boston Police Department.\n  In developing an effective approach like this, Boston has become a \nmodel for the rest of the country. The results have been impressive. \nThe success of Boston's comprehensive strategy is borne out in these \nresults:\n\n  From January 1999 through April 2000, no juvenile in Boston was \nkilled with a firearm.\n  In 1990, 51 Boston young people, ages 24 and under, were murdered by \na firearm. Last year, there were 10 such murders.\n  Reports from emergency rooms about firearm injuries are also down \ndramatically.\n  It's no coincidence that the firearm death rate in Massachusetts is \nsignificantly lower than the national average. When we compare states \nwith tough gun laws to those that have weak gun laws, the differences \nare significant. In 1996, across the nation, the number of firearm-\nrelated deaths for persons 19 years old or younger was 2 deaths per \n100,000 persons.\n  In states that have the weakest gun laws, the number was \nsignificantly higher:\n  Utah had 5.1 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people--two and a \nhalf times higher than the national average.\n  Indiana had 5.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three times \nhigher.\n  Idaho had 6.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three and a half \ntimes higher.\n  Mississippi had 9.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--four and a \nhalf times higher.\n  It is clear that strict gun laws help to reduce gun deaths. Yet, \nevery time that Democrats propose steps to keep guns out of the hands \nof young people--proposals that would clearly save lives--our \nRepublican friends have nothing to say but no. No to closing the gun \nshow loophole. No to child safety locks. No to support for stricter \nenforcement of current gun laws. No to every other sensible step to \nreduce the shameful toll of gun deaths.\n  Nothing in any of our proposals threatens in any way the activities \nof law-abiding sportsmen and women. Surely, we can agree on ways to \nmake it virtually impossible for angry children to get their hands on \nguns. We can give schools the resources and expertise they need to \nprotect themselves from guns, without turning classrooms into \nfortresses.\n  We must deal with these festering problems. There is ample time to \nact before this session of Congress ends this fall. We could easily act \nbefore the end of the current school year this spring. We could act \nthis week, if the will to act is there. All we have to do is summon the \ncourage and the common sense to say no to the National Rifle \nAssociation--and yes to the Million Mom March.\n  I want to take a moment or two more to talk about the issue which has \nbeen raised by others who say, really the answer is just Federal \nenforcement of existing gun laws.\n  The National Rifle Association calls in public for more effective \nenforcement of the nation's gun laws. But it has waged a shameful and \ncynical campaigns over the years to undermine Federal enforcement \nactivities by restricting the budget for the very enforcement it calls \nfor.\n  Between 1980 and 1987, for example, the number of ATF agents was \nslashed from 1,502 to 1,180, a reduction of over 20 percent, and the \nnumber of inspectors dropped from 655 to 626 even as the number of \nlicensed firearms dealers soared.\n  For the past 25 years, Congress has provided ATF with far fewer funds \nthan necessary to support enough inspectors and agents to effectively \nenforce the nation's firearms laws. In 1973, ATF and the Drug \nEnforcement Agency had comparable numbers of agents and nearly equal \nfunding--about $250 million a year. From 1973 to 2001 we see the cuts--\nin the number of agents--that have been made when we had the Republican \nleadership here in the Senate and in the House.\n  By 1998, however, the number of DEA agents had almost tripled, from \n1,470 to 4,261, while ATF's remained constant. 1,631 ATF agents were on \npayroll in 1998--only 9 more than in 1973. Yet there are more licensed \nfirearm dealers in the United States than there are McDonalds \nfranchises.\n  A substantial increase in funding is needed if we're serious about \nhelping ATF enforce the gun control laws. At every opportunity, the NRA \nand the Republicans say ``We don't need more gun laws. We need to \nenforce what's already on the books.'' Well, enforcement is exactly \nwhat Federal agents and prosecutors are doing. The facts are clear:\n  Overall firearms prosecutions are up. Criticism of Federal \nprosecution statistics ignores the basic fact that both\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nFederal and State authorities prosecute gun cases, and Federal \nauthorities generally focus on the worst type of offenders.\n  The gun lobby says that the Federal Government should prosecute every \ncase in which a person lies on the background check form, without \nexception. The fact is that ATF and DOJ do not have the resources to \nprosecute every case. Instead, their strategy is to have state law \nenforcement officials investigate and prosecute most of the gun \nviolations while federal law enforcement officials pursue the more \nserious cases.\n  Although the number of Federal prosecutions for lower-level \noffenders--persons serving sentences of 3 years or less--is down, the \nnumber of higher-level offenders--those sentenced to 5 years or more--\nis up by nearly 30 percent--from 1049 to 1345.\n  Do you understand that, Madam President? The number of Federal \nprosecutions for low-level offenders serving a sentence of 3 years or \nless is down. The number of higher level offenders of 5 years or more \nis up more than 30 percent. Why don't our Republican friends quote \nthose statistics?\n  At the same time, the total number of Federal and State prosecutions \nis up sharply--about 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for \nState and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992, from 20,681 to 25,186. \nThe number of high-level offenders is up by nearly 30 percent.\n  The total number of Federal and State prosecutions is up. Twenty-five \npercent more criminals were sent to prison for State and Federal \nweapons offenses in 1997 than in 1992.\n  The instant background check, which the NRA initially fought, is a \nsuccessful enforcement tool. It has stopped nearly 300,000 illegal \npurchases since 1994. It has also resulted in the arrests of hundreds \nof fugitives.\n  Violent crimes committed with guns, including homicides, robberies \nand aggravated assaults, fell by an average of 27 percent between 1992 \nand 1997, and the Nation's violent crime rate has dropped nearly 20 \npercent since 1992.\n  The results speak for themselves. The increased collaboration among \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement has resulted in a more \nefficient distribution of prosecutorial responsibilities, a steady \nincrease in firearms prosecutions on a cumulative basis, and, most \nimportant, a sharp decline in the number of violent crimes committed \nwith guns.\n  Those are the facts. We will hear, as I have heard in the Judiciary \nCommittee and in various debates: This is not really about more laws; \nwhat we need to do is prosecute.\n  The Republicans have cut the agents who are responsible for the \nenforcement of the laws by 20 percent, and on the other hand, we have \nseen the total prosecutions, not only the prosecutions but the results \nof those prosecutions--people going to jail as a result of the \ncombination of Federal, State, and local prosecutions--has increased \nsignificantly. I hope in these final weeks of debate we will not keep \nhearing those arguments that have been made.\n  I mentioned Boston a few moments ago and about the stringent gun \nlaws. Also, as Chief Evans has pointed out, we need effective \nprosecution; we need the laws, but we need prevention as well.\n  In Boston, between 1990 and 1999, homicides dropped by 80 percent.\n  In 1990, there were 152 homicides in Boston as compared to 31 in \n1999. Indeed, serious crime across the board is at its lowest level in \n30 years.\n  In 1999, no juvenile in Boston was murdered by a gun and none so far \nthis year.\n  In 1990, 51 young Boston people, age 24 and under, were murdered by a \nfirearm. Last year, there were 10; this year, thus far, 3.\n  Between 1990 and 1999, there was an 80-percent drop in young people \nage 24 and under murdered by a firearm.\n  There can be effective efforts, and they are making them. We ought to \ncontinue to eliminate, to the extent possible, the proliferation of \nweapons in the hands of children and those who should not have them. \nEvery day in this country 12 children die. We need to make sure we take \nsteps, including safety locks, parental responsibility, smart-gun \ntechnology, and the range of options to cut into that figure \ndramatically. We can do that.

Madam President, I thought I had seen some fairly unusual \nand Byzantine proposals around this town, but one that was described in \nlast Friday's Washington Post almost takes the cake. Going back some \nyears, there was a proposal by the U.S. Post Office that would allow \npeople to file change of address forms in the event of a nuclear war. I \nthought that was rather bizarre. One can imagine being under nuclear \nattack and trying to find the road to the post office to leave a \nforwarding address. That is not very likely. There is a proposal even \ngoofier than that.\n  On Friday, May 12, John Berry, a Washington Post staff writer--\nsomeone for whom I have respect and he is an excellent writer and \nthinker--wrote an article about ``Rate Forecasts Climbing.'' He was \ntalking about interest rates. John describes the thinking of some \nmembers of the Federal Reserve Board and the Open Market Committee \nabout what they intend to do with interest rates. I wish that this \nstory, however, included an analysis of opposing views and there are \nsome.\n  Here is the situation: Tomorrow morning at 9:30, there will be a \nmeeting in this town of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and \nregional Fed bank presidents--five of them--who will make decisions \nabout interest rates. The speculation is they will increase interest \nrates by one-half of 1 percent despite the fact there is no evidence of \ninflation that suggests they should do this.\n  It is the same as deciding they are going to tax the American people. \nIn fact, the rate increases last June, August, November, February, \nMarch, and now tomorrow--we will have another, mark my words--those \nrate increases have added about $1,210 in interest charges to the \naverage household. If one has a $100,000 home mortgage, one is paying \n$100 more a month because of what the Federal Reserve Board has done. \nEvery household is paying on average some $1,210 more per year in \ninterest charges.\n  That is from the folks who meet in secret and effectively impose a \ntax on every single American. The only difference is, when it is done \nin this Chamber in the form of taxation, there is a debate and then a \nvote. It is done in the open. Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve Board will \ndeal with interest rate questions in secret.\n  At 9:30, if those who are paying attention to C-SPAN want to go down \nto the Federal Reserve Board and say, I want to be involved in this \ndiscussion, they will be told: No, you cannot be involved; this is \nsecret; the doors are locked; we intend to make decisions about your \nlife and you can have no involvement.\n  Here is what the Washington Post article said about what these folks \nare going to think tomorrow which I think is bizarre. They are saying \nthat American workers are becoming more productive and because the \nproductivity of the American worker is up, they believe that justifies \nhigher interest rates.\n  It used to be the same economists who cannot remember, in most cases, \ntheir home telephone numbers and their home addresses but who can tell \nus what is going to happen 5 years or 7\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nyears from now, would say our problem is we have inflation pressures in \nthis country because we do not have increases in productivity. If we \nhave increases in productivity, that will deal with all of the other \npressures that come to bear on the economy and offset them.\n  Now they are saying, but if workers become more productive, we are \ngoing to have to raise interest rates. You see, they are concerned \nabout workers' pay. If workers in this country receive more pay, they \nsay that is inflationary. So the workers are kind of stuck, aren't \nthey?\n  The Fed has already said, if workers receive more money, that is \ngoing to drive up inflation. But in the past they have said, if \nworkers' productivity goes up, that will be all right, because you can \nreceive more money if you have greater productivity, right? You ought \nto. American workers ought to expect they would be able to share in \ntheir increased productivity and increased output.\n  Now the Fed is saying: That is not right either. Workers can be more \nproductive, but we don't intend to see them get more money. We intend \nto continue to raise interest rates to slow down the American economy.\n  If workers in America become more productive, the Fed wants to go \ninto a room tomorrow and penalize them--all of them. Talk about a goofy \nidea.\n  I was going to go through the entire article. I will not.\n  But let me do this, as I conclude. The folks who are going to do \nthis, they all have gray suits, they all look like bankers, and they \nall think like bankers. They all have worked there for 100 years. These \nfolks are confirmed by the Congress. To be appointed to the Board of \nGovernors, they have to be confirmed by the Senate. But these other \nfolks also serve on that Open Market Committee on a rotating basis--\ntomorrow five of them will be in a room with the Board of Governors. \nThey are not confirmed by us. They represent their regional Federal \nReserve Banks. They are all presidents of the regional banks. They are \ngoing to be voting.\n  I could have described what they said in that article. I could have \ndescribed what Cathy Minehan said in that article. Strange. I don't \nunderstand this at all. Workers are more productive, and therefore you \nmust penalize them? It used to be that people would say, if workers \nwere more productive, they would be able to expect to receive more \nwages.\n  None of you folks down at the Fed has ever given a whit about the top \nexecutives in this country who earn $1 million, $5 million, $10 \nmillion, $100 million, or $200 million a year. You all have seen those \nnumbers. I have spoken about some of them on the floor. It does not \nmatter to these folks if the upper crust is getting a lot of money. But \nlet the American workers get a gain in productivity and an increase in \nwages, and then you have these folks running in a room, closing the \ndoor, and, in secret, deciding they want to impose another higher \ninterest rate on the American people. There is no justification for it \nat all.\n  The core Producer Price Index is up only three-tenths of 1 percent \nover the past 6 months. Retail sales are down. Auto sales fell seven-\ntenths of 1 percent--the second straight monthly drop. Building \nmaterial sales are down 1.6 percent. These are the last monthly \nfigures. There is no justification at all.\n  The only thing I can conceive of is these people just do not sleep. \nThey see things that do not exist. Imagine how they must feel when the \nlights are turned off. They see inflation that does not exist.\n  For nearly a year they have been worried about inflation that does \nnot exist. They have been willing to impose a penalty on the American \neconomy and the average American household to the tune of $1,210 a \nyear.\n  What do you think people would say if this Congress said: We have a \nproposal; let's increase taxes on the American people $1,210 a year on \nthe average household? They would have apoplectic seizures around here. \nBut these folks are doing it in secret, with no justification at all. \nWhy? Because they tilt on the side of money center banks on the \nquestion of monetary policy. They always tilt that way. It is funny \nthey can stand up, they tilt so far.\n  It seems to me this country deserves a monetary policy that allows \nworkers in our factories, on our main streets, in our towns, to be more \nproductive and to be able to receive the rewards of that increased \nproductivity.\n  If these folks close that door tomorrow--and they will; mark my \nwords--and increase interest rates another full one-half percent--and \nthat is likely what they are going to do--they are going to continue to \ninjure this economy and injure the American workers.\n  I said before that Mr. Greenspan has sort of used himself as a set of \nhuman brake pads. His only mission in life somehow is to slow down the \nAmerican economy. He has always insisted we could not grow more than \n2.5 percent without more inflation and that we couldn't go below 6 \npercent unemployment without more inflation. He has been wrong on both \ncounts. We have been below 6 percent unemployment for 5 years, and \ninflation has gone down. We have had more than 2.5-percent economic \ngrowth for some long while, and inflation has gone down.\n  At some point, the American people, through this Congress, ought to \nask the tough questions of this Federal Reserve Board: How do you \ncontinue to justify this? How do you justify this at a time when there \nis no evidence of real inflationary trouble in this country, risking \nruining our economy, ruining continuous economic growth for some while \nand imposing on the backs of the American citizen, on the backs of the \naverage families in this country, such a significant penalty? It is \nwrong, wrong, wrong.\n  I will have more to say about this tomorrow, after the Federal \nReserve Board meeting.\n  Madam President, I guess that ends the business for today.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/15/senate-section/article/S3956-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
