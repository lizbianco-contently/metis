Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \npassage of H.R. 1883.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\na sufficient second? There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to express my ardent support for \npassage of the Iran Nonproliferation Act. It is very likely that this \nlegislation will pass the Senate by a margin matching or nearing the \nunanimous 419 to 0 vote in the House of Representatives last September.\n  The importance of this legislation should not be lost amid the \nwidespread acclamation with which it will be sent to the President. \nThis bill is aimed at controlling the transfer or sale of technology \nand expertise to Iran, especially from Russia, that will assist in its \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction and missiles designed to \ndeliver these weapons.\n  This is a very real, very well-documented and very serious security \nconcern for the United States and Israel, our nation's most-trusted \nally in the Middle East. The Central Intelligence Agency has reported \nIran has the capability to launch a missile that will reach Israel, and \nit is well known that Iran is pursuing development of nuclear, chemical \nand biological weaponry.\n  The Iran Nonproliferation Act provides for biannual reports on who \naround the world is transferring prohibited technology or information \nto Iran, and allows the President to take action against persons or \nentities found to be engaged in such activity. This bill also includes \nnew steps to ensure the Russian Space Agency, which is a partner with \nNASA in the International Space Station project, is complying with \nRussia's official Iran anti-proliferation policy.\n  Media reports on the Iran election, held only days ago, show an \nencouraging shift in the attitudes of the Iranian people, a trend that \nwe should applaud and encourage. Unfortunately, the structure of the \nIranian government and its police services may well frustrate the will \nof the Iranian people, and the quest of its armed forces for weapon and \nmissile technology proceeds apace. I look forward to the day on which \nIran will be a good and peaceful neighbor. That day may be closer, but \nit has not yet arrived.\n  This bill is a necessary step towards our goal of nonproliferation \nand certainly merits a high level of bipartisan support, as well as the \nsignature of President Clinton.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Iran \nNonproliferation Act.\n  We are faced with an historic opportunity to send a strong message to \nnations around the world--we will not sit by idle as goods, services or \ntechnology are transferred to Iran that contribute significantly to its \nability to develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or ballistic \nor cruise missiles.\n  This legislation provides the Administration with useful tools to \ncombat the spread of dangerous weapons technology and to discourage \nnuclear proliferation. It also enhances U.S. efforts to monitor Iranian \nproliferation.\n  This legislation demonstrates our commitment to prevent the \nproliferation of dangerous nuclear weapons to countries that threaten \nour national security as well as the security of allies--such as Israel \nand Europe. The Middle East is of vital strategic importance to the \nU.S.--and our interests and Israel's security are threatened by the \ncontinuing build-up of advanced conventional weapons by `rogue regimes' \nin the region. For this reason, U.S. support for Israel must go beyond \neconomic and military aid to Israel--it must meet the very real \nchallenges that will face Israel and the United States in this new \ncentury, such as limiting the threats of weapons of mass destruction. \nIt is well documented that technology provided to Iran increases its \nability to develop its own intermediate range ballistic missile that is \ncapable of reaching Israel as well as our European allies. By limiting \nIran's access to such technology we can better protect these countries \nas well as our own troops in the Middle East and Europe.\n  The people of Iran demonstrated in their recent elections an \noverriding desire to move away from the extremism of the previous \ngovernment toward reform and moderation in the future--but it is too \nearly to tell what this change will mean in practice. I hope that it is \na sign that Iran will end its missile program and its support for \ninternational terrorism. But despite this positive step, the Iran \nNonproliferation Act is still vital to combat the spread of dangerous \nweapons technology and, in particular, to monitor nuclear weapons \nproliferation to Iran.\n  This legislation also sends a strong message to Russia that U.S. aid \nand scientific collaboration will be limited if Russia doesn't stop \nmissile proliferation to Iran. U.S. funding will be substantially \nlimited unless the President certifies that the Russian Space Agency is \nnot transferring technology to Iran.\n  As the ranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee that funds the space \nprogram, I have been a strong supporter of the International Space \nStation. I supported Russia's participation in the space program for \nthree reasons:\n  One, their technical expertise;\n  Two, to build stronger links between the United States and Russia; \nand\n  Three, to ensure that Russian scientists and engineers had civilian \nwork--so they would not sell their skills to rogue governments.\n  Russia has failed to live up to its promises on the space station. I \nhave no question of Russia's technical competence. But I have strong \nconcerns about its failure to meet its end of the bargain. Russia has \nnot adequately funded its share of the space station, resulting in \ndelays and a cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the entire program.\n  Even more troubling is Russia's role in the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. Russia has exported technology, material and \nexpertise to help Iran develop ballistic missiles. These missiles could \ncarry chemical, nuclear or biological weapons--which could reach any \ntarget within about 800 miles of Iran.\n  Russia's former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin promised to end this \nassistance. We need to make sure the new Russian government fulfills \nthis promise. I recognize that Acting Russian President Vladmir Putin \nhas been receptive to restricting companies that sell missile \ntechnology and equipment to Iran. I hope his intentions are translated \ninto action. Otherwise, our cooperation with Russia--both in space and \nelsewhere--may end.\n  We live in a dangerous world--where terrorists and rogue nations are \ndeveloping the most repugnant weapons of mass destruction. Our action \ntoday will send a clear message to our allies and to our adversaries. \nBy coming together to support this bipartisan legislation, we will \ndemonstrate our unified commitment to limit nuclear proliferation and \nto create a safer more stable world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

After we have this en bloc vote, we \nwill put in a time for morning business. I see Senator Specter, and \nSenator Stevens wants to speak, and probably Senators on the other side \ndo. We will put in probably an hour, from 12:30 until approximately \n1:30, so Senators can speak on a number of subjects.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, after \nthe votes on the judges, may it be in order that Chairman Hatch and I \nbe recognized for a couple minutes on the nominations that had been \nvoted on?\n  Mr. LOTT. Is Senator Hatch here?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was asking for myself, but I thought as a matter of \ncourtesy I should include the chairman.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is a reasonable request. We need to have the \nvote as soon as we can. Senators are prepared to vote.\n  Mr. President, I amend my request and ask unanimous consent that we \nhave 2 minutes for the chairman and 2 minutes for the ranking member \nfollowing votes. I note that Senator Inhofe will probably have some \ncomments on these nominations, and he indicated he would make those \nafter the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the leader will yield, is the leader \nagreeable to extending morning business until 2 o'clock?\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S757-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S757-S758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF KERMIT BYE, OF NORTH DAKOTA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT \n                      JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Kermit Bye, of \nNorth Dakota, to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recommend the confirmation \nof Kermit Bye for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me and Senator Dorgan in supporting his nomination.\n  Kermit Bye is a native North Dakotan. He was born in the middle of a \nNorth Dakota blizzard, in a railroad section house in Hatton, North \nDakota. He has distinguished himself in his career, and is widely \nrecognized as one of the best trial lawyers in our state. Kermit Bye \nwill be an excellent addition to the federal judiciary, and he has my \nstrong support.\n  Kermit Bye would bring a wide range of experiences to the bench. \nBefore receiving his law degree from the University of North Dakota in \n1962, he worked as a milk truck driver, a radio advertising salesman, \nand in catalog sales at Montgomery Wards.\n  Soon after completing law school, Mr. Bye worked as North Dakota \nDeputy Securities Commissioner, and later served as Assistant United \nStates Attorney for the District of North Dakota.\n  Since 1968, Mr. Bye has worked for the Vogel Law Firm and was named \nPresident of the firm in 1981. Mr. Bye has over 30 years of experience \nin Federal and state trial and appellate litigation. His long and \ndistinguished career includes representing individual and corporate \nclients. He has tried more than 100 cases, representing both plaintiffs \nand defendants. He has also argued numerous appeals, including more \nthan 20 before the Eighth Circuit. Mr. Bye has served on the Board of \nGovernors and as the President of the State Bar Association of North \nDakota.\n  Through his broad experience and success he has earned an excellent \nreputation. As an experienced litigator, Mr. Bye also has a full \nunderstanding of the appropriate role of the judiciary.\n  My colleague, Senator Dorgan, and I have heard from individuals \nacross our home state, from both sides of the aisle and from all \nsections of the legal community, recommending Mr. Bye for this \nposition. According to his colleagues and fellow bar members, Mr. Bye \nis a man of great character and qualifications.\n  One of his supporters is Judge Frank Magill, who Mr. Bye has been \nnominated to succeed on the Eighth Circuit. Judge Magill has been on \nsenior status since April 1, 1997, and was appointed to the Eighth \nCircuit by President Reagan in 1986. He states in a letter to Senator \nhatch: ``I have had a longtime professional association with Kermit \nBye. His professional competence and integrity are of the highest \norder. He has several decades of trial experience. I know from personal \nexperiences that he will be an easy fit for your criterion of judicial \ntemperament.''\n  Mr. President, I am confident that Mr. Bye will be an outstanding \naddition to the federal bench. I support his confirmation and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Kermit Bye, of North Dakota, to be a \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit? On this question, \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate voted 98-0 on \nKermit Bye to be United States Circuit Court Judge for the Eighth \nCircuit and Justice George Daniels to be United States District Court \nJudge for the Southern District of New York.\n  Kermit Bye is an outstanding attorney from North Dakota. I will put \nhis full record in the Record later. Justice Daniels is a distinguished \nNew Yorker, with the strong support of the two distinguished Senators \nfrom New York--Senators Moynihan and Schumer--in the same way Kermit \nBye had the strong support of the two distinguished Senators from North \nDakota--Senators Conrad and Dorgan.\n  I wish to thank both the Republican leader and the Democratic leader \nfor helping us get these nominations up. They had been reported last \nyear. For some inexplicable reason, they were held up. We see that the \nSenate, in voting on them, has voted 98-0. I mention this because many \ntimes we have judges, who are judicial nominations, where it takes a \nlong time to get their nominations to the floor, and then they are \npassed by overwhelming margins. Out of a sense of justice towards the \npeople we are putting on our Federal courts, we, the Senate, should do \na better job.\n  Many wait too long. The most prominent current examples of that \ntreatment are Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. We have waited too \nlong to vote on them. I understand, finally, after 4 years, we are \ngoing to vote on Judge Paez, who has one of the most distinguished \nrecords anybody has ever had who has come before the Senate. He is \nstrongly supported by law enforcement, strongly supported by the bar, \nstrongly supported by the Hispanic community. He is certainly proud of \nhis Hispanic background, as well he should be. He has accomplished more \nthan most people accomplish of any background. I hope that after 4 \nyears he will be voted on.\n  Finally, I had hoped we would reach a vote on Timothy Dyk today. He \nwas first nominated to a vacancy in the Federal Circuit in April of \n1998. For anybody who is keeping track, that was well in the last \ncentury. After having a hearing and being reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee to the Senate in September of 1998, his nomination \nwas left on the Senate calendar without action and then returned to the \nPresident 2 years ago as the 105th Congress adjourned. He was \nrenominated in January 1999 and reported favorably in October 1999.\n  So he has been waiting for all these years. He has clerked for three \nSupreme Court Justices, including the Chief Justice. He has a \nremarkably distinguished career. He has represented people across the \nspectrum, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly backs \nhim. I hope we can get him confirmed this week or next. They need him \non the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. He is one of the most \nqualified people we have ever seen. We should do it.\n  Mr. Dyk has distinguished himself with a long career of private \npractice in the District of Columbia. From 1964 to 1990, he worked with \nWilmer, Cutler & Pickering as an associate and then as a partner. Since \n1990, he has been with Jones Day Reavis & Pogue as a partner and Chair \nof its Issues and Appeals Section.\n  Mr. Dyk received his undergraduate degree in 1958 from Harvard \nCollege, and his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1961. Following \nlaw school, he clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Reed, Burton, \nand Chief Justice Warren. Mr. Dyk was also a Special Assistant to the \nAssistant Attorney General in the Tax Division. His has been a \ndistinguished career in which he has represented a wide array of \nclients, including the United States Chamber of Commerce. I look \nforward to the confirmation vote on this highly-qualified nominee.\n  Kermit Bye is an outstanding attorney from North Dakota. From 1962 to \n1966, Mr. Bye was the Deputy Securities Commissioner and Special \nAssistant Attorney General for the State of North Dakota. And from 1966 \nto 1968, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of North \nDakota. Since 1968, he has been a member and partner with the Fargo law \nfirm of Votel, Kelly, Knutson, Weir, Bye & Hunke, Ltd. Mr. Bye received \nhis undergraduate degree in 1959 from the University of North Dakota, \nand his law degree from the University of North Dakota Law School in \n1962.\n  Mr. Bye's nomination is another of those that was favorably reported \nlast year by the Judiciary Committee but which was not acted upon by \nthe Senate. He is strongly supported by Senator Dorgan and Senator \nConrad, who are to be commended for their efforts on his behalf and on \nbehalf of the people of North Dakota that has finally brought us to \nthis day.\n  Justice George Daniels is a distinguished New Yorker. He has \ndistinguished himself with a long career of service in the New York \nfederal and state court systems. He was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in \nthe Eastern District of New York from 1983 to 1989. From 1989 to 1990, \nand again from 1993 to 1995, he was a Judge in the Criminal Court of \nthe City of New York. And from 1990 to 1993, he was a counsel to the \nMayor of the City of New York. Since 1995, Mr. Daniels has been a \nJustice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York.\n  Justice Daniels received his undergraduate degree in 1975 from Yale \nUniversity, and his law degree from the University of California at \nBerkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law in 1978.\n  He has the strong support of Senator Moynihan and Senator Schumer and \nthe ABA has given him its highest rating. Although he was reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee last year, his was one of the \nnominations not acted upon by the Senate. I congratulate the Senators \nfrom New York and Justice Daniels and his family on his consideration \ntoday.\n  I thank the majority leader and commend the Democratic leader for \nscheduling the consideration of these judicial nominations. The debate \non judicial nominations over the last couple of years has included too \nmuch delay with respect to too many nominations.\n  The most prominent current examples of that treatment are Judge \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon. With respect to these nominations, the \nSenate has for too long refused to do its constitutional duty and vote. \nI am grateful that the majority leader agreed last year to bring each \nof those nominations to a Senate vote before March 15. Nominees deserve \nto be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two or three \nor four years. The nomination of Judge Paez has now been pending for \nover four years. He has the strong support of his home State Senators \nand of local law enforcement.\n  His has been a distinguished career in which he has served as a state \nand federal judge for what is now approaching 19 years. His story is a \nwonderful American story of hard work, fairness and public service. He \nand his family have much of which to be proud. Hispanic organizations \nfrom California and around the country have urged the Senate to act \nfavorably on his nomination without further delay.\n  Within the next two weeks the Senate will be called upon to vote on \nthis outstanding nomination, and I trust that we will do the right \nthing. I recall when Judge Sonia Sotomayor, another outstanding \nDistrict Court Judge, was nominated to the Second Circuit and her \nnomination was delayed. Reportedly, she was so well qualified that some \nfeared her quick confirmation might have led her to be considered as a \npossible Supreme Court nomination and that was why Senate consideration \nof her nomination was delayed through secret holds. Ultimately, she was \nconfirmed to the Second Circuit.\n  After all the delay in that case, I was struck that not a single \nSenator who voted against her confirmation and not a single Senator who \nhad acted to delay its consideration uttered a single word to justify \nsuch opposition.\n  Of course it is every Senator's right to vote as he or she sees fit \non all matters. But I would hope that in the case of Judge Richard \nPaez, where his nomination has been delayed for over four years, for \nthe longest period in the history of the Senate, those who have opposed \nhim will show him the courtesy of using this time to discuss with us \nany concerns that may have and to explain the basis for any negative \nvote against a person so well qualified for the position to which he \nhas been nominated by the President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator be \nrecognized for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate has \nconfirmed Kermit Bye's nomination to the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Kermit Bye is one of North Dakota's most distinguished and respected \nattorneys, and a senior partner in one of the top law firms in the \nMidwest. He has nearly 40 years of trial and appellate experience, he \nwas President of the North Dakota Bar Association, and he's received \nthe North Dakota State Bar Association's Distinguished Service Award.\n  I won't name every civic and community organization that Kermit Bye \nhas chaired and served on, because the list is too long. Instead, I \nwill say Kermit Bye cares deeply about the law and about the people our \nlaws protect.\n  He is a man of impeccable integrity and sound judgment, possessing a \nformidable intellect and a healthy dose of North Dakota common sense. \nKermit is temperamentally very well-suited for the bench, and can be \ncounted on as a fair-minded jurist who understands the importance of \nthe rule of law to society, and the judiciary's proper role within our \nconstitutional system.\n  As many will recall, this seat on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \nwas first vacated in April 1997, and my fellow North Dakotan John Kelly \nwas nominated and confirmed to this seat last summer. Tragically, just \na few weeks after taking his oath, Judge Kelly took ill and passed \naway.\n  I am pleased today that Kermit Bye has been confirmed to fill this \nvacancy so that our Federal judiciary can benefit from his wisdom and \njudgment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, for proceeding today with votes for these judicial \nnominees. As I have stated, we will continue to process the \nconfirmations of nominees who are qualified to be federal judges. In \nthat respect, the Senate Judiciary Committee held its first nominations \nhearing of this Session on Tuesday, February 22, and I expect to see \nmore judicial nominees moving through the process in the coming months. \nThere is a perception held by some that the confirmation of judges \nstops in election years. This perception is inaccurate, and I intend to \nmove qualified nominees through the process during this session of \nCongress.\n  That said, in moving forward with the confirmations of judicial \nnominees, we must be mindful of problems we have with certain courts, \nparticularly the Ninth Circuit. It was reported yesterday that the \nNinth Circuit has a record of 0-6 this supreme court term. In addition, \nthe President must be mindful of the problems he creates when he \nnominates individuals who do not have the support of their home-State \nSenators. In this regard, I must say that it appears at times as if the \nPresident is seeking a confrontation with the Senate on this issue, \ninstead of working with the Senate to see that his nominees are \nconfirmed.\n  During this Congress, despite partisan rhetoric, the Judiciary \nCommittee has reported 42 judicial nominees, and the full Senate has \nconfirmed 36 of these--a number comparable to the average of 39 \nconfirmations for the first sessions of the past five Congresses when \nvacancy rates were generally much higher. In total, the Senate has \nconfirmed 340 of President Clinton's judicial nominees since he took \noffice in 1993.\n  I am disturbed by some of the allegations that have been made that \nthe Senate's treatment of certain nominees differed based on their race \nor gender. Such allegations are entirely without merit. For \nnoncontroversial nominees who were confirmed in 1997 and 1998, there is \nlittle if any difference between the timing of confirmation for \nminority nominees and non-minority nominees. Only when the President \nappoints a controversial female or minority nominee does a disparity \narise. Moreover, last session, over 50% of the nominees that the \nJudiciary Committee reported to the full Senate were women and \nminorities. Even the former Democratic chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Joe Biden, stated publicly that the process by which \nthe committee, under my chairmanship, examines and approves judicial \nnominees ``has not a single thing to do with gender or race.'' That is \nfrom the transcript of a Judiciary Committee hearing on judicial \nnominations on November 10, 1999.\n  The Senate has conducted the confirmations process in a fair and \nprincipled manner, and the process has worked well. The Federal \nJudiciary is sufficiently staffed to perform its function under article \nIII of the Constitution. Senator Lott, and the Senate as a whole, are \nto be commended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S760-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss my concern regarding \nrecent developments in the Dickerson case concerning voluntary \nconfessions. Opponents are using some extreme tactics to encourage the \nSupreme Court to strike down this law.\n  For years, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including \nmyself, encouraged the Clinton Justice Department to enforce 18 U.S.C. \n3501, the law on voluntary confessions. In the Dickerson case, the \nDepartment refused to permit career federal prosecutors to rely on the \nlaw in their efforts to make sure a serial bank robber did not get \naway.\n  When the Supreme Court was deciding whether to hear the case, the \nDepartment had the opportunity to defend the statute, as many of us \nencouraged it to do. While making its decision, the Department \nconsulted with certain federal law enforcement agencies. The Drug \nEnforcement Administration explained that Miranda in its current form \nis problematic in some circumstances and encouraged the Department to \ndefend the law.\n  The Department later wrote in its brief about the views of federal \nlaw enforcement in this matter, but that support for the statute and \nreservation about Miranda is nowhere to be found. Instead, the brief \nstates ``federal law enforcement agencies have concluded that the \nMiranda decision itself generally does not hinder their investigations \nand the issuance of Miranda warnings at the outset of custodial \ninterrogation is in the best interests of law enforcement as well as \nthe suspect.'' The brief should recognize that there is disagreement \namong federal law enforcement agencies about the impact of the Miranda \nwarnings in investigations and the need for reform of the Miranda \nrequirements. The Department should not generalize in a brief before \nthe Supreme Court to the point of misrepresentation. Senator Hatch and \nI sent a letter to Attorney General Reno and Solicitor General Waxman \nlast week asking for an explanation in this matter, and I look forward \nto their response.\n  One of the amicus briefs, which was filed by the House Democratic \nleadership, takes a very novel approach toward the statute. It seems to \nsuggest that the voluntary confessions law is not really a law after \nall. It states that the ``Congress enacted section 3501 largely for \nsymbolic purposes, to make an election year statement in 1968 about law \nand order, not to mount a challenge to Miranda.''\n  This statement is not only inaccurate. It is completely \ninappropriate.\n  I was in the Senate when the voluntary confessions law was debated \nand passed over 30 years ago. A bipartisan majority of the Congress \nsupported this law, and Democrats were in the majority at the time.\n  We did not enact the law to make some vague statement about crime. We \npassed the voluntary confessions law because we were extremely \nconcerned about the excesses of the Miranda decision allowing an \nunknown number of defendants who voluntarily confessed their crimes to \ngo free on a technicality. We passed it to be enforced.\n  For the House Democratic leadership brief to state that the Congress \ndid not intend for a law that it passed to be enforced trivializes the \nlegislative branch at the expense of the executive. It is a dangerous \nmistake for the legislative branch to defer to the executive regarding \nwhat laws to enforce.\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\n  The executive branch has a constitutional duty to enforce the laws, \nunless they are clearly unconstitutional. Contrary to what is happening \ntoday, the executive branch is not free to ignore acts of Congress \nsimply because it does not support them, and the legislative branch \nshould not support this approach.\n  In this matter, the Justice Department has refused to abide by its \nduty to faithfully execute the laws, and has instead chosen to side \nwith criminals and defense attorneys over prosecutors and law \nenforcement. It is unfortunate that, in this case, the Department will \nbe making arguments on behalf of criminals before the Supreme Court. No \narguments about the law will change this sad fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is an honor to be here today with my \ndistinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts. We want to \ninstitute a process by which this body can increasingly come to grips \nwith some of the challenges that persist in our foreign policy and \ncontinue to be, in terms of our defense, a challenge to us and to the \nyoung men and women of America.\n  It is an opportunity for us to continue our dialog which we started \nin the Armed Services Committee over the last 3 years as we have \nencountered difficulties in the Middle East, southwest Asia, and as we \nsee problems around the world. He and I have more and more come to an \nunderstanding that we have more in common than we do in disagreement.\n  One of the things we have in common is that we asked some very \nimportant pertinent questions about our foreign policy and our defense \nas we go into the 21st century. We are delighted today to kick off, not \nso much a debate on American foreign policy but a dialog which we hope \nwill develop a consensus of some basic first principles by which we \nought to engage the world.\n  We have the post-cold-war world, as it is called. I was with \nMadeleine Albright today, our distinguished Secretary of State, and she \nsaid it is probably not the post anything; it is just a new era. We \nhave gone through the cold war and the terrors of that period, but we \nare certainly in a new era, and it does not even really have a name.\n  We hope to provide for our colleagues in the Senate--and we hope they \nwill join us--over the course of this year, an understanding of key \nnational security issues and begin building the building blocks of a \nbipartisan consensus on the most appropriate priorities and approaches \nfor our country in today's international environment.\n\n  In launching this endeavor, I am very mindful of both the enormity of \nthe undertaking and of my own limitations in addressing such a subject. \nHaving been only 3 years, beginning my fourth year in the Senate, I \ncertainly do not claim to have a solution to these problems about which \nwe are going to talk, but I hope to ask some pertinent questions.\n  American foreign policy is challenged because of the end of the cold \nwar, and Senator Roberts and I approach these questions on the road to \nthe future with great humility and certainly with far more questions of \nour own than answers. Yet I believe this dialog is one the Senate must \nhave. We owe it to the other nations of the world, including those that \nlook to America for leadership, as well as those that make themselves \nour competitors, and certainly we owe it to those that make us their \nadversaries. Even more, we owe it to those who serve our country in the \nArmed Forces and in the Foreign Service, whose careers and sometimes \nvery lives can be at stake. Perhaps most of all, we owe it to our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  I was with Senator Nunn last night at the State Department. He was \nbeing honored by the State Department. I always learn something from \nhim whenever I am with him. We were talking about a particular country, \na particular challenge in American foreign policy. He said: Yes, what \nhappens there will affect our children and our grandchildren.\n  It is astounding that the consequences of the decisions we make today \nwill, indeed, affect future generations, so we must make these \ndecisions wisely.\n  Uncertainty, disunity, partisanship, and overstatesmanship will not \nserve this country well. We need to seriously consider what our global \nrole in the 21st century is and what it should be. That decision will \naffect future generations more than we can possibly understand.\n  One more point: I do believe a meaningful, bipartisan dialog on the \nU.S. role, which many believe is vital to our national interest, is \nalso imminently doable even in this election year. While the subject \nmatter is very important to our country and our future, it is not an \nissue of great use on the campaign trail. This great body is the place \nto discuss these great and momentous issues where we can lay it all out \nand talk about it in a way that does not impinge on anybody's \nparticular partisan views. Simply put, neither the Presidential race \nnor the elections for the Congress will be determined by who has the \npartisan upper hand on foreign policy.\n  Over the course of the year, Senator Roberts and I--and we hope a \nnumber of other Senators--will be engaging in a series of floor dialogs \nrelating to the general direction of U.S. foreign policy and national \nsecurity policy in the 21st century.\n  We have actually chosen to sit together. We are on different sides of \nthe aisle, but we chose to come from our back-bench positions to show \nthat we stand actually shoulder to shoulder in this regard. We are all \nAmericans, and we hope we can do something good for our country.\n  Our current game plan is to begin today by considering frameworks for \nthe U.S. global role with respect to priorities and approaches. In the \nweeks to come, this will be followed by sessions on U.S. national \ninterests. Of course, the first question about American engagement in \nthe world should be: Is it in our vital strategic national interest? \nThat is question No. 1. The next session will be on U.S. national \ninterests, what are they.\n\n  Another phase of our discussion will be the use of our military \nforces. Quite frankly, this should be question No. 2 because if we do \nnot have a military objective following America's strategic vital \ninterests, why commit the military?\n  Next is we want to engage the question of our relationship with \nmultilateral organizations. We realize the United States is the world's \nforemost military and economic power, but that does not necessarily \nmean we can go it on our own everywhere. The issue of multilateral \norganizations and our relationship to them is an important one.\n  After multilateral organizations is the foreign policy roles of the \nexecutive and legislative branches. One of the first things that came \nto my attention when I came to the Senate 3 years ago was something \ncalled the U.S. Constitution. Senator Byrd was kind enough to give me \nan autographed copy of the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of \nIndependence, which I proudly carry with me. Quite frankly, if you read \nthe Constitution carefully, it gives the Congress the power to declare \nwar, to raise and support armies, and to provide and maintain a navy. \nThat is a responsibility we have, along with a unique role in the \nSenate of advising and consenting, particularly on treaties into which \nthe executive branch may enter.\n  The executive and legislative branches have to work together for \nforeign policy and defense policy in this country to actually work.\n  Next is economics and trade. One can hardly separate economics from \ndefense issues anymore. Economics and\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\ntrade are absolutely mixed up with our foreign policy and defense \nissues. Arms control is certainly an issue we need to confront.\n  Then there will be a final wrapup at the end of the year, probably in \nSeptember.\n  However, this is just a preliminary outline, and we want these \ndiscussions to be flexible enough to go wherever the dialog takes us--\nthat is the beauty of the Senate--and to include a wide array of \nviewpoints and illustrative subjects.\n  We encourage all our colleagues, of whatever mind on the topics under \nconsideration, to join in so we can have a real debate in this \nChamber, one in which we, indeed, ask each other hard questions, not in \norder to score partisan points and not in a particularly prearranged \nset of choreographed responses between like-minded individuals but to \nseek a better understanding of each other's thoughts.\n\n  That is exactly what we are after. We have determined that we will \nnot tie this dialog, this debate, to any particular administration, any \nparticular issue, any particular commitment, any particular budget \nitem, any particular legislative proposal. We hope for a freewheeling \ndialog that we think can benefit the country.\n  What we are hoping for is not to find final answers, for surely that \nwould probably be too ambitious an objective, but, rather, to bring \nthis body, which has a key constitutional role in the conduct of \nAmerican foreign and national security policy, to the same kind of \nserious examination of our foreign policy goals and assumptions as is \nnow underway among many of our leading foreign policy experts.\n  I was thinking about this dialog today. I was thinking, how does this \ndialog differ from what might be termed, shall we say, an ``academic \nundertaking''? There are many seminars. There are thousands of courses \non American foreign policy. There are numerous reviews of our defense \nstrategy going on in this country and around the world.\n  What makes this different? I think what makes this dialog different \nis that we are the ones who ultimately have to make the decision. This \nis not an academic exercise. I can remember voting for NATO expansion. \nIt was an incredible experience for me to know that by the raising of \nmy hand I could extend the security of NATO to three nations on the \nface of the globe that did not have that security before. That was an \nincredible experience for me.\n  So we do not participate just in some academic exercise here. We are \nthe leaders. We are the ones who have to ultimately bite the bullet and \nmake the decisions. Therefore, we need to think these things through. \nThat is the point.\n  One of my favorite lines from Clausewitz, the great German \ntheoretician on war, is: The leader must know the last step he is going \nto take before he takes the first step. That is the spirit of these \ndiscussions. At some point, and in some fashion, a bipartisan consensus \non America's global role must emerge because our national interest \ndemands it. It may not be as pure as in World War II when Senator \nVandenberg said: Politics stops at the water's edge, but certainly at \nsome point statecraft should overtake politics.\n  If these dialogs can assist that effort, in even a small way, they \nwill be time well spent. We hope our discussions will not be tinged \nwith particularly partisan or highly personalized considerations \nbecause the subject matter clearly transcends the policies and views of \nany one individual or certainly any one administration. The challenges \nwill be the same, no matter which party controls the White House next \nyear or which party controls the Congress.\n  With that, I yield to my good and distinguished friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Kansas. Let me say, in the time I have been in the \nSenate, I have found him to be a great source of reason and thoughtful \npronouncements on national security matters. He has a marvelous sense \nof humor, which will come out whether we want it to or not in the \ndialogs. It is my pleasure to turn the discussion over to my \ndistinguished friend and colleague, the great Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nPat Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. First, Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, for the opportunity to join \ntogether in what we both hope will be a successful endeavor.\n  As Senator Cleland stated, our objective is to try to achieve greater \nattention, focus, and mutual understanding in this body on America's \nglobal role and our vital national security interests and, if possible, \nbegin a process of building a bipartisan consensus on what America's \nrole should be in today's ever-changing, unsafe, and very unpredictable \nworld.\n  At the outset, I share Senator Cleland's sense of personal limitation \nin addressing this topic. As he has said, even the finest minds and \nmost expert American foreign policymakers have had considerable \ndifficulty in defining both what role the United States should play in \nthe so-called ``New World Disorder'' or reaching a consensus on what \ncriteria to use in defining our vital national interests.\n  Now having said that, I do not know of another Senator better suited \nto this effort than Max Cleland. He brings to this exchange of ideas an \noutstanding record of public service, of personal sacrifice, and of \ncourage and commitment. On the Senate Armed Services Committee, he has \ndemonstrated expertise and a whole lot of common sense in addressing \nthe quality of life issues so important to our men and women in uniform \nand, in turn, to our national security.\n  As members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we both share a \nkeen interest in foreign policy and national security. In my own case, \nI was privileged to serve as a member of the 1996 Commission on \nAmerica's National Interests. It was chaired by Ambassador Robert \nEllsworth, Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, and Rita Hauser, and was sponsored \nby the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, the \nNixon Center for Peace and Freedom, and the RAND Corporation. The \nCommission was composed of 15 members, including Senators John McCain, \nBob Graham, and Sam Nunn. In brief, our Commission focused on one core \nissue: What are U.S. national interests in today's world?\n  The conclusion in 1996, 4 years ago--and the Senator, I think, will \nsee some real similarities to some of our concerns as of today--in the \nwake of the cold war, the American public's interest in foreign policy \ndeclined sharply, and our political leaders have focused on domestic \nconcerns. America's foreign policy was adrift.\n  The defining feature of American engagement in the world since the \ncold war has been confusion, leading to missed opportunities and \nemerging threats.\n  The Commission went on to say there must be a regrounding of American \nforeign policy on the foundation of solid national interests. They went \non to conclude that there must be greater clarity regarding the \nhierarchy of American national interests and, with limited resources, a \nbetter understanding of what national interests are and, just as \nimportant, are not.\n  Then the Commission prioritized what we felt represented vital \nnational interests. It is interesting to note that the conflicts such \nas Bosnia and Kosovo did not make the priority cut at that time. That \nwas 4 years ago.\n  However, the real genesis for this forum that Senator Cleland and I \nhave tried to initiate resulted from frustrations over continued and \nincreasing U.S. military involvement and intervention both in the \nBalkans, the Persian Gulf and all around the world. Absent was what we \nconsider to be clear policy goals, not only from the executive, but \nalso from the Congress.\n  We found ourselves on the floor of the Senate, and in committee, \ncoming to the same conclusion reached by the esteemed and beloved \nlongtime chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nRichard Russell of Georgia, who said this, following the war in \nVietnam:\n\n       I shall never again knowingly support a policy of sending \n     American men in uniform overseas to fight in a war where \n     military victory has been ruled out and when they do not have \n     the full support of the American people.\n\n  Yet we continue to see our military becoming involved and taking part \nin peacekeeping missions, and other missions, where incremental \nescalation has led to wars of gradualism, where our vital national \ninterests are questionable, and where the unintended effects of our \ninvolvement have been counterproductive to national security.\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\n  We met in Senator Cleland's office and discussed at length the proper \nrole of the Senate in regard to the use of American troops. We talked \nabout the War Powers Act. We talked about the future of NATO. We talked \nabout our policy in the Persian Gulf. We noted, with considerable \nfrustration, that Senators seemed to be faced with votes, but votes \nthat were already foregone conclusions.\n  Few were willing to oppose funding for U.S. troops--not many in the \nSenate or the House will do that--yet many Senators had strong \nreservations and questions about U.S. policy, our military tactics, and \nthe lack of what some called the end game.\n  We instructed our staffs to research the War Powers Act and any other \npossible alternatives that would provide an outlet for future policy \ndecisions.\n  Senator Cleland persevered, and along with Senator Snowe of Maine, \nauthored and won passage of an amendment mandating that the \nadministration report to the Congress on any operation involving 500 or \nmore troops, and that report would include clear and distinct \nobjectives, as well as the end point of the operation.\n  In my own case, I authored and won approval of an amendment stating \nno funds could be used for deployment of troops in the Balkans until \nthe President reported to Congress detailing the reasons for the \ndeployment, number of military troops to be used, the mission and \nobjectives of the forces, the schedule and exit strategy, and the \nestimated costs involved. Again, these amendments were after the fact, \nbut they at least represented a bipartisan effort on the part of \nSenators who realized then and realize now that we simply must do a \nbetter job of working with the executive and searching for greater \nmutual understanding in the Senate in regard to foreign policy and our \nnational security interests.\n  In saying this, let me stress that this body and our country are \nfortunate to have the benefit of Senators with both expertise and \nexperience with regard to foreign relations and national security. That \ncertainly doesn't reside only with the two Senators here involved. When \nthey speak, we listen. But the problem is, they do not speak enough, \nand when they do, many do not listen.\n  The unfortunate conclusion I have reached is that too many Americans \nare not only uninterested in world events but uninformed as well. More \nand more today in the Congress, it seems to me that foreign policy, \ntrade, and national security issues are driven by ideology, insular and \nparochial interests, protectionism, and isolationist views. Both the \nadministration and the Congress seem to be lacking a foreign policy \nfocus, purpose, and constructive agenda.\n  The one notable exception has been the hearings held by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, \nwho has held extensive hearings on ``Lessons Learned'' with regard to \nKosovo. It is a paradox of enormous irony that the vision of knitting a \nmultiethnic society and democracy out of century-old hatreds in Kosovo \nis in deep trouble. The danger of Kosovo is the fact that it may become \nanother Somalia. These hearings have attracted little more than a blip \non the public radar screen and little, if any, commentary or debate in \nthe Senate.\n  So as Senator Cleland has pointed out, over the course of the coming \nyear he and I will engage in a series of floor dialogues relating to \nthe general direction of U.S. foreign and national security policy in \nthe 21st century. We begin today by discussing the framework for the \nU.S. global role. In the following months, as the Senator has said, we \nwill discuss the defining national interests, deployment of U.S. \nforces, the role of multilateral organizations, the role of the \nExecutive, Congress and the public, and the role of trade, economics, \nand arms control. As Senator Cleland has stressed, this is just an \noutline.\n  We invite all Senators to engage in this series. The concept is one \nof a forum, a dialogue, that will and should include a wide variety of \nviewpoints. For instance, given the flashpoint situation today in \nKosovo, with about 5,000 to 6,000 American troops at risk--and we may \nbe calling in the Marines. I believe that topic certainly demands \nattention and discussion, however, in a different and separate forum. \nThere should be some discussion and consideration in the Senate in that \nregard.\n  As Senator Cleland has pointed out, we all know that foreign policy \nand national security are legitimate concerns that should be addressed \nin the Presidential and congressional campaigns; at least I hope they \nare addressed. But beyond this election year, the Senate will again be \nfaced with our constitutional responsibilities in shaping this Nation's \nrole in global affairs, national security, international stability, and \npeace. Simply put: Our national interest depends on reaching a \nbipartisan consensus. My colleague and I both hope this forum will \ncontribute to achieving that goal and, in doing so, also contribute to \ngreater public support and understanding.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding and understand he has some \nadditional remarks, as I do following his remarks.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. We appreciate working with him on \nthis quite challenging and daunting task, but it is worth doing. It is \nan honor to be with him today and work with him. One of my key staff \npeople, Mr. Bill Johnston, has done a momentous job of research for the \nspeeches, the addresses, the facts, the figures, and the quotes I will \nbe using in this dialog. I want to make sure he gets proper credit at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, I will now set the stage for today's discussion by \nsketching a brief outline of the evolution of the main currents of U.S. \nforeign policy and, then, by providing a short look at what some \nleading voices are currently proposing for how America should make its \nway in the post-cold-war world.\n  As in any transition period, we are feeling our way for the \nappropriate strategy and policies with which to maintain and enhance \nour national security interests in this period of a ``new world \ndisorder.'' As the debates on NATO enlargement, Kosovo and the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty revealed, those leading voices on \nAmerican foreign policy currently offer divided counsel on this issue. \nIt is obvious that no clear consensus has yet formed as to America's \npost-cold-war strategy, and that, or course, is what we are looking to \naddress in these discussions.\n  Until the 20th century, it would be fair to sum up our general \nphilosophy on foreign policy as an attempt to continue to follow \nPresident Washington's recommended approach contained in his Farewell \nAddress of September 17, 1796:\n\n       Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. \n     Cultivate peace and harmony with all. . . . The Nation which \n     indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual \n     fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \n     animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient \n     to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. . . . Steer \n     clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign \n     world. . . . There can be no greater error than to expect or \n     calculate upon real flavors from nation to nation.\n\n  Then Secretary of State John Quincy Adams further elaborated on this \napproach when he proclaimed in 1821 that:\n\n       Whenever the standard of freedom and independence has been \n     or shall be unfurled, there will her [America's] heart, her \n     benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad, in \n     search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the \n     freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and \n     vindicator only of her own.\n\n  As Henry Kissinger, a modern day commentator, has put it, this \npolicy, augmented by the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 which sought to \nprevent European interference in the Western Hemisphere, made imminent \ngood sense until early in the 1900s:\n\n       In the early years of the Republic, American foreign policy \n     was in fact a sophisticated reflection of the American \n     national interest, which was, simply, to fortify the new \n     nation's independence. . . . Until the turn of the twentieth \n     century, American foreign policy was basically quite simple: \n     to fulfill the country's manifest destiny, and to remain free \n     of entanglements overseas. America favored democratic \n     governments whenever possible, but abjured action to \n     vindicate its preferences. . . . Until early this century, \n     the isolationist tendency prevailed in American foreign \n     policy. Then two factors projected America into world \n     affairs: its rapidly expanding power and the gradual collapse \n     of the international system centered on Europe.\n\n  Woodrow Wilson took this increased American power and the shattered \nEuropean order, added to it the traditional American view of our \nexceptional role in the world and developed\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\nwhat has become the dominant approach of modern American foreign \npolicy-making. As he said in 1915:\n\n       We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen \n     lines of national development. We do more than that. We \n     demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm \n     for individual liberty and free national development to the \n     incidents and movements of affairs which affect only \n     ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries \n     to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right.\n\n  Thus, for the first time in American history, the notion that it was \nour right and our duty to . . . wherever they might arise was \nestablished. While the details have changed from time to time, with \nsome variation in the degree of enthusiasm for foreign interventions, \nthis is still today the foundation in defining our role in the world. \nIt was elaborated somewhat in the famous 1947 Foreign Affairs article \npenned by ``X''--later disclosed to be George Kennan--which guided our \nultimately successful conduct of the cold war by urging, ``a policy of \nfirm containment, designed to confront the Russians with unalterable \ncounterforce at every point where they show signs of encroaching upon \nthe interests of a peaceful and stable world.''\n  To be sure, there has rarely been a time in American history when all \nvoices have been united behind the dominant approach to the U.S. global \nrole. Many in this body, including myself, participated in one way or \nanother in the national turmoil over the application of the containment \npolicy in Southeast Asia, in a place called Vietnam. But, while there \nwas vigorous debate on the advisability of specific implementations of \nWilsonian ``idealism'' there has never been a serious challenge since \nthe Second World War to what might be called an ``internationalist \ninterventionist'' model for the United States in its national security \npolicies.\n  Yet, as we begin the year 2000, the world has changed in significant \nways from the one we have known since World War II. The Soviet Union is \nno more. The Communists did not, in the end, bury us, but with a few \nnotable exceptions who currently survive in China, Cuba, Vietnam, and \nNorth Korea, it is they who have been buried by historical \ninevitability. Again, to quote, Dr. Kissinger:\n\n       The end of the Cold War produced an even greater temptation \n     to recast the international environment in America's image. \n     Wilson had been constrained by isolationism at home, and \n     Truman had come up against Stalinist expansionism. In the \n     post-Cold War world, the United States is the only remaining \n     superpower with the capacity to intervene in every part of \n     the globe. Yet power has become more diffuse and the issues \n     to which military force is relevant have diminished. Victory \n     in the Cold War has propelled America into a world which \n     bears many similarities to the European state system of the \n     eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and to practices which \n     American statesmen and thinkers have consistently questioned. \n     The absence of both an overriding ideological or strategic \n     threat frees nations to pursue foreign policies based \n     increasingly on their immediate national interest.\n\n  Just as the very different international environment facing America \nat the start of the 20th century--with growing American strength \naccompanying a collapse of the European order--occasioned the need for \na fundamental reassessment of the U.S. place in the world, so the end \nof the 20th century--with an end to the bipolar cold war and the \nemergence of multiple, if not yet super at least major, powers--\nnecessitates another thoroughgoing review and evaluation of where we \nare and where we should be headed.\n  And if one has been reading the foreign policy journals and white \npapers during the last few years, one finds a vigorous and thoughtful \ndebate underway on just such questions. I'd like to take just a few \nminutes to provide the Senate with a small bit of the flavor of this \ndialog among American foreign policy commentators.\n  In a 1995 article in Foreign Affairs magazine, Richard Haass of the \nBrookings Institute provided I think a useful starting point for our \nconsideration by separating the debate on America's global role into \ntwo parts: the priorities or ends of American policy, and the \napproaches or means currently available to achieve those ends. As \npossible priorities, he lists Wilsonian idealism with its emphasis on \npromotion of democratic values, economism which--as the name suggests--\ngives primacy to economic considerations, realism which is often \nassociated with the traditional diplomatic concepts of balance of power \nand international equilibrium, humanitarianism which focuses more on \nalleviating the plight of individuals, and minimalism which could be \nthought of as ``neo-isolationism'' but accepts the need for selected \nand limited U.S. engagement in global affairs. On the side of means, \nHaass lists unilateralism which provides the dominant country--the \nUnited States--with largely unfettered freedom of action in pursuit of \nits goals, neo-internationalism or ``assertive multilateralism'' which \nrelies on multilateral organizations and approaches to international \nproblem-solving, and regionalism which he defines as U.S. leadership \nwithin alliances and coalitions.\n\n  Writing in the Spring 1996 issue of Strategic Review, Naval \nPostgraduate School Professor of National Security Affairs Edward A. \nOlsen presented a view which might be termed as minimalism when he \nadvocated a return to our pre-World War II approach which he \ncharacterized as one of ``abstention, benign neglect, and non-\ninterventionism within a policy of highly selective engagement.'' \nProfessor Olsen distinguished his proposed policy of disengagement and \nnon-intervention--which would be marked by less military intervention, \nless foreign aid, and fewer international entanglements--from \nisolationism because his approach would allow the U.S. ``strategic \nindependence'' to determine for itself, independent of other countries \nor multilateral organizations, when and how to engage abroad.\n  In almost direct opposition to the Olsen prescription, with goals \nakin to Wilsonian idealism and employing a largely unilateralist \napproach, William Kristol and Robert Kagan used a summer 1996 edition \nof Foreign Affairs to argue for a U.S. role of benevolent global \nhegemony in the belief that, ``American principles around the world can \nbe sustained only by the continuing exertion of American influence,'' \nincluding foreign aid, diplomacy, and when necessary military \nintervention.\n  In his 1994 book, entitled Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger, provides a \ncontemporary, updated version of the realist balance of power view:\n\n       America's dominant task is to strike a balance between the \n     twin temptations inherent in its exceptionalism: the notion \n     that America must remedy every wrong and stabilize every \n     dislocation, and the latent instinct to withdraw into itself. \n     . . . A country with America's idealistic tradition cannot \n     base its policy on the balance of power as the sole criterion \n     for a new world order. But is must learn that equilibrium is \n     a fundamental precondition for the pursuit of its historic \n     goals.\n\n  A quote that comes to mind for me is when President Kennedy said, \n``There is not necessarily an American solution for every problem in \nthe world.''\n  I think that is the real issue. Former Congressman Stephen Solarz \nespoused the humaniarianism goal in the Winter 2000 edition of \nBlueprint Magazine:\n\n       Some, of course, will object to humanitarian intervention \n     as a violation of the principle of sovereignty, which \n     precludes military interference in the internal affairs of \n     other nations. . . . Yet it is clear today that the non-\n     interference doctrine no longer trumps all other \n     considerations. This was obvious when the United Nations \n     sanctioned interventions during the 1990s in Northern Iraq, \n     Somalia, and Haiti. Where crimes against humanity or genocide \n     are involved, the doctrine of humanitarian intervention is \n     increasingly accepted as a justification for violating the \n     otherwise inviolable borders of sovereign states.\n\n  A particular variant of the regionalism approach is contained within \nSamuel P. Huntington's 1996 work, The Clash of Civilizations: Remaking \nof World Order.\n  I know that is a favorite of the good Senator from Kansas.\n\n       In the aftermath of the cold war the United States became \n     consumed with massive debates over the proper course of \n     American foreign policy. In this era, however, the United \n     States can neither dominate nor escape the world. Neither \n     internationalism nor isolationism, neither multilateralism \n     nor unilateralism, will best serve its interests. Those will \n     best be advanced by eschewing these opposing extremes and \n     instead adopting an Atlanticist policy of close cooperation \n     with its European partners to protect and advance the \n     interests and values of the unique civilization they share.\n\n  These are just a very few of the many ``think pieces'' which have \nbeen coming\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\nout of the American foreign policy community since the end of the cold \nwar. Even this brief glimpse reveals a wide divergence in expert \nopinions on the preferred priorities and approaches for post-cold-war \nU.S. global engagement. To further evaluate the current debate among \nindividuals with strongly held views on where we should be headed I \nasked the outstanding Congressional Research Service to provide me with \na ``review of the literature'' on U.S. global role options.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this CRS document be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           A Review of Literature on U.S. Global Role Options\n\n       1. Abshire, David M. ``U.S. Global Policy: Toward an Agile \n     Strategy.'' Washington Quarterly, v. 19, spring 1996: 41-61.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, which was marked by the U.S. \n     promotion of a policy of containment, the U.S. and other \n     powers have entered a strategic interregnum (44) in which \n     foreign policy strategies have not been fully defined. \n     Abshire states that the U.S. should strive toward a policy of \n     agility: ``an agile strategy for the use of power and the \n     achievement of peace'' (41) which is characterized by \n     flexibility in action and long-range goals and is guided by \n     vital national interests. This strategy is proactive rather \n     than reactive and aims to ``return to classical formulations \n     of the proper uses of power to influence the behavior of U.S. \n     opponents, and indeed allies'' (46). Realism (49) forms the \n     foundation of a strategy of agility, acknowledging that \n     military conflict and economic competition are features of \n     world affairs. At the same time, this strategy recognizes the \n     importance of idealism (50) and the role U.S. democratic \n     ideals should play in international relations. Specifically, \n     this strategy represents a balance between short-term realism \n     and long-term idealism (48): In the short run, the U.S. \n     should defend its interests from immediate threats; in the \n     long run the U.S. should strive to promote U.S. ideals such \n     as democracy and free trade. This policy is opposed to \n     isolationism (51), but expects U.S. leaders to set clear \n     boundaries in U.S. foreign policy.\n       2. Albright, Madeleine K. ``The Testing of American Foreign \n     Policy.'' Foreign Affairs, v. 77, Nov.-Dec. 1998: 50-64.\n       Albright describes a four-part strategy for U.S. foreign \n     policy. The U.S. should encourage continuing relations with \n     other leading nations (51), aid transitional states in \n     playing a larger role in the international system (52), help \n     weaker states that are trying to overcome economic and \n     political problems (52), and ward off threats that affect \n     world security (51-53). This strategy is driven by vision and \n     pragmatism: U.S. foreign policy should incorporate a vision \n     of future policy concerns and should be shaped by pragmatic \n     approaches to foreign policy issues (54-59). The will and \n     resources to carry out policy are essential to implementing \n     this strategy (59-62). In the final analysis, U.S. foreign \n     policy is tested by ``how well our actions measure up to our \n     ideals . . . we want our foreign policy to reflect our status \n     as the globe's leading champion of freedom'' (63).\n       3. Arbatov, Georgi. ``Eurasia Letter: A New Cold War?'' \n     Foreign Policy, no. 95, summer 1994: 90-103.\n       The institutions of the West have supported Russian plans \n     for reform despite the plans' shortcomings and disastrous \n     results. Russia has not made progress toward building \n     democracy, and the West is partly responsible for Russia's \n     current woes. The West's role in supporting economic policies \n     unsuitable for Russia has spurred new distrust of the West \n     and notions of a Western conspiracy to introduce policies \n     that will harm the Russian economy (91-96). The West should \n     take part in stopping human rights violations against ethnic \n     Russians living in former Soviet republics (98). The U.S. \n     must recognize that Russia should play an important role in \n     international affairs (102). Both countries are responsible \n     for Russia's future and should seek cooperation (103).\n       4. Blumenthal, Sidney. ``The Return of the Repressed Anti-\n     Internationalism and the American Right.'' World Policy \n     Journal, v. 12, fall 1995: 1-13.\n       Isolationism has been revived in a new form as an \n     ``inchoate anti-internationalism'' (2) on the part of the \n     Republican Right. This new anti-internationalism is marked by \n     vigorous opposition to the role of the United Nations and is \n     closely related to growing anti-government and xenophobic \n     sentiments. Although isolationist views were espoused by \n     members of both the Right and the Left in pre-World War II \n     America, by the end of the war, isolationism had become \n     strictly a cause of the Right and was combined with its \n     anticommunist movement (4-5). Advocates of this policy viewed \n     containment as a poor compromise and advocated a unilateral \n     military approach to Cold War threats. Unilateralism (6) \n     remained an important cornerstone of this policy up to \n     Reagan's terms in office, although Reagan eventually \n     disillusioned supporters with his policy of engagement with \n     Gorbachev. George Bush was criticized for his emphasis on \n     foreign affairs. As Clinton's first term in office \n     progressed, he paid more heed to anti-internationlism and \n     initiated policies to limit the U.S. role in multilateral \n     peacekeeping (9). The Republican platform, Contract with \n     America, advanced several anti-international principles, and \n     ``[f]or the first time since the inception of the Cold War, \n     tenets of anti-internationalism have become official dogma of \n     the Republican Party'' (10). Republicans who oppose anti-\n     internationalism have not challenged this position within \n     their party. Idealist and realist approaches (11) to foreign \n     policy will be affected by this anti-internationalism if it \n     continues to flourish. Blumenthal identifies several versions \n     of realism. Augmented realism, or realism plus, (11) sees \n     conviction as a driving force in obtaining a leadership role. \n     Washington realism (11) focuses on international affairs at \n     the expense of domestic ones. Republican realism fails ``to \n     explain how internationalism can coexist with a social policy \n     that radically widens class, racial, and gender divisions . . \n     .'' (11).\n       5. Calleo, David P. ``A New Era of Overstretch? American \n     Policy in Europe and Asia.'' World Policy Journal, v. 15, \n     spring 1998: 11-29.\n       Clinton downplayed foreign policy when elected in 1992 and \n     in his first term ``quietly'' took on ``a sort of \n     devolutionist foreign policy'' (12-13). Clinton encouraged \n     the Europeanization of NATO and seemed to promote a foreign \n     policy in which the U.S. would serve as a balancing power in \n     a multipolar arena and would not aspire to Bush's vision of \n     the U.S. as the only superpower in a unipolar world (13). \n     Muted elements of Wilsonianism could be detected in some \n     Clinton policies to ``[prod] the world toward universal \n     democracy'' (13). Clinton began to take a more active role in \n     foreign policy in his second term and initiated efforts to \n     reassert American hegemony in NATO (14). U.S. interests in \n     NATO expansion suggest that the U.S. is adopting a maximalist \n     stance (16) and is ready to take a hegemonic role in Europe. \n     The U.S. has continued its long-standing role as a strong \n     presence in Asia. Calleo describes three proposed models for \n     a future security structure in Asia--``China the regional \n     hegemon, America the region's hegemonic balancer, and a \n     multipolar regional balance made up of China, India, Japan, \n     Russia, and the United States'' (19).\n       6. DeSantis, Hugh. ``Mutualism: An American Strategy for \n     the Next Century.'' World Policy Journal, v. 15, winter 1998-\n     99: 41-52.\n       DeSantis describes the views of various foreign affairs \n     professionals: Liberal-internationalists, or neo-Wilsonians, \n     expect the value systems of various countries to move toward \n     each other; realists promote persuading other powers to \n     support U.S. policies; American nationalists, or neo-\n     Reaganites, promote a unilateral policy in which the U.S. \n     strives to promote an ``enlightened empire;'' neo-\n     isolationsists, including America Firsters, libertarians, \n     and pacifists, oppose U.S. involvement abroad (41). \n     DeSantis says that these seemingly different views are all \n     versions of American exceptionalism, the myth that the \n     U.S. is the natural model for other countries and should \n     be the leader of an unpredictable world (41-42). He \n     promotes as an alternative a ``non-American centered \n     framework'' called mutualism: ``an interest-based rather \n     than value-driven concept of international relations'' \n     (44) that avoids hegemony. Economies will be \n     interdependent and national and regional communities will \n     be emphasized in order to curb violent frustrations of \n     peoples ``marginalized by the process of globalization'' \n     (47). A cornerstone of mutualism is cultural tolerance and \n     the recognition that the American way is not the only way \n     to a free and harmonious society (48). Security operations \n     must be shared in order to avoid dependence on the U.S., \n     and Americans must ``abandon their triumphalism'' and \n     recognize the need for cooperation with other peoples \n     (51).\n       7. Diamond, Larry. ``Why the United States Must Remain \n     Engaged: Beyond the Unipolar Movement.'' Orbis, v. 40, summer \n     1996: 405-413.\n       The end of the Cold War has forced the U.S. to reexamine \n     its role in the world, and a new trend in favor of \n     isolationism has emerged. This neo-isolationism takes many \n     forms. Some of its supporters advocate free trade and foreign \n     aid while others reject any type of foreign involvement. \n     Other neo-isolationists want the U.S. to become ``a normal \n     nation in normal times'' (406). Despite variations on this \n     theme, all neo-isolationists call for the end of America's \n     role as a superpower. Scholar Eric Nordlinger, in his book \n     Isolationism Reconfigured: American Foreign Policy for a New \n     Century (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995) has \n     articulated a new type of neo-isolationism that calls for \n     varying degrees of U.S. involvement in foreign affairs and \n     recognizes the usefulness of multilateral cooperation. \n     Nordlinger's ``liberal isolationism'' provides a thoughtful \n     approach to foreign policy but is problematic. He mistakenly \n     believes that the U.S. is insulated from outside threats; \n     that U.S. allies could compensate militarily for the loss of \n     a U.S. military presence abroad; that it is better to deal \n     with conflicts as they arise rather than try to predict \n     future conflicts; and that the U.S. would be able to defend \n     itself in the unlikely scenario of a threat to U.S. \n     interests. In fact, spillover from faraway conflicts prevents \n     true insulation; our allies would have difficulties meeting \n     military challenges without U.S. aid and might be forced into \n     bad compromises due to lack of power; the benefits of \n     predicting and deterring conflict can exceed the cost; and, \n     were the U.S. to become as isolationist as Nordlinger \n     proposes, it is unlikely it would be prepared to meet true\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\n     threats to security (407-411). The best strategy for the next \n     century is liberal internationalism (413).\n       8. Gilman, Benjamin A. ``A Pacific Charter: A Blueprint for \n     U.S. policy in the Pacific in the 21st Century.'' Washington \n     Heritage Foundation, 1997 (Heritage Lecture no. 579).\n       Asia will be the most important region to the U.S. in the \n     future, and the U.S. has the greatest power to influence \n     Asian affairs. As in the past, U.S. interests in Asia are: \n     ``regional stability; access to markets; and freedom of the \n     seas,'' (3) and, more specifically, ``the promotion of \n     democracy and the rule of law; human and religious rights; \n     market economies; and regional security for all'' (11). \n     Although the U.S. is ``responsible for the peace and much of \n     the prosperity'' (3) of post-WWII Asia, the U.S. role in Asia \n     is being challenged. The Clinton administration, through base \n     closings, has sent an ambiguous message to Asia, and most \n     Asian nations, which desire a strong U.S. presence in the \n     region, fear the U.S. will retreat to isolationism. The U.S. \n     must maintain a strong role in Asia and thwart the emergence \n     of a regional hegemon that could threaten Asian security. The \n     Clinton administration does not have a good policy to meet \n     these needs. Gilman proposes a ``Pacific Charter'' (7) to \n     outline the U.S. role in Asia. The U.S. must maintain strong \n     relations with Japan, increase relations with India, and curb \n     threats from China.\n       9. Haass, Richard N. ``Paradigm Lost.'' Foreign Affairs, v. \n     74, Jan.-Feb. 1995: 43-58.\n       The post-Cold War world is in a period of ``international \n     deregulation,'' marked by ``new players, new capabilities, \n     and new alignments'' but lacking ``new rules'' (43). Clinton \n     has advocated a new foreign policy centered around \n     international reregulation (44) and characterized by the \n     expansion of market democracies, but this strategy serves \n     more as an ideal than as pragmatic policy. In fact, no one \n     doctrine can encompass every aspect of foreign policy, but \n     the U.S. should strive toward a foreign policy ``that is \n     clear about ends--America's purposes and priorities--as well \n     as about means--America's relationship with and approach to \n     the world'' (45). Haass critiques five approaches to foreign \n     policy that are evident in the current administration. \n     Wilsonian promotion of democratic values is a ``luxury'' that \n     should not take precedence over other interests, such as \n     promoting security in the Middle East, even with non-\n     democratic allies (46). Economism places undue emphasis on \n     the primacy of economics and can be similar to \n     neomercantilism (47). Realism correctly acknowledges threats \n     to the U.S. but neglects the ``internal evolution of \n     societies'' (48). Humanitarianism, which is almost ``post-\n     ideological'' downplays immediate concerns and threats (49). \n     Minimalism ignores factors that affect U.S. security and \n     could lead to long-term problems that greatly threaten U.S. \n     interests (49). Haass describes three types of means to U.S. \n     foreign policy. Unilateralism allows the dominant country \n     freedom of action, but can be imitated and abused by other \n     powers and can break down international order (50). Neo-\n     internationalism, also known as ``assertive \n     multilateralism,'' distributes power and responsibility, but \n     this power may clash with U.S. foreign policy interests (51). \n     U.S. leadership would position the U.S. as the leader of \n     alliances and coalitions, but could lead to problematic \n     compromises (52). Clinton has incorporated each mean and end \n     in some form, resulting in an inconsistent foreign policy. \n     Haass promotes ``augmented realism,'' or ``realism plus,'' \n     which would concentrate on threats to security but would be \n     broader than traditional realism. Haass states that U.S. \n     leadership is the most viable means to meet this form of \n     realism (55-56).\n       10. Haass, Richard N. ``What to do with American Primacy.'' \n     Foreign Affairs, v. 78, Sept.-Oct. 1999: 37-49.\n       U.S. foreign policy should promote multipolarity, \n     ``characterized by cooperation and concert rather than \n     competition and conflict'' (38). Post-Cold War society will \n     have four cornerstones: ``using less military force to \n     resolve disputes between states, reducing the number of \n     weapons of mass destruction and the number of states and \n     other groups possessing such weapons, accepting a limited \n     doctrine of humanitarian intervention based on a recognition \n     that people--and not just states--enjoy rights, and economic \n     openness'' (39). The U.S. should maintain its role as the \n     only superpower and should model itself after nineteenth-\n     century Great Britain (41). The U.S. should persuade other \n     powers through consultations rather than negotiations (42-\n     43). Regionalism, which involves regional cooperation, would \n     serve as a good balance between the extremes of perfect \n     internationalism and unilateralism (44), but is \n     problematic because many regions do not agree on the \n     definition of regional order. An American world system \n     involves external influences, but the U.S. must play an \n     active and discriminating role in deciding when \n     humanitarian intervention is necessary. Finally, America \n     must overcome its indifference to foreign affairs (49).\n       11. Hillen, John. ``Superpowers Don't Do Windows.'' Orbis, \n     v. 41, spring 1997: 241-257.\n       The U.S. should encourage a new security system which \n     recognizes the differing interests and military capabilities \n     of different countries and is founded on the principle that \n     the U.S., as the superpower, does not do the little jobs that \n     distract it from its larger role. Because U.S. resources are \n     limited, the U.S. should concentrate on broad security issues \n     and leave regional problems to its allies who will serve the \n     roles of ``local doctor and cop'' (243). The downsizing of \n     the U.S. military places strains on the U.S. military when it \n     acts in regional disputes, such as the Bosnia conflict, and \n     few post-Cold War conflicts have truly required heavy U.S. \n     involvement. The U.S. role in Europe, East Asia, the Middle \n     East, the Persian Gulf, and South America is one of \n     collective defense, which focuses on cooperative efforts to \n     ``defend against threats to the balance of power in a \n     region,'' rather than one of collective security, which \n     responds to a broad range of issues not limited to immediate \n     threats (251). In alliances with European countries, the U.S. \n     must preserve its role as a leader and needs to readjust the \n     division of labor in organizations such as NATO. The U.S. \n     should, however, be cautious in increasing Japan's \n     responsibilities in Asia. Within the Middle East, ``de facto \n     alliances'' serve the U.S. better than ``de jure alliances'' \n     that exist with European countries (255). No other regions \n     demand a U.S. presence.\n       12. Huntington, Samuel P. ``The Erosion of American \n     National Interests.'' Foreign Affairs, v. 76, Sept.-Oct. \n     1997: 28-49.\n       American identity has been defined by culture and creed, \n     ideals such as liberty, constitutionalism, limited \n     government, and private enterprise. This identity has been \n     constructed vis-a-vis a foreign ``other,'' which for much of \n     this century has been communism. The end of the Cold War will \n     affect American identity and has led the U.S. ``not to find \n     the power to serve American purposes but rather to find \n     purposes for the use of American power'' (35). Ethnic and \n     commercial interests now overshadow national interests in \n     shaping foreign policy. ``Commercial diplomacy'' (37) has \n     become a cornerstone of Clinton's foreign policy. Ethnic \n     groups now play a major role in shaping U.S. international \n     involvement; the drive for multiculturalism and an increase \n     in new immigrant groups who have resisted assimilation have \n     influenced the actions of the U.S. government toward \n     immigrants' native countries. The combined influence of \n     commercial and ethnic interests has led to a \n     ``domesticization of foreign policy'' (40). America's \n     strength is reflected in military, economic, ideological, \n     technological and cultural spheres, but America is \n     ineffective in influencing other countries (42-43). This \n     paradox is partly the result of a gap between American \n     resources and governmental power. The nature of American \n     power has changed. Immediately after WW II America directly \n     expanded its influence to other parts of the world. From the \n     1970s, U.S. power has shifted to ``the power to attract'' \n     (44), as illustrated by the power of the U.S. to raise money \n     from other countries for the Persian Gulf War and a shift \n     toward widescale lobbying by foreign governments. U.S foreign \n     policy, with its attention to special interests, is turning \n     into a policy of particularism. A policy of restraint (48), \n     which would limit attention to special interests, would \n     better position the U.S. to ``[assume] a more positive role \n     in the future . . . and to pursue national purposes'' \n     supported by the American population (49).\n       13. Hutchings, Robert L. ``Rediscovering `The National \n     Interest' in American Foreign Policy.'' Washington, Woodrow \n     Wilson International Center for Scholars, 1996.\n       The end of the Cold War has left the U.S. struggling to \n     redefine its global role. Encompassing principles like \n     ``democratic enlargement'' and ``new world order'' fail to \n     fully address U.S. foreign policy needs; ``new world order,'' \n     for example, has been ambiguous on the relationship between \n     principles and interests and has been constantly redefined \n     and reformulated (2). Foreign policy should not pit \n     principles against interests. Principles alone fail to solve \n     foreign policy problems. Interest-based policies should be \n     tied to U.S. capabilities (2-3). The U.S. placed top priority \n     on Eastern Europe in relations with Moscow and thus helped \n     contribute to ``an international environment conducive to'' \n     the success of Eastern European democracy movements (4). The \n     U.S. recognized the importance of German affairs to European \n     security. In other parts of Europe, the U.S. ``continued to \n     cling instinctively to a dominant role that [it was] no \n     longer ready to play and so found it difficult to cede \n     leadership gracefully to the Europeans'' (5). These \n     approaches to Western and Eastern Europe together helped \n     bring about the end of the Cold War, but the U.S. failed to \n     develop suitable policies to support post-Communist \n     countries. The Cold War should teach the U.S. that a stable \n     Europe, more than a stable Asia, is vital to U.S. security, \n     and U.S. leadership is necessary for European unity (6-7). A \n     stable Eastern Europe is most vital for a stable Europe. The \n     U.S. should not assume responsibility for Russian reform; the \n     task should fall into Russian hands (8). The U.S. should \n     ``invite'' Russia into the international arena and encourage \n     Russia to pursue peace (9).\n       14. Joffe, Josef. ``How America Does It.'' Foreign Affairs, \n     v. 76, Sept.-Oct. 1997: 13-27.\n       No alliance in history has persisted long past victory, and \n     yet the U.S. continues to build its alliance system even \n     after the end of the Cold War. Organizations like the EU \n     could challenge U.S. power, and Russia, China, and France \n     have paid lip service to ending U.S. hegemony, but allies of \n     the U.S. have yet to truly turn against America. The reason \n     for ``America's unchallenged primacy'' lies in the uniqueness \n     of America (16). The U.S. ``irks and domineers, but it does \n     not conquer'' (16). During WWI and WWII, the U.S., like \n     Imperial Britain, maintained a strategy of checking \n     hegemonies. More recently, U.S. policy has come to resemble \n     the\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\n     policies of Bismarck's Germany; the U.S. has built a ``hub \n     and spoke'' relationship with other countries in which \n     ``association with the hub [Washington] is more important to \n     them than are their ties to one another'' (21). As a result, \n     other countries cannot form old-style alliances against the \n     U.S. (24). The U.S. bears a great deal of responsibility in \n     upholding security for other countries, but this benefits and \n     provides for America's own security (27).\n       15. Kagan, Robert. ``The Benevolent Empire.'' Foreign \n     Policy, no. 111, summer 1998: 24-34.\n       Although foreign countries complain about U.S. global \n     leadership, many countries nonetheless have grown to rely on \n     American dominance. Although European and other nations call \n     for ``multipolarity,'' U.S. dominance in fact provides the \n     best option for global affairs (26). U.S. hegemony is a \n     benevolent hegemony (26). The U.S. has risked its own safety \n     for the safety of other countries, and Americans have \n     believed since WWII that ``their own well-being depends \n     fundamentally on the well-being of others'' (28). It is in \n     the best interest of the nations that benefit from this \n     benevolent hegemony to support rather than criticize U.S. \n     power. Advocates of multipolarity, and the similar \n     balance-of-power theory of global parliamentarianism, or \n     world federalism (30), fail to recognize that no other \n     country would be willing to truly take on the \n     responsibilities and sacrifices multipolarity entails. \n     Countries like France and Russia have not adopted measures \n     that would enable them to shoulder the burdens of \n     multipolarity; what these countries truly want is an \n     ``honorary multipolarity'' (32): ``the pretense of equal \n     partnership in a multipolar world without the price or \n     responsibility that equal partnership requires'' (32). The \n     growth of neo-isolationism in the U.S. satisfies European \n     calls for less U.S. involvement in international affairs, \n     but the U.S. must continue to recognize the ultimate \n     importance of its dominance (34).\n       16. Kennan, George F. ``On American Principles.'' Foreign \n     Affairs, v. 74, Mar.-Apr. 1995: 116-126.\n       Kennan defines a principle as a ``general rule of conduct \n     by which a given country chooses to abide in the conduct of \n     its relations with other countries'' (118). This principle \n     should provide a framework for policy and, with special \n     exceptions, should be ``automatically applied'' (119). A \n     principle should be set forth by a political leader who can \n     reflect the views of the population he represents. Despite \n     wide differences among Americans, most Americans agree on \n     certain ideals. In choosing when to intervene in other \n     countries' affairs, the U.S. should respond only to events \n     that truly threaten U.S. interests (124). U.S. policy must \n     embody John Adams' principle of foreign policy that the best \n     way to help other countries is through ``the benign sympathy \n     of our example'' (125) rather than through direct \n     intervention.\n       17. Kennedy, Paul. ``The Next American Century?'' World \n     Policy Journal, v. 16, spring 1999: 52-58.\n       For much of the early twentieth century, America looked \n     inward in its foreign policy. By the end of WWII, however, \n     America's role as the world's leader was clear; the twentieth \n     century had become the American century. Later, the Cold War \n     suggested that world affairs were dominated by a bipolar \n     system of Russian and American power, and anti-Americanism \n     abroad and domestic crises at home lent further doubts to the \n     primacy of America. The appearance of an ``America in \n     relative decline,'' however, was not fully accurate (55). The \n     U.S. held many advantages over a Soviet Union constantly \n     plagued with problems, and despite domestic difficulties, the \n     U.S. demonstrated its ability to renew its economic power in \n     the 1980s. The U.S. is influential in its ``soft power'' \n     (American culture) and ``hard power'' (military resources) \n     (56), and is a leader in finance and technology. These \n     advantages place America ``in a relatively more favorable \n     position in the world than at any time since the 1940s'' \n     (56). It is uncertain, however, whether the U.S. will sustain \n     its number-one position throughout the 21st century. The \n     spread of American influence could lead to a backlash against \n     the U.S., and other nations have the potential to develop \n     into superpowers.\n       18. Khalilzad, Zalmay. ``Losing the Moment? The United \n     States and the World After the Cold War.'' Washington \n     Quarterly, v. 18, spring 1995: 87-107.\n       The U.S. must develop a foreign policy for the post-Cold \n     War world in order to maintain its strength. Secretary of \n     Defense Dick Cheney's ``Regional Defense Strategy,'' (88) \n     which focused on strengthening alliances, preventing the rise \n     of regional hegemons, and eliminating sources of instability, \n     never took root under the Bush administration. Clinton \n     Administration foreign policy, outlined in National Security \n     Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement, (88) stresses similar \n     points but also emphasizes peacekeeping efforts, economic \n     issues, and the expansion of democracy. But the Clinton \n     strategy fails to prioritize foreign policy issues, and \n     Clinton's handling of foreign affairs has been controversial. \n     Possible alternatives for foreign policy are neo-isolationism \n     (89-91), a return to multipolarity (91-94), and global \n     leadership (94-106). Although neo-isolationism offers short-\n     term benefits, in the long term it is likely to lead to power \n     struggles and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A \n     return to multipolarity and balance of power would allow the \n     U.S. to reduce defense spending and concentrate on economic \n     concerns, but depends on other major powers ``[behaving] as \n     they should under the logic of a balance of power framework'' \n     (93). Global leadership, in which the U.S. would maintain its \n     position and prevent the rise of rival powers, provides the \n     best option. For this policy to work, it must ``maintain and \n     strengthen the `zone of peace' and incrementally extend it; \n     preclude hostile hegemony over critical regions; hedge \n     against reimperialization by Russia and expansion by China \n     while promoting cooperation with both countries; preserve \n     U.S. military preeminence; maintain U.S. economic strength \n     and an open international economic system; be judicious in \n     the use of force, avoid overextension, and develop ways of \n     sharing the burden with allies; and obtain and maintain \n     domestic support for U.S. global leadership and these \n     principles'' (95).\n       19. Kristol, William and Robert Kagan. ``Toward a Neo-\n     Reaganite Foreign Policy.'' Foreign Affairs, v. 75, July/\n     August 1996: 18-32.\n       Kristol and Kagan advocate a conservative, ``neo-\n     Reaganite'' foreign policy, in which American exceptionalism \n     is celebrated and in which America ``cheerfully'' takes on \n     the international responsibilities that come with its role as \n     the benevolent global hegemon (32). They assert that \n     ``American principles around the world can be sustained only \n     by the continuing exertion of American influence'' by such \n     means as providing foreign aid and playing a role in conflict \n     control or resolution in its diplomatic and/or military \n     capacity when appropriate; they further assert that ``most of \n     the world's major powers welcome U.S. global involvement'' \n     (20-28). Neo-Reaganite foreign policy differs from the \n     neoisolationism of the ``America First'' variety in that it \n     is a policy of engagement for the purposes of maintaining \n     peace and international order, as well as national benefit \n     (21-23). In addition, unlike the pragmatist foreign policy \n     under the Bush administration, neo-Reaganite foreign policy \n     justifies its engagement not only with practical or material \n     interests (such as jobs), but also with the goal of upholding \n     and ``actively promoting American principles of governance \n     abroad--democracy, free markets, respect for liberty'' (27-\n     8). America ought to reassume that sense of responsibility \n     for global ``moral and political leadership'' which underlay \n     the ``overarching Reaganite vision that had sustained a \n     globally active foreign policy through the last decade of the \n     Cold War'' (28).\n       20. Layne, Christopher. ``Rethinking American Grand \n     Strategy: Hegemony or Balance of Power in the Twenty-First \n     Century?'' World Policy Journal, v. 15, summer 1998: 8-28.\n       Layne favors the balance of power strategy over the \n     strategy of preponderance (synonymous with hegemony) that has \n     prevailed in U.S. foreign policymaking circles since after \n     World War II. The ``essence'' of the strategy of \n     preponderance is the creation of ``a U.S.-led world order \n     based on preeminent U.S. political, military, and economic \n     power, and on American values'' (9). Preponderance is \n     unsustainable for several reasons: one, hegemonic power \n     instigates its own demise--states that feel threatened will \n     endeavor to emerge as new great powers to balance against the \n     hegemon, thus destroying the unipolar situation(13); second, \n     the U.S. is at risk of strategic overextension when it must \n     defend its extensive interests throughout the world in order \n     to maintain its hegemonic status (17); and third, \n     preponderance as a strategy will be obsolete in the emerging \n     multipolar world, China, Japan, Germany and Russia being the \n     potential new great powers. The balance of power alternative \n     to preponderance is ``offshore balancing''(20). The premise \n     of the offshore balancing strategy ``is that it will become \n     increasingly more difficult, dangerous, and costly for the \n     United States to maintain order in, and control over, the \n     international system'' (21). As an insular great power \n     geostrategically shielded from most foreign threats, the U.S. \n     is in position to disengage itself from many of its military \n     commitments and global leadership role, thus avoiding \n     overextension. Offshore balancing lets the U.S. stand to the \n     side and achieve relative gains while other, less insulated \n     powers quarrel amongst themselves; it also lessens the U.S. \n     risk of war by allowing the U.S. to act last, when the \n     situation is clear (20-22). Geostrategic concerns are \n     paramount in offshore balancing; other issues such as \n     ``market and global economic welfare imperatives'' are to be \n     subordinate (24). U.S. power and strategic choice are \n     maximized through offshore balancing (24).\n       21. Mastanduno, Michael. ``Preserving the Unipolar Moment: \n     Realist Theories and U.S. Grand Strategy after the Cold \n     War.'' International Security, v. 21, no. 4, spring 1997: 49-\n     88.\n       Mastanduno offers a discussion of realism and its two major \n     variants, the balance of power theory and the balance of \n     threat theory, and how these theories apply to different \n     aspects of U.S. foreign policy. Realism is not itself a \n     theory, but instead a ``research program that contains a core \n     set of assumptions from which a variety of theories and \n     explanations can be developed'' (50). Realist assumptions \n     include an anarchic international system and that states are \n     ``like units'' (52). Balance of Power theory states that a \n     hegemonic state will ``stimulate the rise of new great \n     powers'' or the formation of coalitions that will balance \n     against its preponderance (54). The rational course of action \n     under this theory is to accept the ``inevitability of \n     multipolarity'' and make the most of it, by adopting the \n     position of offshore balancer (see Layne)(56). Balance of\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\n     Threat theory assert that states are not threatened by power \n     (aggregate resources) alone; the presence of other \n     considerations such as ``geographic proximity, offensive \n     capability, and aggressive intentions'' is necessary to \n     constitute a threat (59). The rational strategy under this \n     theory would be to ``pursue policies that signal restraint \n     and reassurance''--be nonthreatening, in other words (59). \n     Balance of power guides U.S. foreign economic policy while \n     balance of threat informs U.S. security policy, and the two \n     theories thus applied has worked together in the scheme to \n     preserve U.S. global primacy (51). To ``dissuade'' and delay \n     challenges to U.S. hegemony, the U.S. must not allow economic \n     conflicts to undermine security relations; the U.S. must be \n     willing to shoulder the costs of a ``global engagement \n     strategy'', and the U.S. must consult and get the cooperation \n     of its allies (a multilateral approach) and refrain from \n     preaching and imposing U.S. values (87-8).\n       22. Maynes, Charles William. ``America's Fading \n     Commitments.'' World Policy Journal, v. 16, summer 1999: 11-\n     22.\n       Maynes traces the American attitude toward multilateralism \n     since the Second World War. Multilateralism and international \n     institutions like the UN have fallen out of favor among the \n     U.S. political elite since the 1980s, due to the restrictions \n     multilateralism places on America's freedom of action. To \n     maintain that freedom, America has moved toward unilateralism \n     (``American isolationism in another form'') by acting alone \n     or through dominating its alliances (17). Maynes argues that \n     the multilateral experiment cannot be abandoned (21). \n     Globalization brings new transnational problems that must be \n     dealt with multilaterally, and the balance-of-power approach \n     to foreign policy is too prone to catastrophic failure to be \n     completely relied upon (20-21). America's unilateral approach \n     also creates resentment among other states (22). Despite \n     appropriate concerns about the erosion of sovereignty and the \n     erosion of democratic control, America must revive the \n     Wilsonian commitment to international organizations and \n     international law (also liberal internationalism), for ``the \n     hope for a more orderly and peaceful world lies in the \n     commitment to progressive multilateralism . . . [a hope \n     which] will never be fulfilled unless the most powerful \n     country in the world does its share'' (22).\n       23. Maynes, Charles William. `` `Principled' Hegemony.'' \n     World Policy Journal, v. 14, fall 1997: 31-36.\n       America has the ability to deter attacks against itself, \n     but often lacks the will and resources to compel other states \n     to act in accordance with its wishes (35). Maynes suggests \n     limiting the obligations of principled hegemony (specifically \n     in the human rights area) by restricting the U.S. role to \n     providing logistical and political assistance and acting as \n     an example, instead of taking over other states' \n     responsibilities, acting as global or regional policeman, or \n     imposing American views (35-6)\n       24. Maynes, Charles William. ``The New Pessimism.'' Foreign \n     Policy, no. 100, fall 1995: 33-49.\n       Influential authors informed by Hobbesian realist \n     assumptions express an unwarranted mood of pessimism for \n     America's future, Mayne asserts. The state of the world is \n     better than it has been for decades and there is much America \n     can do for a better future. The international system is \n     ``structurally sound'' because no great power is seeking the \n     hegemonic position (a goal repudiated by the Bush \n     administration)(44). Wars and conflicts are now more numerous \n     but on a much smaller scale--war doesn't pay like it used to; \n     there is also no ideology fueling a drive for world supremacy \n     (43). The U.S. should use this ``moment of unusual structural \n     stability in world affairs'' to ``found a structure of peace \n     for the future''(44), by devising a European structure that \n     would involve both Germany and Russia and to fully integrate \n     China into the international system (45-6). The American goal \n     must not be to counter the power of these emerging great \n     powers, but ``to channel it in directions that are more \n     benign and that respect the rights of [their] neighbors'' \n     (46).\n       25. Maynes, Charles William. ``The Perils of (and for) an \n     Imperial America.'' Foreign Policy, no. 111, summer 1998: 36-\n     48.\n       America leads the world economically, militarily, and \n     politically (37). It already carries the burden of ``a \n     totally disproportionate share of the expense of maintaining \n     the common defense'' as well as being the ``world economic \n     stabilizer'' (37). Yet America should NOT go further and \n     attempt to pursue a policy of world hegemony, for four \n     reasons: ``domestic costs, impact on the American character, \n     international backlash, and lost opportunities'' (39). Since \n     there is ``no clear geographical limit to the obligations'' \n     imposed on an aspiring hegemon, America, should it elect to \n     pursue world hegemony, must be prepared for huge increases in \n     military and non-military spending, in dollars and in \n     bloodshed (40). Hegemony can be attempted ``only by using the \n     volunteer army,'' which would exacerbate the social \n     fragmentation between those who reap benefits from \n     globalization, and those who have to pay the price (42). \n     Dangerous too is the arrogance supreme power brings, and from \n     which America already suffers. Unilateral actions such as \n     economic sanctions and dictates to the U.N. and other \n     countries provoke alienation and resistance, making other \n     countries less cooperative (44). A policy of hegemony ``will \n     guarantee that in time America will become outnumbered and \n     overpowered'' (46). America should not waste this post-Cold \n     War moment on pursuing hegemony, but use the opportunity to \n     try to forge a new relationship among great powers.\n       26. ``Old Challenges in a New Era: Addressing America's \n     Cold War Legacy, Defense, Economic & International Security \n     Concerns.'' Washington, Institute for Foreign Policy \n     Analysis, 1995.\n       During the Cold War, ideology was the dominant factor \n     governing international relations. But economic \n     considerations have taken the place of ideology with the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union and following globalization. \n     Unlike during the Cold War era, the transfers of arms and \n     defense technologies to other states are being made largely \n     on the basis of economic considerations, not ideology. A \n     laissez-faire approach to arms transfers might have negative \n     impacts on regional stability and detrimental effects on \n     future international commercial relations and overall \n     political stability in the long term (Chapter 1).\n       Even though the U.S. was the leader of the globalization of \n     the international economic system, it failed to adopt \n     internal policies to maintain its competitiveness in the \n     world market. In reality, however, the United States \n     considerably depends on importation. Consequently, it is \n     demanded that the United States continues to improve its \n     economic competitiveness in international markets if it is to \n     reverse the trend of dependency. (Chapter 2)\n       The increasing competition incurred from \n     internationalization and interdependence of trade transformed \n     the structure of the U.S. economy. For example, wages of U.S. \n     workers were adjusted to the equilibrium of global wage \n     levels. This structural transfiguration of the U.S. economy \n     from industrial era to information age resulted in U.S. \n     defense downsizing. The U.S. defense drawdown appears prima \n     facie to have negative impacts on the national job market. \n     The impact upon the U.S. job market as a whole is, however, \n     minimal in the context and also can be ameliorated with \n     continued economic growth. (Chapter 3)\n       Today's defense industrial base was formed during World War \n     II, and evolved during the quasi-warlike period of the Soviet \n     Union threat. The strategy of the U.S. military against \n     Soviet quantitative military advantages was technological \n     innovation with qualitatively superior weapon systems. This \n     also demanded large-scale industrial production of products \n     and a massive modernization of industry. But with the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union, the primary role of defense \n     industry disappeared and left dichotomous problems; ``how to \n     reduce the size of the US defense industrial establishment \n     without losing the capability to support the armed forces in \n     the near-term surge by major powers such as Russia and China, \n     or to respond to provocations from major regional states and \n     to concurrently facilitate futuristic armaments production \n     needed for long-term security needs.'' (Chapter 4)\n       Regarding the direction of U.S. military industry, ``the \n     key objective of U.S. defense industrial policy must be the \n     preservation of critical design, engineering, and production \n     skills in the United States economy.'' Moreover, ``long-term \n     U.S. defense production is rooted in maintaining a robust \n     manufacturing base within the United States. Failure to \n     preserve a diverse manufacturing base will eventually result \n     in increased U.S. vulnerability to foreign veto over U.S. \n     security-related decisions.'' (Chapter 5)\n       U.S. foreign dependency on military production will \n     naturally increase as the United States moves toward a \n     unified commercial/defense industrial base and prime \n     manufacturers continue to reorganize their supplier networks. \n     Within this framework, long lead-time products such as \n     aircraft, submarines, aircraft carriers, and tanks are not \n     vulnerable to foreign suppliers who might prove reluctant to \n     provide parts for U.S. defense production if tensions \n     develops in selected international relationships. The United \n     States currently has the technology to reestablish industries \n     if required but at a cost. The United States is more \n     vulnerable to stoppage of critical parts and components for \n     electric equipment and combat consumables needed for quick-\n     response intervention operations. In the long-term, U.S. \n     vulnerability will depend on the scope and diversity of the \n     United States industrial base.'' (Chapter 7)\n       Preserving international stability is of great importance \n     to the U.S. political, economic and military capabilities. \n     After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the security \n     condition of the world has been transformed, triggering a \n     dispute about how much military capability should be retained \n     under the new uncertain world order. The Clinton \n     Administration's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) postulated the United \n     States must be able to fight two nearly simultaneous major \n     regional conflicts (MRCs). But the U.S. force structure \n     planning has been complicated along with the continuous \n     change of the World and the diversity of potential missions \n     unlike during the Cold War. ``As a result of the changes in \n     global stability and Allied force levels, three questions \n     need to be reexamined. 1) what are the critical international \n     interests of the United States, 2) what are the emerging \n     threats to international stability, and 3) what military \n     capability does the United States need to defend those \n     interests.'' (Chapter 8)\n       ``The twin goals of maintaining a viable U.S. defense \n     industrial base and promoting international stability are not \n     mutually exclusive. As long as discretion is exercised,\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\n     transfers of U.S. arms to non-aggressive states is more \n     desirable than the alternatives of allowing other arms-\n     exporting states to dominate the trade, or cutting off \n     international arms supplies and encouraging the \n     development of indigenous arms industries.'' (Chapter 9)\n       27. Olsen, Edward A. ``In Defense of International \n     Abstention.'' Strategic Review, v. 24, spring 1996: 58-63.\n       Olsen advocates the return of American foreign policy to \n     its pre-Second World War program of ``abstention, benign \n     neglect, and non-interventionism within a framework of highly \n     selective engagement'' (58). The U.S. was pulled into a \n     collective approach to security by the special circumstances \n     of the Second World War and the Cold War, and even now \n     retains this ``anachronistic'' pursuit of world leadership \n     with little concern for national self-interest (58-9). Now \n     that the Cold War is over, the U.S. should return to a more \n     ``normal'' role in world affairs by disengaging itself from \n     the ``permanent allies'' and ``entangling alliances'' frowned \n     upon by the Founding Fathers (59-61). A policy of \n     disengagement and non-intervention is not isolationism; non-\n     intervention merely provides the kind of ``strategic \n     independence'' that allows America to get involved ``when \n     Americans--not other countries or international \n     organizations'' decide it is wise (59). Less intervention \n     overseas, less foreign aid, and fewer entanglements will let \n     the U.S. shed burdens its allies can and should carry on \n     their own, and ``maximize U.S. geo-economic influence through \n     a demilitarization of U.S. involvement overseas,'' as well as \n     grant the U.S. a ``more benign and unprovocative image'', \n     facilitate ``trade and investment, and permit a wholesale \n     reduction in obligations without calling into question \n     American prestige and credibility'' (63).\n       28. Pfaff, William. ``The Coming Clash of Europe with \n     America.'' World Policy Journal, v. 15, winter 1998/99: 1-9.\n       The Atlanticist dream of an American-European political, \n     economic, and security union is unlikely to be realized due \n     to the oncoming Western European versus American clash over \n     economic and industrial competition (1). The euro (EU common \n     currency), if successful, will draw investments away from \n     U.S. securities as well as become a ``powerful rival for \n     denominating international trade products'' (3). Europe is \n     also expected to resist the globalization trend of mergers in \n     strategic industries such as aerospace and other high-\n     technology sectors to achieve and maintain the ``industrial \n     and economic guarantees of sovereignty'' (5). European \n     economic and industrial interests serve to make European \n     countries more economically and politically integrated as a \n     union, as EU institutions and policies develop to maintain \n     these interests; further, these same interests will become a \n     ``new and fundamental factor of U.S.-EU rivalry and \n     competition,'' forming an obstacle to transatlantic \n     integration (3). Europe does not wish conflict with the U.S., \n     but these vital interests render conflict almost inevitable \n     (1). On a slightly different note, Pfaff argues against an \n     American claim on hegemony, because hegemony is an \n     ``inherently unstable'' position that provokes resistance, \n     because most of the world does not accept the idea of \n     American exceptionalism, and because American public opinion \n     does not support the kind of expenditure necessary for \n     hegemonic pursuit. (6-7).\n       29. Rielly, John E. ``Americans and the World: A Survey at \n     Century's End.'' Foreign Policy, no. 114, spring 1999: 97-\n     113.\n       The latest quadrennial foreign policy opinion survey of the \n     American public and leadership, sponsored by the Chicago \n     Council on Foreign Relations, finds three major trends (1). \n     First, the American public prefers a multilateral approach in \n     U.S. response to crises abroad, while the leadership is more \n     willing to take unilateral action (112,100). Second, although \n     the public recognizes many vital American interests around \n     the world, it is disinclined to send troops or money overseas \n     except to defend national self-interests--a position Rielly \n     calls ``guarded engagement'' (105). Altruistic \n     internationalist causes (such as promoting human rights and \n     democracy and defending allies' security) are low priority. \n     Guarded engagement ``could prove problematic if global \n     leadership requires the United States to make tougher choices \n     in the next century'' as the ``world's only superpower'' \n     (113). Third, there is a marked contrast between public \n     pessimism (major concern being international violence) and \n     leadership optimism for the 21st century world (112). The \n     survey also finds that both the public and leadership groups \n     are upbeat about globalization (105), and that both are \n     viewing ``economic rather than military power as the most \n     significant measure of global strength'' (97).\n       30. Rosati, Jerel A. ``United States Leadership into the \n     Next Millennium: A Question of Politics.'' International \n     Journal, v. 52, spring 1997: 297-315.\n       The ``constraints and political uncertainty faced by \n     [American] presidents in today's domestic political \n     environment does not bode well for a strong proactive foreign \n     policy in the future'' (310). No longer do presidents have \n     the ``automatic or long-lasting'' support behind their \n     foreign policy like they did in the Cold War era (307); now \n     they must deal with a contentious public (307) and a more \n     assertive Congress which increasingly involves itself in \n     foreign policy (308). In addition, presidential policies are \n     constrained by what bureaucracies, usually more oriented to \n     the past than the present, are ``able and willing to \n     implement'' (309). Finally, the personal qualities of the \n     president also determine the success of presidential foreign \n     policy--whether the president has the persuasive power, \n     professional reputation, public prestige, and ability to make \n     good choices (311). The result of these combined factors is \n     that U.S. foreign policy ``has tended to become increasingly \n     reactive--as opposed to proactive--and, hence, incoherent and \n     inconsistent over time,'' rendering the exercise of the much-\n     advocated sustained U.S. global leadership very difficult \n     (306).\n       31. Rosenthal, Joel H. ``Henry Stimson's Clue: Is \n     Progressive Internationalism on the Wane?'' World Policy \n     Journal, v. 14, fall 1997: 53-62.\n       Rosenthal explicates and distinguishes the philosophies of \n     conservative and progressive internationalism, and concludes \n     that ``a realist foreign policy and a `progressive' social \n     agenda did not have to be mutually exclusive'' (61). \n     Conservative internationalism is ``conservative in that it \n     sought modest, incremental change in international \n     relations'' and maintains the state-centered model in which \n     nations have sovereign control over their own territories and \n     domestic policies (56). Conservatives are concerned with \n     promoting American geopolitical and mercantilist interests, \n     not radical world reformation (56). Progressive \n     internationalism takes its cue from the American Progressive \n     movement and ``sought to extend the ideals and achievements \n     of the Progressive movement'' to the world, as reflected in \n     its emphasis on political democracy, and social and \n     economic justice worldwide (55-7). Progressives also \n     envision a ``One World'' international structure. \n     Rosenthal then writes that ``the story of American \n     internationalism is a history of how `national interests' \n     grow out of and are defined by domestic considerations'' \n     (54). Citing Morgenthau's idea that ``international power \n     depended on domestic power and that a key factor in \n     determining domestic power was the presence or absence of \n     moral principles,'' Rosenthal observes that even realists, \n     of whom Morgenthau is a prime representative, accept that \n     power rests not only on military and economic might, but \n     also has a moral basis--legitimacy (54). Working for and \n     achieving social progress at home is ``a prerequisite'' in \n     the extension of American power and interests abroad (61). \n     Thus although conservative internationalism is the more \n     mainstream policy, ``progressive aspirations cannot and \n     should not be jettisoned,'' for these aspirations of \n     equality in freedom and opportunity constitute the \n     ``purpose of American politics . . . [and] for various \n     historical, geographic, cultural and technological \n     reasons, `the area within which the United States must \n     defend and promote its purpose [had] become world-wide'' \n     (61). It is the American purpose and ethical obligation to \n     deliver on the progressive philosophy, domestically and \n     globally (the latter by example), in its role as the \n     ``indispensable nation'' (62). In short, moral principles \n     cannot be ignored in foreign policy.\n       32. Rubinstein, Alvin Z. ``The New Moralists on a Road to \n     Hell.'' Orbis, v. 80, spring 1996: 277-295.\n       American policy on aid to needy nations and especially on \n     military intervention against political injustices (like \n     ethnic violence) has come under the negative influence of a \n     group Rubinstein calls the ``new moralists'' (277). The new \n     moralists are a ``disparate group of influential notables in \n     the media, academy, and think tanks,'' who want to use U.S. \n     military power to ``spread democracy, protect the victimized, \n     and promote economic development,'' even where the U.S. has \n     no strategic stake (277). New moralists assume that the U.S., \n     as the sole world superpower, must shoulder global \n     leadership; that the international community is willing to \n     follow its lead; that civil and ethnic conflicts must be \n     stopped before ``they lead to great-power wars'' and that the \n     U.S. has a ``moral responsibility'' to promote democracy and \n     defend the downtrodden (278). They view national interest \n     through a moral, not strategic, framework (278). Rubinstein \n     criticizes the new moralists for misusing historical evidence \n     and for wrongly claiming international support (286-7). \n     Foreign policy ``must be affordable, supportable, and \n     demonstrably in the best interests of the country at large,'' \n     and based on ``sober calculations of fundamental U.S. \n     strategic, economic and political interests'' (293). ``Except \n     in cases of direct threats to the survival or vital interests \n     of the United States, the determination of which moral \n     goal(s) to emphasize is a matter of choice'' (294). Further, \n     the moral dimensions of foreign policy must be carefully \n     handled with the proper perspective and sound priorities, in \n     order to prevent trivialization, indifference, and self-\n     righteousness (292).\n       33. Rubinstein, Alvin Z. ``NATO Enlargement vs. American \n     Interests.'' Orbis, v. 42, winter 1998: 37-48.\n       NATO enlargement is not in the U.S. interest. The decision \n     to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO was \n     based on Clinton's bid for votes from voters with strong ties \n     to Central and Eastern Europe, and not on a cost-benefit \n     policy analysis (37). NATO enlargement will cost the U.S. \n     money, add to NATO's security burden, and force the new \n     members to divert money from economic and social development \n     in order to upgrade their defense system to NATO standards \n     (38-40). Given the new challenges and uncertainties facing \n     the U.S. in East Asia, it is unwise for the U.S. to take on \n     ``unnecessary responsibilities'' in Europe, where the \n     situation is stable (43). Introducing new elements into NATO \n     will disrupt its ``secure\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\n     strategic environment'' by affecting power structures and \n     member cohesion, possibly resulting detrimental consequences \n     (44). The key concern here is Germany. Admitting the Central \n     and Eastern European members will once again put Germany in \n     the center of Europe, with the potential for rekindling \n     adversarial Franco-German and Russo-German relationships, as \n     well as undermining European integration as France and \n     Britain assess Germany's new, more important status (45). The \n     addition of new members, all ``heavily dependent on \n     Germany,'' may affect intra-NATO politics (45). Finally, \n     ``any geopolitical development . . . that transforms Germany \n     from an ordinary nation-state into a strategic hub . . . will \n     pose problems for America's presently unchallenged \n     dominance''; in an enlarged NATO where Germany has NATO \n     members as a buffer against Russia (thus reducing its \n     security reliance on the U.S.), America may well lose its \n     leverage in NATO to Germany (45).\n       34. Ruggie, John Gerard. ``The Past as a Prologue?'' \n     International Security, v. 21, Spring 1997: 89-125.\n       Ruggie uses three past reconstruction periods in \n     international policy, 1919, 1945, and post-1947 to predict \n     future trends (109). He contends that in all three instances \n     American leaders advocated ``multilateral organizing \n     principles . . . to animate the support of the American \n     public'' (117). He states that these principles are embedded \n     in American nationalism and by their nature appeal to the \n     public. ``Multilateral organizing principles are singularly \n     compatible with America's own form of nationalism, on which \n     its sense of political community is based'' (109). However \n     the author is hesitant to define these acts as ``mere \n     rhetoric'' or idealism (117). He asserts that various factors \n     must be taken into account depending on the complexity of \n     each situation, with special focus on ``strategic interests \n     and collective identity'' (124). Ruggie argues that the \n     outlook for American foreign policy should be not simply \n     defined by historical instances or past successes but in \n     terms of the existing situation and political climate.\n       35. Schild, George. ``America's Foreign Policy \n     Pragmatism.'' Aussenpolitik, v. 46, 1st Quarter 1995: 32-40.\n       Schild discusses American foreign policy transition from \n     isolationism (33) to internationalism (34). The author states \n     that isolationism ``does not mean the complete decoupling of \n     the United States from Europe and from the world'' but rather \n     ``refusal to enter into lasting political commitments'' (33). \n     The change in U.S. foreign policy from isolationism to \n     internationalism was a result of four factors. The era of \n     isolationism between the two world wars caused a belief in \n     the American population that it left the country unprepared \n     for attack, as in the case of Pearl Harbor. The policy failed \n     to provide economic growth and the development of new weapons \n     expanded defense borders beyond American coastlines. Finally, \n     the Cold War created an adversary in which the general public \n     accepted the Soviet Union as an enemy (34). The combination \n     of these factors led to the emergence of internationalism, \n     defined as universal or transnational interests (34). \n     However, Schild declares that since the end of the Cold \n     War the trend toward isolationism has re-emerged, a trend \n     he calls ``pragmatic foreign policy'' (33).\n       36. Schwabe, William. ``Future Worlds and Roles: A Template \n     to Help Planners Consider Assumptions About the Future \n     Security Environment.'' Rand Corporation, 1995.\n       Schwabe discusses nine possible future roles for the U.S. \n     concerning international security. He explains the origin of \n     his roles by distinguishing between possible future worlds \n     and possible U.S. roles. Possible future worlds include ``new \n     era'' denoting improvements in economic and political \n     structures, ``baseline'' referring to status quo levels which \n     continue in the same fashion as it has since World War Two \n     and ``Malthusian'' meaning deterioration in which the \n     international system is failing and all countries struggle \n     (2). Potential roles for the U.S. encompass leadership, co-\n     equal, and second tier (3). The leadership function maintains \n     that the U.S. will continue the role it has assumed for the \n     past half century, dominating in many aspects of \n     international relations and security. The co-equal option \n     posits that the U.S. will maintain its comparative advantage \n     in some aspects but recognize equivalent or superior ability \n     of other first tier countries. In this respect the U.S. will \n     ``abandon the modern version of manifest destiny and comes to \n     see greater value and security in not having to lead'' (6). \n     The second tier role presumes that the U.S. will decline in \n     status, falling below other leading industrialized nations. \n     Schwabe does not hypothesize on which of these possibilities \n     will occur.\n       37. Schwenninger, Sherle R. ``Clinton's World Order: U.S. \n     Foreign Policy is Hastening--by accident--Arrival of the \n     post-American Century.'' Nation, v. 266, Feb. 1998: 17-20.\n       Since President Clinton has taken office a ``new global \n     order'' has taken shape (17). Schwenninger states that \n     Clinton's policy of ``political isolation and economic \n     strangulation have hardened into an ideological commitment'' \n     (18). The author explains his theory through examples of U.S. \n     economic trade agreements and various attempts at sanctions. \n     He notes that American sanction policies especially have done \n     more to strain U.S.-European relations than they have altered \n     behavior of condemned countries. Schwenninger continues by \n     saying, ``It (the Clinton Administration) has mismanaged this \n     period of U.S. dominance in world affairs by pushing \n     ideologically driven initiatives (like NATO expansion), which \n     will bring little if any lasting benefit to U.S. interests or \n     the larger cause of a stable world order'' (20). The author \n     promotes U.S. foreign policy that includes labor and \n     environmental protections, more extensive domestic measures \n     to insure the majority of Americans benefit, and when needed \n     international regulatory structures needed to oversee \n     international capital flows (19-20).\n       38. Shain, Yossi. ``Multicultural Foreign Policy.'' Foreign \n     Policy, no. 100, Fall 1995: 69-87.\n       In the past century America's population has expanded \n     considerably. Ethnic groups living in America have altered \n     the shape and function of U.S. foreign policy. Those involved \n     in U.S. foreign political affairs have recognized this wave \n     of influence and have acknowledged the resurgence of \n     Wilsonianism (70). However, this presents a foreign policy \n     conundrum: foreign policy- makers must take into account the \n     demands of citizens but avoid undermining national \n     cohesiveness due to ethnic strains. With increasingly \n     powerful ethnic influences such as diasporic lobbies, ``one \n     should expect to see strong ramifications in U.S. foreign \n     affairs, including a redefinition of U.S. national \n     interest''. (73) Shain states two ideologies that ethnic \n     communities encounter when compelled by ethnic and U.S. \n     interests. Isolationists consider their culture superior to \n     American culture and reject cultural assimilation in the U.S. \n     (75). Integrationists endorse a vision of pluralist democracy \n     that includes cultural and political recognition from main \n     stream institutions (78). American policymakers will have to \n     carefully consider these factors when creating and \n     implementing foreign policy.\n       39. Sloan, Stanley, R. ``The U.S. Role in the Twenty-first \n     Century World: Toward a New Consensus?'' Foreign Policy \n     Association, 1998: 64 p.\n       Sloan contends that U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold \n     War era must be directed by executive leadership with the \n     acknowledgment of scholars, analysts, and Congress. A crucial \n     element in comprehending America's new role is to understand \n     world interdependency. Sloan proposes U.S. interests can be \n     ``affected by developments in any region of the globe'' (5). \n     Sloan suggests that the U.S. has been experiencing an \n     ``escapist'' period in foreign policy (36). He contends that \n     escapism is a result of America's uncertain international \n     role in the future and a misunderstanding of U.S. foreign \n     objectives. He recommends the current Administration \n     explicitly defining America's foreign policy agenda based on \n     common values, goals, and interests (59). The author reveals \n     that this endeavor would ``reflect post-cold-war realities \n     and would restore flexibility to U.S. policymaking'' (59).\n       40. Travers, Russell, E. ``A new Millennium and a Strategic \n     Breathing Space.'' Washington Quarterly, v. 20, Spring 1997: \n     97-114.\n       In a reevaluation of threats against U.S. security Travers \n     suggests eight general policy prescriptions to succeed during \n     the post Cold War period. Included in his recommendations are \n     rejection of isolationist and instant gratification policies \n     which he depicts as being two major mistakes in U.S. history \n     (110-111). He promotes the use of newly defined sovereignty \n     combined with neo-Wilsonian ideals ``because it is in the \n     U.S. national interest to help build such a world'' (112). \n     The author also suggests minimizing future threats by \n     addressing potential vulnerabilities including possible \n     domestic problems. He states that this can be accomplished by \n     creating a exceptional intelligence community with early \n     warning systems to thwart domestic and international threats. \n     Military preparedness should include readiness in low \n     intensity conflicts with small force packages of highest-end \n     U.S. technology integrated with 1980s- and 1990s-vintage \n     weapons (112). Essentially, Travers concludes that the U.S. \n     maintains a favorable strategic position in the post Cold War \n     era.\n       41. United States Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations. \n     ``U.S. National Goals and Objectives in International \n     Relations in the Year 2000 and Beyond.'' Hearing, 104th \n     Congress, 1st Session, July 13, 1995. Prepared Statement by \n     Henry Kissinger, 12-22.\n       Kissinger states that every major nation finds itself in a \n     transitional stage. ``The current world contains six or seven \n     major global players whose ability to affect nonmilitary \n     decisions is essentially comparable'' (13). For this reason \n     Kissinger believes that there are two stable options for U.S. \n     policy makers: hegemony or equilibrium. Hegemony would allow \n     the U.S. to dominate in the international sphere but has been \n     recently rejected by the American public (13). The \n     equilibrium or ``balance of power'' approach has also been \n     dismissed by U.S. society due to endless tension that many \n     feel it causes (13). However, Kissinger maintains that \n     ``the reality is that the emerging world order will have \n     to be based on some concept of equilibrium . . . among its \n     various regions'' (13). He also argues that the U.S. will \n     be forced to impose a variety of foreign policy \n     initiatives, based on U.S. relations and each nation's \n     political agenda. Concerning countries with which we share \n     common values and principles, Kissinger suggests emphasis \n     on democratic principles to usher in the new world order \n     (17). In the case of nontraditional U.S. allies he asserts \n     that we must avoid containment policies of a generation \n     ago. Containment may allow or possibly promote unified \n     defiance. (21). Kissinger stresses\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\n     the need for a well developed and supported international \n     policy, blind to partisanship. ``The national interest of \n     the United States does not change every four years; \n     foreign leaders judge our country by its insight and its \n     constancy'' (22).\n       42. Van Heuven, Marten. ``Europe in 2006: A Speculative \n     Sketch.'' Rand, 1997: 16 p.\n       U.S. foreign policy with respect to Europe in the next \n     decade should be founded on ``the fact that a secure, stable, \n     and prosperous Europe is vital to American security and well-\n     being'' (13). Europe and America have had a long record of \n     cooperation as a result of similar interest and values. For \n     this reason political, financial, and social stability in \n     Europe is essential to prosperity in America. Van Heuven \n     stresses that because of our historical partnership \n     bipartisanship should not muddle U.S. foreign policy \n     objective in the region (15). Emphasis on pragmatic policies \n     such as those concerning the EU and open markets should \n     continue to be the American objective (15). In closing the \n     author states that there is a need for greater public \n     discussion about what the U.S. role should be concerning \n     Europe.\n       43. Weston, Charles. ``Key U.S. Foreign Policy Interests.'' \n     Aussenpolitik, v. 48, no. 1, 1997: 49-57.\n       Since the end of the Cold War the U.S. has remained the \n     only influence capable of international influence. Changes in \n     America politically and domestically have influenced U.S. \n     foreign policy decisions. Weston states that the current \n     Administration's policy combines ``idealism with pragmatism \n     and emphasizes democracy and human rights'', a reflection of \n     public sentiment (52). Despite international engagements such \n     as Bosnia, ``Washington is not at all keen about the idea of \n     an offensive and worldwide interventionism'' (52). The author \n     concludes that to overcome international challenges faced in \n     the 21st century the U.S. must lead alliances with examples \n     of coordination and cooperation (57).\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, James Lindsay of the Brookings \nInstitution, I think, well summed up where we in Congress are today in \nthis great debate on America's proper role in the world in the Winter \n2000 Brookings Review, where he wrote:\n\n       Much like friends who agree to dine but can't agree on a \n     restaurant, foreign policy elites agree that the United \n     States should do something, just not what. Congress naturally \n     reflects this dissensus, which makes it difficult for the \n     institution to function. Divided by chamber, party, ideology, \n     region, committee, and generation, Congress lists toward \n     paralysis whenever a modicum of agreement and a sense of \n     proportion are absent.\n\n  In a nutshell, attempting to overcome this ``dissensus'' and \n``paralysis'' is what Senator Roberts and I are trying to do in these \ndialogs. I'd like at this point to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas for his comments.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, Senator Cleland has very effectively outlined the \nevolution of our nation's foreign policy, from Washington and Adams \n(chary of foreign involvement and alliances) to the Monroe Doctrine to \nWilson's idealism and all of the so called ``ism's''--economism, \nrealism, humanitarianism, minimalism, unilateralism, regionalism, \nisolationism with intervention and non intervention tossed in. Now, \nthat is quite a foreign policy tossed salad.\n  But, the point is, discussion and definition must preface clarity, \npurpose and consensus and Senator Cleland has done just that along with \na Clelandism, a new concept he will define in his closing remarks, \n``Realistic Restraint.''\n  In setting the framework for discussion on the global role our nation \nwill play in the 21st century, the benchmark used by virtually all \nobservers is the post-cold-war period.\n  Ashton Carter, professor of science and international affairs at the \nJohn F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and an Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for International Security Policy in the first \nClinton administration, put it very well when he recently wrote:\n\n       The kindest thing that might be said of American behavior \n     ten years into the post-Cold War world is that it is A-\n     STRATEGIC, responding dutifully to the (crisis du jour) with \n     little sense of priority or consistency.\n       A less charitable characterization would be that the United \n     States has its priorities but they are backwards, too often \n     placing immediate intervention in minor conflicts over a \n     ``preventive-defense strategy focused on basic, long term \n     threats to security.\n       This formula has become awkward, even embarrassing, as the \n     years go by. It is an admission that we do not know where we \n     are going strategically, only whence we have come. It is time \n     to declare an end to the end.\n\n  In his recent article, ``Adapting U.S. Defense to Future Needs,'' \nProfessor Carter has recommended identifying an ``A-list'' of security \npriorities to fill the current strategic vacuum. I was struck by the \nsimilarity between Professor Carter's A, B, and C lists determining \nthreats to our national security and the recommendations by the \nCommission on America's National Interests four years previous that I \nmentioned in my opening remarks.\n  And, Professor Carter did us another favor in his article by quoting \nGeorge Marshall at the time of America's previous great strategic \ntransition following the Second World War. In 1947 at Princeton \nUniversity, General Marshall said:\n\n       Now that an immediate peril is not plainly visible, there \n     is a natural tendency to relax and to return to business as \n     usual. But, I feel that we are seriously failing in our \n     attitude toward the international problems whose solution \n     will largely determine our future.\n\n  The report by the Commission on America's National Interests in 1996 \nexpressed a similar view:\n\n       The confusion, crosscurrents, and cacophony about America's \n     role in the world today is strikingly reminiscent of two \n     earlier experiences in this century: the years after 1918 and \n     those after 1945. We are experiencing today the third post-\n     war transition of the twentieth century. In the twenty years \n     after 1918, American isolationists forced withdrawal from the \n     world. America's withdrawal undermined the World War I peace \n     settlement in Europe and contributed mightily to the Great \n     Depression, the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy, and the \n     resumption of war in Europe after what proved to be but a \n     two-decade intermission. After 1945, American leaders were \n     determined to learn and apply those lessons of the interwar \n     period. Individuals who are known now as the ``wise men,'' \n     including Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, \n     Secretaries of State George Marshall and Dean Acheson, and \n     Senator Arthur Vandenberg, fashioned a strategy of \n     thoughtful, deep American engagement in the world in ways \n     they judged vital to America's well-being. As a result, two \n     generations of Americans have enjoyed five decades without \n     world war, in which America experienced the most rapid \n     economic growth in history, and won a great victory in the \n     Cold War.\n\n  To address this historical challenge and responsibility, what did the \nCommission recommend? We recommended the following:\n\n       Challenges to American national interests in the decade \n     ahead. Developments around the world pose threats to U.S. \n     interests and present opportunities for advancing Americans' \n     well-being. Because America's resources are limited, U.S. \n     foreign policy must be selective in choosing which issues to \n     address. The proper basis for making such judgments is a \n     lean, hierarchical conception of what U.S. national interests \n     are and are not. Media attention to foreign affairs tends to \n     fixate on issues according to the vividness of a threat, \n     without pausing to ask whether the U.S. interest threatened \n     is really important. Thus second- and third-order issues like \n     Bosnia or Haiti become a consuming focus of U.S. foreign \n     policy to the neglect of issues of higher priority, like \n     China's international role or the unprecedented risks of \n     nuclear proliferation.\n       Based on its assessment of specific threats to and \n     opportunities for U.S. national interests in the final years \n     of the century, the Commission has identified five cardinal \n     challenges for the next U.S. president: To cope with China's \n     entry onto the world stage; to prevent loss of control of \n     nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons-usable materials, and to \n     contain biological and chemical weapons proliferation; to \n     maintain sound strategic partnerships with Japan and the \n     European allies; to avoid Russia's collapse into civil war or \n     reversion to authoritarianism; and to maintain singular U.S. \n     leadership, military capabilities, and international \n     credibility.\n\n  Note the similarity in agreement in regard to Professor Carter's \nrecent article in which he says, 4 years later:\n\n       The public imagination, reflected in the press, abhors the \n     post-Cold War's conceptual vacuum. Under CNN's relentless \n     gaze, and in the absence of any widely accepted strategic \n     principles, the accumulation of a decade's worth of telegenic \n     events has begun to furnish the public with a conception of \n     strategic priorities that differs from an A-list as defined \n     here. Citizens watching the news (and even those few who \n     still read it) can be forgiven if they have begun to get the \n     impression that the security challenges of the new era (the \n     post-Post-Cold War era) arise in such places as Kosovo, \n     Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia. These are the \n     issues that have dominated the security headlines in the \n     1990s. Indeed, there is even talk of the post-Cold War's \n     first presidential doctrine, the so-called ``Clinton \n     Doctrine'', dealing with precisely this issue. According to \n     President Bill Clinton: ``Whether you live in Africa or \n     Central Europe or any other place, if somebody comes after \n     innocent civilians and tries to kill them en masse because of \n     their race, their ethnic background or their religion, and it \n     is within our power to stop it, we will stop it.''\n       The Kosovos and their ilk are undoubtedly important \n     problems: they represent not only atrocities that offend the \n     human conscience,\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\n     but if allowed to fester can undermine the foundations of \n     regional and international stability. However, it is also \n     true that such problems, while serious, do not threaten \n     America's vital security interests.\n\n  Carter went on to say there are four dangers that he puts on the A \nlist, the top priority concerns in regard to vital national security \ninterests: No. 1, the danger that Russia might descend into chaos, \nisolation and aggression as Germany did after the First World War; No. \n2, the danger that Russia and other Soviet successor States might lose \ncontrol of the nuclear and chemical and biological weapons legacy of \nthe former Soviet Union; No. 3, the danger that, as China emerges, it \ncould spawn hostility rather than becoming engaged in the international \nsystem; the danger that the weapons of mass destruction will \nproliferate and present a direct military threat to U.S. forces and \nterritory; and finally, the danger that catastrophic terrorism of \nunprecedented scope and intensity might occur on U.S. territory.\n  Professor Carter indicated these A-list problems do not take the form \nof traditional military threats and they have not, as a general rule, \nmade headlines or driven our defense programs during the decade-old \npost-cold-war era. While neither imminent nor certain, the A-list \nproblems will, to quote Marshall again, ``largely determine our \nfuture.''\n  Both Professor Carter and the commission report go on to stress many \nadditional policy recommendations. I commend both the report and the \narticle to my colleagues.\n  In trying to better prioritize our national security obligations, I \nthink we are faced with two clear policy alternatives: The first I call \nthe so-called Powell doctrine, named after retired Joint Chiefs \nChairman, General Colin Powell, who focused on the dangers of military \nengagement and recommended limiting commitments that put America's men \nand women in uniform in harm's way to absolutely vital national \ninterests; the second being the so-called Clinton doctrine, which \nemphasizes more of a global policing role for the United States.\n  This debate does recall others. It was 40 years ago that President \nEisenhower's emphasis on strategic deterrence was challenged by \nPresident John Kennedy's advocacy of something called ``flexible \nresponse.'' However, the difference is that once in office, the Kennedy \nadministration increased defense spending, while in the last 10 years \nafter engagement and sending more American service men and women \noverseas than any other President took place in tandem with cutting our \nmilitary by one-third.\n  Our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton \nsummed up the situation very well when he told the John F. Kennedy \nSchool of Government recently:\n\n       The military makes a great hammer in America's foreign \n     policy tool box, but not every problem we face is a nail.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       As a world superpower, can we dare to admit that force \n     cannot solve every problem we face. I think that the decision \n     to use force is probably the most important decision our \n     nation's leaders can make. The fundamental purpose of our \n     military forces is to fight and win the nation's wars.\n\n  General Shelton went on to echo what both the commission on America's \ninterests and Professor Carter have said: Military intervention should \nbe used for vital national interests, important national interests, and \nthey have been used for humanitarian efforts. But the general cautioned \nthat such efforts should be limited in duration and clearly defined.\n  The general referred to the Dover test, named after Dover Air Force \nBase, the point of entry of the bodies of service members that are \nkilled in action overseas. The general said: The question is, Is the \nAmerican public prepared for the sight of our most precious resources \ncoming home in flagged-draped caskets into Dover?\n  He said this should be among the first things raised by Washington \ndecisionmakers. Both Senator Cleland and I agree very strongly.\n\n  The historical analogies aside, there is one clear difference in \ntoday's global world and what faced our political and military leaders \nof yesterday. That is what I call the information age of the CNN \neffect. Joseph S. Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nInternational Security Affairs, said in a recent article:\n\n       Today the free flow of information and shortened news \n     cycles have a huge impact on public opinion, placing some \n     items at the top of the public agenda that might otherwise \n     warrant a lower priority. Our political leaders are finding \n     it harder than ever to maintain a coherent set of priorities \n     on foreign policy issues that determine what is in the \n     national interest.\n       The so-called ``CNN effect'' makes it harder to keep some \n     items off the top of the public agenda that might otherwise \n     warrant a lower priority. Now, with the added interactivity \n     of activist groups on the Internet, it will be harder than \n     ever for leaders in democracies to maintain a consistent \n     agenda of priorities.\n\n  In closing, let me say that while this forum is intended to focus on \ndebate and discussion, events of the day have a way of forcing the \nagenda.\n  I paraphrase from the distinguished admiral who heads up the Defense \nIntelligence Agency when he said before a recent hearing: We must pay \nattention to uncertainties in regard to Russia, China, Europe, the \nMiddle East, and Korea. They must be addressed. We must deal with rogue \nstates and individuals who do not share our vision of the future and \nare willing to engage in violence. Rapid technology development and the \nproliferation in information technology, biotechnology, and \ncommunications, tactical weapons, weapons of mass destruction, pose a \nsignificant threat. A 50-percent reduction in global defense spending \nmeans both our adversaries and allies have not kept pace with the \nUnited States, but as we see after the war in Kosovo, it will result in \nasymmetric threats from our adversaries and reduced help from our \nallies. Demographic developments will stress the infrastructure and \nleadership in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Disparities in global \nweather and resource distribution will get worse. The reaction to the \nUnited States and western dominance will spur anti-U.S. sentiments now \nmore pronounced since Kosovo, the law of unintended effects. \nInternational drug cultivation and production and transport and use \nwill remain a major source of crime and instability. And lastly, ethnic \nand religious and cultural divisions will remain a prime motivation for \nconflict.\n  To be sure, the Senate of the United States cannot solve all the \nproblems, but these problems do indeed comprise current and emerging \nthreats to our national security, international stability, and to \npeace. The question is, Can we reach consensus in this body to address \nthem in a rational fashion as the leader in the free world?\n  I think my colleague has some closing remarks, as I do.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, may I say my colleague from Kansas, as he \nso often does, put his finger right on it. The question is one of \npriorities. I appreciate him pointing out the CNN effect. The extent to \nwhich this country can respond to each and every problem in the world \nis limited. We have to recognize that; therefore, we must insist on \ndealing with our top priorities.\n  I deeply appreciate the wonderful quote of General Shelton which I \nfirst heard at an Armed Services Committee hearing, that we have, in \neffect, a great hammer, but not every problem in the world is a nail. \nWhat a great way to phrase that particular point of view.\n  I appreciate Senator Roberts' mentioning General Powell, one of my \npersonal heroes. I once had the pleasure of visiting him in the \nPentagon when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We spoke \nabout the purpose of the American military. He said: My purpose is to \ngive the President of the United States the best advice I can on how to \nuse the American military to stay out of war; but if we get in war, win \nand win quickly.\n  That is still probably the finest definition of the mission statement \nof our military forces I have ever heard.\n  So I thank the Senator from Kansas for his insight and for his timely \nremarks.\n  I will now conclude my prepared remarks today by offering some \npreliminary thoughts as we begin this dialogue on the U.S. global role. \nAs I said at the outset, I certainly do not have any final judgments or \nanswers to this critical question. In my view, no one has, or can have, \nall of the answers right now because so many of the elements of the \npost-cold-war world--including its geopolitical alignments,\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\n``rules of the game'' in dispute resolution and trade, and the role of \nnon-national actors, including non-governmental organizations, the news \nmedia and unfortunately transnational terrorists--are in flux. But we \ncannot let this lack of certainty and finality deter our efforts to \nfind the best set of policies we can now develop, not when challenges \nor potential challenges to our national interests continue to arise, \nnot when the people of America are asked to sustain whatever policy we \nhere espouse.\n  I might say, as a Vietnam veteran who almost came back in a body bag, \nthe Dover test, the Dover, DE test, or the ability of this country to \nmeasure the rightness of our actions based on the price we are willing \nto pay, is a powerful one.\n  When our sons and daughters in the military are asked to put their \nfamily life on hold and their lives on the line in support of whatever \nthe civilian authorities determine, they have a right to ask us if \nthose policies are worth it.\n  I have been deeply disturbed by the tenor of our recent debates in \nthe Congress and with the administration on a host of important \nnational security issues. Most recently, the Senate failed to ratify \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty after little meaningful debate and no \nSenate hearings. This was one of the most consequential treaties of the \ndecade, and it was sadly reduced to sound-bite politics and partisan \nrancor.\n  In addition to the CTBT, the Senate has made monumental decisions on \nour policies in the Balkans and the Persian Gulf, funding for the Wye \nRiver Accords and the future of NATO and the United Nations, all \nwithout a comprehensive set of American goals and policies. Simply put, \nI do not believe we can afford to continue on a path of partisanship \nand division of purpose without serious damage to our national \ninterests.\n  In addition, as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nPersonnel Subcommittee, I have been heavily involved in trying to \nimprove the quality of life for our servicemen and women through such \nsteps as increasing pay and enhancing health and education benefits. It \nis my deeply held view that not only do we need to take such action to \naddress some disturbing trends in armed forces recruitment and \nretention, but we owe these individuals nothing less in recognition of \ntheir service.\n  However, as important as these other factors are, the ultimate \nquality of life issues center on decisions made by national security \ndecisionmakers here in Washington relating to the deployment of our \nforces abroad. It is these deployments which separate families, disrupt \nlives, and in those cases which involve hostilities, endanger the \nservice member's life itself. This is not to say that I believe our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are not fully prepared to do \nwhatever we ask of them. But we on this end owe them nothing less than \na full and thorough consideration each and every time we put them into \nharm's way.\n  There are thirteen military installations in Georgia, and I visit the \ntroops whenever I can. When I go to these bases, I see weary and \nbeleaguered families who are doing their best to make it through the \nweeks and months without their husbands or wives. They are, indeed, on \nthe point of the spear of this Nation's military force. They are paying \na heavy toll for our military engagements around the world. It is a \nprice they are ready to pay, but one I want the Senate to understand \nand appreciate as we continue in our commitment of troops aboard.\n  For what it is worth, based on what I have seen and heard to date, I \nbelieve we in positions of foreign policy making responsibility in the \nUnited States need to be much more mindful of such traditional realist \ndiplomatic precepts as ``balance of power'' and ``equilibrium.'' This \nis not to say that I believe our distinctly American approach to \nforeign policy, dominated throughout by idealist considerations and in \nmost of the 20th century by what is often called Wilsonian \ninternationalism has been wrong-headed or unfounded. Clearly, for the \nmost part, it has served us well in advancing our vital national \ninterests, whether those were securing our national independence, \npromoting the spread of self-determination and democracy, or defeating \nSoviet communism.\n  But the post-cold-war period is a new day for America as well as the \nworld. In my view, we need not, and certainly will not, renounce our \nideals, but in this new era, those ideals must be grounded in a policy \nwhich realistically gauges what price Americans can or should pay in \nsupport of our global role.\n  We have to ask the Dover, DE test: How many body bags do we want to \nsee coming home? We have to ask what price we are going to pay for our \nmilitary. We cannot continue to downsize our American military by a \nthird and increase our commitments abroad by 300 percent, whether or \nnot our commitments abroad are actually sustainable over a period of \ntime.\n  Last, I am struck by the words of the conservative editor of the \nNational Interest, Owen Harries:\n\n       I advocate restraint because every dominant power in the \n     last four centuries that has not practiced it--that has been \n     excessively intrusive and demanding--has ultimately been \n     confronted by a hostile coalition of other powers. Americans \n     may believe that their country, being exceptional, need have \n     no worries in this respect. I do not agree. It is not what \n     Americans think of the United States but what others think of \n     it that will decide the matter.\n\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senate for our \ndiscussion here, and I thank my colleague for his tremendous insight \nand his marvelous research into the challenges we face in America's \nglobal role today. I look forward to continuing this discussion and \nthis dialog in the coming weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in closing, I again thank my colleague \nfor undertaking this effort. As usual, his remarks have been on point. \nThey have provided focus. They have been very thought provoking.\n  I would like to recount a personal experience. Last spring, Senator \nStevens led a Senate delegation to the Balkans, to Macedonia. \nObviously, we didn't go into Kosovo at that particular time. Along with \nother Senators, we visited the Albanian refugees and the various \nrefugee camps. This one was Brazda.\n  Standing in the cold and in the mud amidst a circle of refugees, \nthere came an old man with a stocking cap. It was pulled over his head. \nHe was recounting, through his interpreter, his tale of human misery. \nHe had refused to join his wife and family in fleeing their home. He \ndidn't want to leave home. He urged them to leave the home because of \nhis worry about their safety.\n  Two sons had fled to the mountains. He did not know, since he fled at \nthe last moment, where his family was. He was wearing the shoes of a \nlong-time friend who was killed in the violence. His home was burned. \nHis savings and life's wherewithal were destroyed. And with tears in \nhis eyes he grabbed me by the lapels and he said: ``I believe in God, I \nbelieve in America, and I believe in you.'' That face will always be \nwith me.\n\n  Yet today, we see the continuing ethnic violence so prevalent in that \npart of the world. The Senator from Georgia mentioned Samuel P. \nHuntington's book, ``The Clash of Civilizations: The Remaking of the \nWorld Order.'' The central theme of that book is that culture and \ncultural identities, which we see so prevalent in the Balkans and in \nother places around the globe, which at the broadest level are \ncivilization identities, are shaping the patterns of cohesion, \ndisintegration, and conflicts in the post-cold-war world.\n  We should focus on that. I recommend his book to every Senator. It \nshould be required reading. He has five corollaries to his main point \nwhich will help us shape our future foreign and defense policy:\n  One, in the post-cold war world, for the first time in history, \nglobal politics has become multipolar, multi-civilizational; \nWesternization is not producing a universal civilization--a shock, \nperhaps, to many who call themselves decisionmakers in regard to \nWestern civilization.\n  Two, the balance of power among civilizations is shifting. The West \nis declining in relative influence. Asian civilizations are expanding \ntheir economic, military, and political strength. The Nations of Islam \nare exploding demographically, with destabilizing consequences for \nMuslim countries and their neighbors, and nonwestern civilizations \ngenerally are reaffirming the value of their own cultures.\n  Three, a civilization-based world order is emerging. Societies \nsharing\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\ncultural affinities tend to really cooperate with each other. Efforts \nto shift societies from one civilization to another are unsuccessful. \nAnd countries group themselves around the lead or core states of their \ncivilization. The West's universalist pretensions increasingly bring it \ninto conflict with other civilizations.\n  Finally, the survival of the West depends on Americans reaffirming \ntheir Western identity and westerners accepting their civilization as \nunique but not universal, and uniting to renew and preserve it against \nchallenges from nonwestern societies. Avoidance of global war of \ncivilizations depends on world leaders accepting and cooperating to \nmaintain the multi-civilizational character of global politics.\n  Simply put, Samuel Huntington says, leaders in Western nations, \nMembers of the Senate, the President of the United States and his \nCabinet, maybe we ought to concentrate on strengthening and preserving \nour values where they are cherished, they have been nourished, and they \nwork well, instead of trying to impose them on countries where they are \nnot welcome. If we do that, we will take a giant step in trying to set \nappropriate priorities in regard to our vital national security \ninterests.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia. We have concluded our remarks. I \nyield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S774-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S774-S775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \ncontinue with the consideration of S. 1134.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier today, I will attempt \nagain now to see if we can work out an agreement as to how to proceed \non the education savings account issue. I am prepared to continue \nworking to try to work something out. I think it is perfectly \nlegitimate--in fact, essential--that Senators be able to express \nthemselves on education matters as a whole and specifically as it \nrelates to this bill.\n  I think education amendments or education-related tax amendments that \nrelate to this bill are very much in order. I support that all the way. \nBut if it goes beyond that, then you get off into all kinds of other \nissues, and we will have an opportunity for that before this year is \nover. We have a long way to go. But I hope we can get serious \nconsideration, good debate and amendments, on this education savings \naccount bill and then move forward to other issues.\n  I am continuing to be hopeful that we can get an agreement to proceed \non the Export Administration Act which does have bipartisan support. \nBut we are working with the key members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Intelligence \nCommittee to make sure legitimate concerns are addressed about national \nsecurity, intelligence, and how the concurrence process works between \nCommerce and State and Defense. We still are hopeful we can get an \nagreement worked out for that.\n  For now, I renew my request and ask unanimous consent that all \namendments be relevant to the subject matter of education or related to \neducation taxes on the education savings account bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been able to consider every piece of \nlegislation so far this year in this session of Congress under \nunanimous consent agreements.\n  This is the first amendable vehicle that Members have had to try to \namend this year. There is no attempt by the minority to filibuster, to \ndelay this bill in any manner. Members on our side simply want the bill \nconsidered in the regular order, open to amendment.\n  Like the majority leader, I had the good fortune of serving in the \nHouse of Representatives. I loved my job in the House of \nRepresentatives, but there we worked under different rules. We had a \nRules Committee. Before any bill came to the House floor--in fact, the \nmajority leader served on the Rules Committee--there had to be a rule \non that bill as to how long the debate would take, how many amendments \nwould be offered, and how long for each amendment. Those are not the \nrules that have governed the Senate for 200-plus years, and they should \nnot be the rules that govern the Senate today.\n  We have clearly heard what the majority leader said today, that other \nthings we may want to bring up will be scheduled at a later time. But \nwe are not part of that scheduling process. There are issues we believe \nare necessary now in this country to be the subject of legislation. The \nonly way we can do that is through the amendment process. We believe \nthe minority should be entitled to offer amendments of their choosing. \nThere is no germaneness requirement, nor is there any necessity that \nthere be a rules committee such as in the House of Representatives. \nJust because a Member's amendment may not be relevant does not mean it \nis not important and it is not something about which we should be able \nto talk.\n\n  I say to the majority leader, we object. I would hope he would \nreconsider and allow this matter to proceed in the regular order so \namendments can be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do truly regret this objection. But as I \nhave indicated before, we will keep working to see if we can find a way \nto get an agreement to proceed.\n  I say to my colleagues, and to the American people, what is a more \nimportant issue than education? In most polls, the people indicate the \nissue they really are concerned about the most--or certainly in the top \nthree--is education. Also, the indications across the board have been \nthat people support the idea of having an opportunity to save for their \nchildren's education, not only for higher education but in some \nrespects even more importantly K through the 12th grade. This would \nallow parents to set aside up to $2,000 per year per child of their own \nmoney for their own children's education needs.\n  I emphasize, what we are trying to work out does not restrict \namendments on education, or education tax issues. Senators who have \nideas about education--local control of education, or other ways we can \nhelp the children's education--boy, I can think of a lot of amendments \nthat would be applicable here.\n  What I do not think we should do in an education debate is get into a \nwhole raft of other important issues--maybe foreign trade issues, maybe \njust foreign policy issues, maybe trade amendments, maybe defense \namendments, gun amendments--a whole myriad of amendments that Senators \ncould come up with that they would want to put on this bill, perhaps \nbecause it is the first bill.\n  Under Senate rules, Senators will have the opportunity to offer \nwhatever amendments they may be working on as we go through the year. \nIt is just that I think sometimes we get into a position where we start \noffering the same amendments over and over again. What I am trying to \ndo is get a process to get us to focus on education, have a good \ndebate, have amendments, and when that is over, pass this legislation \nthat, again, has bipartisan support.\n  There is broad support for the education savings account idea. But I \nwill continue to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle. I think \nI am offering a reasonable request. I hope we can get something worked \nout between now and next Tuesday as to how to proceed.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. However, in order to be prepared to try to get an \nindication of where Senators are--are Senators for savings education \naccounts or not?--I do send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     124, S. 1134, The Affordable Education Act of 1999:\n         Trent Lott, William V. Roth, Jr., Paul Coverdell, Slade \n           Gorton, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Rod Grams, Pete Domenici, \n           Gordon Smith, Conrad R. Burns, Don Nickles, Mike Crapo, \n           Sam Brownback, Frank H. Murkowski, Rick Santorum, Judd \n           Gregg, Tim Hutchinson.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this cloture vote then will occur on \nTuesday, unless we get something worked out where we could vitiate that \nagreement, as we did 3 weeks ago on the bankruptcy reform legislation. \nWe had a cloture motion, we saw good faith on both sides, we got an \nagreement worked out, and we vitiated that vote.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived and the cloture vote occur at 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the leader consider having that vote \nat 2:30 instead of at 2:15? We have a request for that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I amend my request to put it at 2:30 on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say sincerely to the \nmajority leader and to the majority that we should be given the \nopportunity to go forward on this bill. We are very anxious to move \nforward. We believe there is a lot to be done in education. We \ncertainly want to do that, but we want to proceed under the regular \nrules of the Senate. That does not seem to be asking too much. We are \nnot going to object to the waiver of the quorum and those kinds of \nthings, but I will say, if we are not able to work something out before \nTuesday at 2:30, I will recommend to all Democratic Senators, all the \nminority, that we vote against invoking cloture on this issue. That \nwould be too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of the agreement, there will be no \nfurther votes today. We do have a number of Senators who have requested \ntime during morning business, and I will have a unanimous consent on \nthat momentarily.\n  The Senate will be in session on Monday debating this very important \nissue, education, and education for our children at the 4th-grade \nlevel, the 8th-grade level, and the 10th-grade level, and the merits of \nbeing able to save a little of your own money for your own children's \neducation. I find it hard to believe that every Democrat is going to \nwalk down and vote against going forward on education savings \naccounts--I think that is going to be hard to explain--because they \nwant to offer an unrelated, nongermane amendment. But if the Democrats \nare prepared to do that, then we will just have to deal with that. The \nnext rollcall vote, however, will occur then at 2:30 on Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S775-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, as chairman of the International Trade \nSubcommittee, I rise to express extreme disappointment about a very \nadverse decision to the United States handed down in Geneva today by \nthe World Trade Organization appellate body in the Foreign Sales \nCorporation case, sometimes called the FSC case.\n  I suppose I should not be standing here on the floor crying about the \nUnited States losing a case before the World Trade Organization because \nwe win most of these cases. The reason I am so disappointed in this one \nis that I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose \nof our Foreign Sales Corporation tax law. From that standpoint, when we \nrely so much on income taxes and the European Community relies so much \non value-added taxes, this sales corporation tax law is to equalize the \nplaying field between Europe and the United States on a lot of key \nmanufactured products.\n  The appellate body decision essentially means the Foreign Sales \nCorporation rules in our Tax Code violate the WTO rules. As I \nindicated, the appellate body fundamentally misunderstood the nature \nand the intent of the Foreign Sales Corporation plan. The FSC plan was \ndesigned to address the competitive disadvantage faced by United States \nbusinesses that compete with foreign firms in European countries that \nhave value-added tax regimes. When products from countries with a \nvalue-added tax regime are exported, they typically get rebates. \nHowever, in the United States, because we rely upon the corporate \nincome tax and not on a value-added tax, our exporting firms don't \nenjoy this type of tax benefit. This obviously makes our exports less \ncompetitive in world markets. The FSC rules were designed, then, to \ncreate a level playing field with these European tax systems.\n  The appellate body decision is a very serious development because it \ncomes at a time when the World Trade Organization itself is under \nattack. In my view, these attacks are unwarranted and unjustified, but \npolitically we have to deal with them. It will probably be the case, in \none or the other body of this Congress, that we will even be voting \nthis year on the issue of whether or not the United States ought to \nstay as a member of the World Trade Organization. I think they should, \nbut this case could impact that decision.\n  Of course, we must not allow this setback to undermine either the \nWorld Trade Organization or our support for this vital institution. I \nwill do everything I can to make sure this does not happen. In the \nmeantime, I strongly urge President Clinton to attempt to negotiate a \nsettlement with the European Union that modifies or overturns this \nappellate body's decision. This should be President Clinton's No. 1 \npriority at the G-8 summit in Okinawa later this year.\n  I also call upon the European Union not to take any retaliatory \naction against the United States until we, through our President, have \nthe opportunity to personally discuss this case in Okinawa at the \nsummit there.\n  We must make sure we observe the rule of law in this case and in \nevery case involving international trade disputes. We expect no less \nfrom our trading partners, and we must do the same. And since we win \nthe vast majority of these cases, we find ourselves not in a bad \nposition by taking this moral stand.\n  But I hope when we address this case, we bear in mind that while the \noutcome of the case itself is very important, there is something else \nat stake; that is, the integrity of our international trading system. \nWe must remember that the WTO benefits every farmer and every business \nthat sells its goods and services in foreign markets. If we did not \nhave a WTO and, more importantly, the discipline in the rule of law in \ninternational trade that goes with it, we would have only the rule of \nthe jungle. Those who would suffer the most would be the small \nexporters.\n  In the United States, two-thirds of all businesses that export have \n20 or fewer employees. It is, then, the WTO that prevents these small \nfirms from being dominated by their larger competitors in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Let's make sure we get an appropriate and fair resolution of this \ncase, and let's make sure we maintain our strong support for the World \nTrade Organization.\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed by the WTO \nappellate body's decision on the FSC. The panelists completely ignored \neconomic reality. The FSC is not an export subsidy. It is a remedy for \nthe competitive disadvantage our firms face in the marketplace due to \nthe tax practices of other WTO members, particularly the members of the \nEuropean Union.\n  That said, the real problem here is not the appellate body's \ndecision, but the underlying WTO rules. That, and the perverse decision \nby the European Commission, over the objection of many of its own firms \nand member countries, to reopen this trade dispute 20 years after we \nhad reached a satisfactory settlement of these issues.\n  Other WTO members, particularly in the European Union, employ a \nterritorial-based tax system that does not tax foreign source income, \nincluding income from exports. That system affords a competitive \nadvantage to firms operating in those jurisdictions that the U.S. tax \nsystem, based on worldwide reporting of income, does not. The WTO rules \ncurrently permit the use of territorial based tax systems, despite the \ncompetitive benefits they confer on products exported from those \ncountries. That is what the FSC and the DISC before it were designed to \noffset.\n  I want to be absolutely clear about my view on this. While I fully \nexpect we will live up to our obligations, no resolution of this issue \ncan leave our firms, our farmers, and the American worker at a \npermanent competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\n  Indeed, I thought we had put this issue to rest with our European \ncounterparts 20 years ago. But, they saw fit to abrogate the agreement \nwe had reached to resolve our prior dispute over the trade effects of \ntheir tax system and our attempts to redress those effects. That \nagreement included the understanding that, in the future, we would take \nour differences over tax policy to fora that were specifically designed \nfor that purpose, and not the GATT or the WTO.\n  The reason for that understanding was simple. The GATT and the WTO \nare essentially agreements to reduce trade barriers and avoid other \ndiscriminatory trade practices. Nothing in those rules was intended to \nforce a member country to choose between competing tax systems. Yet, \nthat is the net effect of the current ruling.\n  The Europeans' action raises a far broader point about the conduct of \ntheir trade policy. The decision to abrogate our 20-year-old agreement \nand bring the FSC case, by all accounts, was not made at the behest of \nthe EU member countries. Nor was it made at the insistence of EU firms \ncomplaining that the FSC somehow put them at a commercial disadvantage. \nThat is because European firms understand that they already benefit \nfrom the territorial-based tax systems and the FSC was simply a way of \nproviding equivalent treatment under our system of taxation. In fact, a \nnumber of those European-based firms have U.S. subsidiaries that take \nadvantage of the FSC as well.\n  The decision to bring the FSC case was made at the European \nCommission without consideration either for its political impact here \nor for its impact on the trading system. In that sense, the decision to \nbring the FSC case fits with the Commission's attitude on our disputes \non bananas and beef and on other WTO disputes. The Commission seems to \nhave forgotten that the European Union member countries are, along with \nthe United States, among the principal beneficiaries of the WTO system \nand that the Commission bears the responsibility to shore the system \nup, rather than engaging in tactics designed to weaken it.\n  Both the Commission's decision to flout the WTO rules in the beef and \nbananas disputes and the reckless decision to bring the FSC case are \ndeeply inconsistent with that responsibility. This case was brought, \nnot for any European constituency, but for the Commission's own petty \npolitical interest in balancing its losses before the WTO with a few \nwins, regardless of the larger consequences for the trading system.\n  This issue must be made a top priority in discussions at the upcoming \nG-8 summit. President Clinton must make the political point to his \nEuropean counterparts that they, not the Commission, are responsible \nfor setting the course of the European Union's trade policy and that \nthis issue needs to be resolved in terms that ensure a level-playing \nfield for American workers, farmers, and firms. As chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I am committed to making that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S776-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S776-S777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STABILIZING CRUDE OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the gouging of the \nAmerican consumer, particularly high energy users and, probably most \nimportantly, working Americans who are paying such high gasoline prices \nbecause of OPEC. I do this in the context of supporting a resolution \nSenator Ashcroft is offering the Senate. I do this not only because he \nis my good friend but because he knows the impact on working Americans \nand on agriculture.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to communicate to the \nleaders of the OPEC nations and even non-OPEC cartel producers, prior \nto the next meeting of the OPEC nations in March, the importance of \nstabilizing crude oil prices.\n  I appreciate the importance of the message by my good friend from \nMissouri. He realizes the significance of this issue because he is from \na State with vital interests in the health and well-being of the \nagricultural economy and the transportation industry. The soaring \nprices of diesel fuel and of gasoline have had an especially \ndetrimental effect upon farmers and truckers whose livelihood is tied \nclosely to the input costs.\n  We in the Senate should not stand idly by while a foreign monopoly \ndictates our States' economic stability.\n  Remember, if oil company CEOs were doing this sort of OPEC price \nfixing, they would be in prison for violating the antitrust laws. We \nobviously can't apply our law to foreign countries in the sense that \ntheir leaders are violating them. But it is antithetical to the \nprinciples of free trade and markets, even to the WTO. Saudi Arabia \nwants to get into the WTO. We should not be supporting their entry into \nthe WTO if they are using their economic power in a way that is \nantithetical to the very organization they want to join.\n  Just in the past month, gasoline prices in my State have taken their \nbiggest jump in 10 years. We now pay an average of $1.38 a gallon for \ngas, an average of 17 cents higher than last month and 48 cents higher \nthan in February a year ago. Diesel prices in my State are averaging \n$1.45, which is 12 cents more than last month and 43 cents higher than \na year ago.\n  When considering the family farmers' plight, OPEC's action creates a \nharsh duty that is applied to every bushel of corn, soybeans, and any \nother agricultural product produced in the United States. Anyone who is \nfarming can tell you that fuel expenditures are always one of the most \ncostly inputs on the farm.\n  The agricultural industry has not fared as well in recent years. Just \nlast year, prices for all kinds of livestock and grain commodities were \nat their lowest since the 1970s. The outlook for the next year is, at \nbest, mixed. At a time when margins on farm products are already tight, \nOPEC has consciously increased the price of petroleum products and \nexpenditures within our agricultural community. It is not the free \nforces of the marketplace that are doing this. These are political \ndecisions that we ought to stand firmly against.\n  But this isn't just about family farmers and truckers. Sometimes we \nforget that trucking impacts almost every industry. While farmers and \ntruckers might feel the most immediate impact from this action in my \nhome State of Iowa, it is really true that all consumers will \neventually feel the far-reaching effects of OPEC's marketplace \nshenanigans. In Iowa alone, trucks transport freight for 4,438 \nmanufacturing companies, supply goods to 19,500 retail stores, and \nstock almost 9,000 wholesale trade companies.\n  Trucks supply goods to 2,359 agricultural businesses and deliver the \nproduce and products to market. Annually, trucks transport \napproximately 160 million tons in and out of Iowa. Eighty-three percent \nof all manufactured freight transported in Iowa is carried by trucks, \nand over 75 percent of all communities in Iowa depend entirely on \ntrucks for the delivery of the\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\nproducts my constituents use every day.\n  OPEC's action has and will continue to drive up costs for \ntransportation, and the bottom line is that the consumer will \neventually be forced to bear the burden of the cost. As anyone can see, \nthis situation has the ability to have a substantial detrimental impact \non the economies of Iowa and the entire Nation.\n  For this reason, I have tried to address this problem from every \nangle available to me. I recently wrote to Energy Secretary Bill \nRichardson and asked him to encourage the President to use the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize the price of petroleum \nproducts. As he is well aware, the President has the power to use the \nreserve when a very sharp increase in petroleum prices threatens the \nNation's economic stability. In my opinion, the current situation meets \nthis test. At the very least, the option should be heavily weighed.\n  I also sent a letter to Mr. Stanley Fisher, First Deputy Managing \nDirector of the International Monetary Fund, to ask that the market-\ndistorting behavior of the 11 members of OPEC be weighed when these \nnations apply for loans. Twenty percent of the IMF money comes from the \nAmerican taxpayers. We should not be using U.S. taxpayers' money to \nfurther the causes of an economy that is anticompetitive and is \nstrangling the economy of the very taxpayers who support the IMF.\n  IMF is an international organization of 182 member nations. Each \nmember of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also \nbelongs to the International Monetary Fund.\n  Due to the fact that the IMF's purpose is to promote monetary \ncooperation and economic growth, I find it disheartening that the \nmember nations of OPEC have chosen a course of action which adversely \naffects economic growth and stability in the United States. It is for \nthis reason I ask the IMF to consider developing criteria to judge \nmarket-distorting behavior which would be weighed when nations \nexhibiting monopolistic behavior apply for loans through the IMF.\n  I also spoke out against Saudi Arabia previously in my remarks and \nabout their joining the World Trade Organization. I have made this a \nformal request of U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.\n  As we all know, we have become far too dependent upon foreign oil. \nFor a very long time, I have been a leading advocate for the \ndevelopment and expanded use of renewable sources of energy, especially \ncorn-based ethanol as well as wind energy and biomass. I have been \nsuccessful in getting tax credits applied to these alternative forms of \nenergy. I thank my colleagues for their support of that.\n  You have all heard me say that not only is clean-burning ethanol good \nfor the rural economy and the environment, it helps to reduce America's \ndangerous and expensive dependence on foreign sources of energy. I am \ndisappointed it took a crisis to make some people aware of this \nunhealthy addiction, but now we should all see how our dependence on \nforeign crude can impact our economy and why we should seek to develop \ndomestically-based renewable fuel sources.\n  This is a very important issue, and I applaud the resolution offered \nby the Senator from Missouri. I thank him for bringing the resolution \nto the floor and for helping to bring this issue to the attention of \nthe Clinton-Gore administration, which needs to finally get on top of \nthis growing problem.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will reserve that for use at a later time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed under the \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S777-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S777-S778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to carry on a little bit regarding \nthe colloquy we have had on the floor during the day about the need for \nus to proceed as the Senate has always worked in the 200-plus years of \nthis Republic. I asked staff during this intermission time to pull for \nme at random a bill we worked on when we were in the majority. They \nchose a bill that doesn't have a really sexy title but which is very \nimportant; it is called the Enterprise Zone Tax Incentives Act. On that \npiece of legislation, there were 109 amendments filed. This bill was \ntaken up on September 25, 1992.\n  We completed this bill 3 or 4 days later and it was passed. The \nEnterprise Zone Tax Incentive Act dealt with scholarship tax, dental \nschools, tractors--many things that really weren't relevant or germane \nto this particular piece of legislation. But we dealt with it. We \nallowed the minority to offer whatever amendments they wanted, and we \nproceeded with the legislation. That is what we need to do. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about. I hope everybody will understand we are \nnot asking to break some new territory, new ground, or do something \nthat was never done before. We simply want to say that once in a while \nwe need a piece of legislation to which we can offer amendments.\n  Now, we are very happy to be discussing education. I believe it is \nthe most important issue facing the country today, and my pet project \non which I have worked for a number of years with the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, is high school dropouts. Three-thousand kids a \nday--500,000 children each year--drop out of school in America.\n  That is something we need to work on. That is only one aspect of \neducation that is important. We know about school construction. We know \nabout smaller class sizes. There are lots of things we need to do in \neducation. There are other important things we need to work on. I think \nwe should have a debate about Social Security. I think we have to do \nsomething right away about Medicare and the attachment of prescription \ndrug benefits. Which is very important to our seniors.\n  In the 35 years since Medicare came into being, we now have people's \nlives being saved as a result of people being able to get prescription \ndrugs. Senior citizens have an average of 18 different prescriptions \nfilled during a period of a year. That is the average. Some have more \nthan that. We need to do something about prescription drug benefits.\n  Certainly we need to do something to have reasonable gun control. All \nwe are asking is that you are not able to buy weapons at gun shows \nwithout a background check. With pawnshops, the same should apply, as \nit applies every place else where you buy a gun in stores.\n  We think we should do something updating the minimum wage. We think \nthere are so many issues that deserve our attention, notwithstanding \nthe terrible health care delivery system we have in this country. Over \n40 million people have no health insurance. Every year it is going up \n1.5 million.\n  We need to pass a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. The lucky \npeople are those with insurance, but even they aren't being treated \nfairly.\n  Referring again to the Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive Act, H.R. 11, in \nSeptember of 1992, we spent less than 4 days on this piece of \nlegislation. We dealt with 109 amendments and passed a bill.\n  If we had gone to work on this education bill on Monday, the bill \nwould have been completed today. But the way things are happening, we \nare not working the will of the Senate, and we are not working the will \nof the people of this country. I think we need to do that as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for \na quick question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. He can answer them in a relatively brief fashion, I \nthink.\n  First of all, is it not true that when his party was the majority \nparty in the Senate the minority party would come out with many \namendments to a piece of legislation and sometimes we would have 100 \namendments?\n  I want to get to the definition of what ``relevant'' means so people \nfollowing this will know what that definition is.\n  Is it not true that we would have many amendments and we would \nbasically debate these amendments and then after several days of hard \nwork, even if we had to work 14 hours a day, we would go forward and \npass that legislation? That is one of the ways you\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\nrepresent people back home. If there is a compelling issue, you offer \nan amendment to a piece of legislation and you hope to pass it.\n  I remember the amendment on mental health parity that I offered with \nSenator Domenici. It was an amendment on housing on the veterans \nappropriations bill.\n  Will the Senator from Nevada not agree with me that is the way the \nSenate has always conducted its business?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is yes. They have the right to offer amendments. \nSometimes they offer an amendment and debate it.\n  I see my friend, who I came to Congress with in 1982, from Florida, \nthe senior Senator from Florida. I have been talking about this H.R. \n11. On that particular piece of legislation, the Senator from Florida \noffered five amendments.\n  The Senator from Florida had some good reasons to offer every one of \nthese amendments. For example, you would ask: Why did he offer an \namendment dealing with tractors to the Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive \nAct? I don't know. I am sure he had a good reason for doing so. They \nhad a right to offer the amendments, and they offered them.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on this particular piece of legislation \nthat Senator Coverdell introduced, which we have been debating, will \nthe Senator from Nevada not agree with me that the kind of amendment, \nfor example, I wanted to offer to this legislation dealing with the \nhunger of children, dealing with the poverty of children, dealing with \nhow to deal with the violence in children's lives in their homes would \nnot be considered to be by the definition of ``relevant'' relevant? Yet \nit affects education and children's lives. There have been hardly any \nopportunities over the whole last year to come out on the floor with \namendments to different pieces of legislation. Is that not true? So it \ngets to the point where you can't even represent people back in the \nState as a Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe there are times when we should \nenter into unanimous consent agreements to move legislation. We have \nbeen willing to do that. We have done that time after time in an effort \nto complete things that are important.\n  As I said earlier, I say to my friend from Minnesota, we need \nopportunities. It should be all the time, but I will settle for \nopportunities once in awhile to have a bill on which we can offer \namendments. We might want to offer an amendment dealing with tractors. \nI should be able to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S778-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CAPITOL HILL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to raise a question \nwhich I can't believe I have to keep raising over and over again.\n  Many of us attended the services for Officer Chestnut and Agent \nGibson. They were part of the Capitol Hill police force. They were here \nevery day not only protecting Senators and Representatives but the \npublic. I started speaking about this before. We had the 1-week break. \nI want to come back to this again. This is the one issue on which I \nwant to focus.\n  We made a commitment to do everything we could possibly do to make \nsure the officers were as safe as possible and would never have to go \nthrough this kind of hell again, for families and for loved ones, and \nthat the public would be safe. Part of that commitment was the idea \nthat surely at the different stations, especially those with the most \npublic, we would have at least two officers.\n  This morning, again--I think it is the Second Street or C Street \nentrance, the barricaded part of the Hart Building--at about 10 o'clock \nin the morning when I came in there was one police officer with all \nsorts of people. There must have been about 20 people streaming in. \nThat one officer is in peril, and the public is in peril.\n  I cannot believe we have not lived up to our commitment. I say to \ncolleagues that it is pretty simple. I think the Senate Sergeant at \nArms said this: A, we need to pass a supplemental appropriations bill \nso that you can use overtime in the short run to do the staffing so we \nhave two officers at each one of these stations, or each one of these \nposts; and, B--I applauded the Senate Sergeant at Arms--we need to hire \nabout 100 more officers so that on a permanent basis we can staff and \nhave two officers at each one of these posts.\n\n  I am telling you, colleagues, what we have done is absolutely \nunconscionable, or what we have not done. How in the world can whoever \nmakes these appropriations decisions--given all we have been through, \ngiven all of our concern and all of the commitment we have made, given \nthe service we attended for the two officers who were slain--how can we \nnot put the resources into this so our officers are safe, and, for that \nmatter, so we are safe and the public is safe?\n  I for the life of me don't get it. I honest to goodness don't get it. \nI think that every day I am going to come out and mention this. I can't \nbelieve this.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The Senator from Minnesota knows I support him on this issue. I am \nthe only former Capitol Hill police officer serving in the Senate. I \nknow the importance of the issue on which he has spoken. I followed the \nSenator on a number of occasions, and I back up everything he said. I \nagree with him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Having talked to the Senate Sergeant at Arms, I think \nthat Senators who care about this issue--and I think all do--need to \nmake sure our voices are heard. We support the Capitol Police.\n  On the House side, there seems to be some slowness on a decision \nabout whether or not we will pass through the supplemental \nappropriations bill and whether or not we will do the job here.\n  I say to colleagues one more time, I think this is a scandal. I think \nit is an absolute scandal. We have two officers that have lost their \nlives. I believe we have made a commitment to the police officers and \nto their families. I think we have to do much better. It won't happen \nright away, but at least the decisions need to be made so we can do the \nstaffing to make sure we have two officers at each post.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Mack, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, be \nrecognized for 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  Mr. MACK. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will make sure that Senator Hollings has \n15 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South Carolina be \nallowed to speak for 15 minutes, following Senator Murkowski. The \nSenator from Washington has agreed to allow the Senator to speak before \nhim. That will be about 30 minutes from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, there was a press conference today held \nby the National Campaign for Jobs and Income. There were some very \ndramatic findings reported. This is directly relevant to the debate we \nwere having with the majority leader. They reported today in a \nprosperous country, we still have about 35 million poor Americans and \n13 million of those Americans are children. They reported that while \nthe administration and other Senators and Representatives boast about \nhaving cut the welfare rolls in half, we actually have just made a \nsmall, hardly any, dent in reducing poverty.\n  Remember, the goal of the welfare bill was to move people from \nwelfare to economic self-sufficiency.\n  They report that the poorest children in America are getting poorer. \nThat is worth repeating: The poorest children in America are getting \npoorer.\n  They report there is a whole group of people, mothers and children, \nremaining in poverty. Many are families under tremendous stress and \nstrain. Perhaps a mother has struggled with substance abuse; a mother \nwho is a single parent has a severely disabled child; a mother has been \nbattered, beaten up over and over again. About every 13 seconds in \nAmerica, a woman is battered in her home.\n  There is precious little evidence these families will be able to move \nto work. Pretty soon, depending on the State, they will be pushed off a \ncliff.\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\n We have no safety net left as a result of the welfare bill.\n  They report there is not one State in the country where the average \nearnings is even close to the poverty level income. The vast majority \nof the jobs are barely above minimum-wage jobs, and after 1 year the \nfamilies lose their health care coverage and are not able to get good \nchild care for their children, sometimes not any child care.\n\n  Given those findings, I think it should give Members pause that we \nare actually seeing an increase in the poverty of the poorest children \nin America; it should give Members pause.\n  It is amazing that State governments with the TANF money have about \n$7 billion they have not spent--$7 billion. There are all the needs for \naffordable child care, for training, especially for additional support \nservices for families that are under unbelievable strain, are mainly \nwomen and children in need of affordable housing, sometimes \ntransportation. All of this compelling need and these families are \nunder tremendous pressure trying to survive under very difficult \nconditions, and the money we have allocated to these States, $7 \nbillion, is not being spent. Albeit, some of it can be put in a rainy \nday fund and maybe should be because who knows if the business cycle \nwill stay up forever.\n  Six States--Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, New York, Texas, and \nWisconsin--transferred $800 million from the TANF surpluses to funding \nprograms other than those that serve poor families. Quite often it ends \nup as general tax rebates, not to the poor. This year, Minnesota is \ndoing much better with the TANF money. Last year, I am not proud of \nwhat the Minnesota Government did.\n  My point is simple:\n  No. 1, the amount of unspent TANF money in the States has reached $7 \nbillion, an enormous amount of money.\n  No. 2, this money has been unspent despite the persistent level of \npoverty that exists in our country, especially among women and \nchildren. And for children, the poorest of poor children, their poverty \nhas increased and some of the States are not spending the money to help \nthem.\n  No. 3, these low-income families are not receiving the services and \nthe support they need to move out of poverty, which is what this bill \nwas supposed to be all about.\n  No. 4, although some States are developing innovative programs, other \nStates are diverting TANF money to pay for tax cuts or other programs \nthat are not even targeted to the poor.\n  No. 5, in a time of unprecedented economic growth, there are all \nsorts of ways in which the States could be using this money to invest \nin children, to make sure that families can move from welfare to \neconomic self-sufficiency, and they are not.\n  Conclusion: Don't we write the checks? Doesn't this money come from \nthe Congress and the Federal Government? I think we have the \nresponsibility to ensure that the States are spending the TANF money in \nways that meet the goals of the program, which is to move families out \nof welfare into jobs so they can support themselves.\n  We should insist that the TANF money is spent to help struggling \nfamilies--not put into a surplus, or not to be given back as tax \nrebates to citizens across the board. I think it is an abuse of the \nprogram.\n  In this TANF reauthorization, that will be my work as a Senator. I \nhope other Senators will join. I oppose the bill. I am glad I oppose \nthe bill. Those in favor of the bill should be the first to want to \nmake sure the money is spent the way it is supposed to be spent. We \nshould insist on accountability.\n  Second, I will come back with an amendment. That is what the debate \nwith the majority leader is about. I am a Senator most vocal about \nhaving the right to bring amendments to this bill. I want an amendment \nthat says we should have a policy evaluation of what is happening to \nthe poor children.\n  Don't tell me that is not relevant to their education, but it \nwouldn't be relevant to this piece of legislation as defined by the \ndefinition of ``relevant.'' It would be an amendment, and I do not have \na right to offer that amendment--so says the majority leader.\n  But this is compelling. The poverty of children is compelling. The \npoverty of the poorest of children is compelling. As a Senator who \nspent most of his adult life working in many of these communities, I \nwant to have some amendments that deal with the poverty of children and \nI want to have the right to introduce those amendments to this bill. As \na Senator from Minnesota, I don't want to continue to be shut out, by \nthe majority, of my right to come out here and fight for people. \nBasically, that has been the strategy for almost this whole last year.\n  I hope Democrats will, basically, not let themselves be rolled. I \nhope Democrats will say: As Democrats, as the minority party, we are \ngoing to insist on the same rights as the minority party had when we \nwere the majority. It is a very important principle. But it is not just \ninsider politics. It is all about whether or not, when you go home to \nyour State and meet with people, and you know their problems, you want \nto do better for people--it is whether or not you can be a legislator \nand come out here with amendments and debate and fight for people for \nwhom you want to fight. So if there is no agreement, I certainly hope \nthe Democrats will support one another on what I think is a very \nimportant question.\n  Back to the substantive issue, I hope my colleagues will take a look \nat what is being done to this welfare bill with this TANF money. We \nhave some troubling data from which we cannot turn our gaze. Most of \nthese families who are now working, 670,000 people, are no longer \ncovered by medical assistance since this bill was passed because after \n1 year they are off. Hardly any of these mothers have living-wage jobs. \nWe just had a report a few weeks ago that the child care situation for \ntheir children ranges from dangerous to barely adequate. Just because \nthey are poor children does not mean they are not entitled to good \nchild care.\n  We have had this dramatic decline in food stamp participation. We \nhave no idea why. It is certainly not because there has been much of a \ndecrease in poverty. We see the rise of hunger and the use of food \nshelves in our country. But the States have $7 billion they are sitting \non. They came here and said: Trust us, just give us the money; we will \ndo the best with it.\n  But quite often low-income families, poor families, whether they are \npeople of color or white people, do not have much clout. It is up to us \nto say: We are a national community. There are certain values we hold \ndear. There are certain things as a national community we hold dear. \nOne of them is, by gosh, there are going to be some standards everyone \nis going to have to meet because whether a child eats or not, whether \nor not there is decent housing, whether or not a family is able to make \nends meet, whether or not children are able to look forward to a good \nlife, should not depend on the State in which they live.\n  We make a commitment as a national community, especially to the most \nvulnerable citizens in our country, who are children, who are poor \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S779-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S779-S782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BROTHERS TO THE RESCUE \n                               SHOOTDOWN\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate \nfour brave Americans. Theirs is a story of courage, it is a story of \nheroism, and it is a story of freedom.\n  Four years ago today, on February 24, 1996, Fidel Castro sent Cuban \nMiG fighters into the Florida Straits and killed Carlos Costa, Armando \nAlejandre, Mario de la Pena, and Pablo Morales.\n  These men were members of a humanitarian organization known as \n``Brothers to the Rescue.'' These volunteers search the Florida Straits \nfor rafters. Too many Cubans die each year in their flight to freedom. \nThe Brothers try to save lives.\n  So my thoughts and prayers today are with the families of the brave \nand courageous humanitarians who lost their lives 4 years ago. I know \nthis day must be especially difficult for the families--today reminds \nthem of the terrible loss suffered, and today also\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nmarks another year passed without closure.\n  People need to be able to put the past behind them and move on. But \nwhen the President and his administration give assurances and advice, \nand American families trust and obey this advice only to be dragged \nalong and let down, the administration commits a great injustice.\n  Think for a moment about Armando's sister or Mario's mother, or any \nother family member. Think for a moment, how you would feel if your \nbrother or son was murdered while volunteering with a humanitarian \norganzation--killed by state-of-the-art fighter jets flown by the air \nforce of one of the world's last totalitarian dictators? I know the \npain for me would be unbearable.\n  I join with the families today in remembering these brave men. I want \nto tell their story of freedom, their story of courage, and their story \nof heroism.\n  Armando came to the United States from Cuba as a child. He so loved \nhis life here, his freedom, that he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and \nvolunteered for a tour in Vietnam. He volunteered to fight for his \nadopted home. He survived his tour only to be murdered by Fidel Castro. \nHe was 45 years old. His wife of 21 years and his daughter have now \nlived with the struggle for justice for 4 years. They are in our \nthoughts today.\n  Carlos, a Florida native, was 29 years old when the Cuban government \nshot him out of the sky. He was always interested in aviation and \ndreamed of one day overseeing the operations of a major airport. He \nreceived his college degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University \nand worked for the Dade County Aviation Department. His parents and \nsister today are in our thoughts.\n  Mario, a New Jersey native, was only 24 years old when Castro's MiG's \ntook his life. He was in his last semester at Embry-Riddle, working \ntoward his dream of becoming an airline pilot. His parents and brother \nare in our thoughts today.\n  Pablo left Cuba on a raft in 1992, and the Brothers to the Rescue \nsaved his life. Indebted to these heroic pilots, he joined them and \nbegan training to obtain his pilot's license. Pablo often talked of his \nfamily still in Cuba and how much he missed them. Since his death, \nthere are reports that they have been persecuted and discriminated \nagainst. Our thoughts are with his family in Cuba today.\n  Remember, as you think of these men this afternoon, what they were \ndoing when they lost their lives--they were working to save the lives \nof others. This humanitarian effort must have so enraged Fidel Castro \nthat he ordered the interception of these small, unarmed aircraft by \nhis huge fighter jets to be blown from the sky with air-to-air \nmissiles.\n  Two days after their murder four days ago, the President so moved by \nthis tragedy said on national television;\n\n       I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will \n     provide immediate compensation to the families, something to \n     which they are entitled under international law, out of \n     Cuba's blocked assets here in the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo items which detail this President's request for legislation. First, \na transcript of ABC Breaking News February 26, 1996, with Peter \nJennings; and second, the White House press release dated February 26, \n1996 in which the President requests this legislation from the \nCongress. I ask that this be printed immediately following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MACK. Two months later the Congress passed the bill--the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1996--and the President signed it in a large ceremony \non the White House lawn.\n  The Brothers' families wanted to understand the new rules before they \nchose to proceed with any civil suit. They met with officials from the \nU.S. State Department to clarify the meaning of the new law.\n  In their meeting at the State Department, the families were told the \nU.S. Government encouraged them to file the civil lawsuit against the \nCuban government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an affidavit by Maggie \nKhule which documents State Department support for the lawsuit be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, they took the Cuban Government to court. It \ntook a long time, but eventually they won. In December of 1997, almost \n2 years ago, a United States Federal court entered judgments against \nCuba for the murders of their family members. Justice seemed to be won. \nThe end appeared to be near. But the very same U.S. Government and the \nsame Clinton administration that encouraged the families to postpone \nclosure and pursue legal justice began to oppose them. They entered the \nlawsuit on the side of Fidel Castro.\n  I quote from Maggie Khule's testimony of last October before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and Maggie Khule is the sister of Armando \nAlejandre:\n\n       No words can possibly explain our shock when we went to \n     court and found U.S. attorneys sitting down at the same table \n     as Cuba's attorneys. How can you explain to a mother who has \n     lost her son, to a wife who has lost her husband, to a \n     daughter who has lost her father, that their own government \n     is taking the murderer's side? . . . The Clinton \n     administration has shut its doors to us. Secretary of State \n     Albright, for example, won't meet with us on any of our other \n     concerns because, to quote an aide, ``We are on the opposing \n     side of this civil action.'' Are we? We thought we were the \n     victims' families, victims ourselves. We thought we were \n     Americans entitled to protection from our own country. We \n     thought Cuba was the terrorist, the guilty party.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a moment from their busy \nschedules today, on this fourth anniversary of the murder of four brave \nhumanitarians, and think about the blight of terrorism and the cost it \nhas extracted from too many families of our country.\n  Think also this afternoon about what we ask to deter terrorism and \npromote justice. I want to read one more quote, this time from a \nFederal judge who heard the case brought by the families against Cuba. \nAfter observing this administration's change of position from support \nto opposition, he states the following in the March 1999 ruling:\n\n       The court notes with great concern that the very President \n     who in 1996 decried this terrorist action by the Government \n     of Cuba now sends the Department of Justice to argue before \n     this court that Cuba's blocked assets ought not to be used to \n     compensate the families of the U.S. nationals murdered by \n     Cuba. The executive branch's approach to this situation has \n     been inconsistent at best. It apparently believes that \n     shielding a terrorist state's assets are more important than \n     compensating for the loss of American lives.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this section of the \ncourt's decision be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the story of these four brothers, the \nBrothers to the Rescue, is a story of heroism and freedom. These men \nrisked their lives for their own freedom as well as for the freedom of \nothers, and their families have fought tirelessly for justice. I hope \nmy colleagues will think about these courageous families. We must, \nindeed, honor them and their memories and the memories of their loved \nones this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n              Transcript From ABC News, February 26, 1996\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Announcer. This is a special report from ABC News.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Pres. Bill Clinton. Good afternoon. Two days ago, in broad \n     daylight, and without justification, Cuban military aircraft \n     shot down two civilian planes in international airspace. \n     Search and rescue efforts by the Coast Guard, which began \n     immediately after we received word of the incident, have \n     failed to find any of the four individuals who were aboard \n     the airplanes.\n       These small airplanes were unarmed, and clearly so. Cuban \n     authorities knew that. The planes posed no credible threat to \n     Cuba's security. Although the group that operated the planes \n     had entered Cuban airspace in the past on other flights, this \n     is no excuse for the attack and provides--let me emphasize--\n     no legal basis under international law for the attack. We \n     must be clear, this shooting of civilian aircraft out of the \n     air was a flagrant violation of international law.\n       Saturday's attack is further evidence that Havana has \n     become more desperate in its efforts to deny freedom to the \n     people of Cuba.\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\n       Also on Saturday, the Cuban Council, a broad group that \n     wants to bring democracy to Cuba, had planned a day of \n     peaceful discussion and debate. Instead, in the days leading \n     up to this gathering, scores of activists were arrested and \n     detained. Two have already been sentenced to long prison \n     terms. They join about 1,000 others in Cuba who are in jail \n     solely because of their desire for freedom.\n       Now the downing of these planes demands a firm response \n     from both the United States and the international community.\n       I am pleased that the European Union today strongly \n     condemned the action.\n       Last night, on my instructions, Ambassador Albright \n     convened an emergency session of the United Nations Security \n     Council to condemn the Cuban action and to present the case \n     for sanctions on Cuba until it agrees to abide by its \n     obligation to respect civilian aircraft and until it \n     compensates the families of the victims.\n       Today I am also ordering the following unilateral actions.\n       First, I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will \n     provide immediate compensation to the families--something to \n     which they are entitled under international law--out of \n     Cuba's block assets here in the United States. If Congress \n     passes this legislation, we can provide the compensation \n     immediately.\n       Second, I will move promptly to reach agreement with the \n     Congress on the pending Helms-Burton Cuba legislation so that \n     it will enhance the embargo in a way that advances the cause \n     of democracy in Cuba.\n       Third, I have ordered that Radio Marti expand its reach. \n     All the people of Cuba must be able to learn the truth about \n     the regime in Havana, the isolation it has earned for itself \n     through its contempt for basic human rights and international \n     law.\n       Fourth, I am ordering that additional restrictions be put \n     on travel in the United States by Cuban officials who reside \n     here and that visits by Cuban officials to our country be \n     further limited.\n       Finally, all charter air travel from the United States to \n     Cuba will be suspended indefinitely.\n       These deliberate actions are the right ones at this time. \n     They respond to Havana in a way that serves our goals of \n     accelerating the arrival of democracy in Cuba, but I am not \n     ruling out any further steps in the future, should they be \n     required.\n       Saturday's attack, was an appalling reminder of the nature \n     of the Cuban regime--repressive, violent, scornful of \n     international law. In our time democracy has swept the globe, \n     from the Philippines exactly 10 years ago, to Central and \n     Eastern Europe, to South Africa, to Haiti, to all but one \n     nation in our hemisphere. I will do everything in my power to \n     see that this historic tide reaches the shores of Cuba.\n       And let me close by extending, on behalf of our family and \n     our country, our deepest condolences to those in the families \n     of those who lost their lives.\n       Thank you very much.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Feb. 26, 1996\n\n                           Fact Sheet on Cuba\n\n       The President has directed his Administration to take the \n     following steps immediately in response to the Cuban \n     Government's blatant violation of international law:\n       Seek rapid international condemnation of Cuba's actions.\n       The European Union today strongly condemned the Cuban \n     shootdown.\n       The United States will seek United Nations Security Council \n     condemnation and press that sanctions be imposed until Cuba \n     provides compensation to the families of victims and abides \n     by international law.\n       The United States will seek condemnation of Cuba by the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization and other relevant \n     international bodies.\n       Move promptly to reach agreement with Congress on the \n     pending Helms-Burton Cuba legislation so that it will enhance \n     the effectiveness of the embargo in a way that advances the \n     cause of democracy in that country.\n       Request the Congress to pass legislation authorizing \n     payment of compensation to the families of victims out of \n     Cuban blocked accounts in New York.\n       Restrict the movement of Cuban diplomats in the U.S. and \n     tighten criteria for issuing visas to employees of the Cuban \n     government.\n       Increase support for Radio Marti to overcome jamming by \n     Cuba.\n       Indefinitely suspend all commercial charter flights to \n     Cuba.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n   [In the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, \n Southern Division, Civil Nos. 96-10126, 96-10127, 96-10128 Judge King]\n\nMarlene Alejandre, et al., plaintiffs, v.

My brother, Armando Alejandre, was murdered by the \n     government of Cuba on February 24, 1996. He and three other \n     men were shot down by the Cuban Air Force over international \n     waters while flying two small, unarmed civilian aircraft on a \n     humanitarian mission.\n       3. On August 22, 1996, I attended a meeting at the United \n     States Department of State, Cuba Desk, to discuss issues \n     related to the shoot down. Also present were the following \n     relatives of the murdered men: Marlene Alejandre, Mario de la \n     Pena, Miriam de la Pena, Jorge Khuly, Mirta Mendez, Richard \n     Mendez and Nelson Morales.\n       4. The meeting was chaired by Michael E. Ranneberger, \n     Coordinator, Office of Cuban Affairs, United States \n     Department of State. Others US government officials present \n     included Hal Eren, OFAC; Robert Malley, NSC; Lula Rodriguez, \n     State, and Susana Valdez, WH liaison.\n       5. The issues discussed at this meeting included the \n     forthcoming humanitarian payments from the United States \n     government to each family of the four murder victims.\n       6. The families had been asked to bring with them to this \n     meeting personal and financial institution information so \n     that the United States government would directly transfer the \n     humanitarian payments to individual bank accounts. A \n     handwritten handout requesting these facts and distributed at \n     the meeting was to be filled out and mailed to R. Richard \n     Newcomb, OFAC.\n       7. Several concerns related to these humanitarian payments \n     were discussed at this meeting Very important was the one \n     dealing with limitations, if any, contingent upon acceptance \n     of the humanitarian payments.\n       8. Miriam de la Pena specifically asked Mr. Ranneberger \n     that if accepting President Clinton's humanitarian payments \n     meant the families would then be restricted in seeking other \n     measures of justice, including legal and financial ones.\n       9. Mr. Ranneberger replied that no, the payments were meant \n     to be a ``gesture'' on the President's part. He stated that \n     the US government did not want to offend the families, only \n     ease their pain, and that the payments in no way were meant \n     to put a value on the four murdered men's lives.\n       10. Other family members then posed questions asking for \n     additional clarification on any conditions tied to the \n     humanitarian payments. it was specifically asked if any \n     signed releases were to be requested from the families upon \n     acceptance of the monies.\n       11. Mr. Ranneberger reassured the families again by stating \n     that accepting the humanitarian payments did not make them \n     incur any obligations, legal or otherwise, and that they were \n     free to pursue any other avenues they desired in their search \n     for justice.\n       12. The possibility of legal action against the government \n     of Cuba was brought up by the families and Mr. Ranneberger \n     said that the US government not only did not oppose this, but \n     encouraged them to seek justice through US and international \n     courts.\n       13. Richard Mendez brought up the figure the US government \n     had advised the families they would be receiving and \n     commented that the amount was so small it was meaningless. \n     Mr. Ranneberger responded that this figure was intended as a \n     humanitarain gesture, not as compensation.\n       I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is \n     true and correct.\n       Date: January 12, 1999.\n                                        Margarita Alejandre Khuly.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n[U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, Case Nos. 96-10126-\n            Civ-King, 96-10127-Civ-King, 96-10128-Civ-King]\n\n Marlene Alejandre, Individually and as Personal Representative of the \n Estate of Armando Alejandre, Deceased, plaintiff, v. the Republic of \nCuba and the Cuban Air Force, defendants, v.

In so ruling, the Court gives \n     considerable weight to the fact that the larger part of the \n     available legislative history supports this interpretation. \n     Also persuasive is the fact that section 117 is the outgrowth \n     of the 1996 AEDPA amendments to the FSIA. Congress therein \n     expressly waived the jurisdictional immunity of terrorist \n     foreign states, and also their immunity from attachment or \n     execution. Congress later clarified the mechanism through \n     which the victims of an attack by a terrorist foreign state \n     may sue for compensatory and punitive damages. By enacting \n     section 117, Congress expanded the property subject to \n     attachment/execution, giving the victims a larger pool of \n     assets from which to satisfy any judgment in their favor. All \n     of these legislative enactments are guided by a single \n     purpose: to provide an executable judicial remedy to the \n     nationals of the United States attacked by a terrorist \n     foreign state. Had Congress intended to give the President \n     the authority single-handedly to impede achievement of this \n     goal, it could have done so more clearly in section 117(d). \n     Its failure unambiguously to do so favors a narrow reading, \n     both in light of legislative history and the fact that \n     Congress usually specifies the waiver authority it grants \n     with greater clarity. The President cannot simply express his \n     intention to execute a law a certain way if that action is \n     not allowed by the legislative authority to which it is made \n     pursuant.\\16\\ If the Government, the Garnishees, Non-Party \n     ETECSA, or any other individual or entity objects to this \n     Court's interpretation of this unclear legislative mandate, \n     it should turn to Congress and have that government branch \n     clearly enunciate a broad waiver authority in an amended \n     section 117(d). It is this Court's responsibility to \n     interpret the law as written; only Congress can re-write the \n     law.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                                footnote\n\n     \\16\\ The Court notes with great concern that the very \n     President who in 1996 decried this terrorist action by the \n     Government of Cuba now sends the Department of Justice to \n     argue before this Court that Cuba's blocked assets ought not \n     be used to compensate the families of the U.S. nationals \n     murdered by Cuba. The Executive branch's approach to this \n     situation has been inconsistent at best. It now apparently \n     believes that shielding a terrorist foreign states' assets \n     are more important than compensating for the loss of American \n     lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to spend a little time talking \nabout what has transpired with the U.S. budget over the last 35 years, \nand I will focus mostly on the last 5 years.\n  I think everyone knows that next month we begin the process of \nproducing a congressional budget plan for the fiscal year that begins \nthis coming October. The Senate Budget Committee, which I have been \nhonored to chair, will complete its hearings next week on the \nPresident's budget which was submitted to Congress earlier this month. \nBefore we begin the task of producing that budget blueprint, I thought \nit might be of interest to some of my colleagues and some of those who \nmight be watching to briefly review some facts surrounding the Federal \nbudget.\n  One can provide different interpretations of numbers, but a number is \na very stubborn thing. It is what it is. Using the help of some charts, \nI will provide a very brief historical overview of the Federal budget \ntoday.\n  Chart No. 1 is the total budget surplus and deficit over the last 30 \nyears. After nearly 30 years of Federal deficit spending--and my \ncolleagues can see the surplus/deficit excluding Social Security is in \ngreen and the total budget surplus is in red. The green, as one can \nsee, starting back in 1965 and going all the way to 1998, is constantly \nbelow the line, meaning we have been in deficit for that whole period \nof time.\n  We finally reported a balanced budget, under the unified budget \nprocess in 1998, of nearly $70 billion. Last year, in 1999, we once \nagain successfully achieved a unified budget surplus of $125 billion. \nBut more importantly--noting the green line on this chart--we will be \nable to balance the budget not counting the Social Security surplus. \nThe red line is the total budget surplus and the green is Social \nSecurity balances.\n  Here is the way the budget goes. We now have a surplus above zero in \nboth the Social Security and in the non-Social Security accounts of our \nGovernment. Last year, we actually achieved a surplus--not very much--\nof $1 billion, and certainly that is substantially better than when we \nwere approaching $300 billion in deficits.\n  For the current fiscal year, we expect a surplus of $176 billion, \nand, of that, nearly $23 billion excludes the Social Security moneys, \nmeaning we have some money left over in surplus after we put all the \nmoney in the Social Security trust fund that is required by law.\n  Projections for the near future remain positive. Of course, depending \non what policies we enact relating to taxes or spending, the Social \nSecurity surpluses will continue to accumulate over the next decade, \nand the rest of Government also is expected and projected to see \nsurpluses as far as the eye can see.\n  By the year 2005, the Congressional Budget Office expects the surplus \nto be between $270 billion and $300 billion. One thing that this job \nhas taught me is to be very careful in statements about the long term. \nI could spend some time suggesting that these long-term surpluses are \nvery reliable and credible, but I will do that at another time. Today, \ninstead of statements about the long term, what I want to do is talk \nabout--rather than pontificating about the future and what we might \nexpect--about what has passed, just so there will be an understanding \nof whether or not Congress and the Senate and the Budget Committee and \nthe appropriators and everybody in this body ought to be proud of what \nwe have accomplished in terms of controlling the spending of our \nNational Government.\n  So here is chart No. 2. It has a lot of things on it. I just put it \nup because it shows, in five intervals over the last 30 years, the \nmajor components of the budget. We can clearly see that total Federal \nspending has increased, to where this year the Federal Government is \nlikely to spend $1.8 trillion.\n  In terms of the totality of the budget--in all of its components: \nMilitary, entitlements, the 13 appropriations bills--it has been going \nup every year. Now we are at about $1.8 trillion. That is an \ninteresting number because if there is a $4 trillion surplus--just to \ncompare--that means we will have more than 2 full years of the Federal \nbudget in surplus during the next decade. That is a rather profound and \nmajor change in things over the past 35 years.\n  The country has grown over the last 30 years, and it has grown faster \nthan Government spending. So while we reached a peak of nearly 23 \npercent of our gross domestic product in 1985, today it has declined \nalmost 5 full percent; that is, we are now at 18.5 percent of our gross \ndomestic product in the total spending of the American Government, \nincluding interest on the debt, entitlements, Social Security, and 13 \nappropriations bills--and, obviously, one of those is the defense bill.\n  This bar chart points out a phenomenon of which I think we are all \naware. Let's just look at it for 1 minute. Entitlement spending today \nrepresents 55 percent of all Federal spending. If we add paying the \ninterest on our national debt as another entitlement--and it might be \nthat, so let's add it in--then 77 percent of what we spend every year \nis either mandatory spending or an entitlement.\n  I did not go back in history to equate the percentages under other \nPresidents, but suffice it to say, not too long ago, in the era of, \nlet's say, President Kennedy's tenure, clearly, about 40 percent of the \nentire Federal budget was entitlements; and now we are up to 77 \npercent.\n  Let's look at the third chart: Growth in Total Outlays. This is very \nimportant. For those who wonder about how poorly we do or how well we \ndo when we finally finish all our work--it might not look pretty; it \nmay take too long; there may be a lot of scuffling on the \nappropriations bills--I would like very much to make sure we all take a \ngood, careful look at this chart and see what we have really been doing \nthat has contributed to the great fiscal policy of this country and to \nour position today of low interest rates and sustained economic growth.\n  This is a very dramatic chart. It is very simple but very dramatic. \nThe blue on the chart is what is called nominal growth, and the red is \nreal growth. The nominal growth includes inflation, plus the growth \nbeyond inflation. It is very interesting what we\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nhave done. Because we think it makes the most sense, we have gone back \nto 1965 and done this on 5-year intervals. So we have taken 5-year \nintervals and then taken the average for that 5-year interval.\n  It is rather dramatic to see what is shown on the chart, without any \nexplanation--the dramatic reduction in the percentage of growth in \nactual total outlays year after year. It was not long ago we were \ntalking about deficits as far as the eye could see. Now, as this chart \nshows, as the reality of the years 1995 through 2000 has become true, \nwe are beginning to see rather large surpluses.\n  I might add, by way of taxes--with which I do not think we did much \nin these charts--even though taxes, for certain Americans, may be lower \nthan 15 or 20 years ago, but the percent of our gross domestic product \nthat goes to taxes is the highest since the end of the Second World \nWar. So it is obvious, if your taxes are the highest and your growth in \nGovernment is the lowest, you begin to develop a rather good surplus. \nIt is kind of easy to see that much of that surplus is because we are \ntaxing the American people at a higher percent of our total production \nthan we ever have since the Second World War when we had all kinds of \ntaxes.\n\n  Let's just look at this chart and take a couple of years. Growing at \nan annual rate of nearly 12.2 percent in the late 1970s, the total \nGovernment spending right now that we can tell you already occurred--as \nI said in my opening remarks, we are not predicting. Numbers that are \nbehind us are hard to throw away.\n  For the years 1995 to 2000, the total amount of growth in our \nGovernment, including appropriated accounts, is 3.1 percent; and of \nthat, the real growth--that is, noninflationary growth--is 1.3 percent.\n  Just compare that quickly with other periods of time shown on the \nchart. Pick any interval you like. From 1980 to 1985, the nominal \ngrowth was 9.9 percent, the real growth was 3.6 percent--almost three \ntimes as much in real growth as it was from 1995 to the year 2000.\n  If today I sound as if I am trying to convince somebody of something, \nI address this to a number of Senators because there are some who say \nwe are overspending everywhere and some who say the appropriated \naccounts are out of control. My friend, if they are out of control when \nthey are part of a Government growth that is 1.3 percent in real \ngrowth, what were they when it was 5.8 percent? It was unexplainable. \nThere is no word for it.\n  If we are out of control now--and for those who are interested, the \nyears 1990 to 1995 were not too shabby either. In fact, from 1990 to \n1995, it was 1 percent real growth and 3.9 percent for a combination of \nreal growth and inflation. That is just slightly higher in its totality \nthan the period from 1995 to 2000.\n  I remind Senators that for the period 1995 to 2000--the occupant of \nthe Chair knows this; Senator Hollings knows this--we had a lot of \nemergency money we put in. We had an agricultural emergency 3 years in \na row. We had some military emergencies where we got into wars, and we \nhad not funded them, so we put them in as emergencies. They can be \nwhatever you want, but when the year is finished they are part of the \ntotal outlays. If, in fact, you allocated the money, and put it in an \nappropriations bill, it would eventually be spent, whether it was an \nemergency or whatever, and that is the reason we talk about total \noutlays.\n  The fourth chart only shows the red, which depicts real growth. For \nsome people--not me at this point; I am not sure everything should \nincrease by the rate of inflation every year--but some people think \nthat should be the policy of our Government.\n  What we are looking at here in each of these years is: What was the \nreal outlay growth, on average, over the 5-year intervals, meaning \nwithout inflation? It is pretty simple. If we took the 35-year average, \nand we drew a line--looking at the years 1965 to 1970, it was almost 6 \npercent--but the average for the 35 years is 3.1 percent. Looking at \nthe last decade, real growth for the years 1990 to 1995 was 1 percent; \nfrom 1995 to 2000, it was 1.3 percent.\n\n  Frankly, somebody did something right. If we are talking about \nrestraining expenditures of Government so as to produce a fiscal policy \nthat puts us in balance and ultimately creates a surplus--I know my \ndear friend, Senator Hollings, is here and his and my definition of \n``surplus'' may differ, but I think anybody who looked at this would \nsay we are surely moving in a direction different from what we did for \nmost of the last 35 years.\n  In terms of how much we are letting Government grow, the fifth chart \nshows major components of the entitlements and other mandatory \nprograms. The 35-year average annual rate of growth of Government \nspending has been about 3.1 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This chart shows the various entitlement spendings. It \nis over 55 percent of all Federal spending today. Three-quarters of it \nis just three programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  Let's move on to the Growth in Entitlements and Mandatories. Many of \nus are of the impression that it is the entitlement programs that are \nout of control. I admit, looking at this chart, one would see where it \nwasn't too long ago when they were out of control. Let's take 1970-75. \nThe growth was 18.5 percent nominal growth. In 1980-85, it was 9, and \nin 1985-90, it was 6.9. In 1990-95, it was 5.5. Here we are in 1995-\n2000, in entitlement programs, 4.5 percent nominal and, without \ninflation, the growth was 2.6 percent. If we can continue growth in \nthis manner, which is principally predicated upon controlling the costs \nof health care, which the Government pays for partially or totally, we \ncan keep our government under control and the costs can continue to \ncome down.\n  National defense is something we ought to be concerned about because \nwe have thrown some numbers around and some percentages. The facts are \nbefore us, and they don't look too good. The truth is, since the 1985-\n90 era, everything since that time has been no growth in defense rather \nthan growth. If you are looking at the chart turned upside down, when \nit comes to the last decade, defense spending starts to come out on the \nnegative side, meaning year after year the outlays for defense have \ngone down rather than up, and these are the numbers. We are doing a \nlittle better in the 5 years of 1995-2000 than we did in 1990-95, but \nit is clear that if, in fact, we think we have been really increasing \ndefense in terms of outlays, as we finally get them accounted for, it \nis obvious we have a long way to go if we are going to say we have \nincreased defense spending. I am not saying we must. I am merely giving \nsome facts as they show up here.\n  In summary, the data suggests to me that we have been successful in \ncontrolling the rate of Federal spending. And while we must continue to \nbe vigilant and very careful, in this time of projected budget \nsurpluses, to avoid returning to an era of expansive Government \nspending, I do not think we should dismiss what these charts show. We \nhave been successful in controlling Government spending, and we have \nbeen most successful in the last decade, very successful in the last 5 \nyears. There are many institutions, entities, and people who can take \nsome credit for what has happened to the American economy, but I \nbelieve it is fair to say that the Budget Committee of the Senate, not \nalways under my chairmanship but under the chairmanship of others, has \nbeen part of a decade of tremendous pressure to reduce the expenditures \nof Government and thus create a surplus.\n  If the surplus is good--and, frankly, it looks as if the American \npeople have understood loud and clear that the debt is not good. I \nwould assume if the debt is not good, they must think surpluses are \ngood. Indeed, we do. Much of the surplus is going to that accumulated \ndebt. As a matter of fact, I close by saying, while the two parties and \nthe President disagree on many things, it is good for America that we \nhave agreed on one thing; that is, the Social Security surplus is going \nto the Social Security trust fund, not into the general coffers of \nGovernment to be spent. That alone will dramatically reduce the debt we \nowe to the public.\n  As a matter of fact, if we continue for the next decade to apply the \nSocial Security surpluses, which I am rather confident will continue to \noccur, then\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\nwe will have in a decade reduced the debt of the American people by \nsomewhere around 70 percent, which is not very shabby, if you talk \nabout one decade, one group of people reducing the debt that much.\n  I thank the Senate for permitting me to speak. I will come to the \nfloor at a later time and express why I am convinced the surpluses are \nfor real and that, as a matter of fact, they are apt to be more rather \nthan less over the next decade because of what is happening in the \nAmerican economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the reason I asked for the extra time \nis, in addressing the Senate with respect to the Education Savings Act, \nI was going to make the point that we weren't saving and we had no \nmoney for this particular act. The act will cost the government $2 \nbillion. But the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of \nour Budget Committee, says the Senator from South Carolina sees the \nsurplus differently than he sees a surplus.

It isn't what the Senator from New Mexico \ncalls a debt or surplus. It isn't what the Senator from South Carolina \ncalls a debt or surplus. It is what we call a debt under the Public \nLaw.

It is the \nmonkeyshine on the part of the majority of this body, all running \naround calling surplus, surplus, surplus, when there isn't any surplus.\n  Let's go directly to yesterday's release by the Department of \nTreasury. We find, on table 6, page 20 that they began the year with a \ndebt, as I have just reported, of $5,606,486,000,000. Now, at the close \nof the month, as of January, it was $5,660,780,000,000. The Treasury \nDepartment, beginning October 1 of last year, fiscal year 2000, has \nalready borrowed $54 billion. Please, let's tell the Secretary of the \nTreasury that if we have surpluses, quit borrowing money. What is he \nborrowing money for?

Government FY 1998; Beginning in 1962 CBO's 2001 Economic and Budget Outlook.\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, says we ended 1998 with a surplus of almost $70 billion (it \nwas $69.2). But in order to state that figure, he had to borrow $178.2 \nbillion from the trust funds: Social Security, highway, airport, \nmilitary retirees, civil service retirees, etc.--even Medicare. And \nthen he says that we ended last year with a surplus of $124.4 billion, \nbut he had to borrow $251.8 billion from the trust funds. So the actual \ndeficit for the fiscal year 1998 was $109 billion, and 127.4 billion \nfor 1999. Here are the numbers so everyone can see. Yes, we reduced the \ndeficit each year in that 4- to 5-year period--until last year. The \ndebt went from $109 billion to $127.4 billion. So that was an increase.\n\n  Mr. President, let me state very clearly what has been going on. They \nused to talk of a unified budget and a unified deficit. Now, they talk \nabout off-budget and on-budget, and public debt. This misleads the \npublic because it is the U.S. Department of Treasury--not the CBO, \nSenator Hollings or Senator Domenici--that keeps the official records. \nThey have actual accountants. You know, economists can lie, but \naccountants can't. They have to keep the actual record and give you the \ntruth.\n  Let me get the borrowed trust funds chart and show you exactly what \nis going on. They thought they could borrow enough from the other trust \nfunds to say they are not going into Social Security but, of course, \nthey are. At the end of the fiscal year, we already owe $855 billion to \nSocial Security, $181 to Medicare, $141 to military retirees, and $492 \nbillion to civilian retirement. You can go right on down. We owe $1.869 \ntrillion to the trust funds.\n  Now, you can talk about the wonderful record, but this is what the \nSenator from South Carolina is looking at because that is the actual \ndebt. Just in 2000, we will owe $1 trillion to Social Security, but by \n2013, that figure jumps to nearly $4 trillion. Think of the \ninflationary pressure when the Baby Boomers start to retire and we have \nto redeem these bonds.\n  Now, what I have done is I have gone to each one of the trust funds. \nI won't take the time to go through all of them. ``But there is hereby \ncreated on the books of the Treasury of the United States a trust fund \nto be known as the Federal Old-Age and Survivors . . .''--and so forth \nand so on. Mr. President, on page 2 of the act, section (b), ``there is \nhereby created on the books of the Treasury of the United States a \ntrust fund to be known as the Federal Disability Insurance Trust \nFund.''\n  Mr. President, what we did in 1983 was gradually raise the Social \nSecurity payroll tax to 6.25 for employees and 6.25 for employers, for \n12\\1/2\\ percent. In 1983, if you had said we are going to vote for \nincreased taxes for food stamps or for Kosovo or for courthouses or for \ndredging or for ships that the Department of Defense said they don't \nneed, and those kinds of things, you could not have gotten a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate. We passed the increase assuming the money \nwould be put in trust. But they have been spending it.\n  We have a way so they won't spend it--what we call the lockbox--and \nthey won't let us vote on it. Anytime, anywhere they want to vote on a \nreal lockbox, call this Senator up. I have had it drawn up by the \nAdministrator of Social Security, Ken Apfel. I worked with him when he \nwas on the Budget Committee, together with the Senator from New Mexico, \nthe present chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  I tried for some time to take Social Security off budget and it was \nblocked in the Budget Committee. But I finally got it passed, with one \ndissenting vote from the Senator from Texas. That is the best way I \ncould do it.\n  Section 13301. I ask unanimous consent to have this one-page summary \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security from all Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any . . .\n\n  So it is against the real trust and against the law itself. But we \ncontinue to violate that law. Everybody knows the practice in the \nGovernment under the 1994 Pension Reform Act is that you can't use \npension money to pay off the company debt. We all know Denny McLain, \nthe famous pitcher formerly with the Detroit Tigers. He did that and \nwas charged with a felony. If you can find him, tell him to, instead of \npaying off the company debt, run for the Senate. Instead of a jail \nterm, you will get the good government award.\n  You can say the public debt is down, but it is like paying off the \nMasterCard with the Visa card. You still owe the same amount of money. \nThat is what we have been doing. We play a shabby game up here talking \nabout surpluses. Yesterday, the Secretary of Commerce came to my office \nwanting to talk about surplus. I said: Mr. Secretary, we don't have any \nsurplus. I said: Look at the President's budget itself.\n  Here it is right here on page 420. You can see it. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this one page be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\n\n\n

$500 million or less\n\n  Mr. President, there are not any surpluses as far as the eye can see, \nas the chairman of the Budget Committee just said, but deficits as far \nas the eye can see. The total gross Federal debt starts off in the year \n2000 at $5.606 trillion. The next year, it goes to $5.686 trillion, so \nit goes up $80 billion. It ends up at $6.815 trillion. So it goes up \n$1.2 trillion over this period until 2013--as far as the eye can see. \nThe debt is up, up, up, and away. There is no, no, no surplus.\n  Every year since President Clinton has been in office, we have spent \nmore in Congress than the President's budget, which I have in my hand. \nBoth sides are now calling for a tax cut. The Democratic side is \ntalking about $350 billion; the Republican side is talking about $750 \nbillion. I will never forget when the President was going to give his \nState of the Union Address, and the distinguished majority leader, the \nSenator from Mississippi, said: Good gosh, that is going to cost us a \nbillion dollars a minute.\n  Well, the distinguished President talked for an hour and a half, so \nthat is $90 billion. George W. Bush has a $90 billion a year tax cut, \nwhich is $900 billion over the next 10 years.\n  We are spending that kind of money right now; 90 and 90--that is $180 \nbillion-plus. If we weren't paying $365 billion in interest costs on \nthe national debt, I could give you the Republican program and the \nDemocratic program and have $185 billion to pay down the debt. We may \nnot have a Senate session tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, but \nthe first thing at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, the Treasurer is going \nto borrow a billion dollars and add it to the debt--on Sunday, \nChristmas Day, each day of the year of 2000. The actual fact is there \nis no surplus.\n  It is time that the media and we in the Congress and Government tell \nthe American people the truth. There is no surplus. I wish there were \nsome.\n  Now you have this particular bill coming along. I have each one of \nthese particular trust funds. I could go down the entire list of them--\nnot only the Social Security, but I could go down the Medicare. The \nMedicare trust fund is hereby created. Again, the Federal supplementary \nmedical insurance trust fund--report immediately to Congress whenever \nthe board is of the opinion that the amount of the trust fund is unduly \nsmall.\n  We were very careful in the legislation, but not in the actual fact \nand the actual treatment.\n  We have each one of these trust funds--the particular language on \nmilitary retirement, civil service retirement, and unemployment \ncompensation. The employers of America are paying in their particular \namounts to the trust fund--and the employees for unemployment \ncompensation.\n  There isn't any question. I can show you exactly the language of the \ncourt and how they treat these trust funds when they get involved--not \nin a political discussion but in the legality of it.\n  I quote from the court:\n\n       State unemployment funds deposited in the Federal \n     unemployment trust fund are a continuing appropriations for a \n     specific purpose and the Federal Government does not obtain \n     title to the money by depositing it in trust for the State \n     Unemployment Reserve Commission which is bound to administer \n     the money in accordance . . . with the law.\n\n  That is exactly the way the Treasurer of the United States is bound \nto adhere. But that isn't what we do. We keep talking about a surplus \nand the public debt, which I put in the Record as reported by the \nminute.\n  It goes up. It is an astounding figure--$894,000 every minute. That \nis how much the debt, that is how much the deficit goes up every \nminute, not a surplus--$894,000.\n  That is the tragedy of this particular charade that goes on. We \nbrought up a tax bill in the Senate, and everybody knows under the \nConstitution that it has to resonate in the House. So it is not going \nanywhere. We put that up to debate it. We don't fund it. Then we put \ncloture on as if we are delaying something. We are delaying the \nnonsense. We ought to pull the bill down. The bill is nothing. It is \nnot going anywhere, and everybody knows that. But we are supposed to \nfool the press upstairs. They report that we are going to have a \ncloture vote, and we are working, and everything else like that. The \ngame plan here is the Presidential race. Don't do anything to upset the \napplecart. We have our candidate. We have given him the $70 million. We \nhave another $70 million, and we are headed for the brass ring, and \njust do not have anything happen in Washington in the Congress to upset \nour pell-mell for the White House.\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\n  It is a tragic thing. We have these trust funds. They talk about \nSocial Security. These are just in trust for Social Security.\n  In fact, the ``other'' is on here. The Senator from Alaska is here. \nHe knows good and well that we pay in there under ``other'' for nuclear \nstorage and the waste storage fund. The private power companies have \nbeen paying into that over the years. We have $19 billion in there. But \nwe can't spend it. We are supposed to spend it in trust only for that. \nWe haven't put it at Yucca Mountain. So we have to hold up. That is \npart of this $59 billion ``other.'' We have the Federal Financing Bank \nheld in trust.\n  When the day of reckoning comes when we can stop increasing the \ndebt--everybody is talking about paying down the debt--if we can just \nstop increasing it, oh, boy, then we would have set a record in this \nparticular Congress because the debt has been going up, up, and away \nwith the consequent interest costs, which is like taxes. When I pay \ngasoline taxes, I get a highway. I pay a sales tax, and I can go ahead \nand get a school, or whatever it is. When I pay interest costs, or \ninterest taxes, I get absolutely nothing. The Government and the \neconomy thereby is in real trouble.\n  That is the state of the Union.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The time of the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from South \nCarolina outline the state of the budget. I concur with his pointed \ncriticism of whether or not we have a sound surplus, or whether it is \nsomewhat realistic.\n  He points out the $19 billion that has been paid by the ratepayers \ninto the nuclear waste fund, as an example. He and I both know that \nmoney has gone into the general fund. It is basically not in escrow. It \nis not in a reserve account.\n  When the administration or the Government ever addresses that \nresponsibility, we will have to appropriate that money someplace \nbecause it has been spent. As an old banker, I can tell you that \ninterest is like a horse that eats while you sleep. It goes on Saturday \nnight, Sunday morning, and Sunday night. As a consequence, we often \nfind ourselves in the position where the interest exceeds the \nprincipal. When that happens, you are broke.\n  I am certainly sympathetic to the points raised by my colleague.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2098 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for many months now, I and other Members of \nthis body have been coming to the floor to talk about the need for \nprescription drug coverage for our older people under Medicare. I have \nbrought to the floor on more than 20 occasions specific cases of older \npeople who, in so many instances, are walking an economic tightrope, \ntrying to balance their food costs against their prescription drug \nbill, their prescription drug bill against some other necessity. More \nand more of these older people and their families simply cannot make \nends meet.\n  I wish to address the question of whether this country can afford to \ncover prescription drugs for older people under Medicare. I submit this \nNation cannot afford not to cover these essential health care services.\n  We talked on the floor about the important drugs such as Lipitor, a \ncholesterol-lowering drug used by many older people. These drugs are \nabsolutely key to keeping older people well. There is no question that \nright now if the Government were to pick up the costs of these \nmedicines there would be additional costs, but the savings generated as \na result of extending prescription drug coverage to older people, in my \nview, would be staggering.\n  I continually cite the exciting contributions made by these new \nmedicines that prevent strokes. They are known as anticoagulant drugs. \nFor an older person, it might cost perhaps $1,000 a year to pay for the \ndrugs, anticoagulant drugs that prevent these strokes, but if you \nprevent a stroke you could save upwards of $100,000 through an \ninvestment that is just a small fraction of those costs.\n  I am very hopeful it will now be possible to reconcile the various \nbills that cover prescription drugs for older people. Senator Daschle \nhas talked to me on a number of occasions, even a few hours ago, \nindicating he is very interested in seeing the Congress come together \non a bipartisan basis and enact this legislation to meet the needs of \nolder people and better utilize the dollars that are available for \nhealth care in this country.\n  The stories we have accumulated from home are tragic. I heard \nyesterday from an older woman in Tillamook, OR. She recently took \nanother senior, an 80-year-old woman, to the emergency room. This 80-\nyear-old woman said she could not afford the one medication she needed \nto control her high blood pressure. As a result, she almost died.\n  From what we are seeing across this country, we either now go forward \nand make a well-targeted investment to make sure vulnerable seniors get \nhelp with prescription drugs or we end up with vastly more people \nsuffering and much increased costs.\n  I have received scores of letters from across rural Oregon. These are \nfrom people who have to drive 40 miles, 50 miles to a pharmacy. They \ndon't have big health plans that negotiate discounts for them.\n  In Baker City, OR, I have been told by an older couple they are \ngetting by on $200, the two of them, for their entire month after they \nare done paying their prescription drug bills. There is not a one of us \nin the Senate who could live in that kind of arrangement where they \nessentially had only a couple of hundred dollars a month to pay for \ntheir food and shelter and other essentials. A country as good and rich \nand strong as ours is capable of addressing this need. I think it can \nbe done using an approach that relies on marketplace forces.\n\n  I particularly wish to praise my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. \nI have been able to team up with her on this prescription drug issue \nfor 14 months. When we started in the Budget Committee, I think a lot \nof folks looked at us and said, Senator Snowe, Senator Wyden, they are \nwell meaning but there is no chance this prescription drug issue is \ngoing to be addressed.\n  We have seen over the last few months tremendous progress. There is \nnot a Member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, who goes home and \ndoesn't get asked about this issue. We have a chance to bring the \nvarious bills together. Senator Daschle wishes to do so, and I know a \nnumber of Republicans want to do so as well. Our colleagues in the \nSenate recognize this ought to be a voluntary program. A lot of lessons \nhave been learned since the catastrophic care issue came before the \nCongress. This is not going to be a mandatory program. This is not \ngoing to be a one-size-fits-all program from Washington. This is going \nto be based on voluntary choice. We are going to use the dollars that \nare raised for this program to pick up the prescription drug portion of \na senior citizen's private health insurance.\n  I am not talking about a federalized health care system. We are \ntalking about using private health insurance, making sure older people \nhave a variety of choices and offerings. As a result of those choices \nand offerings, they can have some big bargaining power.\n  What happens right now is the health plans, the HMOs, big buyers, go \nout and negotiate a discount. If you are an older person in rural \nNebraska or rural Oregon and you don't have prescription drug coverage, \nyou walk into the Rite Aid or a Fred Meyer or one of your drugstores \nand you, in effect, have to subsidize the big buyers who are in a \nposition to negotiate discounts. We can use private marketplace forces, \nthe way the Snowe-Wyden legislation does, and the way several of the \nother bills do, to make sure older people have the kind of bargaining \npower that makes these prescription drugs more affordable.\n  I am very pleased that this issue has become a bigger priority in the \nCongress in the last few weeks. I think now is going to be a test of \nwhether we can,\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nas Senator Daschle and others have suggested, reconcile the various \nbills that have been introduced on this issue. I do not expect to have \nthe last word on this matter.\n  Senator Snowe and I are very proud the financing of our legislation \nreceived 54 votes in the Senate when it came up last year. On the \nSnowe-Wyden amendment, we saw Senator Wellstone vote for it, Senator \nSantorum vote for it, Senator Kennedy vote for it, and Senator Abraham \nvote for it. That is a pretty good coalition. That is the kind of \ncoalition we can build if we pick up on the counsel of Senator Daschle, \nand I know a number of Republican leaders, to come together and \nreconcile these various bills.\n  I intend to keep coming to the floor and reading these cases. Our \nfriend, Senator Kerrey, is here. I know he is going to be speaking on \nan important issue, and I do not want to detain him. I think in this \ncountry we are now seeing older people break their pills in half \nbecause they cannot afford to pick up the cost of medicine when we \nhave, as we saw in Tillamook, OR, 80-year-old women being taken to \nemergency rooms and not able to afford their medicine. It is wrong. It \nis just wrong for this Congress to not address this issue in a \nbipartisan way this year.\n  This is not one we ought to put off until after the election and see \nit used as a political football. It should not be used as fodder for \nthe campaign trail because if it is, too many older people who cannot \nafford their medicine are going to suffer.\n  We have a chance to move on a bipartisan basis to reconcile these \nvarious bills. I intend to keep coming to the floor of this body again \nand again to describe these cases, to show how urgent the need is. The \nPresident at the State of the Union Address made it clear he was \nextending the olive branch to both political parties to work with him \non this issue. We ought to seize, on a bipartisan basis, the \nopportunity to use private health insurance, not some federalized \nGovernment program, to make sure we meet the needs of older people for \nprescription medicine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, former Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger joined what has become a chorus of distinguished \ncitizens and representatives who are suggesting the decision to deploy \nthe national missile defense system be postponed until after the \nNovember 7 Presidential election. Although it may be that a delay is \nnecessitated for other reasons, I hope we do not allow the approach of \na Presidential election to prevent us from making important foreign \npolicy decisions.\n  Not only do I believe this to be a precedent which would hamper \nfuture Presidential decisionmaking, but it also ignores the fact that \nthis is a tough decision for any President to make anytime, regardless \nof the circumstances. It also ignores that it takes time for a new \nCommander in Chief at the helm of the ship to get his or her foreign \npolicy sea legs. Such a delay could jeopardize our capacity to deploy \nNMD in a timely fashion.\n  In his argument, Secretary Kissinger referred to ``congressionally \nimposed deadline.'' This is a commonly made mistake about what Congress \ndid last year. All we called for was deployment of national missile \ndefense ``as soon as it is technologically possible.'' The \nadministration has said this decision could be made as early as June \nand has recently indicated this could slip to late summer.\n  Of the four criteria that will be used by President Clinton to make \nhis decision, the most difficult to quantify is the impact on other \narms control agreements. Specifically, the impact most feared is that \ndeployment of this missile defense system would be regarded by the \nRussians as a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  While I can make a very strong argument that deployment of NMD is \npermitted under the terms of this treaty, this argument will diminish \nin importance if the Russian Government abrogates other treaties by \nmodifying their strategic nuclear weapons. This includes the very real \nand destabilizing prospect of re-MIRVing their missiles or converting \nsingle-warhead missiles to multiwarhead missiles. This is why the \nUnited States is attempting, and thus far without success, to persuade \nRussia to allow a modification of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty in order to build NMD and avoid potentially serious conflict \nbetween the United States and the Russian Government. We have met \nconsiderable resistance, not only from the Russians but also from \nallies who regard our analysis of the ballistic missile threat to be \nflawed.\n  To be clear, the new threat is real. We cannot afford to ignore the \nreal threat that an accidental or rogue nation launch of ballistic \nmissiles carrying nuclear weapons poses to the survival of our Nation. \nThe need to build this defensive system, which is still being tested \nfor feasibility and reliability, derives from the national intelligence \nestimate and an external panel headed by Donald Rumsfeld. Both have \nconcluded that the threat of rogue nation or unauthorized launch of a \nnuclear, biological, or chemical weapon at the United States of America \nis real.\n  As a consequence, we have begun testing a system which would protect \nAmericans against this threat. A test schedule for May will be \ncritically important to demonstrate feasibility and reliability, one of \nthe four Presidential conditions needed for deployment. Given the risk/\nreward ratio of defending against nuclear weapons, the current cost \nestimates over 10 years of an amount that is less than 1 percent of our \nnational defense budget and the unlikely reassessment of this threat, \nall that would stand in the way of a Presidential decision to deploy \nwould be the potential adverse impact on other agreements.\n\n  The President will face this question: Will a decision to deploy NMD \nresult in other nations, especially Russia, reacting in a manner that \nwould produce a net increase in proliferation activity and thus \nincrease the potential for rogue or unauthorized launch of nuclear, \nchemical, or biological weapons?\n  We are more likely to resolve this potential conflict in a way that \nincreases the safety and security of Americans if President Clinton \ndoes not delay the decision until after the November 7 election. This \nis a decision that should be made on the basis of the current facts and \nthe four criteria for deployment previously outlined by the \nadministration.\n  To be successful, we should also consider an alternative negotiating \nstrategy that would pose a win-win for both the United States and \nRussia. It would reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. It \nwould improve the relations between the United States and Russia. And \nit would enable the United States to redirect money from maintaining \nour current nuclear weapons stockpile to our conventional forces, where \na real strain can be seen in recruitment, readiness, and capability.\n  To spur constructive action, we must force ourselves to remember this \ngrim truth: The only thing capable of killing every man, woman, and \nchild in the United States of America is the Russian nuclear stockpile. \nWe must remember the threat no longer comes from a deliberate attack. \nInstead, these weapons now present two new and very dangerous threats.\n  The first is the possibility of an accidental or unauthorized launch \nof a Russian nuclear weapon. During the cold war, we worried about the \nmilitary might of the Soviet Union, but today we worry about the \nmilitary weakness of Russia and her ever-decreasing ability to control \nthe over 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads in her arsenal. There are \nnumerous stories that have emerged out of Russia over the past few \nyears highlighting the vulnerability of these weapons. There are \nstories of major security breaches at sensitive nuclear facilities. \nThere are stories of unpaid Russian soldiers attempting to sell \nnuclear-related material in order to feed their families. And there are \nstories of the continuing decay of the command and control \ninfrastructure needed to maintain the nuclear arsenal of Russia. Each \nof these demonstrates the vulnerability of the Russian arsenal to an \naccidental launch based on a technical error or miscalculation or the \nunauthorized use of a weapon by a rogue group or disgruntled \nindividual.\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\n  The second threat posed by the nuclear legacy of the cold war is the \ndanger of the proliferation of material, technology, or expertise. \nConsider just the case of North Korea. Last summer, North Korea held \nthe world's attention as a result of indications that they were \npreparing to test a long-range Taepo Dong ballistic missile. Through \nskillful diplomacy, the United States was able to convince the North \nKoreans to halt their missile testing program.\n  However, the stability of the entire east Asian region was in \njeopardy as a result of the possibility of such a test. North Korea is \none of the most backward countries in the world. It is a country where \nmillions of its own citizens have starved to death. Yet this country \nwas able to affect the actions of the United States, Japan, and China \nas a result of their ability to modify what is, in truth, outdated \nSoviet missile technology. As has been indicated publicly, the Taepo \nDong is little more than a longer range version of the 1950s Soviet \nScud missile. One can only imagine the consequences to our security if \nNorth Korea had a nuclear capability and the means to deliver it. But \nthis illustrates the threat posed by proliferation. Without real \nmanagement of these materials and technology--much of it Russian in \norigin--it will become easier for third and fourth rate powers to \ndrastically affect our own security decisions.\n\n  Both of these threats--accidental or unauthorized launch and \nproliferation of these weapons to rogue nations--present a new \nchallenge to the United States. It is a challenge very different from \nthe cold war standoff of two nuclear superpowers. Classic deterrence, \nbetter known as mutual assured destruction, was the bedrock of our \npolicy to confront nuclear threats during the cold war. Mutual assured \ndestruction was based on the premise that our enemies would not dare to \nattack the United States as long as they knew that such an attack would \nbe met with an overwhelming, deadly response by the United States. This \ntheory, however, provides no safety from an accidental launch caused by \nthe failure of outdated technology. It provides no safety net from the \nuse of these weapons by a terrorist state whose only objective is the \ndeath of as many Americans as possible.\n  We need to develop a completely new and comprehensive approach to \nconfront these threats. National missile defense will not add to our \nsecurity if it is built as a stand alone venture. As part of a \ncomprehensive approach it most assuredly can. To succeed, we should \nwork with Russia to develop a new strategic partnership. We need a \npartnership based on cooperation, not confrontation--a partnership that \nbuilds on the many areas of mutual concern, not those that divide--a \npartnership that recognizes the nuclear legacy of the cold war \nthreatens all of us, and that only by working together can we truly \nreduce this threat.\n  The possibility of a new approach where our interests intersect with \nthose of Russia can be seen in a proposal made by Russia to our arms \ncontrol negotiators in Geneva. The Russians offered to reduce the \nnumber of strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 on each side. We rejected \nthe offer based on an assessment of minimum deterrence levels that are \n500 to 1,000 strategic warheads higher. But this assessment has been \novertaken by events in Russia which now make it likely the Russians \nwill be unable to safely maintain more than a few hundred of their own \nnuclear weapons.\n  As the Russian capability to maintain their stockpile dwindles, it is \nnatural to assume our threshold for deterrence will also significantly \ndecrease. Thus, by keeping more weapons than we need to defend our \nnational interests, we are encouraging the Russians to maintain more \nweapons than they are able to control. The net effect is to increase \nthe danger of the proliferation or accidental use of these deadly \nweapons which decreases the effectiveness of national missile defense.\n  So, here is the outline of a win-win proposal to the Russians. We \njointly agree to make dramatic reductions in the U.S. and Russian \nnuclear arsenal. We jointly agree that national missile defense is an \nessential part of a strategy to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. \nAnd, we jointly agree that parallel reductions in our nuclear forces \nmust include arrangements--and a Congressional commitment to provide \nfunding--to secure and manage the resultant nuclear material.\n\n  We are fortunate that we will not begin from scratch on this problem. \nWe can build upon one of the greatest acts of post-cold war \nstatesmanship: the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. To \nfacilitate these dramatic reductions, we must look for ways to expand \nupon the success of this program, to enlist new international partners, \nand to work with the Russians to find new solutions to the problems of \nsecuring nuclear material. Additionally, we should continue our lab-to-\nlab efforts that are assisting the transition of Russian nuclear \nfacilities and workers from military to civilian purposes. These are \nthe practical, on the ground programs that will help us reduce the \nchance of the proliferation of nuclear materials and know-how.\n  In exchange for deep nuclear reductions and technical assistance, the \nRussians would agree to changes in the ABM Treaty. With this \nalternative, the President would not have to choose between national \nmissile defense and future cooperation with Russia. Instead, by working \nin cooperation with Russia on a comprehensive basis, we will be able to \ndeploy a limited NMD system designed to protect the United States from \naccidental or rogue state ballistic missile launches.\n  We can reach such an agreement with Russia because the Russian people \nnow know they are not immune from the threats of extremism. Their \nsecurity is also endangered by the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction to terrorists and rogue states. This now presents us with \nan opportunity to begin to work with Russia diplomatically to confront \nthis emerging threat from countries like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. \nFormer Secretary of Defense William Perry's success in halting North \nKorea's missile testing program highlights the potential power of \ndiplomacy to reduce these threats. But by developing a strategic \npartnership with Russia, and working cooperatively to bring change in \nNorth Korea, to end Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, or to foster real \nreform in Iran, we will reduce nuclear dangers and create a safer \nworld.\n  So as President Clinton considers his decision about NMD, I hope he \nconsiders an alternative strategy that embraces a comprehensive \napproach to the threats we face in today's world. Now is the time to \nreach out to Russia and to create a partnership that will build the \nbasis for securing the post-cold war peace for our children.\n  Mr. President, in the aftermath of the administration's rejection of \nthe offer to substantially reduce strategic weapons, the issue of a \nprevious analysis of the minimum deterrence done by then-Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, was raised. I say to \nmy colleagues, I intend to read carefully that report and revisit the \nfloor with an opportunity to discuss what I believe is a rational \nminimum deterrence level necessary to protect the people of the United \nStates of America. Obviously, that must be a concern of ours as well.\n  But I believe there is a historic opportunity. It will be difficult \nfor us to seize that opportunity if Republicans and Democrats do not \nagree that still the most important thing for all of us to do is to \nmake certain the safety and security of the American people are secured \nthrough not only our policies but our active efforts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we were away for the winter break, \nthe annual high school survey on drug use trends among 8th, 10th, and \n12th graders came out. This annual Monitoring the Future study, \nreleased on December 17, revealed little change in trends of illicit \ndrug use among our young people. The administration has tried to put a \nhappy face on the results. But there is little to be happy about.\n  Although the Monitoring the Future study found that the increase in \ndrug use among teens has slowed down, what the data show is that use \nand experimentation remain at high levels. You can see from this chart \nthat we still face the discouraging fact that nearly 50 percent of our \nhigh school seniors reported use of marijuana, not only in\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\n1999, but in the 2 previous years as well. In fact, 12th grader use of \nmarijuana is at its highest since 1992. In addition, 23 percent of the \nhigh school seniors questioned in the past 3 years, reported that they \nhad used marijuana in the past 30 days. Sadly, the study also found \nthat the percentage of 10th graders who reported use of marijuana \nincreased from 39.6 percent in 1998 to nearly 41 percent in 1999. \nHardly news to find comfort in.\n  Marijuana remains a gateway drug for even worse substances and this \nnext chart shows overall illicit drug use among high school seniors. \nYou can see in this second chart that, in 1999, nearly 55 percent of \n12th graders reported using an illicit drug in their lifetime. What \nthat ``lifetime'' means is that 55 percent of 17-year-olds have at \nleast tried marijuana or other dangerous, illicit drugs. That's an \nappalling figure. You can also see that this number is the highest it's \nbeen since 1992. With the Office of National Drug Control Policy's \nrecent blitz of ads through the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \nCampaign, these high numbers are truly disappointing. It seems though, \nas the news gets worse, the press releases get happier. But it's still \ndouble-speak.\n  Another upsetting finding was the increase in the use of the ``club \ndrug,'' Ecstacy. Use of Ecstacy among 10th graders increased from 3.3 \npercent in 1998 to 4.4 percent in 1999. In addition, use among 12th \ngraders increased from 1.5 percent in 1998 to 2.5 percent in 1999. The \nincrease in the use of these so called club drugs, such as Ecstacy, is \nparticularly disturbing. This is so, because club drugs are frequently \nreferred to as recreational drugs and are perceived by many young \npeople as harmless. On December 23 of this past year, we were given a \nglimpse of the sheer magnitude and severity of the market for Ecstacy, \nwhen Customs officials seized 700 pounds of Ecstacy. These 700 pounds \nwould have been enough to provide 1 million kids each with a single \ndose. Unfortunately, Ecstacy is quickly becoming the drug of choice \namong our young people. And it too is a gateway to wider drug use. \nParents need to take a harder look at what their children are being \nexposed to.\n  Last session I gave a floor statement on one particular club drug, \nthat is frequently used in sexual assault cases, called GHB. I am \npleased to learn from this year Monitoring the Future study that in \nnext year's survey, young people will be questioned about use of GHB. \nBut the issue is not this drug or that drug but the climate that \nencourages use and recruits kids into the drug scene. We must work to \nreverse the trend to normalize and glamorize drug use that has taken \nroot in recent years.\n  There is an encouraging decline in the use of inhalants among 8th and \n10th graders. And, use of crack cocaine among 8th and 10th graders is \ndown slightly. In addition, 12th graders reported a significant \ndecrease in the use of crystal meth from 3 percent in 1998 to about 2 \npercent in 1999.\n  As we begin not only a new year but a new millennium, we are faced \nwith the difficult challenge of making the 21st century safe for our \nyoung people. Although we have made some progress, these study results \nleave our young people facing an uncertain future. We cannot be \nsatisfied with unchanging trends in teenage drug use. We have not seen \na significant decline in drug use among our country's young people \nsince 1992. In fact, what we have seen are dramatic increases. This \nfact makes me pause and wonder what we have been doing for the past 8 \nyears. Whatever it is, it has failed to make the difference we need to \nbe seeing. We need to move toward significant decreases in use. We need \ncoherent, sound, accountable efforts. We must not neglect our duties in \nkeeping our young people drug free. We are not in any position to let \nour guard down. We need policies and strategies that make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S790-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S790-S791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHY CHINA SHOULD JOIN THE WTO\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate will soon make a very \nimportant and historic decision about whether to grant permanent normal \ntrade relations status to China. This decision would pave the way for \nChina's accession to the WTO. China's likely accession to the WTO is \none of the most pivotal trade developments of the last 150 years. It is \nalso perhaps the single most significant application of the most-\nfavored-nation principle, or non-discrimination principle, in modern \ntrade history.\n  I believe we should approve permanent normal trade relations for \nChina. I also strongly believe China should be admitted to the World \nTrade Organization. Because this is such an important matter, I would \nlike to address this issue today in a careful and thorough way.\n  I have two main points. First, The Core principle of the WTO, the \nprinciple of nondiscrimination, or most-favored-nation treatment, is \nthe only way we have to keep markets open to everybody.\n  We should seek the broadest possible acceptance of this basic \nprinciple of non-discrimination in trade. History shows that when \ncountries trade with each other on a nondiscriminatory basis, everyone \nwins. History also shows that free and open trade is one of the most \neffective ways to keep the peace.\n  Second and lastly I also support China's entry into the WTO because \nit is in our national self-interest to have a rules-based world trading \nsystem that includes China.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about my first point, \nthat everyone wins when we have nondiscriminatory trade, which gives us \na better chance to keep the peace.\n  Most-favored-nation treatment, or what we now call normal trade \nrelations, started with Britain and France in the 1860s. These two \nnations negotiated free trade agreements based on the most-favored-\nnation principle of nondiscrimination, which later became the \ncornerstone of the GATT, and, in 1993, the WTO.\n  The results of these early international trade treaties was \nspectacular. It began a new era of free trade that led to a great \nincrease in wealth around the world. Unfortunately, this hey-day of \nfree trade didn't last long. It ended in about 1885, when Europe turned \ninward, and retreated from the free-trade principle.\n  Just 30 years after Europe abandoned the nondiscrimination principle \nin trade, the war ``to end all wars'' ravaged most of the continent. \nEvents following the First World War also massively disrupted \ninternational trading relationships. Many countries pursued beggar-thy-\nneighbor trade policies, including harsh trade restrictions.\n  When the Great Depression set in, many countries adopted extreme \nforms of protectionism in a misguided attempt to save jobs at home. The \nworst of these misguided laws was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, \nwhich was enacted into law by the 71st Congress.\n  The act started out with good intentions. Its aim was to help the \nAmerican farmer with a limited, upward revision of tariffs on foreign \nproduce. But it had the exact opposite result. It strangled foreign \ntrade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Depression. Other \ncountries faced with a deficit of exports to pay for their imports \nresponded by applying quotas and embargoes on American goods.\n  Mr. President, I went back to the historical record to see what \nhappened to United States agricultural exports when other countries \nstopped buying our agricultural products after we enacted that tariff. \nI was shocked by the depth and severity of the retaliation.\n  In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of \nagricultural goods. By 1932, that amount had been cut almost in half, \nto $589 million. Barley exports dropped by half. So did exports of \nsoybean oil. Pork exports fell 15 percent. Almost every American export \nsector was hit by foreign retaliation, but particularly agriculture.\n  As U.S. agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign retaliation, \nfarm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of many rural banks. \nTheir weakened condition undermined depositor confidence, leading to \ndepositor runs, bank failures, and ultimately, a contraction of the \nmoney supply.\n  Mr. President, I'm not saying that if we hadn't abandoned the \nnondiscrimination principle we wouldn't have had a depression. But it \nwouldn't have lasted as long. It wouldn't have hit as hard. It wouldn't \nhave destroyed as many lives.\n  President Roosevelt attempted to correct this mistake with a major \nshift\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\nin policy in 1934 with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. This \nlegislation authorized the President to negotiate trade liberalizing \nagreements on a bilateral basis with our trading partners.\n  But the damage was done. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was too \nlittle, too late.\n  Although 31 bilateral agreements were signed, the outbreak of the \nSecond World War completely shattered any hope of a more cooperative \ninternational trading environment. I don't think it is a coincidence \nthat another World War closely followed the Depression. If political \ntensions were not inflamed by severe economic pressures, and made worse \nby unnecessary and destructive trade disputes, perhaps the history of \nthe first half of the 20th century would have been different.\n  Free trade alone may not keep the peace. But it makes it a lot harder \nto go to war.\n  At the end of World War II, the United States led the effort to once \nagain construct a world trading system based on the Most-Favored-Nation \nprinciple of nondiscrimination. We succeeded with the launch of the \nGATT, in 1947.\n  Now, once again, we have a world trade system that increases our \ncollective wealth through nondiscriminatory free trade. We also have a \nworld trade system that helps keep the peace. The fact that the cold \nwar never ignited to a hot conflict is due in large part to the success \nof the GATT in forging closer economic ties at a time when world \npolitical tensions were escalating over other issues.\n  Mr. President, we finally got it just about right. But we still don't \nhave a world trade system that includes the world's most populous \nnation, and one of its most dynamic economies. China's absence from the \nglobal trade forum matters because we still have not managed to rid the \nworld of political tensions and destabilizing trade disputes.\n  We could still easily lose it all, just as Europe did in 1885, and as \nwe did in 1930. Increasingly, many of these disputes and tensions will \ninvolve, or at least affect, both China and the United States. There \nare a few Members here who may remember the pressures on the world \ntrading system we had in the early 1970s. Back then, we had a major \nworld recession and two major oil price shocks.\n  These pressures led to the so-called ``New Protectionism,'' when \ncountries increasingly resorted to non-tariff barriers to trade, such \nas quotas, voluntary export restraint agreements, industrial and \nagricultural subsidies, and orderly restraint agreements. The \nheightened tensions brought about by the ``New Protectionism'' were \npotentially very destabilizing.\n  It was only with the conclusion of the Uruguay round of global trade \nnegotiations in 1993 that we finally reversed the dangerous course of \nthis ``New Protectionism,'' and got free trade back on track. Our \nexperience in the 1970s, when we could have easily lost most of our \nprogress in opening new global markets, demonstrates why it's so \nimportant to expand and strengthen the world trade system as much as we \ncan.\n  China was not a GATT member in the 1970s. The disciplines were much \nweaker. Important sectors like agriculture weren't covered. Dispute \nresolution was largely unenforceable.\n  Today, that is all changed. Disciplines are stronger. Disputes can be \nsettled and effectively enforced. For the first time, we now have rules \nthat cover agriculture. And now China is ready to end a fifty-year \nperiod of going its own way on trade policy.\n  Mr. President, rules and disciplines are meaningless unless they are \nwidely accepted and broadly applied. We cannot have an effective, open \nworld trade system that excludes China. It's as simple as that.\n  There is one more reason why China's entry into the WTO is in our \nvital national interest. For the first time in history, China would be \nbound by enforceable international trade rules. I would like to briefly \nexplain why this development is so important.\n  Because of the economic reforms of the 1990s, China's leaders have \nsparked an economic renewal that has lead to growth rates of 7-10 \npercent every year of the last decade, easily dwarfing the growth rates \nof our own super-heated economy. As a consequence of its new \nprosperity, China is buying a great deal of everything, especially \nagricultural products.\n  But because about one-third of China's economic activity is generated \nand controlled by state-owned enterprises, if often manipulates its \nmarkets in a way that harms its trading partners. Take just one example \nwell known to the soybean farmers in my own state of Iowa. In 1992, \nChina's soybean oil consumption shot up from about 750,000 metric tons \nto about 1.7 million metric tons. Keeping pace with this increased new \ndemand, soybean oil imports also more than doubled.\n  In order to keep up with surging domestic demand, China imported more \nsoybeans and soybean meal, much of it from the United States, and much \nof that amount from Iowa. When China's soybean imports hit their peak \nin 1997, soybean meal in the United States was trading at an average \nbase of about $240.00 per ton. This means our farmers were getting \nbetween $7.00 and $8.50 per bushel for their soybeans. Everyone was \nbetter off. China's consumers got what they wanted. America's soybean \ngrowers prospered. This is the way trade is supposed to work.\n  But suddenly, China's state-run trading companies arbitrarily shut \noff imports of soybeans. Soybean meal that was selling in 1997 for \n$240.00 per ton in the United States plummeted to $125.00 per ton by \nJanuary 1999. Soybeans selling for $8.00 per bushel in 1997 fell to \n$4.00 per bushel by July 1999. You can imagine what happened on the \nfarm. With the loss of that income, combined with other factors, \nfarmers were unable to pay their bills. Many lost their farms. Many are \nstill struggling to recover.\n  Mr. President, what happened in China shows what occurs when \nprotectionism, trade barriers, tariffs, and government-run controls \ntake the place of free markets. Trade is distorted. Consumers abroad \nhave less choice. American farm families suffer. It also demonstrated \nhow important China's entry into the WTO is for America's farmers.\n  With a new bilateral market access agreement in place, and with \nmeaningful protocol agreements that should soon be in place, China \nwon't be able to use state trading enterprises to arbitrarily restrict \nand manipulate agricultural trade--and trade in other products--once it \nenters the WTO.\n  Let me say one final word. When we trade with other countries, we \nexport more that farm equipment, soybeans, or computer chips. We export \npart of our society. Part of our American values and ideals. This is \ngood for the WTO. It is good for China. It is good for the United \nStates. And I believe it will help keep the peace.\n  Mr. President, we seldom get a real change in Congress to make this a \nbetter and safer world. but this is one of those rare moments. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting China's admission to the WTO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S791-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S791-S792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DISMANTLING THE COLUMBIA-SNAKE HYDROELECTRIC SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last Friday, Oregon governor John \nKitzhaber announced his support for a radical Clinton-Gore \nadministration proposal to begin dismantling the Columbia-Snake \nhydroelectric system by removing four hydroelectric dams in \nsoutheastern Washington. That same day, in Seattle, campaigning for \npresident, Bill Bradley also announced his support for this proposal.\n  Is support for destroying the Columbia hydro system now a litmus test \nfor the Democratic Party and its candidates for public office? I hope \nnot, because the importance of salmon recovery and the value of our \nNorthwest hydro system is too important to every family and community \nin our region.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration--most prominently through Interior \nSecretary Bruce Babbitt--has aggressively advocated dismantling dams. \nSpecifically, the administration has devoted significant agency \nresources to study removal of the four Snake River dams in Washington. \nEven the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has publicly endorsed dam-\nbreaching. Several other agencies list it as a serious ``option'' to \nrecovery Pacific Northwest salmon.\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\n  I will state here again--as I have many times already--no proposal to \nremove Snake or Columbia River dams will pass in Congress while I am \nSenator. I know that my colleagues, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, \nSenator Mike Crapo and Senator Larry Craig, as well as Governor Dirk \nKempthorne of Idaho share my view.\n  In addition, last year, Republican members in the House for \nWashington, Idaho, Oregon, and Alaska--led by my friend Congressman Doc \nHastings--co-sponsored a House resolution expressing opposition to the \nremoval of dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Scores of Washington \nState Senators and state legislators appeared at a rally last year in \nsupport of the dams. And unlike the Democratic presidential candidates, \nmy friend governor George W. Bush has stated that he would not approve \nof such a proposal.\n  I particularly commend Governor Gary Locke for stating his opposition \nto this unwise position. Governor Locke has been especially courageous \nand thoughtful in representing the best interest of his constituents in \nspite of the criticism of many of his own supporters. Removing dams \nfrom the Columbia hydro system is bad policy. It is bad for people. It \ncosts too much. And the value to salmon is highly questionable. What is \ncertain is that dam removal will make the Northwest a dirtier place to \nlive as it will put tens of thousands of added trucks on the road and \nas clean hydro power is replaced with coal or gas burning energy.\n  The case against breaching the Snake River dams is bolstered by \nevidence found in the Corps of Engineers own feasibility study. The \nCorps found that with existing dam conditions, the average survival \nrate through all four dams and reservoirs on the Snake River for \njuvenile salmon is already over 80 percent, and for adult salmon is 88-\n94 percent. In addition, in the dozens of appendices, summaries, \ncharts, glossy brochures, and documents, there is little, if any, \nconcrete, verifiable biological or scientific data in the Corps' study \nthat shows that the removing even one inch of these dams would restore \nsalmon runs.\n  At the same time, much of the Corps' own evidence in the feasiblity \nstudy verifies that the economic and social effects caused by dam \nbreaching would be devastating to the region. The Corps' cost \nestimates, which are unrealistically low, assume that the economic \nimpact measured in lowered farmland values, pump modification costs, \nand irrigation wells would exceed $230 million.\n  Replacing lost hydropower with other energy forms would increase \nelectricity costs to local ratepayers by as much as $291 million per \nyear. And increased highway and rail traffic costs would cost \nindustries an additional $24 million per year, and $100 to $200 million \na year to replace barging with trucking and rail. On top of that, the \ngovernment, through your taxpayer dollars, would have to find an \nestimated $1 billion just to accomplish the job of removing the dams.\n  Throughout the study, the Corps acknowledges that breaching the dams \nwould have an adverse effect on the environment, resident fish and \nwildlife, clean air, higher water temperatures, specifically through 50 \nto 75 million cubic yards of eroding sediment, increased dust and \nemissions from replacing hydroelectric power with natural gas, and \nincreased annual pollution and safety concerns from highway and rail \ntraffic.\n  What the Corps didn't say in the study is that today, the Columbia \nand Snake Rivers provide a transportation corridor that moves more than \n$13 billion in cargo comprised of exports and imports to and from 43 \nstates. This system in 1997 alone handled 43 percent of all U.S. wheat \nexports and 11 percent of U.S. corn exports. That's a significant \namount of food for the world that would have to be transported in other \nways.\n  All of this comes at a time when the Bonneville Power Administration \nis reporting impending energy shortages for the Pacific Northwest and \nthe Secretary of the Energy is traveling to the Middle East to try for \ncheaper oil to counteract increasing gasoline and oil prices.\n  Also lost on this administration and other dam removal advocates is \nthe fact that salmon populations are declining everywhere including in \nwatersheds where there are no dams. The National Academy of Sciences \nstudied Northwest salmon issues and found that in river basins like the \nChehalis basin and the Willapa basin where there are no dams, the \ndecline of salmon populations, per capita, is identical to that of the \nColumbia River. Native salmon runs on the East Coast are in more \nserious decline than many in the Pacific Northwest and yet almost none \nof those salmon runs are from rivers containing hydroelectric dams. But \nare we still to believe that destroying the Columbia hydro system is \nnecessary to save salmon?\n  And let's be clear about one more thing. Today, the dam removal \nadvocates focus only on four dams that generate power for BPA on the \nSnake River. But let nobody be fooled. They and their political allies \namong the national environmental groups mean to destroy more of the \nColumbia hydro system than just these four dams.\n  If removing these four dams on the Snake River--dams containing fish \npassage facilities--is necessary to comply with the Endangered Species \nAct and other laws, then surely, Grand Coulee Dam without fish passage \nfacilities blocking hundreds of miles of pristine salmon habitat must \ncome down. Perhaps the Oregon Governor can explain why Oregon's Hells \nCanyon dam on the Snake River and with no fish passage capacity can \nsurvive under his criteria.\n  This debate is about preserving or dismantling the Columbia River \nhydro system. I will fight to preserve this system and fight to restore \nsalmon runs within the context of this system.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd pertaining to the submission of S. Con.

Mr. President, I have the pleasure to be the chairman of \nthe U.S.-Spain Council, which is a council formed in 1996 between the \nAmerican and Spanish governments and made up of members of the private \nand public sectors. This council meets once a year to discuss issues of \ncommon interest, and also to work on what we call a triangulation, \nutilizing the tremendous knowledge, awareness, and influence of Spain \nin the Americas to enter into cooperative efforts with the United \nStates to improve economic conditions and strengthen democratic \ninstitutions in the Western Hemisphere.\n  This past couple of days we have had the pleasure of hosting King \nJuan Carlos of Spain and his wife, Queen Sofia. This morning, I had the \nprivilege of being in attendance at the Library of Congress to hear an \naddress in the Great Hall by King Juan Carlos. This was a remarkable \naddress that I thought my colleagues might enjoy reading.\n  I was tremendously pleased that we were joined at a reception prior \nto the King's address by our majority leader, Senator Lott, who made \nexcellent remarks welcoming the King to the Library of Congress, and by \nSenator Daschle, who commented on the unique cooperative relationships \nthat the two countries have enjoyed. Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, who, of course, is also the head of the \ncommission that deals with the Library of Congress, also shared some of \nhis thoughts. In addition, a number of our colleagues were present to \nspeak with King Juan Carlos, including the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, Senator Bayh, and Senator Bob \nGraham, who, in fact, was my predecessor as the U.S. Chairman of the \nU.S.-Spain Council. It was a very worthwhile gathering.\n  I feel fortunate to have attended this morning's address. In his \naddress, King Juan Carlos spoke about the defining moments and \nopportunities in a nation's history. His Majesty, himself,\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\nhas been involved in several of the defining moments in Spain's \nhistory. In the wake of Tuesday's terrorist assault against Democracy \nin Spain, it is comforting to see firsthand the dedication to peace and \nnonviolence that His Majesty King Juan Carlos personifies. Throughout \nhis reign, King Juan Carlos has been a uniting force in his country--\nforever championing human rights and consensus building. That is not to \nsay, however, that he has given in to the demands of terrorist rebels. \nIn fact, 25 years ago, shortly after taking office, rebels stormed the \nParliament of Spain, held lawmakers hostage, and attempted a coup \nd'etat. As a young ruler, King Juan Carlos stood up to the rebels and \nreplied that the coup would succeed only over his dead body. The rebels \nstood down only days later.\n  Once again, Spain finds itself under terrorist attack. I am confident \nthat under the spirit of leadership engendered by King Juan Carlos, \nSpanish authorities will restore trust and order to Spanish daily life \nand silence terrorist bombs once and for all.\n  This is not to say that Spain finds itself in a precarious world \nposition today. In the new millennium, Spain is a cultural, economic, \nand world leader in the European arena. As the European Union becomes \nmore interconnected, and the Euro becomes the currency of trade in \nEurope, Spain will assuredly step up to its leadership position. As His \nMajesty states, Spain is not only focused on European relations. Spain \nhistorically has been an Atlantic nation and thus enjoys rich historic \nand economic ties with the United States and Latin America. Without \ndoubt, the United States will continue to support warm relations with \nSpain in the future.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take the time to read in full the \neloquent remarks of King Juan Carlos and I ask unanimous consent that \nhis remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Address by H.M. the King at the United States Library of Congress, \n                           February 24, 2000\n\n       Senators, Members of Congress, Director of the Library of \n     Congress, Ladies and Gentleman,\n       The opportunity that you have given me to speak today in \n     this solemn and historic building, under the dome that stores \n     so much human knowledge, fills me with deep satisfaction.\n       The books that surround us are codified forms of the memory \n     and of the experience of the best that humankind has \n     accomplished in this world. This is a place that undoubtedly \n     inspires excellence, which invites people to learn from the \n     past, and to plan for the future with hope and energy. We \n     stand here before history, and a past whose calm and profound \n     presence enlightens us.\n       Therefore, allow me first of all to pay tribute to those \n     who, at the inception of the young American nation, made \n     their passionate struggle to establish forms of government \n     more just than those which had until then been commonly \n     accepted, compatible with a far-reaching yearning for \n     knowledge and a continuous thirst for new findings, and \n     scientific discoveries.\n       George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin \n     were, in this sense, three archetypes of the men who built \n     the foundations of the incipient United States of America \n     upon ideals of freedom and democracy that were truly \n     revolutionary for their times, and were also spurred by a \n     continuous search for scientific knowledge.\n       It was they who were mainly responsible for ensuring that \n     the thirteen original colonies, once Independence had been \n     attained, did not content themselves with merely maintaining \n     the model of rural society that had formed them. From the \n     start they inculcated in them--through their own example of \n     encyclopedists avid for new learning--those features which \n     still seem to me the most significant and permanent of this \n     great country: the search for scientific discovery, the \n     accumulation of knowledge, always in permanent expansion \n     driving forward the everchanging frontiers of the human mind.\n       Thus, it is not surprising that the leading role of the \n     United States at the beginning of this new millennium is \n     precisely based on the great scientific and technological \n     advantage achieved by the urge for discovery instilled in it \n     by the Founding Fathers.\n       In the lives of nations, great historic opportunities \n     sometimes arise which must be put to good advantage. The \n     honour and glory fell to Spain for having been the country \n     that, through the discovery of 1492, and the subsequent \n     colonial expansion, laid the groundwork for the emergence of \n     the community of nations that, on both sides of the Atlantic, \n     shares today the same human and political values.\n       Spaniards at the close of the 15th century and beginning of \n     the 16th, actively joined and, in many occasions, led the \n     great political, social and scientific movements of their \n     age. Similarly, it is Spain's aim at the dawn of the 21st, \n     century to play a prominent role in an age, in which, once \n     again, we are witnessing great transformations. Motivated by \n     technological and scientific progress and an extraordinary \n     change on the international political scene, these \n     transformations light up a new century that has been born \n     under the sign of globalization.\n       During the final years of the 20th century, the bipolarity \n     that had divided the world in two blocks since the second \n     World War, disappeared.\n       Although it is still too soon to venture a historic \n     judgment, we can nevertheless assert that this development \n     has contributed remarkably to accelerating the process of \n     globalisation, by allowing a greater integration of the \n     economies and increasingly free communications between \n     nations.\n       The gigantic leap forward by communication and information \n     technologies over the past few years has also played a part. \n     In a progressively integrated and inter-dependent world, the \n     ``new economy'' is a daily reality.\n       But the great advances in science and technology in recent \n     times, and the good performance of the economies of our \n     respective countries, must not allow us to forget that a \n     large part of the world population lives in poverty.\n       Globalisation, the phenomenon of the ``new economy'', is \n     sustained by free-trade and free-market principles. We must \n     support these principles since they constitute the \n     foundations of the economic prosperity of nations; but we \n     must also ensure that they are compatible with the values \n     that we all share, and which find their most worthy \n     expression in the respect for rights, for all fundamental \n     human rights, including appropriate working conditions.\n       In this new international context, Spain looks with special \n     interest towards Europe and the Atlantic. After years of \n     absence, Spain is once more actively involved in the \n     political life of Europe.\n       Accession to the European Union constituted a watershed in \n     the recent history of my country. Within a short time, \n     Spaniards made an exceptional effort to adapt their entire \n     economic, industrial, and even social structures to the \n     regulations of the new environment where we have chosen to \n     live.\n       We can say, and I as a Spaniard am proud to do so, that \n     this effort has been rewarded by considerable success. Spain \n     today is an open and modern country, with a plural, highly-\n     motivated and thriving society, which faces the future with \n     optimism and aims to play a leading role in the community of \n     developed nations.\n       It is precisely because we are aware of the enormously \n     positive effect that accession to the European Union has had \n     on our country, that Spaniards from the outset have been \n     resolutely in favour of enlargement to the countries of \n     Central and Eastern Europe.\n       Europeans now have the opportunity and the moral obligation \n     to incorporate into the ambitious project now under \n     construction those countries that, on account of unfair \n     historical circumstances, remained isolated from what had \n     always been their political, economic and cultural \n     environment. The possibility of extending respect for values \n     shared by us all to Central and Eastern Europe, together with \n     the economic progress of their people, is the best guarantee \n     for peace and stability for the future of our continent.\n       Besides being a European country, Spain has historically \n     been and Atlantic nation. Our history is closely bound up \n     with the Transatlantic link that unites the two shores. \n     European unity cannot be built to the detriment or at the \n     expense of the relationship with the United States. Today, as \n     in the past, Transatlantic relations must constitute one of \n     the focal points of our international relations.\n       Spain's Atlantic vocation is not confined to the northern \n     hemisphere. Obviously, Spain feels particularly concerned \n     with everything that happens in Latin America. This region \n     currently presents very encouraging results, both in respect \n     of political and economic progress, although many problems \n     are still pending, such as poverty and social inequality.\n       The high degree of inter-relationship that exists between \n     the Iberian peoples on both sides of the Atlantic cannot be \n     explained solely in terms of the long period of time during \n     which they formed a single nation. Once the countries that \n     today make up what we call Latin America reached their \n     independence, close ties were still preserved between our \n     peoples. These ties continue to be very strong today, as \n     shown by our active participation in initiatives such as the \n     Ibero-American Summits, the promotion of relations between \n     the European Union and these countries, and the resolute \n     commitment of Spanish businessmen to the future of Latin \n     America.\n       But today's Hispanic world has expanded far beyond its \n     geographical and political boundaries. It has become a major \n     force, even in the United States, where it has taken on \n     special importance.\n       The Hispanic community in this country has an ever-growing \n     presence. This presence is not only the result of its strong \n     demographic growth, but rather constitutes a development with \n     major social and political repercussions, on account of the \n     progressively bigger role of the individuals that make it up.\n       The United States should not forget that the Union was \n     formed with the Southern states, on whose people the Hispanic \n     imprint was deeply stamped. In short, the Hispanic\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\n     world is an integral part of the history of the United \n     States.\n       Allow me to quote the words of: President Kennedy. In a \n     speech delivered in 1961, he said: ``Unfortunately, too many \n     Americans think that America was discovered in 1620, when the \n     pilgrims came to my state, and they forget the immense \n     adventure of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th in \n     the South and South-western part of the United States.''\n       Perhaps President Kennedy's words would not respond to \n     today's reality. I am sure that the Hispanic community I \n     mentioned earlier, and which is nowadays evermore flourishing \n     and influential, will ensure that the enormous colonising \n     task undertaken by its ancestors in the 16th and 17th \n     centuries in what today are the Southern and South-western \n     states of this country is given due recognition by fellow \n     Americans.\n       There is a very large Spanish section in the Library of \n     Congress. Therefore this is a good place to recall that on \n     territory that is now American, two great cultural vectors \n     meet: one coming from Northern, Anglo-Saxon Europe, the other \n     from the Mediterranean, what we could call the Latin and \n     Iberian culture.\n       It is precisely on our collaboration with, and on the \n     support of this noble institution, the Library of Congress, \n     that I place my highest hopes for recognition of a new \n     awareness of Spain's historic role in creating and forming \n     the personality of the American nation.\n       The widely recognized academic authority of the Library, \n     the new data-processing methods that give it an enormous \n     capacity for disseminating its bibliographical and \n     documentary treasures, as well as its plans for collaboration \n     with the most important libraries of our country, are our \n     best guarantee for success.\n       Honorable Senators, Honorable Representatives, a good \n     knowledge of our past will enable us to better understand our \n     future.\n       In 1840, Alexis de Tocqueville, in his work Democracy in \n     America, wrote, ``America is a country of wonders; everything \n     there is in constant change, and all change seems to be \n     progress.''\n       We are now in the first year of a new century and are \n     living in times of great change. Therefore let us live up to \n     the spirit that Tocqueville saw in 19th Century America and \n     let us ensure that all change will constitute progress, so \n     that the words with which the illustrious Frenchmen described \n     those Americans will ring true: ``In America man seems to \n     have no natural limits to his efforts; in his eyes, \n     everything that has not already been achieved is because it \n     has not yet been attempted''.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I regret I was unable to vote on the Iran \nNonproliferation Act and two judicial nominations, but it was necessary \nfor me to be in Montana today.\n  I traveled back to Montana to join with Montana farmers, Montana \nbusiness people, and Montana government officials, and Montana economic \ndevelopment experts in Great Falls and Helena to greet a high-level \nChinese agriculture purchasing delegation. This group is led by the \nChairman of COFCO, the China National Cereals, Oils, and Feedstuffs \nImport and Export Corporation, and includes senior Chinese government \nofficials. We provided this Chinese delegation with information about \nthe opportunities Montana presents and educated them about the high \nquality and competitive agricultural products and value-added food \nproducts in our state.\n  I have been working for over 20 years to expand trade and open \nmarkets overseas for Montana and American agricultural commodities, \nvalue-added agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services. \nIncreasing exports brings benefits to our farmers, our workers, and our \ncommunities in Montana.\n  China, in particular, represents a market of almost unlimited \npotential. I have worked hard for the last 10 years to expand trading \nrelations between the United States and China. This year, I am leading \nthe fight to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR. \nThe full implementation of this agricultural agreement is a vital part \nof this effort to bring China into the WTO. It will ensure that Montana \nand the rest of America will benefit from the unique opportunities in \nChina. The delegation that I brought to Montana this week is only the \nfirst step along the road to increased exports to China.\n  The outcome of today's vote on the Iran Nonproliferation Act would \nnot have changed had I been present. This measure passed, 98-0, and I \nstrongly support it. I do so for three reasons: it requires the \nPresident to report to Congress on foreign entities where there is \n``credible information'' that they have transferred certain goods, \nservices or technologies to Iran; it authorizes the President to impose \nmeasures against these entities; and it prohibits ``extraordinary'' \nU.S. payments to the Russian Space Agency until certain conditions are \nmet. I voted for a similar bill in 1998, legislation which passed the \nSenate, 90-4, and was subsequently vetoed by the President.\n  I also support the outcome of the other rollcall votes that occurred \nin the Senate today, for the confirmation of two Federal judges. Kermit \nBye, nominated to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the 8th Circuit, and George \nDaniels, nominated for District Judge of the southern district of New \nYork, are both highly qualified judges. Both were confirmed today, by \nvotes of 98-0. In both cases, my vote would have made the outcome 99-0.\n  Although I regret that I was unable to cast these three votes, I am \npleased to have advanced the economic well-being of my state by \ncontinuing my fight to open markets for Montana agriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S794-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S794-S795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INTERNET PRIVACY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention an article from today's TheStreet.Com entitled ``DoubleClick \nExec Says Privacy Legislation Needn't Crimp Results.'' For many \nAmericans, the fear of a loss of personal privacy on the Internet \nrepresents the last hurdle impeding their full embrace of this exciting \nand promising new medium. In addition, many other Internet users \nunfortunately are today unaware of the significant amount of \ninformation profiling that is occurring every time they visit a web \nsite. Notwithstanding the significant privacy concerns raised by such \nsurreptitious activity, many companies continue to oppose even a basic \nregulatory framework that would ensure the protection of consumers' \nprivacy on the Internet--a basic framework that has been successfully \nadopted with respect to other areas of our economy. That is why I was \nso pleased to see a leading Internet Executive from DoubleClick state \nthat his company would not ``face an insurmountable problem'' in \nattempting to operate under strict privacy rules. Complying with such \nrules is ``not rocket science,'' the executive stated, ``It's \nexecution.'' Obviously, what this gentleman has asserted is that strict \nprivacy rules would not impede the basic functionality and commercial \nactivity on the Internet. I look forward to working with my colleagues \non the Commerce Committee to draft legislation in this area and hope \nthat others in industry will join DoubleClick's apparent willingness to \nimplement pro-consumer privacy rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``DoubleClick Exec \nSays Privacy Legislation Needn't Crimp Results'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Street.Com, February 24, 2000]\n\n    DoubleClick Exec Says Privacy Legislation Needn't Crimp Results\n\n                           (By George Mannes)\n\n       The worst-case scenario for DoubleClick (Nasdaq:DCLK--news) \n     may not be so bad after all.\n       The Internet advertising company has suffered a barrage of \n     negative publicity recently over the information it gathers \n     on people's online activities. News that the Federal Trade \n     Commission is conducting an informal inquiry into the \n     company's data-collection policies was among the developments \n     that prompted a 23% decline in the stock's price over the \n     past week. (It rose 1 47/64 Wednesday to close at 85 55/64.)\n       But at a Wall Street conference Wednesday, a DoubleClick \n     executive at the eye of the data-collection storm told \n     investment professionals that even the worst outcome for \n     DoubleClick wouldn't present a major hurdle to its business \n     plans.\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\n                             Rocket Science\n\n       Jonathan Shapiro, senior vice president and head of the \n     company's Abacus Online Alliance, told a group of attendees \n     at the eMarketing2000 conference hosted by C.E. Unterberg \n     Towbin that DoubleClick would be able to find a way to \n     operate under stricter privacy rules. ``It's not rocket \n     science,'' Shapiro said. ``It's execution.''\n       Shapiro's comments come in the wake of assertions by \n     activists and at least one senator that, to protect people's \n     privacy online, DoubleClick and other online marketers should \n     be restricted from continuing current information-collection \n     policies. That hasn't sat well with DoubleClick, whose \n     president suggested last week that such restrictions would \n     hurt the company and threaten the financial health of all \n     Internet companies relying on advertising revenue.\n       As part of its strategy to help marketers finely target \n     their advertising messages, DoubleClick is in the process of \n     merging anonymous profiles of the online behavior of millions \n     of Web surfers with information from its recently acquired \n     subsidiary Abacus Direct. The company's goal is to tie as \n     many of the anonymous online profiles as it can to its Abacus \n     database, which details the names and off-line purchasing \n     habits of millions of consumers.\n\n\n                               opting out\n\n       At issue is how easily DoubleClick will be able to attach \n     names and addresses to its anonymous online profiles. The \n     company hopes it will be able to continue its current ``opt-\n     out'' process. Under that procedure, if people register by \n     name at a DoubleClick-affiliated site such as Alta Vista, \n     DoubleClick can attach that name to the information it \n     gathers from different sites and through Abacus Direct, \n     assuming the person has been sufficiently warned and hasn't \n     specifically refused to the arrangement, or ``opted out.'' In \n     contrast, the privacy bill that Sen. Robert Torricelli (D., \n     NJ) introduced this month would prevent DoubleClick from \n     collecting personally identifiable information unless surfers \n     have ``opted in,'' or specifically agreed to the arrangement.\n       But even if DoubleClick were required to switch from opt-in \n     to opt-out, the company wouldn't face an insurmountable \n     problem, according to Shapiro. ``If we have to go to opt-in . \n     . . we'll get people to opt in,'' he told a small group of \n     investors at a breakout session.\n       Asked how the company would be able to do this, Shapiro \n     made it sound like no big deal. ``You'd do a value \n     exchange,'' he said, outlining a scenario in which the \n     company could easily get 20 online merchants with which it \n     does business to each contribute a $10-off to a coupon book. \n     Then DoubleClick could use that coupon book as an incentive \n     to have online consumers opt in. The merchants, not \n     DoubleClick, would absorb the cost of the coupons, and \n     consumers would benefit by receiving a $200 value, he said.\n\n\n                           lifting the gloom\n\n       Shapiro's comments stand in contrast to the gloomy \n     statements made last week by DoubleClick President Kevin Ryan \n     who said if companies were forced to get Internet surfers to \n     opt in, ``it would be extremely hard for the Internet to be \n     successful.'' Ryan may have been talking about having to get \n     permission even to create anonymous online data, not just \n     personally identifiable profiles.\n       But a reading of Torricelli's bill, as well as an FTC \n     complaint filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n     indicates that proponents of opt-in want it only for \n     personally identifiable information. ``If there's a realistic \n     assurance that the information collected will remain \n     anonymous and not be tied to an actual identity, there is no \n     real need for an affirmative opt-in,'' says David Sobel, \n     general counsel for EPIC.\n       In a further indication that opt-in isn't a life-or-death \n     issue for DoubleClick, Shapiro said the company wouldn't have \n     to personally identify all the now-anonymous surfers in its \n     database before the Abacus information would be useful. What \n     DoubleClick will be able to do, he said, is to use a sample \n     of identifiable surfers--for whom it has personally \n     identifiable purchasing histories and online habits--to make \n     an educated guess at the buying habits of surfers who remain \n     anonymous. DoubleClick believes that tactic will be possible \n     using information from about 5 million personally \n     identifiable Internet users--a sample size the company hopes \n     to amass by the end of the year. So far, the company has \n     between 100,000 and 200,000 profiles in its combined off-\n     line-online database, Shapiro said.\n       But that doesn't mean the company would be ready to quit \n     after collecting 5 million of these profiles. ``We would like \n     to, over time, learn who people are,'' Shapiro said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S795-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978 to\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\nmodify procedures relating to orders for surveillance and searches for \nforeign intelligence purposes, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the counterintelligence reform act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation which would correct procedures under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. I offer this bill on behalf of Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Thurmond, Senator Biden, Senator Grassley, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Helms, Senator Schumer, and Senator Sessions.\n  This is legislation which is designed to correct a very pressing \nproblem. This bill refines the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to \nenable the appropriate investigations of espionage to avoid the very \nserious mistakes which were made during the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho \nLee. The references to Dr. Lee's investigation are made only for the \npurpose of illustrating the procedural problems which this legislation \nis designed to correct. The determination as to whether or not Mr. Wen \nHo Lee is guilty will remain for the court of competent jurisdiction \nwhere he has been indicted.\n  There was information released into the public domain at Mr. Lee's \nbail hearing which underscores the tremendous importance of this \nparticular case. Dr. Stephen Younger, assistant laboratory director for \nnuclear weapons at Los Alamos, testified at Dr. Lee's bail hearing on \nDecember 13, 1999, and said:\n\n       These codes and their associated databases and the input \n     file, combined with someone that knew how to use them, could, \n     in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global \n     strategic balance.\n\n  It is hard to have any item of greater importance than changing the \nglobal strategic balance.\n  Dr. Younger further testified:\n\n       They enable the possessor to design the only objects that \n     could result in the military defeat of America's conventional \n     forces. . . They represent the gravest possible security risk \n     to . . . the supreme national interest.\n\n  Again, it is hard to find more forceful language as to the \nseriousness of this particular matter than the potential military \ndefeat of America's conventional forces.\n  During the course of this investigation, there were very serious time \nlapses while the FBI sought to get a warrant on Dr. Lee under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  The FBI made the FISA request in June of 1997. It was refused by the \nDepartment of Justice on August 12, 1997, and then FBI Director Freeh \nsent FBI Assistant Director John Lewis to talk personally to Attorney \nGeneral Reno. Attorney General Reno then appointed a Department of \nJustice subordinate named Daniel Seikaly, who reviewed the matter and \nrejected it. Attorney General Reno, as she conceded in testimony \npresented to the Judiciary Committee on June 8, 1999, did not follow up \non the matter, leaving this very important request rejected.\n  The proposed legislation would require that when the Director of the \nFBI makes a request for a FISA warrant that the Attorney General \npersonally must make the decision as to whether the FISA warrant \nrequest should be submitted to the court for action. The legislation \nfurther provides that when the Attorney General declines to submit the \nFISA application to the court, the rejection must be in writing. This \nwould give the FBI Director a roadmap, so to speak, as to what \nadditional information is necessary to have the warrant request \nsubmitted to the court.\n  After the Department of Justice declined to submit the FISA warrant \nto the court, the FBI investigation of the case was inactive for some \n16 months. It took from August of 1997 to December of 1997 for the FBI \nHeadquarters to send a letter regarding the FISA request to the FBI \nAlbuquerque Field Office, where it lay dormant until November of 1998. \nFrom the time the FISA application was not forwarded to the court to \nthe time the FBI office in Albuquerque finally acted, some 16 months \nelapsed. These 16 months were very crucial with respect to the \nactivities of Dr. Lee.\n  This legislation further provides that when the Attorney General \nrejects a FISA application in writing, the Director of the FBI has the \nobligation to personally supervise the matter.\n  The Department of Energy then initiated a polygraph of Dr. Lee, in a \nvery unusual way, that has since been criticized by the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board. The Department of Energy \nrepresented that Dr. Lee passed the polygraph when, in fact, he had \nnot. The Secretary of Energy even made an announcement on national \ntelevision to the effect that Dr. Lee had passed the polygraph when, in \nfact, he had not. That threw the FBI off course, thinking that a passed \npolygraph exonerated the suspect. This legislation provides that an \nagency such as the Department of Energy may not take action on a \npolygraph, that these matters are to be left to the FBI, which has the \nparamount authority to investigate these matters.\n  The FBI then conducted another polygraph, but not until February 10, \n1999, some 6 weeks after the polygraph he allegedly passed. Even though \nDr. Lee failed this second polygraph, no action was taken to terminate \nDr. Lee until March 8. In the interim, he deleted many of the files \nthat are in issue. These deletions took place on January 20, February \n9, 11, 12, and 17, all to the potential prejudice of the United States. \nDr. Lee did not have a search warrant executed until April 9, which is \na very long lapse before any official action had been taken.\n  The legislation further provides that when a suspect is left in place \nfor the purpose of the investigation, the FBI must make this request in \nwriting and that to that agency. The agency, such as the Department of \nEnergy, must then formulate a plan within 30 days to structure how that \nsuspect will be left in place while minimizing the exposure of \nclassified information to that person.\n  One of the reasons given by the Department of Justice in declining to \ngo forward with the FISA application was that Dr. Lee was not \n``currently engaged'' in objectionable activities--to use mild words. \nThis bill changes that requirement to probable cause on the totality of \nthe circumstances.\n  That is a brief summary of what this legislation would do. It is the \nview of the sponsors of this bill that it is very important for it to \nmove forward so that on pending espionage investigations we do not have \nthe lapses that occurred in this very important case.\n\n  I am pleased to note that all the members of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee have joined in cosponsoring this legislation. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Torricelli, for his cooperation. Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Grassley, and Senator Sessions have all cosponsored among the \nRepublican members, as have Senators Feingold and Schumer, in addition \nto Senator Torricelli. Senator Biden was consulted specially and is a \ncosponsor because he was the author of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act back in 1978. Senator Helms has asked to be added as a \ncosponsor, which he has.\n  The subcommittee has had some substantial difficulty in ``birth'' \npains; it has not really been born, to the extent that the subcommittee \nhas not been funded. We have worked really from our own personal \nstaffs. We have had three fellows and one detailee. We have completed a \nvery lengthy detailed report, some 65 pages, which is the product of \nextraordinary work by Mr. Doman McArthur of my staff, in collaboration \nwith Senator Torricelli's staff and the staffs of others. We have gone \nthrough the 65-page report with a fine-tooth comb to be sure that it is \nprecise, exact, and does not make any disclosures as to any classified \ninformation.\n  The subcommittee has deferred holding hearings on the Wen Ho Lee \nmatter, which had been scheduled for December, at the specific request \nof Director Freeh. Director Freeh met with Torricelli and myself and \nrequested that the hearings on Dr. Lee not go forward substantively, \nwhich might cause some problem with the pending prosecution. We do have \nhearings scheduled on the legislation for March 7, 8 and 21. I have \nalready informed FBI Director Freeh of our intentions to proceed with \nthose hearings, which will be on the substance as to how the act should \nbe reformed. We have given notice to Director Freeh that we would \nappreciate his presence as a witness. He has said he would be glad to \nattend.\n  That is a very brief statement of a very complex matter. It is my \nhope we will have the final clearance from the\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nDepartment of Justice to be able to file the full 65-page report which \nwill elaborate upon the brief summary which I have presented.\n  I am delighted to yield to my very distinguished colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Torricelli, the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter for yielding \ntime to me. I also thank him for his perseverance and diligence in \nworking on this issue over the course of the last several months.\n  I also express particular thanks to Senator Biden who in reviewing \nthis legislation made very important additions and allowed us to \nproceed on a bipartisan basis for what I think is an important and \nworthwhile change in the laws dealing with foreign intelligence \nsurveillance.\n  The origins of this legislation--part of the Judiciary Committee's \noversight--is the question of how the Department of Justice handled \nallegations of Chinese espionage at our most important National \nLaboratories.\n  The focus of this review, of course, had to do with the case of Dr. \nWen Ho Lee, a scientist who was charged in December with 59 counts of \nillegally removing secrets from computer information at the Los Alamos \nLaboratory. It appears that Dr. Lee was the subject of interest or \ninvestigations for espionage for over 17 years. He was dealing with the \nmost important weapons secrets possessed by his government critical to \nthe security of the United States.\n  It would be difficult for anyone in this Government to explain to the \nAmerican people why, despite 17 years of investigation and some reasons \nfor considerable doubt all during this time, he was permitted to \ncontinue with his job and retain access to highly classified \ninformation.\n  Much is still to be learned about this case. A criminal case is \nproceeding and an investigation. That is for, in some instances, others \nto deal with. That does not mean we do not already know some things \nthat can change the conduct in this Government and the laws under which \nwe govern ourselves. We have learned through this investigation that \nthis was all made possible by a series of procedural and investigative \nerrors that gave Dr. Lee this opportunity to download this highly \nclassified material to an unsecured computer.\n  In truth, we do not yet know whether or not, when this unguarded \nmaterial was in an unsecured computer, in fact it got to foreign agents \nor other interested parties other than people with proper clearance in \nthe U.S. Government. We do not know. We may never know. But we do know \nthis after interviewing many witnesses and thousands of documents: \nThere was a startling, almost unbelievable failure of coordination and \ncommunication between the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the \nDepartment of Energy in dealing with this matter, and only through that \nlack of coordination was an allegation of possible espionage able to \nlead to 17 years of continued access and the possibility that this \ninformation was compromised.\n  As early as 1982, the FBI was aware that Dr. Lee was engaged in \nsuspicious activities. Yet both at that time and in the years that \nfollowed there was no action taken to limit access to classified \nmaterial. The Department of Energy detected Dr. Lee transferring an \ninordinate number of systems from a secured system to an unsecured \nsystem in 1993 and 1994. Personnel responsible for reporting that \ninformation failed to do so.\n  In 1997, the FBI had an opportunity to stop Dr. Lee, but they were \nstymied by the denial of the Department of Justice of a request \nsubmitted by the FBI for a warrant to further investigate Dr. Lee. It \nis this failure that brings us here today.\n  The evidence supporting a FISA request for their warrant was \noverwhelming. It had been building for years. No single piece of \nevidence may have been sufficient to warrant a criminal case, but they \nwere more than sufficient to raise a proper level of suspicion to \nsupport the issuing of a warrant.\n\n  Now we know that the request for this warrant, a FISA application, \nwas never even considered by the Attorney General of the United States. \nWhen the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Freeh, \nsent a personal representative to meet with the Attorney General to \nexpress his concern about the warrant application, which he was right \nand proper to do, the Attorney General delegated the matter to a \nsubordinate who was unfamiliar with the matter and who had never \nprocessed a similar request--no experience, no knowledge, no \ninvolvement--and the final disposition of the matter, therefore, was \npredictable. The request was denied. The warrant was not issued, and an \nopportunity potentially to either apprehend someone committing a \ncriminal act or to have prevented further damage, if any occurred, was \nlost.\n  Unfortunately, this problem was compounded in that when the FBI was \ndenied this warrant, in my judgment, the matter should have been \nappealed but it was allowed to languish, and then further hampered by \nthe Department of Energy which conducted a polygraph of Dr. Lee, and \nthen, incredibly, unbelievably incorrectly concluded that he had passed \nthe test.\n  It is a series of compounded errors of procedure and judgment. It is \ndifficult for the Congress to legislate good judgment for the proper \nexecution of responsibilities. If we cannot do so, we can at least \ndesign the laws to provide for greater accountability.\n  That is, indeed, what is being done by my colleagues. Under the \nlegislation we are now introducing, Senator Specter and I have written \namendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide that \nupon the personal request of the Director of the FBI, the Attorney \nGeneral must personally review the FISA requests--no subordinate, no \nuninformed associate. This is a matter of national security. The \nAttorney General has no greater responsibility than protecting the \nsecrets of the U.S. Government. This matter belongs on the Attorney \nGeneral's desk, and under this legislation that is where it will rest.\n  There are those who may argue that making the Attorney General \ndirectly responsible will somehow provide an avalanche of work, that \nthey will not be able to deal with all of these matters. Appropriately, \nthe legislation has been designed so this provision is triggered only \nby the personal request from the Director of the FBI--no subordinate, \nno associate, no one else in the Government. So the number of cases \nwill be extremely limited. But when asked by the Director of the FBI, \none person, and one person in this Government alone, will have direct \nresponsibility.\n  Second, the legislation requires that if the Attorney General decides \nnot to forward a FISA application to the court, that decision must be \ncommunicated in writing to the FBI Director along with specific \nrecommendations as to what investigative steps should be undertaken to \nmeet the probable cause requirements. Matters of national security on \nthis level cannot fall in departmental cracks--not get lost somewhere \nbetween Justice and the FBI. This will ensure that in those cases when \nthe Attorney General has personally rejected this request the reasons \nwill be stated, the FBI will be told why and then given a chance to \nreturn having met the appropriate probable cause standard.\n  Third, the legislation requires that the FBI Director must personally \nsupervise the implementation of the Attorney General's recommendations \nto ensure once again that in the highest levels of the U.S. Government \nthese unusual but critical cases of national security dealing with \nforeign espionage are dealt with not by subordinates, but that this \nCongress can hold people for which it has responsibility, oversight, \nand votes to confirm--such as the Attorney General and the FBI \nDirector--directly accountable.\n  I believe these are appropriate responses to what we have learned to \ndate out of this investigation. But I conclude by saying both what this \nlegislation is and what it is not.\n  This legislation is not an attempt to lower the probable cause \nstandard for what is required for a warrant and a FISA application. \nProbable cause is a standard of law. It should be taken seriously. The \nrights of no citizen should be violated by an intrusive or curious \ngovernment. The standard remains.\n\n  What is being changed here is accountability, not a lessening of \ncivil\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nliberties. We simply want to know that the standard which has always \nexisted of probable cause will be used, that procedures will be \nfollowed, that people will be held accountable, not that the Government \nis any more or any less intrusive. The probable cause standard remains \nthe cornerstone of American liberties to ensure that the Government has \nreason and merit as a matter of law to involve itself in the privacy of \nour citizens.\n  I proudly offer this legislation with Senator Specter. I believe it \nis a good and appropriate response. I thank the Senator for his \npatience in the drafting. I listened to my colleagues, particularly on \nthis side of the aisle, with relatively modest changes we have \nrecommended, all of which the Senator has incorporated. I look forward \nto the committee and then the Senate enacting this legislation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \nis a very vital part of our arsenal to combat terrorism and espionage. \nFor 20 years, it has enabled the FBI to keep track of major threats to \nour security while preserving the constitutional rights of Americans. \nBasically, it provides for a sort of super search warrant, allowing the \nFBI, under certain unique circumstances, to eavesdrop upon activities, \nafter showing a probable cause to a Federal judge, without having to \ndisclose this eavesdropping in ways that they would have to under a \nnormal warrant for a wiretap or a physical search.\n  FISA has been very useful to deal with terrorism, and also with \nespionage cases.\n  Senator Specter has undertaken an effort to look into what may or may \nnot have transpired at our National Laboratories in the celebrated case \nof Wen Ho Lee and others. This has been the subject of some very \nlegitimate discussion, and occasionally some partisan discussion. But \nknowing Senator Specter as long as I have, I do not doubt his desire to \nlook into these cases that have transpired, and the consequences of any \nleakage of classified information from any of our National \nLaboratories, for the primary purpose of seeing to it that it does not \nhappen again, if in fact it did happen, as well as to determine what \ndid happen.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Torricelli have been looking into these \nrecent cases, especially, as I said, the case of Wen Ho Lee at Los \nAlamos National Laboratory. As a result of that inquiry, Senator \nSpecter is proposing what I think is a very important series of \nsensible amendments to this act we call FISA. I am pleased to cosponsor \nthis bill, having been an original author of that legislation in 1978, \nalong with Birch Bayh and others.\n  The initial bill with which Senator Specter approached me and others \nhad a few areas where I thought it could be improved. I wish to \npublicly thank Senator Specter for agreeing to the changes I suggested \nin his proposed legislation.\n  One of the dilemmas that exists, in the debate about whether the \nAttorney General and the Justice Department and/or the FBI were reading \nfrom the same page in the hymnal on how to investigate the Wen Ho Lee \ncase, is the issue of whether the FBI communicated enough information \nto the Attorney General so that, under the reading of the FISA law, the \nAttorney General could conclude that there was sufficient reason to get \na search or electronic surveillance court order. There has been a \nlittle bit of disagreement, at a minimum, between the FBI and the \nJustice Department as to who said what, when, and what request was made \nwhen. It has led to a serious political controversy. I think it has \nalso led, as a consequence, on both sides of the aisle, to some \nposturing and partisanship about a significant national security issue.\n  One of Senator Specter's most important ideas in this bill, one which \nis going to seem commonsensical to most Americans, is to make it clear \nthat if something is of such consequence that the Director of the FBI \nbelieves there should be a FISA hearing and authority granted to allow \nthe FBI to use invasive measures to eavesdrop upon conversations and/or \nget records, for example, from computer data and the like, if it is \nthat important, the FBI Director can, under this new amendment to FISA, \nput that request in writing to the Attorney General and the Attorney \nGeneral, whoever that may be, then has to personally sign off or not \nsign off, so we avoid this debate that is taking place now about \nwhether second level people or third level people made the right \njudgment or wrong judgment, and whether or not there was any \nmalfeasance.\n  So this is a very practical solution. If this legislation had been in \nplace 3 years ago, 5 years ago, there would be no doubt as to what \nhappened. Had the FBI said this is critical and this is national \nsecurity, the Attorney General personally would have had to say yes or \nno. That is where the record is unclear in the Wen Ho Lee case. This \nbill would eliminate such doubt in future similar cases if and when \nthey arise, and they surely will arise.\n  Section 2 of this bill permits the judge to consider the past \nactivities of the target of an investigation--that is, the person upon \nwhom they want to eavesdrop and/or whose records they want to secretly \nexamine. So, for example, the Attorney General would be able to say, in \na closed FISA hearing: Your Honor, not only do we think this is \njustified because of some current activity, but we can show you \nevidence that in 1991 they were engaged in this suspicious activity, in \n1993 they were engaged in that, in 1995 they were engaged in this, \ntherefore lending greater credibility to the argument that a FISA court \norder should be issued by the judge.\n\n  Again, in this Wen Ho Lee case, and other cases that Senator Specter \nhas examined, there has been discussion of the fact that sometimes \nthese folks had been under investigation before. Would that not lend \ngreater weight to the need for this FISA request to be granted? So we \nclear that up in this legislation, rather than only allowing the \ntarget's current activity to be brought up.\n  Section 3 of this proposal requires the FISA court to be told if the \ntarget of a proposed search or surveillance has a relationship with a \nFederal law enforcement or intelligence agency. This came up in this \ncase as well. The case is being investigated. It turns out at some \npoint one of the persons in the past had been also a source for the \nFBI. The FBI had gone to this person and said: Will you be a source for \nus, looking into the possibility of some illegal activity? Then that \nvery person becomes the target, and that very person is never able to \ntell, nor does the FBI or the CIA say: By the way, Your Honor, we were \nworking with them. That is why they went ahead and did the following.\n  Up to now, when the Federal Government has asked for a FISA court \njudge to give this surveillance authority, it has not been required to \nsay: By the way, Your Honor, this person in the past had worked with us \nas a source, as a person cooperating with us.\n  This is a new and useful protection for Americans, because the \nconduct that might seem suspicious could be a result of what the law \nenforcement agency had actually asked them to do. It seems only fair to \nthe target to be able to have that information known to the judge.\n  This is typical of the Senator from Pennsylvania, that he looks out \nfor individual rights as well as the interests of law enforcement.\n  There are several other interesting provisions in this bill, \nincluding some to improve relations between the FBI and other agencies, \nand I am sure there will be further refinements in this bill when it is \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee. The important thing is that \nSenator Specter is working, I think effectively and in a bipartisan \nmanner, to ensure that his inquiry into the Wen Ho Lee case leads to \nuseful changes and not just to partisan recriminations. I compliment \nhim on that, because the purpose of oversight is not only to find out \nwho struck John but, in the national interest, to find the best way to \nprevent something such as this from happening again. So I compliment \nhim and again thank him for acceding to the more than several changes I \nasked for in this legislation.\n  I think the amendments to existing law that this bill will enact are \ngood amendments. I think America will be well served, and I would argue \nthat the individual rights of Americans will be in no greater jeopardy \nafter this passes than they ever were. They are protected; they will \ncontinue to be protected; and some of these changes will\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\neven help to further protect the rights of individual Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Bunning, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kerrey, \n        and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 2090. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na 1 year moratorium on certain diesel fuel excise taxes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           the america's transportation recovery act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's \nTransportation Recovery Act of 2000 to address the skyrocketing prices \nof fuel which supports our Nation's truckers, farmers, public \ntransportation, and other users. This bill would temporarily suspend \nthe Federal excise tax on diesel fuel for 1 year, or until the price of \ncrude oil is reduced to the December 31, 1999, price.\n  I am pleased to be joined by many of my colleagues and add as \noriginal cosponsors to this bill both the majority leader, Senator \nLott, and the minority leader, Senator Daschle, as well as Senators \nCraig, Feinstein, Conrad, Bunning, Landrieu, and Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  The current fuel crisis is an example of how a discussion leans \ntoward economic factors and international price fixing rather than \nfocusing on the daily effect on American people.\n  Early this week, as Members know, nearly 300 truck drivers drove from \nall over the east coast--in fact, some from as far away as Texas--to \nrally at the steps of the Capitol. Their cause was the increasing price \nof diesel fuel, which is increasing their costs to the point that many \nmay go out of business.\n  I know the trucking life. I put myself through college by driving an \n18-wheeler. Just last December, I renewed my CDC driver's license. \nAlthough I don't drive commercially anymore, it does keep me in touch \nwith the working men and women in the trucking industry. Since I own a \nsmall rig, I know firsthand how the fuel crisis impacts those who \ndepend on it because my fuel bills have doubled in the last year alone, \nas have theirs.\n  When private citizens give their time to come to Washington, the \nissue is not about profit margins, stock prices, or other abstract \nmatters; it is because they are fighting for their lives. Long-distance \ndrivers, as Members probably know, need between 200 and 400 gallons of \ndiesel every 24 hours. Add that to truck payments, permits, insurance, \nupkeep, road fees, and the many other costs for independent trucking, \nand many are barely scraping by. It is no wonder the price increase is \nputting so many out of business. The only way they can survive is to \npass it on to the consumer. Most of them cannot do that because the \nsmall independents are, more often than not, subcontracting to other \nfirms.\n  At Tuesday's rally, one driver told me he knew of two men who had \ngone bankrupt in the last week alone. Any person viewing the television \ncoverage of the rally could not help but be moved by the young couple \nliving in their truck with two small children, both under the age of 3, \nbecause they could not make house payments. Yet another driver told me \nhe had only $8 to his name and made it here for the rally.\n  Many people think this probably does not affect them. Think about \nthis: About 95 percent or more of everything in America, everything we \nbuy, comes by truck. It may also be on a train, airplane, or ship, but \nfrom the point of origin to the point of delivery is often by truck. \nThese people don't want handouts; they don't want food stamps; they \ndon't want to be on welfare; they want to work. If those rigs stop \nrolling, very simply, the Nation stops rolling, too.\n  These trucks don't run on solar energy, as was mentioned this morning \nin our Energy Committee hearing by Senator Craig, and they don't run on \nwind power; they run on diesel fuel. This problem extends to our \nfarmers and ranchers. The increased costs to our farmers and ranchers, \ncoupled with declining commodity prices, makes it very difficult for \nthem to run a farm.\n  In past Congresses, we have had to pass emergency agriculture relief \npackages which have allowed the smaller producers to receive enough \nassistance to get by financially one more year. Now, along with the \ntruckers in public transportation, farmers will probably see future \ndiesel prices nearing $2 a gallon as they go into this year's planting \nseason.\n\n  We cannot let this Nation come to a standstill because we are captive \nto foreign oil cartels. Not too many years ago, we fought a war in the \nMiddle East to protect oil-producing countries from the Iraqi invasion. \nOur young men and women make up the bulk of the military might for many \nnations today. They put their lives on the line to protect some of the \nArab countries against their own cousins, and now we are being repaid \nfor our generosity by the rising cost of fuel from OPEC.\n  Certainly, if there is anyone who thinks there is not a national \nsecurity component to being 55-percent dependent on foreign oil, they \nneed to think again. The fact that we are too dependent on foreign oil \nand we currently have no national energy policy is a point of \ndiscussion for another day.\n  Right now, we face a crisis we need to do something about. That is \nwhy I and my colleagues are introducing this bill. This bill will \ntemporarily suspend the excise tax on diesel fuel for 1 year, which is \n24.4 cents a gallon, in an effort to ease the burdens on so many \nAmericans based on our lack of a national long-term energy policy. This \nwill help primarily truckers, farmers, and public transportation but in \nthe long run will help everybody. While it does not address the long-\nterm problem of our insufficient domestic oil supply, it will provide \nemergency temporary relief. I believe it is a modest and yet essential \nstep.\n  At a time when our citizens are being shaken down by a foreign oil \ncartel and then again by rising taxes, it is somewhat offensive to go \nthrough the same kind of a shakedown twice. The Government is currently \nrunning a surplus, taking in more tax money than we are spending. We \nwill have several years of surplus money, and I am sure we can afford \nto give a short-term break to the hard-working Americans who deliver \nour food and take our children to and from school as well as pick up \nour garbage.\n  This particular tax, as I understand, was never supposed to be \npermanent. It was imposed as a deficit reduction measure, and we simply \ndo not have a deficit nor will we have in years to come. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation with prompt passage, to provide \nimmediate relief for America's truckers, farmers, and other diesel fuel \nusers.\n  I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Act that authorized construction of the \nSan Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project, California, to facilitate \nwater transfers in the Central Valley Project; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  The Construction of the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Projects\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to amend the \nlegislation that authorized construction of the San Luis Unit of the \nCentral Valley Project in California. Enactment of this bill would \nallow water districts in the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley \nProject to supplement their federal water supplies with purchases of \nwater from the State Water Project. At present, federal law prohibits \nthe delivery of non-federal water to districts in the San Luis Unit \nuntil certain conditions are met.\n  The San Luis Unit is the last component created by federal law in the \nCentral Valley Project, which is the largest Bureau of Reclamation \nproject in the United States. Water service to districts in the San \nLuis Unit is often curtailed because of limitations imposed in pumping \nin the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.\n  It is customary for water districts in the San Luis Unit to \nsupplement their supplies through purchases on the open market. \nHowever, current federal law prohibits them from purchasing supplies \nfrom the State Water Project and having these delivered over federal \nfacilities. Making such deliveries is relatively easy because state and \nfederal project conveyance facilities are interconnected. Prohibiting \npurchase of state water for delivery over federal facilities limits the \nopportunities available for San Luis Unit districts to obtain as large \na supplemental supply as they would like.\n  Mr. President, this bill has already passed the House as H.R. 3077. \nIt will impose no additional costs on the federal government. It \ncontains provisions which assure that the additional water obtained by \ndistricts in the San Luis Unit cannot be used in a manner that would \nexacerbate current groundwater drainage problems. It is consistent with \nthe provisions in the Central Valley Project Improvement Act that \nsought to encourage the exchange of water by willing sellers to provide \nadditional supplies at reasonable cost to willing buyers. I urge the \nSenate to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 2092. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to modify \nauthorities relating to the use of pen registers and trap and trace \ndevices, to modify provisions relating to fraud and related activities \nin connection with computers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          high tech crime bill\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my friend \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, a high tech crime bill aimed at combating \ncomputer crime. For the past nine months I have been discussing with \nlaw enforcement and computer crime experts how best to address the \ngrowing threat that computer crimes pose to our increasingly networked \nsociety.\n  Many of the best solutions are far-reaching and complex and will only \nbe achieved through sustained and thoughtful hard work on an \ninternational level by both government and the private sector in the \nyears ahead. There are, however, modes changes to existing laws that \ncan be made now, which will serve as a significant first step in a \nmuch-needed effort to give law enforcement to tools they need to \neffectively fight cybercrime. The legislation that Senator Kyl and I \nare introducing today will, among other things, make the following \nchanges to existing law.\n  We must update our laws governing the use of what are called pen \nregisters (which record the numbers dialed on a phone line) and trap \nand trace devices (which capture incoming electronic impulses that \nidentify the originating number). These laws have become outdated and \ntheir procedures are too slow for the speed of criminals online.\n  Under current law, investigators must obtain a trap and trace order \nin each jurisdiction through which an electronic communication is made. \nThus, for example, to trace on online communication between two \nterrorists that starts at a computer in New York, goes through a server \nin New Jersey, bounces off a computer in Wisconsin, and then ends in \nSan Francisco, investigators may be forced to go successively to a \ncourt in each jurisdiction for an order permitting the trace (not to \nmention having to approach each provider along the way). In the recent \nDenial of Service attacks, hackers utilized dozens or even hundreds of \n``zombie'' computers from which the attacks on specific sites were then \nlaunched. No doubt, these computers were located all over the country. \nand tracing them quickly under current law is therefore virtually \nimpossible.\n  This legislation will amend current law to authorize the issuance of \na single order to completely trace an online communication to its \nsource, regardless of how many intermediate sites it passes through. \nLaw enforcement must still meet the exact same burden to obtain such an \norder; the only difference is that they will not have to repeat this \nprocess over and over each time a communication passes to a new carrier \nin a different Jurisdiction.\n  One deficiency of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.C.C. \nSec. 1030, is its requirement of proof of damages in excess of $5,000. \nIn several cases, prosecutors have found that while computer intruders \nhad attempted to harm computers vital to our critical infrastructures, \nsuch as telecommunications and financial services, damages of $5,000 \ncould not be proven. Nevertheless, these intrusions pose a great risk \nof harm to our country and must be prosecuted, punished, and deterred.\n  The Schumer-Kyl bill will unambiguously permit federal jurisdiction \nat the outset of an unauthorized intrusion into critical infrastructure \nsystems rather than having investigators wait for any damage \nassessment. Crimes that exceed the $5,000 limit will be prosecuted as \nfelonies, while crimes below that amount will be defined as \nmisdemeanors. The bill will also clarify that a $5,000 loss resulting \nfrom a computer attack may include the costs of responding to the \noffense, conducting a damage assessment, restoring a system to its \noriginal condition, and any lost revenue or costs incurred as a result \nof an interruption in service. The $5,000 requirement should not serve \nas a barrier to the prosecution of serious computer criminals who \nthreaten our country's networks.\n\n  This legislation will also modify a directive to the sentencing \ncommission contained in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1999, which required a mandatory minimum sentence of six months' \nimprisonment for certain violations of section 1030. Computer \nintrusions that violate the statute vary in their severity and \nmaliciousness. All violations should be punished, but under the current \nregime the mandatory imprisonment applies to some misdemeanor charges, \neven where the attack caused no damage. As a result, some prosecutors \nhave declined to bring cases, knowing that the result would be \nmandatory imprisonment. We should insure that federal prosecutors are \nbringing cases under section 1030, but we also should insure that the \nsentences being meted out fit the crime.\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\n  Often the most technologically savvy individuals are juveniles who \nhave grown up with computers always at their fingertips. Unfortunately, \ncertain juveniles are committing the most serious computer crimes and \nwreaking havoc on our critical infrastructures. For example, one \njuvenile hacker caused an airport in Worcester, Massachusetts to shut \ndown for over six hours when its telecommunications connections were \nbrought down. Similarly, two California teenagers broke into sensitive \nmilitary computers, including those at Lawrence Livermore National \nLaboratory and the U.S. Air Force.\n  As a longer term strategy, we need to do a better job of teaching our \nchildren from a very young age that, like anywhere else, certain \nconduct on the Internet is wrong and illegal. But we also need to send \na clear message that crimes on the Internet will have real \nconsequences. This legislation will amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030 to give \nfederal law enforcement authorities the power to investigate and \nprosecute juvenile offenders of computer crimes in appropriate cases. \nThe bill will make juveniles fifteen years of age or older who commit \nthe most serious violations of section 1030 eligible for federal \nprosecution in cases where the Attorney General certifies that such \nprosecution is appropriate. In conjunction with the elimination of the \nsix-month mandatory minimum, this legislation will provide a balanced, \nmeasured approach to juvenile hacking crimes.\n  Again, these are just the first steps that should be taken in a very \nlong battle against cybercrime that many of us will wage for years to \ncome. And while we fight computer crime by modifying our criminal laws, \nwe also should seek concomitant ways to fully protect the fundamental \nrights of innocent individuals on the Internet.\n  I want to thank Senator Kyl for joining me in introducing this bill. \nAs chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information, I know that he cares deeply about these issues \nand I look forward to working with him on this commonsense, bipartisan \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2093. A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to ensure that full obligation authority is provided for the \nIndian reservation roads program; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n     the transportation equity act for the 21st century and Indian \n                           reservation roads\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined \nby my colleagues Jeff Bingaman and Max Baucus  in introducing \nlegislation to preserve precious dollars allocated by the Congress and \nthe President for construction of Indian reservation roads.\n  There is no doubt that the Indian reservation road system is the \npoorest in our nation, and every federal dollar allocated for improving \nthis situation should be directed to our nation's Indian reservations. \nThe lack of adequate roads and bridges is a chronic problem on Indian \nreservations, where unemployment averages 35 percent and more than half \nof American Indian live in hard poverty.\n  Since 1982, when my Senate amendment added Indian roads to our \nfederal highway trust fund accounts, all funds allocated for Indian \nroads have been used for that purpose. In ISTEA, which preceeded the \nenactment of the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century \n(TEA-21), the Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) program reached a level of \n$191 million per year.\n  Many of us in Congress worked hard to increase this IRR funding to \n$225 million in the first year of TEA-21 (FY 1998), and $275 million \neach year thereafter, through FY 2003. Unfortunately, a little noticed \nprovision for Federal Lands Highways, placing an ``obligation \nlimitation'' on the IRR program, has resulted in the transfer of funds \nintended for Indian reservations to be transferred to the 50 states.\n  In FY 1998, the amount deducted for this transfer to states from the \nIRR program was $24.2 million. In FY 1999, it was $31.7 million; and in \nFY 2000, the obligation limitation resulted in a loss of $34.9 million \nthat could have been used for Indian reservation road building.\n  In all previous enacting legislation since 1982, federal funds \nintended for IRR programs have been used for IRR purposes. Only in TEA-\n21 was this changed due to the application of the obligation limitation \nto Federal Lands Highways and the IRR program.\n  Our bill will simply exclude the IRR program from this annual \ndeduction that has totaled, in the past three years, more than $90 \nmillion. This money, while helpful to many states, is more badly needed \non Indian reservations and should be preserved for that purpose. By \nexcluding the IRR program from this obligation limitation provision, we \nwill be increasing federal funds for Indian roads without increasing \nthe cost of the total program. We will be focusing the funds for Indian \nroads on Indian roads, as we have intended since the IRR program first \nbecame part of our federal highway trust fund in 1982.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in redirecting funds intended for \nIndian road construction to be dedicated to that purpose.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my good \nfriend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, to introduce \nthis bill along with Senator Baucus. This bill assures that our Native \nAmerican communities have the funding they need for critical \ntransportation projects. Our bill will fund the Indian Reservation Road \nProgram for the next three years with at least $275 million per year, \nthe full amount authorized by Congress.\n  Mr. President, since I came to the Senate in 1983, I've worked hard \nto promote economic development and create new jobs for my state of New \nMexico. One thing I learned very quickly is that you can't expect to \nattract new industry unless you have the basic infrastructure to \nsupport residential and commercial needs. The most important \ninfrastructure needs include transportation, power, communications, \nwater and sewers. Without these basic services at affordable rates, \nopportunities to create good jobs will simply not develop.\n  Today our country is fortunate to have one of the strongest economies \nin history. Our recent advances in job creation and economic growth are \naccomplishments that all Americans should be proud of. Unfortunately, \nas many of us know, some sectors of our nation continue to lag behind \nthe wave of economic prosperity that has swept the nation. In \nparticular, I remain concerned about our Native American communities. \nUnemployment rates today in Indian Country frequently top 30, 40, and \neven 50 percent. Mr. President, the nation must not stand by while \nIndian Country is literally being left behind. Perhaps more than any \nother community in America, the Tribes and Alaska Native Villages \nsuffer from inadequate infrastructure.\n  This year I am pleased to be working with President Clinton, Senators \nDaschle, Domenici, and others on a number of new programs and \ninitiatives to help the Native American Communities enjoy the same \nlevel of economic prosperity as the rest of America. In this respect, \nthe Tribes are no different than the rest of America--to promote their \neconomic development basic infrastructure must first be in place. The \nPresident's initiative recognizes this fact. The bill we are \nintroducing today addresses one element of that initiative--the need \nfor basic transportation, including roads and transit. This bill will \nhelp promote transportation on every reservation in America by fully \nfunding the Indian Reservation Roads Program.\n  First established in 1928, the Indian Reservation Roads program is \none of the ways America meets its special responsibility to help Native \nAmericans achieve self sufficiency and self determination. The goal of \nthe Indian Reservation Roads program is to provide safe and economic \nmeans of transportation throughout Indian Country. Over the years, the \nprogram has been reauthorized and modified to help meet the Tribes' \nneeds for basic transportation infrastructure. Most recently, the \nprogram was reauthorized for six years in 1998. The program is playing \na critical role in economic development, self-determination, and \nemployment of Native Americans in 33 states, including the Alaska \nNative Villages.\n  Currently, the reservation roads system comprises 25,700 miles of \nBIA- and Tribal-owned roads and 25,600 miles of state, county and local \nroads. There\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\nare also 740 bridges on the system and even one ferry boat in the state \nof Washington. These public roads and transit system are, of course, \nused by everyone, not just Native Americans. To give the Senate some \nperspective of the magnitude of this system, the 51,000 total miles on \nthe Indian Reservation Road system are more miles of public roads than \nthere are in 15 states. If you consider only roads on the Federal Aid \nHighway system, the Indian road system has more miles than the state of \nCalifornia.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, many of the roads on the IRR system are \namong the worst in the nation. Of the 25,700 miles owned by BIA and \nTribes, two thirds or 18,000 miles are not paved and 12,000 are \nunimproved dirt roads. Currently, 190 of the 740 bridges are listed as \ndeficient, presenting serious safety concerns. The estimated backlog in \nroad and bridge construction alone is $4 billion, and that doesn't even \nstart to include transit needs. When roads are as bad as these, people \ncan't get to work, children in school buses can't get to school, and \nseniors can't get to their doctors or hospitals.\n  Mr. President, in 1998, under the able guidance of the late Senator \nChafee and Senator Baucus, Congress produced the Transportation Equity \nAct for the Twenty-First Century, or TEA-21. Through its many \ntransportation programs, TEA-21 has already had major impacts on \ntransportation, both highways and transit, in my state and around the \ncountry. The bill increased funding for state highway programs by an \naverage of fifty percent above the levels in the previous six-year \nbill, ISTEA. Some states, because of population growth, are seeing \nincreases of seventy, eighty and even ninety percent over the levels in \nISTEA.\n  Unfortunately, funding for the Indian Reservation Roads Program did \nnot receive the same magnitude of increase as TEA-21 provided for the \nstates.\n  The full impact of TEA-21 on the Indian Road program has only \nrecently become clear. In the last year of ISTEA, the program was \nfunded at nearly $220 million. Now, under TEA-21, the authorization \nlevel was increased to $275 million, but for the first time, the \nprogram was subject to an obligation limitation, which reduces the \nfunding this year by $35 million.\n  Thus, despite the massive infusion of transportation funding to the \nstates, funding for Indian Country was inexplicably left behind. While \nthe states averaged a fifty percent increase in annual highway funding, \nthe tribes got less than half that--only about a twenty percent \nincrease. Mr. President, though TEA-21 strived for equity in funding, \nwe fell short of equity when it came to Native Americans.\n  Our bill is very simple. It provides a very narrow exemption to the \nobligation limitation in TEA-21 to assure that the full authorized \namount, $275 million, is available to help meet critical transportation \nneeds in Indian Country. The exemption would only apply to the \nremaining three years of TEA-21. A number of other programs in TEA-21 \nalready have this exemption, and I believe that Congress should make \ngood on its commitment to the tribes to provide the Indian Road Program \nthe full amount authorized. This increase in funding would bring the \nprogram roughly up to parity with the increase that the state highway \nprograms are already receiving in TEA-21.\n  Mr. President, I fully appreciate that a few Senators may have \nconcerns about changing any aspect of the funding distribution in TEA-\n21. However, I believe a strong argument can be made in this unique \ncase. First, nobody can dispute the incredible needs for transportation \ninfrastructure in Indian Country, which suffers, as I said, a backlog \nof at least $4 billion. Second, the effect of our bill on all other \nhighway programs in TEA-21, including state highway funding, is truly \nminimal; its impact amounts to only about one-tenth of one percent. \nThird, this is an issue of basic fairness. This change would provide \nboth the states and the IRR roughly the same 50 percent increase in \ntheir transportation funding above the levels in ISTEA. And finally, I \nbelieve we made a commitment to the tribes when we authorized funding \nof $275 million. Congress should make good on that commitment.\n  In closing, I look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Smith, and the \nRanking Member, Senator Baucus, as well as with the Chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Senator Voinovich, to \ncorrect this serious inequity in what is otherwise an outstanding \ntransportation bill.\n\n  Mr. President, state highway departments recognize how important this \nprogram is to both the tribes and the states. I recently received a \nletter from Mr. Pete K. Rahn, Secretary of the New Mexico State Highway \nand Transportation Department. In his letter, Secretary Rahn indicates \nhis support for this bill. He goes on to say that the department \nrecognizes that the bill will result in a slight reduction in the \nfederal funds, which flow directly to the state of New Mexico. However, \nhe continues, the department also recognizes that the benefit realized \nby the state as a whole, by the substantial increase in funds to the \nstate's tribes for road improvements, far outweigh this reduction. I \nwant to thank Secretary Rahn for expressing his support for this bill.\n  I have a similar letter addressed to Senator Baucus from Connie Niva, \nChair of the State of Washington Transportation Commission, along with \na resolution in support of lifting the obligation limitation from the \nIndian Reservation Road Program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nRahn, the letter and a resolution from the Washington Transportation \nCommission, letters from Mr. Kelsey A. Begaye, President of the Navajo \nNation, and Mr. David McKinney, Executive Director of the Intertribal \nTransportation Association, and a resolution from the Affiliated Tribes \nof Northwest Indians be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          New Mexico State Highway\n\n\n                                and Transportation Department,\n\n                                  Santa Fe, NM, February 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The purpose of this letter is to \n     indicate my support for the bill that you and Senators \n     Domenici and Baucus have introduced to exempt the Indian \n     Reservation Road Fund from the obligation limitation by \n     amending section 1102(b) of TEA-21 to include the IRR in the \n     list of exceptions.\n       We recognize that this will result in a slight reduction in \n     the federal funds, which will flow directly to the state of \n     New Mexico. However, we also recognize that the benefit \n     realized by the state as a whole, by the substantial increase \n     in funds to the state's tribes for road improvements, far \n     outweighs this reduction.\n       If you have any questions, or would like clarification on \n     these matters please contact Richard Montoya of my staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Pete K. Rahn,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              State of Washington,\n\n\n                                    Transportation Commission,\n\n                                   Olympia, WA, February 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Environment and Public Works \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: The Washington State Transportation \n     Commission has adopted enclosed Resolution No. 600 supporting \n     Resolution #99-23 of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest \n     Indians (ATNI). The Commission joins with ATNI in \n     recommending that the United States Congress remove the \n     obligation ceiling limitation requirement of TEA-21 from the \n     Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) Program.\n       This is an issue of vital concern to all tribes of \n     Washington State, and it is an issue of fundamental fairness. \n     When Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the \n     21st Century (TEA-21) on June 9, 1998, it changes the way in \n     which obligation limits were set for the IRR Program. Instead \n     of having limits set at 100% of authorized levels as they \n     were under previous highway acts, limitation for the IRR \n     Program is now calculated similar to states. For tribes, the \n     change has removed $90 million from their total authorization \n     in the past three years, and an additional $120 million is \n     expected to be lost during the remainder of the authorization \n     period. While the total authorization for the state of \n     Washington is similarly reduced, states have the opportunity \n     to carry over unused authorizations to subsequent years. On \n     the other hand, the authorized amounts deducted from the IRR \n     Program are redistributed to states rather than back to the \n     program. For the state of Washington, there is a net outflow \n     of funding. More is lost from the IRR Program than the state \n     receives back in redistributed authorization.\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n       Thank you for considering this request of such great impact \n     to the tribes of our state.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stable Oil Supply (SOS) Home \n     Heating Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 35 percent of families in the northeastern \n     United States depend on oil to heat their homes each winter, \n     and most of those families have no practical alternative to \n     paying the going price for heating oil or seeking public or \n     private assistance to pay for heating oil;\n       (2) consumers experienced sudden and dramatic increases in \n     prices for home heating oil during the winters of 1989, 1996, \n     and 1999, causing hardship to families and other people of \n     the United States, including people on fixed and low incomes, \n     people living in rural areas, the elderly, farmers, truckers \n     and the driving public, and governments that pay home heating \n     oil bills;\n       (3) a substantial part of each sudden increase in home \n     heating oil prices has been caused by vastly inadequate \n     supplies of home heating oil accumulated during the summer, \n     fall, and winter months by importers, refiners, and \n     wholesalers; and\n       (4) increased stability in home heating oil prices is \n     necessary to maintain the economic vitality of the Northeast.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that \n     minimally adequate stocks of home heating oil are accumulated \n     in the Northeast to meet reasonably foreseeable demand during \n     each winter while protecting consumers from sudden increases \n     in the price of home heating oil.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the safety of migrant seasonal \nagricultural workers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n               the farm worker transportation safety act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise to introduce legislation to \ngive farm workers what so many of us take for granted--a safe commute \nto work.\n  Today, many farm workers are still being transported to fields in \ncrowded vans lacking basic safety equipment. There are reports of vans \noriginally designed for 10 people, transporting up to 20 passengers \nwith no access to seat belts. People should not have to put their lives \nat risk to travel to a job site.\n  According to the latest United States Department of Labor statistics, \nfarm occupations have the second highest work-related fatalities, and \n45 percent of these fatalities are vehicular related.\n  Nationally, 533 farm workers were killed in transportation incidents \nbetween 1994 and 1998. And farm workers are 4 times more likely to be \nkilled in on-the-job highway traffic accidents than a typical worker.\n  The following are just a few of the recent accidents involving farm \nworkers traveling in vehicles without seatbelts.\n  Just two weeks ago, on February 10, 14 people were injured when a car \nran a stop sign and crashed into a van carrying farm workers in Tulare \nCounty, California. Authorities cited the driver of the van three \nmonths ago for illegally transporting workers--but at the time of the \naccident, he still had not received certification to transport workers.\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n  On September 10, 1999, 13 people were injured south of Fresno when an \nunlicensed van driver failed to stop for a posted stop sign and \ncollided with another car. The van had seven seats--all with \nseatbelts--but four passengers were seated on the floor.\n  On August 9, 1999, thirteen tomato field workers were killed when the \nvan transporting them home slammed into a tractor-trailer truck in \nrural southwest Fresno County, California. Most of the victims in this \nhorrific crash rode on three bare benches in the back of the van.\n  On July 23, 1999, one man was killed and more than 40 people injured \nwhen a big-rig crashed into a Greyhound bus and a farm worker van on \nHighway 99 in Tulare County, California. The victim rode in the farm-\nlabor van, packed with 19 other passengers.\n  This is a national problem which calls for Federal action. Farm \nworkers live all over the country, and have work that frequently \ncarries them across state lines.\n  Unfortunately, existing Federal laws leave farm workers inadequately \nprotected.\n  Regulations issued under the Migrant and Season Agricultural Worker \nProtection Act (MSPA) prohibit transport of migrant workers unless the \nvehicles have adequate service brakes, parking brakes, steering \nmechanisms, windshield wipers, tires, and review mirrors. But, believe \nit or not, the law does not mandate seating positions or an operational \nseatbelt for each passenger.\n  The Farm Worker Safety Transportation Act of 2000 will make it \nillegal to transport farm workers unless each passenger has a \ndesignated seat with an operational seatbelt. This applies no matter \nhow the vans are purchased or modified.\n  Federal law now requires vans manufactured with up to 10 passenger \nseats to have operational seatbelts for each seat. However, after a new \nvan is sold to its first owner, the owner can legally remove the rear \nseats and install bare benches. Similarly, Federal law permits an \nindividual to purchase a van with an empty cargo hold and install \nbenches without seatbelts.\n  The legislation will direct the Department of Transportation to \ndevelop interim seat and seatbelt standards for vans or trucks without \nseats that are converted for the transport of farm workers.\n  After a seven-year transition period, the commercial vehicles that \ntransport farm workers will have to meet the same seat and seatbelt \nstandards as a new vehicles.\n  A farm worker should have access to a safe commute whether he or she \nis traveling to a field in Arizona, California, Washington, or Florida.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this sensible, \npractical legislation that will save lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 2096. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan income tax credit to long-term caregivers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n the caregivers assistance and resources enhancement (care) tax credit \n                                  act\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, America is aging--we are all living longer \nand generally healthier and more productive lives. In the next 30 \nyears, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will double. For most \nAmericans this is good news. However, for some families aging comes \nwith unique financial obstacles. More and more middle income families \nare forced to choose between providing educational expenses for their \nchildren, saving for their own retirement, and providing medical care \nfor their parents and grandparents. When a loved one becomes ill and \nneeds to be cared for nothing is more challenging then deciding how the \ncare they need should be provided. Today, I rise to make that decision \neasier and to strengthen one option for long-term care--caring for a \nloved one at home.\n  The bill I introduce today, the Care Assistance and Resource \nEnhancement Tax Credit, provides caregivers with a $3,000 tax credit \nfor the services they provide. I am introducing this bill in order to \nencourage families to take care of their loved ones, make it more \naffordable for seniors to stay at home and receive the care they need, \nand save the government billions of dollars currently spent on \ninstitutional care. Through this tax credit we accomplish all that \nwhile emphasizing family values.\n  There are over 22 million people providing unpaid help with personal \nneeds or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 \nyears old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 caregivers. They do this \nwork without any compensation. They do not send the government a bill \nfor their services or get reimbursed for their expenses by a private \ncompany. They do it because they care. As a result of their compassion, \nthe government saves billions of dollars. For example, the average cost \nof a nursing home is $46,000 a year. The government spent approximately \n$32 billion in formal home health care costs and $83 billion in nursing \nhome costs. If you add up all the private sector and government \nspending on long-term care it is dwarfed by the amount families spend \ncaring for loved ones in their homes. As a study published by the \nAlzheimers Association indicated, caregivers provide $196 billion worth \nof care a year.\n  I held a field hearing in my state, Indiana, last August to discuss \nways to make long-term care more affordable. At this hearing I heard \nfrom three caregivers who are providing care for a family member. Mrs. \nLinda McKinstry takes care of her husband who had been diagnosed with \nAlzheimers two years ago. Mr. and Mrs. Cahee are caregivers for Mr. \nCahee's mother who also has Alzheimers. They all echoed the need for \nfinancial relief and support services. They spoke of the financial and \nemotional stress associated with taking care of a loved one. After \nhearing their stories, it became clear that their efforts are truly \nheroic and we should be doing all that we can at the federal level to \nprovide the support they need to keep their families together.\n  At a time when people are becoming skeptical of the government, \nCongress needs to help people meet the challenges they face in their \ndaily lives. This tax credit does that. It will serve 1.2 million older \nAmericans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults, and approximately 250,000 \nchildren a year. I encourage you to take notice of the work done by \ncaregivers and join me in supporting this legislation and giving \ncaregivers the gratitude they deserve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2098. A bill to facilitate the transition to more competitive and \nefficient electric power markets, and to ensure electric reliability; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   electric deregulation legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an electric \nderegulation bill, which it is my sincere hope will reduce the burdens \non our electric ratepayers and consumers throughout this country by \npromoting competition and reliability in the electric power industry.\n  First, let me say competition isn't the goal of the legislation. \nInstead, competition is the means to achieve the goal of assuring \ncustomers reliable and reasonably-priced electricity.\n  We have seen the benefits of competition in other industries such as \nnatural gas, telecommunications, trucking, and even in the airlines. In \neach case, competition reduced prices. That was the objective--to \nenhance supply and to encourage innovation.\n  There is every reason to expect that competition in the electric \nindustry will benefit consumers. The Department of Energy agrees. It is \nprojecting consumer savings in the area of $20 billion per year. That \nis not hay. That would be a significant savings to the consumers in \nthis country, particularly important at a time when we are seeing \nspiking rates in oil, high gasoline prices, high heating oil prices, \nand high diesel fuel prices, as noted by the trucking industry that \nrecently demonstrated here in Washington, DC. Heating oil prices are \nspiraling in the Northeast corridor.\n  We are talking about, through electric deregulation, trying to bring \nabout consumer savings of $20 billion per year or more. Progress has \nalready been made in this area, both in retail competition and \nwholesale competition because there has been innovation. Twenty-four \nStates have already adopted retail competition. That covers nearly 60 \npercent of our consumers. All other States are now giving it \nconsideration. As a consequence of the innovation of\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nthe States, we are now seeing retail competition becoming a reality.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has created wholesale \ncompetition in the interstate market through Order 888.\n  The legislative task we face--I, as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, and my colleagues on that committee, both \nthe minority and the majority--will be significant. We look forward to \nthe task ahead. It will call for the examination of this bill, as a \ncomprehensive bill, to try to address the various concerns, as well as \ntake up the other bills.\n  However, I recognize there will be certain areas on which we will not \nbe able to reach agreement. We can set them aside and proceed on what \nwe can agree on, then go back one more time and look at those items we \nare still hung up on to see if we can generate any consensus. At that \npoint, we can see what we have. Hopefully, it will be still meaningful.\n  As I said, the legislative task before the Senate is building on the \nprogress that has been made with the States, not halting State progress \non retail competition, and not interfering with the FERC process on \nwholesale competition.\n  The question is: How do we get there from here? How do we move the \nelectric power industry from regulation to competition? Some argue we \nshould preempt the States; I don't think so. Some say that we should \nsubstitute FERC regulation for State regulation; I don't think so. \nOthers have the theory that one size fits all; I don't think so.\n  I think the States and the innovative attitudes coming out of the \nStates indicate that one size does not fit all. We do not want to \nsimply substitute one regulation for another. That is not deregulation. \nIf that is done, it is just ``different'' regulation. Moreover, what \nmay work in one State undoubtedly won't work in another State and the \nconsumers would be harmed.\n  To me, the answer is obvious. For consumers to enjoy the benefits of \ncompetition, we have to let the free market system work. We have seen \nthat time and time again. We must stop having regulators pick the \nwinners and losers, regulators making decisions that should be made in \nthe marketplace.\n  I have long said the best way to move toward market competition is to \nderegulate in those areas we can, streamline what we cannot deregulate, \nand facilitate States moving forward on retail competition.\n  I would prefer deregulating the entire electric power industry. \nHowever, I recognize some regulation must remain because it is \nnecessary to protect consumers. Traditionally, States have regulated \nretail matters directly affecting consumers and FERC has regulated \nmatters in interstate commerce. The legislation I introduce today \nretains this traditional division of authority between the States and \nFERC.\n  I believe that where regulation is necessary, it should be pursued by \nthe unit of government that is closest to the consumer. The government \nthat is closest to the citizen, is the government that will be the most \nresponsive to citizens. Citizens go down to city hall; citizens will go \ndown to the legislative body. That is where citizens are closest to \ntheir government, and those are the people to whom taxpayers can reach \nout and hold responsible--or wring their neck if necessary.\n  I believe that FERC should only regulate that which cannot be \nregulated by States because it is in interstate commerce. I repeat \nthat: In my opinion, as represented in this bill, FERC should regulate \nonly that which cannot be regulated by States because it is in \ninterstate commerce.\n  I will highlight the important provisions of the legislation I have \nintroduced today. One key element is the creation of a clear division \nof responsibility between the States and the Federal Government. States \nare responsible for retail matters affecting consumers in their State, \nincluding retail competition, and FERC is responsible for interstate \nmatters, including wholesale competition. By creating this \njurisdictional ``bright line,'' so to speak, I think we will clear up \nthe current confusion in the jurisdiction that has resulted in \nlitigation which is slowing down progress on competition. In the \nfuture, if there is a problem, we will know whom to hold responsible.\n\n  Oftentimes in this business, accountability is pretty hard to find. \nWe have designed this so we will be able to hold those responsible for \ntheir actions, and they will not be able to hide under a rock.\n  This legislation also includes provisions that will protect electric \nreliability which is so important to consumers in our economy.\n  I am pleased to say Senator Landrieu is joining me in this bipartisan \nlegislation. The Senator from Louisiana has been very diligent in our \nEnergy Committee.\n  The legislation protects electric reliability in two ways: First, it \ncreates a comprehensive, reliability organization that has clear \nenforcement authority. This will help in the short term. Second, by \npromoting competition, it ensures reliability over the long run, \nbecause the market will respond to consumer needs.\n  The legislation also includes provisions to ensure that States and \nState public utility commissions will continue to be fully able to \nprotect consumers.\n  The legislation has provisions which will provide access to all \ninterstate transmission lines, not just those covered by investor-owned \nutilities. Removing gaps in transmission access will promote \ncompetition in the wholesale power market.\n  The legislation also addresses a number of other important issues \nincluding PURPA repeal, PUHCA repeal, assuring funding for nuclear \npower plant decommissioning, and authority to construct new \ntransmission lines.\n  There are other important issues that need to be addressed during the \nlegislative process. For example, we need to look at ways to streamline \nand speed up the merger review process. Utilities are rightfully \ndistressed that FERC's process is far too cumbersome, takes far too \nlong to complete, and as a consequence is far too expensive. And these \ncosts are just passed on to consumers. FERC is retained to do their \nanalysis and make their decisions in a timely manner. These drawn out \ndecisions, for all practical purposes, are simply allowing full \nemployment for far too many lawyers.\n  We also need to consider the creation of a universal service fund, \nsimilar to that which Congress included in the telecommunications \nlegislation. This would help areas of the United States which do not \nyet have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Yes, there are \nregions in the United States where electricity is not taken for \ngranted. My State of Alaska is one.\n  There is a related tax issue which must also be addressed in the \ncontext of comprehensive legislation. That is the tax-exempt municipal \nbond issue, creating a level competitive playing field between \ninvestor-owned utilities and municipally-owned utilities.\n  Because this is important to both municipally-owned and investor-\nowned utilities, I will talk about the problem for a moment. First, \nunder the U.S. Tax Code, municipally-owned utilities can issue tax-\nexempt bonds to build new generation, transmission, and distribution \nfacilities, but investor-owned utilities cannot issue tax-exempt bonds \nfor these purposes. This gives municipally-owned utilities a taxpayer-\nprovided competitive advantage to the extent they are able to use the \nfacilities built with tax-exempt bonds to compete against private power \nwhich cannot use tax-exempt bonds.\n  On the flip side, under the Tax Code, municipal tax-exempt bonds are \nsubject to a private-use limitation. This means that if municipal \nutilities go too far in competing against private utilities, if they \nexceed their ``private use'' limitation allowed by the IRS, their bonds \nare subject to retroactive taxation. This limits the ability of \nmunicipal utilities to compete in the market. I assume we will hear \nfrom them on that. There has to be some equity in this process.\n  The bottom line? We have a Tax Code that is not consistent with \ntoday's competitive environment. Both municipal utilities and private \nutilities are at risk. The issue must be addressed. It is not \nnecessarily part of the legislation I am introducing today because the \nTax Code issue is before the Finance Committee. I admit I am a member \nof that committee. Both the administration and Senator Gorton have \nlegislative proposals pending before the Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\n  But I call, finally, upon industry--private power and public power--\nto come and try to work out their differences on this and to bring \nCongress a compromise proposal that both sides can live with because it \nis something that simply has to be addressed. It is better to have the \nparties resolve it than have a dictate from the Congress.\n  There are other issues of regional consideration that will need to be \naddressed as part of comprehensive legislation. We need to resolve the \nrole of the Federal power marketing administrations in the marketplace, \nincluding the Bonneville Power Administration. We also need to address \nthe role of one of the largest utilities in the United States, the TVA.\n  I look forward to working with Senators from the Northwest--I see one \non the floor--to address the Bonneville Power Administration issue, and \nthe Senators from the South to address the Tennessee Valley Authority \nissue. I am convinced by promoting competition and protecting \nreliability this legislation will benefit the consumers, the economy, \nand our international competitors.\n  I, again, thank Senator Landrieu of Louisiana for cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  To reiterate, I rise to introduce legislation to promote competition \nin the electric power industry. This legislation is bipartisan, it is \ncosponsored by Senator Landrieu.\n  Let me first say that competition is not the goal of this \nlegislation. Instead, competition is the means to achieve the goal of \nassuring consumers reliable and reasonably-priced electricity.\n  We have seen great benefits from bringing competition to other \nindustries such as natural gas, telecommunications, trucking and \nairlines. In each case, competition reduced prices, enhanced supply and \nencouraged innovation. There is every reason to expect that increased \ncompetition in the electric power industry will likewise benefit \nconsumers. The Department of Energy agrees. It has projected consumer \nsavings of $20 billion per year.\n  Great progress has already been made in both retail competition and \nwholesale competition. To date, retail competition programs have been \nadopted by 24 States, which cover 60 percent of U.S. consumers. All of \nthe remaining States are now considering what kind of retail program \nwould best meet their local needs. Competition has been brought to the \ninterstate wholesale market through the enactment of the Energy Policy \nAct of 1992 and FERC's subsequent issuance of Orders No. 888 and 889.\n  So the legislative task facing Congress is to build on this progress, \nnot to halt State progress on retail competition or to interfere with \nFERC progress on wholesale competition.\n  The question is: How do we get there from here? How do we move the \nelectric power industry from regulation to competition? Should we \npreempt the States and substitute Federal regulation for State \nregulation, as some argue? Or should we instead deregulate to allow the \nmarket to operate?\n  To me the answer is obvious: Competition must be market-based, not \ngovernment-run. We must stop having regulators pick winners and losers, \nmaking decisions that ought to be made by the marketplace. Substituting \none regulator for another--Federal for State--is not deregulation. It's \njust different regulation. Creating a one-size-fits-all Federal \nsolution may work in some States, but it will not work in all States. \nFor the market to work and for consumers to enjoy the benefits of \ncompetition, we need to free the market from undue government \ninterference.\n  I have long said that the best way to move toward market competition \nis to deregulate what we can, streamline what we cannot deregulate, and \nto facilitate States moving forward on retail competition.\n  While I would like to deregulate the entire electric power industry, \nI recognize that some regulation will remain necessary to protect \nconsumers. Where regulation is necessary, I believe that it should be \nperformed by the unit of government closest to the consumer. However, \nwhere the matter to be regulated is in interstate commerce, FERC must \nbe the regulatory agency. Traditionally, States have regulated retail \nmatters directly affecting consumers, and the FERC has regulated \nwholesale sales and transmission in interstate commerce. The \nlegislation I am today introducing retains this traditional division of \nauthority between the States and the FERC.\n  I will now outline the key provisions of the legislation.\n  One key element of this legislation is the creation of a clear \ndivision of authority between the States and the Federal government. \nThe legislation makes it clear that States are responsible for retail \nmatters affecting consumers in their State, and the FERC is responsible \nfor interstate matters. Thus, States will continue to be responsible \nfor retail competition, and the FERC will continue to be responsible \nfor wholesale competition.\n\n  This clarification is necessary because when the Federal Power Act \nwas created in 1935, Congress did not foresee the current market and \nindustry structure. As a result, there are now ambiguities as to the \nsplit in jurisdiction between the States and the Federal government. \nThis has resulted in uncertainty and increasing litigation. Creating a \njurisdictional ``bright line'' will help both States and the FERC move \nforward with their efforts to promote competition in their respective \njurisdictions. Moreover, by creating clear lines of accountability, if \nthings don't work right we will know exactly where to point the finger.\n  Another major aspect of this legislation is that it will protect the \nreliability of our electric power system. The legislation does so in \ntwo different ways. First it creates a grid-wide reliability \norganization that is given the enforcement authority necessary to \nassure reliability. The language in the legislation is the industry-\nsupported North American Electric Reliability Council proposal, plus \nadditional reliability provisions proposed by Western Governors, State \npublic utility commissions and State energy officials. However, as much \nas this new organization will help ensure reliability, it is not the \nlong-term solution. The real solution is to promote competition, and \nthat can only be accomplished though comprehensive legislation such as \nthis.\n  This legislation also includes provisions to provide access to all \ninterstate transmission lines, not just those owned by investor-owned \nutilities. Under the Federal Power Act, Federally-owned utilities, \nState-owned utilities, municipally-owned utilities and cooperatively-\nowned utilities are all exempt from FERC's nondiscriminatory open \naccess transmission program. These exempt utilities do not have to \nprovide access to the transmission grid which adversely affects \ncompetition in the interstate wholesale power market. This legislation \ncorrects that problem.\n  Another important aspect of this legislation is its confirmation that \nStates are not prevented from protecting consumers on a variety of \nretail matters such as: distribution system reliability; safety; \nobligation to serve; universal service; assured service to low-income, \nrural and remote consumers; retail seller performance standards; and \nprotection against unfair business practices.\n  There are similar provisions which confirm that States are not \nprevented from imposing a public interest charge to fund State programs \nsuch as: ensuring universal electric service, particularly for \nconsumers located in rural and remote areas; environmental programs, \nrenewable energy conservation programs; providing recovery of industry \ntransition costs; providing transition costs for electricity workers \nhurt by restructuring; and research and development on electric \ntechnologies.\n  By including these provisions, my legislation will ensure that States \nand State public utility commissions are fully capable of protecting \nconsumers and promoting the public interest.\n\n  The legislation also contains a number of other important provisions \nincluding repeal of PURPA's mandatory purchase requirement, repeal of \nPUHCA and assuring funding for nuclear power plant decommissioning.\n  One provision in this legislation that I expect to be controversial \nis eminent domain authority to construct new interstate transmission \nlines. The provisions of the bill make this construction authority \navailable in situations where there is a regional transmission planning \nprocess that provides for full\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\npublic input, and is reviewed and approved by the FERC; and the \ntransmission project cannot otherwise be constructed either because the \nState does not have the necessary authority, or because the State has \ndelayed action for more than one year; and the FERC, through a formal \npublic process with all legal rights protected, finds that the new \ntransmission line is in the public convenience and necessity.\n  When authorizing this construction, the legislation gives the FERC \nfull authority to impose any requirements that are necessary to protect \nthe public interest.\n  You might ask: Why include such a potentially controversial \nprovision? There are three reasons.\n  The first reason is supply. We must have transmission lines if we are \ngoing to get electricity to consumers and industry. It is a simple fact \nof physics that you can't move electricity without power lines.\n  The second reason is market power. As you know, market power exists \nwhere there is more demand than an existing transmission line can \nhandle--a bottleneck. There are two possible ways to address a \nbottleneck. The first is full regulation of the bottleneck transmission \nfacility, with regulators picking the winners and losers. But that does \nnot solve the problem, it just allocates the problem. The other is the \nfree market approach. Let those who want to move their electric power \nto market build a new transmission line around the bottleneck--or at \nleast have a credible threat to build if the owner of the bottleneck \ntransmission line does not offer them a fair deal.\n  The third reason is reliability. Based on events over that past \nseveral years, it is clear that we need to enhance our transmission \nsystem if we are going to meet consumer needs during peak periods of \ndemand.\n  For those who think eminent domain is a brand-new idea for energy \nfacilities--it isn't. The Federal Power Act already gives Federal \neminent domain for hydroelectric dams and their associated electric \ntransmission lines. Similarly, the Natural Gas Act gives Federal \neminent domain for interstate natural gas pipelines. If it works for \ninterstate natural gas pipelines, it will work for interstate electric \ntransmission lines.\n  Turning now to regional transmission organizations, the legislation I \nam today introducing retains the RTO provisions that were in my draft \nbill. While Order No. 2000 has many good aspects--its voluntary nature, \nflexibility, open architecture and transmission incentives--it does \nhave some serious deficiencies. I am especially concerned about two key \nissues.\n  First, Order No. 2000 prohibits any active ownership of the RTO by a \nutility or market participant after a five year transition period. \nOddly, this applies even to someone who only owns transmission. \nClearly, this will discourage participation in RTOs by transmission \nowners.\n  Second, by denying transmission owners the ability to design and file \ncomplete transmission rates with FERC, Order No. 2000 creates confusion \nat best, and at worst it may deny transmission owners their rights \nunder law to recover all of their prudently incurred costs.\n  If these and other deficiencies are not corrected, FERC Order No. \n2000 may be litigated for years, creating great uncertainty in RTO \nformation. In light of the increasing concerns about grid reliability, \ndelay in RTO formation would be particularly troublesome as Order No. \n2000 makes RTOs directly responsible for short-term reliability.\n  Let me mention some significant matters that need to be addressed \nduring the legislative process.\n  For example, there is the important issue of streamlining and \nspeeding up the FERC merger review process. Utilities are rightfully \ndistressed that FERC's process takes far too long and is much too \ncumbersome.\n  We also need to consider the creation of a universal service fund--\nsimilar to that which Congress included in the telecommunications \nlegislation. This would help areas which do not have access to reliable \nand affordable electricity. And yes, there are regions of the United \nStates where electricity is not taken for granted.\n  Another controversial issue that we must deal with in the context of \ncomprehensive legislation is the tax-exempt municipal bond issue, \ncreating a level competitive playing field between investor-owned \nutilities and municipally-owned utilities. Under the U.S. Code \nmunicipally-owned utilities can issue tax-exempt bonds to build new \ngeneration, transmission and distribution facilities, but investor-\nowned utilities cannot issue tax-exempt bonds for these purposes. This \ngives municipally-owned utilities a taxpayer-provided competitive \nadvantage to the extent they are able to use facilities built with tax-\nexempt bonds to compete against private power--who cannot use tax-\nexempt bonds in the same way. But on the flip-side--under the tax code \nmunicipal tax-exempt bonds are subject to a ``private use'' limitation. \nThis means that if municipal utilities go too far in competing against \nprivate utilities--if they exceed their ``private use'' limitation \nallowed by the IRS regulation--then their bonds are subject to \nretroactive taxation. This limits the ability of municipal utilities to \ncompete in the market. The bottom line? We have a tax code that is not \nconsistent with today's competitive environment, putting both municipal \nutilities and private utilities at risk.\n  Although this issue must be addressed, it is not a part of the \nlegislation I am introducing because it is a tax code issue that is now \nbefore the finance committee. Both the Administration and Senator \nGorton have legislative proposals pending before the finance committee. \nI call upon the industry--private power and public power--to work out \ntheir differences and to bring Congress a compromise proposal--that \nboth sides can live with.\n  There are also a number of other regional issues that will need to be \naddressed as a part of comprehensive legislation. For example, we need \nto resolve the role of the Federal power marketing administrations in \nhe marketplace--including the Bonneville Power Administration. We also \nneed to address the role of one of the largest utilities in the United \nStates--the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  I am convinced that by promoting competition in the electric power \nindustry and by addressing the reliability issue, this legislation will \nbenefit consumers, our economy and our international competitiveness. \nLike the Secretary of Energy, I believe that it is now time to move \nforward with legislation. I hope that my colleagues agree.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 2099. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nthe registration of handguns, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n              handgun safety and registration act of 2000\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Handgun \nSafety and Registration Act of 2000, which would enable law enforcement \nagencies nationwide to more easily trace handguns used in crime, and \nprovide background checks and registration by law enforcement of all \nprimary and secondary transfers of handguns, including retail sales, \nInternet sales, gun shows, and all other private transfers. This \nlegislation is supported by Handgun Control, Inc., the Violence Policy \nCenter, the NAACP, and Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n  Many Americans are unaware that there is a successful federal weapons \nregistration system already in place under the 1934 National Firearms \nAct (NFA). The NFA requires registration of all machine guns, short-\nbarrel shotguns and short-barrel rifles, silencers, bombs, grenades, \nand other specialized weapons. The NFA is successfully and efficiently \nadministered by the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms (ATF).\n  The Handgun Safety and Registration Act would require the \nregistration of all handguns under the NFA within one year of \nenactment. I know some of my colleagues may question why this bill is \nneeded. First, the bill would help law enforcement more effectively \ntrace handguns used in crime by making registration data available on-\nline to state and local law enforcement agencies. Tracing methods used \ntoday are extremely cumbersome and favor the criminal over the police. \nWhen a gun used to commit a crime is recovered, a state or local law \nenforcement agency contacts ATF with the name of the manufacturer and \nthe serial number of the handgun--if it has not been removed by the \ncriminal. ATF in turn\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\ncontacts the manufacturer, which provides the name of the wholesale or \nretail dealer to whom the handgun was sold. ATF then contacts the \ndealer to obtain the name of the individual or another retail dealer \nwho purchased the handgun.\n  All too often, this is where the trail goes cold, and another gun \ncrime may go unsolved. If the individual handgun owner has sold the gun \nto another person in a private sale, there is no way for law \nenforcement to follow the path of the handgun without time-consuming \ndetective work and a good deal of luck. Subsequent private transfers or \ngun show sales are similarly unrecorded, making law enforcement's job \neven more difficult. Even before the first retail sale, law enforcement \nis completely dependent upon the record keeping of gun manufacturers \nand gun dealers to follow the trail of a handgun from manufacture to \ncriminal use. There is no law enforcement database of handgun \nproduction or sales in the United States. The Handgun Safety and \nRegistration Act would give the advantage back to the police by making \nhandgun registration data available to law enforcement in an easily \naccessible format.\n  Mr. President, in addition to improving law enforcement's tracing \ncapabilities, the Handgun Safety and Registration Act would help \nprevent handguns from ending up in the possession of people who are \nlikely to commit gun crimes. The bill would require registration of all \nhandguns, including those currently in private possession, and would \nmake it a felony for any person to transfer a handgun to another \nindividual without prior law enforcement approval. As it currently does \nfor all NFA weapons, ATF would conduct a background check on the \ntransferee through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the \nTreasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS), and the National Law \nEnforcement Tracking System (NLETS). This would provide a clear \nincentive for all handgun owners and dealers to exercise great caution \nwhen they choose to sell or otherwise transfer a handgun to another \nperson.\n  It is my hope that by requiring registration of all handguns under \nthe National Firearms Act, we can give law enforcement officials the \ntools to conduct faster and more reliable tracing of handguns used in \ncrime, and prevent handguns from falling into criminal hands in the \nfirst place. The Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 would \naccomplish these goals without restricting in any way the possession or \nsale of hunting rifles or shotguns used by law-abiding sportsmen across \nthe country.\n  I encourage my Senate colleagues to support this important \nlegislation as we seek effective ways to help law enforcement reduce \ngun violence in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2100. A bill to provide for fire sprinkler systems in public and \nprivate college and university housing and dormitories, including \nfraternity and sorority housing and dormitories; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                      College Fire Prevention Act\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today with my colleagues Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Torricelli, I introduce the College Fire \nPrevention Act. This measure would provide federal matching grants for \nthe installation of fire sprinkler systems in college and university \ndormitories and fraternity and sorority houses.\n  Mr. President, the tragic fire that occurred at Seton Hall University \non Wednesday, January 19th of this year will not be long forgotten. \nSadly, three freshman, all 18 years old, died. Fifty-four students, two \nSouth Orange firefighters and two South Orange police officers were \ninjured. The dormitory, Boland Hall, was a six-story, 350 room \nstructure built in 1952 that housed approximately 600 students. \nAstonishingly, the fire was contained to the third floor lounge of \nBoland Hall. This dormitory was equipped with smoke alarms but no \nsprinkler system.\n  Unfortunately, the Boland Hall fire was not the first of its kind. \nAnd it reminded many people in North Carolina of their own tragic \nexperience with dorm fires. In 1996, on Mother's Day and Graduation \nDay, a fire in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill killed five college juniors and \ninjured three others. This fraternity house was 70 years old. The \nNational Fire Protection Association identified several factors that \ncontributed to the tragic fire, including the lack of fire sprinkler \nprotection.\n  Sadly, there have been countless other dorm fires. On December 9, \n1997, a student died in a dormitory fire at Greenville College in \nGreenville, Illinois. The dormitory, Kinney Hall, was built in the \n1960s and had no fire sprinkler system. On January 10, 1997, a student \ndied at the University of Tennessee at Martin. The dormitory, Ellington \nHall, had no fire sprinkler system. On January 3, 1997, a student died \nin a dormitory fire at Central Missouri State University in \nWarrensburg, Missouri. On October 21, 1994, five students died in a \nfraternity house fire in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. The list goes on and \non. In a typical year between 1980 and 1997, the National Fire \nProtection Association estimates there were an average of 1,800 fires \nat dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, involving 1 death, 69 \ninjuries, and 8.1 million dollars in property damage.\n  So now we must ask, what can be done? What can we do to curtail these \ntragic fires from taking the lives of our children . . . our young \nadults? We should focus our attention on the lack of fire sprinklers in \ncollege dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. Sprinklers save \nlives. Indeed, the National Fire Protection Association has never \nrecorded a fire that killed more than 2 people in a public assembly, \neducational, institutional, or residential building where a sprinkler \nsystem was operating properly.\n  Despite the clear benefits of sprinklers, many college dorms do not \nhave them. New dormitories are generally required to have advanced \nsafety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements are \nrarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings. In 1997, over 90 \npercent of the campus building fires reported to fire departments \noccurred in buildings where there were smoke alarms present. However, \nonly 28 percent of them had fire sprinklers present.\n  At my state's flagship university at Chapel Hill, for example, only \nsix of the 29 residence halls have sprinklers. A report published by \nThe Raleigh News & Observer in the wake of the Seton Hall fire also \nnoted that only seven of 19 dorms at North Carolina State University \nare equipped with the life-saving devices, and there are sprinklers in \ntwo of the 10 dorms at North Carolina Central University. At Duke \nUniversity, only five of 26 dorms have sprinklers.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today authorizes the \nSecretary of Education, in consultation with the United States Fire \nAdministration, to award grants, on a competitive basis, to States, \nprivate or public colleges or universities, fraternities, or sororities \nto assist them in providing fire sprinkler systems for their student \nhousing and dormitories. These entities would be required to produce \nmatching funds equal to one-half of the cost. This legislation \nauthorizes $100 million for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n  In North Carolina, we decided to initiate a drive to install \nsprinklers in our public college and university dorms. The overall cost \nis estimated at $57.5 million. Given how much it is going to cost North \nCarolina's public colleges and universities to install sprinklers, I \nthink it's clear that the $100 million that this measure authorizes is \njust a drop in the bucket. But my hope is that by providing this small \nincentive we can encourage more colleges to institute a comprehensive \nreview of their dorm's fire safety and to install sprinklers. All they \nneed is a helping hand. With this modest measure of prevention, we can \nhelp prevent the needless and tragic loss of young lives.\n  Mr. President, parents should not have to worry about their children \nliving in fire traps. When we send our children away to college, we are \nsending them to a home away from home where hundreds of other students \neat, sleep, burn candles, use electric appliances and smoke. We must \nnot compromise on their safety. As the Fire Chief from Chapel Hill \nwrote me: ``Parents routinely send their children off\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\nto college seeking an education unaware that one of the greatest \ndangers facing their children is the fire hazards associated with \ndormitories, fraternity and sorority houses and other forms of student \nhousing. . . . The only complete answer to making student-housing safe \nis to install fire sprinkler systems.'' In short, the best way to \nensure the protection of our college students is to install fire \nsprinklers in our college dormitories and fraternity and sorority \nhouses. My proposal has been endorsed by the National Fire Protection \nAssociation and the College Parents of America. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nlegislation, the letters of support and a partial list of fatal college \nfires be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``College Fire Prevention \n     Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire occurred at a \n     Seton Hall University dormitory. Three male freshmen, all 18 \n     years of age, died. Fifty-four students, 2 South Orange \n     firefighters, and 2 South Orange police officers were \n     injured. The dormitory was a 6-story, 350-room structure \n     built in 1952, that housed approximately 600 students. It was \n     equipped with smoke alarms but no fire sprinkler system.\n       (2) On Mother's Day 1996 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a \n     fire in the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity House killed 5 college \n     juniors and injured 3. The 3-story plus basement fraternity \n     house was 70 years old. The National Fire Protection \n     Association identified several factors that contributed to \n     the tragic fire, including the lack of fire sprinkler \n     protection.\n       (3) It is estimated that in a typical year between 1980 and \n     1997, there were an average of 1,800 fires at dormitories, \n     fraternities, and sororities, involving 1 death, 69 injuries, \n     and $8,100,000 in property damage.\n       (4) Within dormitories the number 1 cause of fires is arson \n     or suspected arson. The second leading cause of college \n     building fires is cooking, while the third leading cause is \n     smoking.\n       (5) The National Fire Protection Association has no record \n     of a fire killing more than 2 people in a completely fire \n     sprinklered public assembly, educational, institutional, or \n     residential building where the sprinkler system was operating \n     properly.\n       (6) New dormitories are generally required to have advanced \n     safety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements \n     are rarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings.\n       (7) In 1997, over 90 percent of the campus building fires \n     reported to fire departments occurred in buildings where \n     there were smoke alarms present. However, only 28 percent had \n     fire sprinklers present.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $100,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2001 through \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 4. GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Program Authority.--The Secretary of Education, in \n     consultation with the United States Fire Administration, is \n     authorized to award grants, on a competitive basis, to \n     States, private or public colleges or universities, \n     fraternities, or sororities to assist them in providing fire \n     sprinkler systems for their student housing and dormitories.\n       (b) Matching Funds Requirement.--The Secretary of Education \n     may not award a grant under this section unless the entity \n     receiving the grant provides, from State, local, or private \n     sources, matching funds in an amount equal to not less than \n     one-half of the cost of the activities for which assistance \n     is sought.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Award Basis.--In awarding grants under this Act the \n     Secretary of Education shall take into consideration various \n     fire safety factors and conditions that the Secretary \n     determines appropriate.\n       (b) Limitation on Administrative Expenses.--An entity that \n     receives a grant under this Act shall not use more than 4 \n     percent of the grant funds for administrative expenses.\n\n     SEC. 6. DATA AND REPORT.\n\n       The Comptroller General shall--\n       (1) gather data on the number of college and university \n     housing facilities and dormitories that have and do not have \n     fire sprinkler systems and other forms of built-in fire \n     protection mechanisms; and\n       (2) report such data to Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Town of Chapel Hill,\n\n\n                                              Fire Department,\n\n                               Chapel Hill, NC, February 15, 2000.\n     Sen. John Edwards,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards, One of the most unrecognized fire \n     safety problems in America today is university and college \n     student housing. Parents routinely send their children off to \n     college seeking an education unaware that one of the greatest \n     dangers facing their children is the fire hazards associated \n     with dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses and other \n     forms of student housing. We in Chapel Hill experienced a \n     worst-case scenario, when in 1996 a fire in a fraternity \n     house on Mother's Day/Graduation Day claimed five young lives \n     and injured three more. We recognized the only complete \n     answer to making student-housing safe is to install fire \n     sprinkler systems.\n       I have had the privilege of reading a draft copy of your \n     legislation creating a matching grants program for \n     universities, colleges and fraternity/sorority house who take \n     the lifesaving step of installing fire sprinkler systems. I \n     strongly urge you to introduce this legislation and I pledge \n     to assist your staff in promoting this important bill and \n     help to develop bi-partisan support for it. Your proposed \n     legislation is the only real solution to the fire threat in \n     student housing.\n       After ten years of being responsible for fire protection at \n     the University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill, I am convinced \n     that where students reside, alarms systems are not enough, \n     clear exit ways are not enough, quick fire department \n     response is not enough and educational programs are not \n     enough. The only way you can insure fire safety for college \n     student housing is to place a fire sprinkler system over \n     them. Thank you for recognizing the magnitude of this threat \n     and for proposing the solution to it.\n       Tell me how we can help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Daniel Jones,\n     Fire Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   College Parents of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2000.\n     Hon. John Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: College Parents of America (CPA) \n     would like to commend you on the introduction of grant \n     legislation to encourage public and private colleges, \n     universities, fraternities and sororities to install \n     sprinkler systems in all dormitories and other forms of group \n     housing.\n       Today college parents represent an estimated 12 million \n     households. An additional 24 million households are currently \n     saving and otherwise preparing children for college. College \n     Parents of America is the only national membership \n     association dedicated to helping these parents prepare for \n     and put their children through college easily, economically \n     and safely.\n       College Parents of America places a high priority on \n     ensuring safety in student housing. In fact, CPA is urging \n     parents and students during their college evaluation process \n     to make sure there are smoke alarms, sprinkler systems and \n     scheduled drills in all campus housing and classroom \n     buildings. While the financing and installation of smoke \n     alarms are relatively easy, funding is cited as a challenge \n     in the installation of sprinkler systems in many older \n     residential buildings on the nation's campuses. Your grant \n     legislation will provide a vehicle for institutions to ensure \n     all student residential facilities have adequate sprinkler \n     safety systems. As a result, the grant legislation will not \n     only save millions of dollars annually from property damage, \n     but also save young lives.\n       Please let me know how and when I can provide assistance. I \n     look forward to working together to pass this important piece \n     of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard M. Flaherty.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Fire Protection\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, February 23, 2000.\n     Sen. John Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: On behalf of the National Fire \n     Protection Association (NFPA) and its 68,000 members, we are \n     pleased to support your legislative efforts to provide \n     federal assistance for the installation of fire sprinkler \n     systems in college and university housing and dormitories.\n       Our statistics show that properly installed and maintained \n     fire sprinkler systems have a proven track record of \n     protecting lives and property in all types of occupancies. In \n     particular, the retrofitting of fire sprinkler systems in \n     college and university housing will greatly improve the \n     safety of these public and private institutions.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to be of assistance in this \n     important initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Anthony R.

This listing\n  should not be considered complete since only those incidents for which\n  information was collected by the National Fire Protection Association\n  were listed.\n \nRevised: 3/99\n\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my \ncolleague from North Carolina, Senator Edwards, in introducing the \nCollege Fire Prevention Act.\n  On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire raged through a dormitory at \nSeton Hall University, claiming the lives of three students and \ninjuring 58 others, including at least 54 students, two police officers \nand two firefighters. The dormitory, Boland Hall, was built in 1952, \nand although it was equipped with smoke detectors, it was not required \nto be equipped with a fire sprinkler system.\n  Nothing is as painful as a senseless accident that takes the lives of \nyoung people. And unfortunately, the Seton Hall community is not alone \nin its grief. In fact, in the last decade, 18 young people lost their \nlives in dormitory fires. We must do all we can to prevent future \ntragedies. Students have a fundamental right to pursue an education in \na safe, secure environment. Parents have a right to know that their \nchildren are protected from harm while on school property.\n  That is why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation to provide Federal matching grants for the installation of \nfire sprinkler systems in student housing. This bill authorizes the \nSecretary of Education, in consultation with the U.S. Fire \nAdministration, to award grants to equip dormitories, sorority, and \nfraternity houses with fire sprinkler systems.\n  I thank Senator Edwards for sponsoring this important legislation, \nand I look forward to working with him to ensure that student housing \nis as safe as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2102. A bill to provide to the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe a permanent \nland base within its aboriginal homeland, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                     timbisha shoshone homeland act\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join \nwith my distinguished colleagues from California, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer, in introducing legislation that would provide a \npermanent land base for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe.\n  For thousands of years the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe has lived in and \naround the area that is now Death Valley National Park. For many years, \nthe Tribe sought unsuccessfully to obtain a base of trust land within \nits aboriginal homeland area. In 1994, when the Congress enacted the \nCalifornia Desert Protection Act, P.L. 103-433, it set in motion a \nprocess to address the need of the Tribe for a recognized land base. \nSection 705(b) of the Act provided that--\n\n       The Secretary, in consultation with the Timbisha Shoshone \n     Tribe and relevant Federal agencies, shall conduct a study, \n     subject to the availability of appropriations, to identify \n     lands suitable for a reservation for the Timbisha Shoshone \n     Tribe that are located within the Tribe's aboriginal homeland \n     area within and outside the boundaries of Death Valley \n     National Monument and the Death Valley National Park as \n     described in part A of this subchapter.\n\n  The study report, which finally was completed late in 1999, set forth \nrecommendations for legislation that would implement a comprehensive, \nintegrated plan for a permanent Homeland for the Tribe. The legislation \nthat we introduce today would give substance to those recommendations.\n  Briefly, the bill provides for the transfer of several separate \nparcels of land, currently administered by the Department of the \nInterior and comprising approximately 7,500 acres, in trust for the \nTimbisha Shoshone Tribe. These parcels include: 300 acres at Furnace \nCreek in Death Valley National Park encompassing the present Timbisha \nVillage Site, subject to jointly developed land use restrictions \ndesigned to ensure compatibility and consistency with tribal and Park \nvalues, needs and purposes; 1,000 acres of land now managed by the \nBureau of Land Management at Death Valley Junction, California, east of \nthe Park; 640 acres of land now managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement in an area identified as Centennial, California, west of the \nPark; 2,800 acres of land now managed by the Bureau of Land Management \nand classified as available for disposal near Scotty's Junction, \nNevada, northeast of the Park; and 2,800 acres now managed by the \nBureau of Land Management and classified as available for disposal near \nLida, Nevada, north of the Park.\n  This legislation also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \npurchase from willing sellers two parcels of approximately 120 acres of \nformer Indian allotted lands in the Saline Valley, California, at the \nedge of the Park, and the 2,430 acre Lida Ranch near Lida, Nevada.\n  The legislation would designate an area primarily in the western part \nof Death Valley National Park as the Timbisha Shoshone Natural and \nCultural Preservation Area, within which low impact, environmentally \nsustainable, tribal traditional uses, activities and practices will be \nauthorized subject to existing law and a jointly established management \nplan agreed upon\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\nby the Tribe, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will at long last provide the \nTimbisha Shoshone Tribe with land on which its members can live \npermanently and govern their affairs in a modern community, and will \nformally recognize the Tribe's contributions to the history, culture, \nand ecology of the Death Valley National Park and the surrounding area.\n  It will ensure that the resources within the Park are protected and \nenhanced by cooperative activities within the Tribe's ancestral \nhomeland, and by partnerships between the Tribe and the National Park \nService and the Bureau of Land Management, all of which will be \nconsistent with the purposes and values for which the Park was \nestablished.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is incomplete \nin that certain map references and specific acreage numbers are still \nbeing determined by the Department. However, these are minor concerns \nthat will be addressed in the coming weeks. It is vitally important \nthat this legislation be introduced so that a hearing can be scheduled \nand all interested parties will have the opportunity to review this \nmeasure prior to the hearing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2105. A bill to amend chapter 65 of title 18, United States Code, \nto prohibit the unauthorized destruction, modification, or alteration \nof product identification codes used in consumer product recalls, for \nlaw enforcement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       anti-tampering act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my good \nfriend from Vermont, the distinguished Ranking Minority Member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, the ``Anti-Tampering Act of \n2000.'' In short, this bill prohibits tampering with product \nidentification codes--a practice that threatens the health and safety \nof US consumers, frustrates legitimate forensic activities of law \nenforcement, and impairs manufacturers' ability to protect their \ndistribution channels, thereby exposing them to significant product \nliability exposure.\n  Let me take just a moment to explain the need for this bill. \nManufacturers code their products in order to protect their consumers \nand to assist law enforcement in investigating consumer complaints, as \nwell as in conducting recalls of tampered products. These codes assist \nthe manufacturer and law enforcement in tracing goods back to a \nparticular lot, batch or date of production. They include batch codes, \nexpiration dates, lot numbers, and other information that one can \ntypically see imprinted on the bottom or side of most products.\n  Legitimate goods produced by manufacturers are obtained by \n``illegitimate decoders'', frequently by fraud, theft or false \npretenses. These decoders then decode and otherwise tamper with product \nlabeling to avoid detection so that they may sell these ill-gotten \ngoods to unauthorized points of sale. The frightening aspect of this \nactivity, Mr. President, is that a substantial portion of the US-made \ngoods sold by illegitimate decoders have been adulterated or otherwise \ntampered with after manufacture, and present health and safety risks to \nconsumers.\n  Incredible as it may seem, thieves routinely tamper with product \nidentification codes on stolen goods; counterfeiters affix fake codes \non gray market goods that are then mixed with counterfeits; and \ndistributors who have broken their distribution contracts with \nmanufacturers typically obliterate product identification codes.\n  Because gray market activity is largely lawful in the US, the \ndiverters' distribution channels have been used by professional thieves \nand counterfeiters to traffic in their illegal merchandise. There \nappears to be a connection between counterfeit and decoded imports, and \nanti-counterfeiting enforcement efforts will be frustrated unless \ngreater controls are placed on the importation of such decoded \nproducts. Regrettably, gray market networks are increasingly being used \nfor the distribution and sale of counterfeit goods. Distributors have \nbeen found to sell counterfeit goods--from baby shampoo to infant \nformula to cosmetics and fragrances--purchased through gray market \nchannels.\n  In short, Mr. President, goods are decoded to hide evidence of \nfraudulent, unlawful conduct and to traffic in stolen, counterfeit, \nmisbranded, out-of-date and unlawfully diverted merchandise.\n  Let me offer you a few examples of the significant health and safety \nrisks presented by this activity. As noted by the International Formula \nCouncil, product identification codes are, without question, the single \nmost important factor in a successful recall. In recent years, this \nlink between product coding and consumer protection has become \nincreasingly evident. Following the Tylenol poisonings of 1982, product \ncoding enabled Johnson & Johnson to identify the tainted production \nlots and issue a nationwide recall of potentially dangerous products. \nSimilarly, the manufacturers of automobiles, toys, food products and \nother consumer goods have consistently relied upon product coding to \nidentify and recall goods that fail to meet consumer quality and safety \nstandards.\n  Last year, the FDA used product codes to quickly identify a shipment \nof contaminated strawberries that had caused an outbreak of hepatitis \nin Michigan schools. More recently, the Slim Fast Corporation relied on \nproduct codes to identify and recall 192,000 cans of its ready-to-drink \ndiet shakes because, according to the New York Times (Apr. 18, 1999), \nsome of the cans might have been filled with a diluted cleaning \nsolution. In addition, this summer, a leading manufacturer of infant \nformula used its product codes to identify and recall 7,000 cases of \ninfant formula after a labeling error resulted in distribution of \ninfant formula cans that may have contained an adult nutritional \nsupplement that could have been harmful to infants. (USA Today, June 9, \n1999.)\n  An undercover investigation by the Food and Drug Administration's \nOffice of Criminal Investigation in New York involved wholesale \npurchases of expensive fertility drugs. Fraudulent code numbers \nappeared on the counterfeit packaging containing these injectible \nproducts. Although laboratory analysis indicated the presence of the \nactive ingredient in these products, the FDA was not able to determine \nthe place or conditions of their manufacture because of the absence of \nlegitimate batch code data.\n  Fraudulent product identification coding has even been used in \nschemes involving bulk food products such as metric tons of frozen \nshrimp. For instance, a Florida indictment charged an importer with \ncriminal offenses involving the repeated ``washing, mixing and \nsoaking'' of putrid and decomposed shrimp in a solution containing \ncopper sulfate, chlorine, lemon juice and other chemicals to conceal \nthe inferiority of the product. Central to this scheme was the ``re-\ncoding'' of product lots as they were repeatedly rejected by buyers, \nchemically treated, and re-sold to others who did not know the \nproducts' history.\n  In short, without product coding, the task of identifying and \nrecalling defective goods becomes infinitely more difficult and often \nimpossible, leaving consumers exposed to potential harm, illness and \neven death. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nthere were 273 product recalls last year and, on average, one high \nprofile recall each week.\n\n  In addition to the health and safety risks presented by this conduct, \nMr. President, there is an additional, equally significant public \npolicy interest served by this bill: codes play a vital part in \ntraditional law enforcement activities. They assist law enforcement in \ninvestigating criminal activity, and they further aid in tracking \nstolen goods. They play a critical role in certain criminal \ninvestigations, allowing law enforcement officers to pinpoint the \nlocation and in some cases--including the World Trade Center bombing--\nthe identity of the offender. In cases of stolen or tainted goods, \nproduct codes point to the source of the product and the site of the \ncrime.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, there is no single federal statute that \nadequately addresses the problem of product identification code \ntampering of all consumer products. Federal law only applies to a \nlimited category of consumer products. Moreover, federal law only \napplies if the decoder or tamperer\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\nexhibits criminal intent to harm the consumer. It does not address the \nvast majority of decoding cases that could result in harm to the \nconsumer, but do not involve the specific intent to harm the consumer. \nMoreover, violations of current federal law result in only a \nmisdemeanor.\n  By criminalizing tampering with product identification codes, we hope \nto send a clear message to the professional criminals: We value the \nlives and well being of Americans and will not tolerate this conduct \nany more on our soil. You, the professional criminal, will persist in \nthis activity at your economic and personal peril.\n  Under the bill, tampering with product codes of pharmaceuticals, \nover-the-counter medicines consumer products, health and beauty aids, \nand other goods will constitute a criminal offense. Criminalizing this \nconduct will result in strengthened law enforcement tools, greater \nconsumer protections and greater security for manufacturers' products.\n  Mr. President, I believe it would be instructive to identify what \nthis bill does not do, as there has been some misinformation about this \nmeasure. The bill does not restrict, prohibit, criminalize or otherwise \nimpair lawful, arms-length diversion activity. In short, Mr. Chairman, \nthe bill does not affect the legality or illegality of the gray market. \nIt simply prohibits tampering with product identification codes. \nDiverters can continue to engage in parallel importing to the same \nextent after passage of this measure as they have in the past. However, \nto be clear, Mr. Chairman, they must do so without obliterating the \nproduct identification codes or affixing fake codes on the goods.\n  Moreover, unintentional acts of decoding or other activities \nassociated with decoded products are not subject to criminal or civil \naction, because the bill provides for a knowledge standard and \nprotection for innocent violators. Thus, the innocent store clerk who \nmerely scans merchandise at the check out counter and unwittingly \npermits the sale of decoded merchandise need not worry. Nor should \neither the innocent trucker who transports this merchandise or the \ninnocent distributor who engages in distributing this merchandise to \nthe retailer have cause for concern.\n\n  Others have expressed concern that enactment of the bill will result \nin the end of discount retailers and discount prices. It is difficult \nto understand this objection. I cannot conceive why discounting would \nrequire altering the expiration dates or the source identifiers of the \ngoods, unless all discounts are illegally diverted or are product that \nshould be recalled. But risking the health and safety of American \nconsumers, or selling them inferior or fake goods to keep alive a \ncertain brand of ``discounting'' does not seem like much of a bargain \nto me. Discounts are routinely offered when inventories build up or \nstyles change. Manufacturers and retailers will continue to discount \nwhen this bill is enacted. But consumers will have greater assurance \nthat the discount they are receiving is not coming with an offsetting \nrisk that the product is contaminated or defective.\n  Finally, Mr. President, some argue that the bill's application to all \nproducts is unnecessarily broad. The bill's several important public \npolicy goals require that it apply to all products. Let me explain why. \nThe bill is intended to ensure effective and targeted product recalls, \nto enhance law enforcement investigations, and to protect American \nconsumers and the legitimate businesses who serve them from the \ndepredations of illegitimate diverters. Product recalls apply to all \nproducts and law enforcement investigations implicate all products. For \ninstance, the codes on the batteries in the Olympic Park bombing in \nAtlanta, Georgia were used to exonerate the security guard then under \nsuspicion in that case, Richard Jewell. The code on the microprocessor \nchip on the bomb in the Pan Am air crash linked the bombing to \nterrorists. And even on a more pedestrian level, the code on a crowbar \nin a recent New York burglary led police to the criminal.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this important measure \ntoday. It enjoys the strong backing of the Coalition Against Product \nTampering (CAPT). The CAPT is a coalition of private sector companies, \nconsumer groups, unions and law enforcement agencies which are \nconcerned about product decoding and product tampering and the role \nthese activities play in fueling and supporting other criminal \nenterprises, including money laundering, organized retail theft, and \ncounterfeiting. I would ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the \nCAPT's membership list be included in the record after my remarks. I \nhave received numerous members of this group expressing their support \nfor the legislation introduced today.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, law enforcement, consumer groups, \nunions, and others agree with me that intentional decoding of products \nthreatens the health and safety of American consumers. According to the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, manufacturers cannot conceive of \na single legitimate reason to decode products. Nor can I. The ``Anti-\nTampering Act of 2000'' I am introducing today is a narrowly tailored \napproach to this problem and should be enacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis of the legislation appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In general\n       Section 2 of the bill amends Title 18 of the United States \n     Code to create a new section 1365A prohibiting for all goods \n     the intentional removal or alteration of product \n     identification codes, as well as the affixing of fake codes, \n     as follows:\n       Section 1365A(a). Definitions. New section 1365A(a) of \n     Title 18 sets forth the definitions of the relevant terms \n     used in new section 1365A. By definition, the prohibitions \n     contained in the bill would not apply to the ultimate user or \n     purchaser of the good, to any hotel, restaurant or other \n     provider of services that alters the packaging in order to \n     make it available to the ultimate consumer, or any retailer \n     or distributor who acquires a good for resale.\n       Under this subsection, the definition of product \n     identification code includes any visible number, letter, \n     symbol, marking, date (including an expiration date), or code \n     that is affixed to or embedded in any good by which the \n     manufacturer may trace the good back to a particular lot, \n     batch, date of production or date of removal. It specifically \n     excludes (1) copyright management information conveyed in \n     connection with copies or phonorecords of a copyrighted work \n     or encryption information, (2) any or all other codes or \n     markings on the good, (3) a Universal Product Code, and (4) \n     trademark or copyright notices, including notices that are \n     affixed to, superimposed on or embedded in product \n     identification codes.\n       Section 1365A(b). Prohibited Acts. Section 1365A(b) sets \n     forth the activities that are prohibited. It seeks to target \n     and prohibit each phase of the decoding process--the act of \n     decoding, the affixing of fake codes, and the distribution of \n     the decoded or falsely coded product. The bill includes a \n     knowledge standard that applies throughout the decoding to \n     distribution process.\n       Specifically, this subsection prohibits the intentional \n     alteration or removal of any visible product identification \n     code. It also prohibits the intentional affixing of any fake \n     or simulated code upon any good, label, container, packaging, \n     or component thereof. The prohibition does not apply to the \n     original manufacturer or the final consumer. This subsection \n     further prohibits the importation, re-importation, \n     exportation, sale, offering or holding for sale, \n     distribution, or brokering of goods or components thereof \n     whose product identification codes have been altered, \n     concealed, removed or falsified.\n       In addition, this subsection prohibits selling, offering \n     for sale, or knowingly permitting the sale at flea markets of \n     certain products, including baby food, infant formula, and \n     other products covered by the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act, except by authorized representatives of the \n     manufacturer or distributor.\n       Section 1365A(c). Applicability to Goods Held in Free Trade \n     Zones. Section 1365A(c) extends the prohibitions against \n     decoding and false coding to all goods held for sale or \n     distribution in interstate or foreign commerce, including \n     goods held in Customs bonded warehouses and free trade zones.\n       Section 1365A(d). Exclusions. The bill excludes from \n     section 1365A the act of affixing genuine Universal Product \n     Codes, security tags or other legitimate pricing or inventory \n     codes that can be removed without damaging the product \n     identification code. It also excludes from section 1365A \n     certain types of repackaging activities. The bill will permit \n     the removal of shipping containers and the repackaging of \n     goods for the purpose of selling the goods in different \n     quantities. The exception would apply only if each retail \n     item retains its original product identification code, the \n     repackaging is in full compliance with all applicable laws \n     and regulations, and the new package includes a label stating \n     that the good has been repackaged and containing the name of \n     the repacker.\n       Section 1365A(e). Criminal penalties. Section 1365A(e) \n     imposes criminal penalties on\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\n     any person who knowingly and willfully engages in decoding \n     violations. This subsection imposes fines pursuant to the \n     schedule of fines set forth in Title 18. A person violating \n     the Act could be imprisoned up to one year for the first \n     offense; up to 5 years if the value of the goods exceed \n     $10,000; up to 10 years if the violation threatens public \n     health and safety; up to 20 years if the violation results in \n     bodily injury; and up to life imprisonment if a death results \n     from the violation. If there are subsequent violations, the \n     bill imposes twice the term of imprisonment that would \n     otherwise be imposed.\n       Section 1365A(f). Injunctions and Impounding, Forfeiture, \n     and Disposition of Goods. This section authorizes the court \n     in its discretion, upon motion of the United States, to grant \n     injunctive relief to prevent or restrain the alleged \n     violation, and impound goods that the court has reasonable \n     cause to believe are involved in the violation. This section \n     also requires the court upon conviction to order the \n     forfeiture of any goods involved in the violation and either \n     the destruction, disposal or return of the goods involved.\n       Section 1365A(g). Civil Remedies. Section 1365A(g) provides \n     consumers and manufacturers who are injured or threatened \n     with injury with a civil right of action against persons who \n     knowingly engage in decoding activities.\n       Paragraph (2) further authorizes the court at its \n     discretion to issue injunctions, and to impound the goods in \n     the custody of the defendant. As part of a final judgment or \n     decree, the court may order the destruction, disposal or \n     return to the manufacturer of the goods involved in the \n     violation of this section. The goods may also be delivered to \n     a government agency or provided as gifts to charitable \n     institutions, if the manufacturer consents to the \n     disposition.\n       Paragraph (3) sets forth the civil damages available to \n     persons injured or who can demonstrate the likelihood of \n     injury by violations of the Act. These damages include actual \n     damages and profits, or, upon election by the plaintiff, \n     statutory damages in an amount not less than $500 and not \n     more than $100,000 for each type of goods involved in the \n     violation. Available statutory damages are increased to not \n     less than $5,000 and not more than $1,000,000 in cases in \n     which the violation threatens the health and safety of the \n     public. In addition, paragraph (5) allows the civil plaintiff \n     to seek treble damages in the event of repeat violations made \n     within 3 years of the original violation. Paragraph (7) also \n     authorizes the court to reduce or eliminate the total damages \n     award, or award no damages, if the violator sustains the \n     burden of proving, and the court finds, that the violator was \n     not aware and had not reason to believe the acts of the \n     violator constituted a violation.\n       Paragraph (4) provides that the court in its discretion may \n     award the prevailing party its costs and attorneys' fees.\n       Paragraph (6) imposes a three-year statute of limitations \n     on the filing of a civil action. The limitation begins \n     running from the date on which the claimant discovers or has \n     reason to know of the violation.\n       Section 1365A(h). Enforcement actions. Section 1365A(h) \n     requires the Attorney General and Secretary of Treasury to \n     enforce the requirements of this new section of Title 18. It \n     also authorizes the head of a department or agency of the \n     Federal Government (including the Secretary of Agriculture \n     and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration) to \n     investigate alleged violations involving goods regulated by \n     their respective agencies.\n       This section also requires Customs Service officials to \n     seize decoded products, notify the manufacturer of such \n     seizure, and destroy or dispose of such goods. In order to \n     facilitate this Customs seizure, the manufacturer would be \n     permitted to record with the Customs Service any relevant \n     information concerning product identification codes.\n     Subsection (b). Conforming amendments\n       Subsection (b) makes a conforming amendment to Title 18 to \n     include the title of new section 1365A in the table of \n     sections for chapter 65 of Title 18.\n     Subsection (c). Regulatory authority\n       Subsection (c) of the bill requires the Attorney General, \n     after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     FDA Commissioner, and the head of any other department or \n     agency of the Federal Government the Attorney General \n     determines appropriate, to issue regulations implementing new \n     section 1365A of Title 18 within six months of enactment.\n\n\n           Section 3. Attorney General Reporting Requirements\n\n       Section 3 of the bill requires the Attorney General to \n     include in his or her reports to Congress on the business of \n     the Department of Justice all actions taken by the Department \n     regarding product decoding.\n\n\n                       Section 4. Effective date\n\n       Section 4 of the bill states that the bill will become \n     effective six months after enactment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am joining forces with my good friend \nSenator Hatch on a Judiciary Committee bill that would prohibit \nimproper tampering with product identification codes.\n  Manufacturers code their products in order to protect their consumers \nand to assist law enforcement in investigating consumer complaints, as \nwell as in conducting recalls of tampered products. These codes assist \nthe manufacturer and law enforcement in tracing goods back to a \nparticular lot, batch or date of production. They include batch codes, \nexpiration dates, lot numbers, and other information that one can \ntypically see imprinted on the bottom or side of most products.\n  This product identification codes are extremely important in terms of \nproduct recall. There were over 250 product recalls last year--\nincluding two recent product recalls, one of ready-to-eat diet shakes \nand the other regarding the recall of 7,000 cases of infant formula. \nAlso, product codes were of great help regarding the Tylenol poisonings \nof 1982 and the contaminated strawberry incident in Michigan in which \nschool children became ill.\n  Forensic experts have used product identification codes in \ninvestigating numerous crimes including the bombing of the World Trade \nCenter in New York City. Sometimes product codes are used to exonerate \nthe innocent. For example, the product codes in the batteries involved \nin the Olympic Park, Atlanta, bombing helped exonerate the security \nguard, Richard Jewell, under suspicion in that case.\n  Product codes have been fraudulently altered regarding medicines, \nfertility drugs, and even bulk frozen shrimp. This makes it very \ndifficult to trade back these products and to determine their safety. \nThis bill addresses those concerns.\n  This bill contains significant improvements over a version introduced \nin the other body some time ago. Wholesalers were worried that they \ncould not repackage goods--together into ``sale baskets''--to be sold \nat discount prices. This bill permits the resale of products at \ndiscounted prices. Each individual item would have to keep the original \ncode but the prices could be changed depending on competitive market \nforces.\n  It is important that manufacturers not be able to control prices by \noperation of this bill. Consumers interested in bargains need to be \nable to get the best bargain they can get. This bill does not prevent \nthe reselling of overstocked, or other, goods to discount retailers.\n  The bill also makes clear that any innocent alterations of product \nidentification codes are not subject to the criminal provisions.\n  The bill contains a provision unrelated to product identification \ncodes which I want to discuss for a moment. The bill prohibits at flea \nmarkets the sale of baby food, infant formula, or similar products made \nfor consumption of children under three years of age. It also prohibits \nthe sale of drugs, medical foods, cosmetics, and medical devices as \ndefined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act at flea markets \nunless the seller keeps for public inspection written documentation \nidentifying the seller person as an authorized representative of the \nmanufacturer or distributor of the food, drug, device, or cosmetic.\n  This appears to be a reasonable policy but I am very interested in \nthe views of my colleagues on this matter as there may be other ways to \nachieve the goals of these flea market provisions. I intend to work \nclosely with the Committee Chairman, Senator Hatch, and my other \ncolleagues regarding this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"},

Con. Res. 82\n\n       Whereas on February 22, 2000, the Basque terrorist group \n     ETA killed Fernando Buesa, the leader of the Basque Socialist \n     Party, and Jorge Diez Elorza, a member of his escort, in a \n     cowardly bomb attack;\n       Whereas this heinous crime displays absolute contempt for \n     human rights and the right to life by those individuals who \n     practice terrorism and threaten freedom, peace, liberty, and \n     the peaceful coexistence of the Basque people and the people \n     of Spain; and\n       Whereas Spain is a democracy where the rule of law is \n     enforced and terrorist acts are not tolerated: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns and denounces those responsible for \n     the cowardly bombing that killed Fernando Buesa and Jorge \n     Diez Elorza;\n       (2) strongly shares the determination of the Spanish people \n     that the perpetrators of this vile act will be brought \n     swiftly to justice so that Spain may demonstrate its \n     opposition to acts of terror;\n       (3) calls again on ETA and those responsible for this act \n     to renounce violence and terrorism which have taken so many \n     lives; and\n       (4) continues to cherish the strong friendship between \n     Spain and the United States.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know I will be joined by every Member of \nthe Senate as I express my deepest condolences to the families of \nFernando Buesa and Jorge Diez Elorza, who were tragically killed in \nTuesday's bombing attack by the Spanish terrorist group ETA in Vitoria, \nSpain. I point out Fernando Buesa was the head of the Socialist Party \nin the Basque Assembly, so he was a political leader of some note and a \nhighly respected leader in his own country. In the aftermath of this \nattack on human rights and peaceful coexistence, I also offer my \nthoughts and prayers to the people of Spain and the Spanish community \naround the world.\n  Reports of terrorist violence in Spain are becoming far too common. \nIt was only one month ago that an ETA car bomb in central Madrid killed \none man and injured innocent children on their way to school. This \ncowardly type of terrorist expression must be stopped.\n  Over a year ago, I was pleased when I heard reports of the historic \nETA cease-fire. Under this cease-fire, Spain remained free of terrorist \nviolence for 14 months and enjoyed the increase in tourism that peace \naffords. Unfortunately, in December of 1999, ETA renounced its cease-\nfire, once again plunging Spain into the horrific terrorist violence \nthat marked its past.\n  I believe that a majority of the people in Spain, both Basque and \nSpanish, are tired of this endless violence. It is time for ETA to \nrenew its cease-fire and negotiate a peace agreement with the Spanish \ngovernment. Only then can the senseless violence that threatens to \ndestroy Spain's booming economy be stopped.\n  Last night, at a White House dinner I attended in honor of King Juan \nCarlos and Queen Sofia of Spain, after-dinner dancing was suspended in \nmemory of the killed. In this vein, I ask that we as a body reaffirm \nour commitment to human rights by condemning this most recent attack in \nSpain.\n  Today, I submit a resolution that denounces the terrorist activities \nthat killed Fernando Buesa and Jorge Diez Elorza, calls again on ETA to \nrenounce the use of violence and terrorism which have taken so many \nlives, and pledges continued alliance between Spain and the United \nStates, and ask it to be referred to the appropriate committee. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S822-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 83--COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF IRAN FOR \n   THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND POSITIVE POLITICAL \n        REFORM ON THE OCCASION OF IRAN'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to.\n\n                            S.

Res. 259\n\n       Whereas the Good Friday Agreement was signed on April 10, \n     1998, to bring about a peaceful settlement to the conflict in \n     Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas in a referendum on May 22, 1998, the people of \n     Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted \n     overwhelmingly in favor of the Good Friday Agreement;\n       Whereas the Good Friday Agreement provides for the \n     devolution of government from the United Kingdom to local \n     institutions in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a \n     North/South Ministerial Council and a British-Irish Council, \n     and consists of provisions on decommissioning, human rights, \n     policing, and prisoners;\n       Whereas much progress has been made in the establishment of \n     both the indigenous Northern Ireland institutions and the \n     North/South and British-Irish bodies, hundreds of prisoners \n     from both communities have been released, and a plan for the \n     restructuring of the police force has been put forth;\n       Whereas the Independent International Commission on \n     Decommissioning (the Commission), led by General John de \n     Chastelain, was established to facilitate the process of \n     decommissioning of paramilitary arms as called for in the \n     Good Friday Agreement;\n       Whereas the two principal loyalist paramilitary \n     organizations, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the \n     Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), informed the Commission that \n     they are prepared to move on decommissioning if the Irish \n     Republican Army (IRA) makes clear that the war is over and it \n     will also decommission;\n       Whereas the Commission's January 31, 2000, report on \n     decommissioning states that though the IRA emphasized that it \n     poses no threat to the peace process, it has not provided any \n     information as to when decommissioning will begin;\n       Whereas the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor \n     Party, John Hume, has called upon the IRA to ``demonstrate \n     for all to see its patriotism and desire to move the \n     situation forward by strengthening the peace process through \n     beginning voluntarily the process of decommissioning'';\n       Whereas on February 11, 2000, due to the decommissioning \n     impasse, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, \n     Peter Mandelson, suspended the Northern Ireland Executive and \n     resumed direct control over the province;\n       Whereas on February 11, 2000, the Commission issued a \n     report noting the ``IRA's recognition that the issue of arms \n     needs to be dealt with in an acceptable way and that this is \n     a necessary objective of a genuine peace process''; and\n       Whereas recent polls indicate that the overwhelming \n     majority of the people in Northern Ireland and the Republic \n     of Ireland support decommissioning by all paramilitary \n     organizations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) stresses the importance of decommissioning of weapons \n     held by paramilitaries on all sides without conditions to the \n     success of the peace process in Northern Ireland;\n       (2) calls upon the Irish Republican Army to make a firm \n     commitment and offer a specific timetable as to when \n     decommissioning of all of their arms and explosives will \n     begin; and\n       (3) urges the loyalist paramilitary organizations to \n     respond to such an IRA proposal by immediately beginning the \n     process of decommissioning all of their weapons.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am certainly not alone in my \ndisappointment at the recent turn of events in Northern Ireland. It is \na disheartening development. With the signing of the Good Friday \nAgreement in April 1998 and the overwhelming desire for peaceful \nresolution of the conflict--in both Northern Ireland and the Republic \nof Ireland--the prospects for peace in that troubled region had never \nseemed better.\n  The Good Friday Agreement, like all negotiated peace settlements, \noffers incentives to all parties but it also requires compromises--\ncompromises that most people are willing to make, and have made, in \norder for peace. I do not pretend to speak for any side in Northern \nIreland, but I can imagine that it was difficult for many in the \nUnionist community to see convicted IRA bombers walk free from prison.\n  And it was certainly difficult for many in the nationalist community \nto accept the principal of continued British sovereignty over Northern \nIreland. But David Trimble, John Hume, and other honorable men and \nwomen have fulfilled their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement \nin order to give peace the opportunity to take root in Northern \nIreland.\n  The current crisis stems from the refusal of one organization--the \nIrish Republican Army--to begin the process of decommissioning of their \nweapons and explosives. The IRA claims it has done enough by keeping \nits guns silent, by not setting off bombs, by adhering to a cease-fire. \nBut, Mr. President, what kind of democratic system exists when one \norganization maintains a massive arsenal for potential use in the event \nthat it is dissatisfied with the political process? Is that considered \na genuine peace? I maintain that it is not, and it should not be \naccepted by people in this country.\n  Let me clear, the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, signed onto \ndecommissioning in the Good Friday Agreement. As the Agreement states: \n``all participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total \ndisarmament of all paramilitary organizations'' and to ``use any \ninfluence they may have, to achieve the decommissioning of all \nparamilitary arms within two years'', which is May 22 of this year.\n  Now, Sinn Fein's leader Gerry Adams has said that his organization \n``has no further room to move'', which I find quite interesting, \nconsidering that members of his party were allowed to participate in \nthe local governing structures established by the Good Friday Agreement \n(but do not seem to be willing to convince the IRA it must fulfill its \nobligations as well).\n  I suggest that Mr. Adams be advised that he cannot have it both ways. \nAnd to those whose excuse is that the deadline for decommissioning is \nstill three months off (May 22, 2000), I would remind them that there \nis an established body designed to manage this process and that the IRA \nrefused to make any commitment or offer any timetable for \ndecommissioning to this institution. It is difficult to believe that on \nMay 21, 2000, the IRA would have, in any event, turned over its \nhundreds of guns, its tons of Semtex, which it maintains as a veto on \npeace.\n  We are at a critical point: due to lack of commitment by the IRA on \ndecommissioning, the British government had no choice but to suspend \nthe indigenous institutions of Northern Ireland. Why? Let me merely \nrecite the obvious: Why should Sinn Fein be allowed to participate in \nlegitimate, elected governing bodies when the IRA refuses to disarm? \nHow can we expect the unionist community to deal with Sinn Fein \nofficials in this capacity when the IRA has turned its back on this \ncrucial part of the peace process?\n  Sinn Fein and the IRA continue to raise the bar; after demanding that \nthe Northern Ireland Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly be \nestablished before beginning decommissioning, they now state that if \nthe British withdraw their troops from bases in Northern Ireland, they \nmight consider handing in their weapons. I would remind them that there \nis an agreement, there is a process that they have signed onto--from \nwhich they have benefitted. Their prisoners have been released. Plans \nfor a drastic overhaul of the Royal Ulster\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nConstabulary have been put forth. Cross border institutions have been \nestablished and are functioning.\n  They must abide by their obligations as well. Mr. President, Sinn \nFein and the IRA must understand that if they do not, they will not \nhave the support of the United States.\n  Today I am offering a resolution stressing the importance of \ndecommissioning to the success of the peace in Northern Ireland and \ncalling on the IRA to commit to the process and to offer a timetable as \nto when they will turn in their arms and explosives. And although the \nloyalist paramilitary organizations have significantly fewer weapons in \ntheir possession, they must fulfill their promise to disarm as well. \nThe two main loyalist paramilitaries have stated that they will disarm \nwhen the IRA begins to do so. If the IRA moves on decommissioning, \nthese organizations should respond immediately.\n  This is an historic moment in Northern Ireland--the best chance for \npeace in a quarter of a century. Let us not waste it. We must encourage \nthose who are working for peace. But more importantly, we must make \nclear to those who want to destroy this opportunity by clinging to old \nand violent means, they can not succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S824-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S824-S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 260--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO \nUNINSURED AND LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN MEDICALLY UNDER SERVED AREAS BE \n   INCREASED IN ORDER TO DOUBLE ACCESS TO CARE OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Breaux, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Inouye) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations:\n\n                              S. Res. 260\n\n       Whereas the uninsured population in the United States \n     continues to grow at over 100,000 individuals per month, and \n     is estimated to reach over 53,000,000 people by 2007;\n       Whereas the growth in the uninsured population continues \n     despite public and private efforts to increase health \n     insurance coverage;\n       Whereas nearly 80 percent of the uninsured population are \n     members of working families who cannot afford health \n     insurance or cannot access employer-provided health insurance \n     plans;\n       Whereas minority populations, rural residents, and single-\n     parent families represent a disproportionate number of the \n     uninsured population;\n       Whereas the problem of health care access for the uninsured \n     population is compounded in many urban and rural communities \n     by a lack of providers who are available to serve both \n     insured and uninsured populations;\n       Whereas community, migrant, homeless, and public housing \n     health centers have proven uniquely qualified to address the \n     lack of adequate health care services for uninsured \n     populations, serving over 4,500,000 uninsured patients in \n     1999, including over 1,000,000 new uninsured patients who \n     have sought care from such centers in the last 3 years;\n       Whereas health centers care for nearly 7,000,000 \n     minorities, nearly 600,000 farmworkers, and more than 500,000 \n     homeless individuals each year;\n       Whereas health centers provide cost-effective comprehensive \n     primary and preventive care to uninsured individuals for less \n     than $1.00 per day, or $350 annually, and help to reduce the \n     inappropriate use of costly emergency rooms and inpatient \n     hospital care;\n       Whereas current resources only allow health centers to \n     serve 10 percent of the Nation's 44,000,000 uninsured \n     individuals;\n       Whereas past investments to increase health center access \n     have resulted in better health, an improved quality of life \n     for all Americans, and a reduction in national health care \n     expenditures; and\n       Whereas Congress can act now to increase access to health \n     care services for uninsured and low-income people together \n     with or in advance of health care coverage proposals by \n     expanding the availability of services at community, migrant, \n     homeless, and public housing health centers: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Resolution to Expand \n     Access to Community Health Centers (REACH) Initiative''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that appropriations for \n     consolidated health centers under section 330 of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) should be increased by \n     100 percent over the next 5 fiscal years in order to double \n     the number of individuals who receive health care services at \n     community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health \n     centers.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the hot topic in \nthe world of health care--health care access. Many people see this as \nthe biggest problem in health care today.\n  Part of the problem, and the part that has received the most \nattention, is that too many Americans lack health insurance--about 44 \nmillion Americans aren't covered by any type of health plan. But an \nequally serious part of the problem is many people's simple inability \nto get access to a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a \nyoung couple with a sick child is out of luck if they can't get in to \nsee a pediatrician or another health care provider. And in too many \nurban and rural communities across the country, there just aren't \nenough doctors to go around.\n  Several plans have been proposed recently on how to deal with the \nhealth care access problem. Senator Bradley has a plan. The Vice \nPresident has one. There's also a bipartisan proposal for tax credits \nto help people buy health insurance. All of these plans have at least 3 \nthings in common.\n  First, they all address a worthwhile goal. I think we all want to see \nthat people have access to good health care, even if we might disagree \non how to get there.\n  Second, they're all very ambitious. Senator Bradley in fact is \nbasically proposing to use close to the entire $1 trillion surplus to \nprovide people with health insurance.\n  The third thing these plans have in common--and perhaps the most \nimportant thing--is that they probably have little chance of becoming \nlaw this year. Whether because of policy differences or political \ndifferences, it's just not likely that they will pass.\n  So today, we're launching a bipartisan effort--called the REACH \nInitiative--that does have a chance this year. There's no need to wait \nfor an election--we can do it now.\n  Our proposal builds on the crucial work that organizations known as \ncommunity health centers have been doing to ensure better access to \nhealth care. Health centers are private nonprofit clinics that provide \nprimary care and preventive health care services in medically-\nunderserved urban and rural communities across the country. Partially \nwith the help of federal grants, health centers provide basic care for \nabout 11 million people every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured.\n  The goal of the REACH Initiative is simple--to make sure more people \nhave access to health care. We plan to achieve this by doubling federal \nfunding for community health centers over a period of five years. We \nbelieve this will allow up to 10 million more women, children, and \nothers in need to receive care at health centers. If we are successful \nwith the REACH Initiative, we can practically double the number of \nuninsured and underinsured people that health centers care for.\n  The REACH Initiative basically recognizes the key contributions that \ncommunity health centers have already made in addressing the health \ncare access problems. But there is so much more that can still be done.\n  Now, out of all the ways we can address health care access problems, \nwhy are health centers a good solution and a worthwhile target for \nadditional funding?\n  1. Health centers are an existing program that produces results. Too \nmany health care proposals want to practically start from scratch, and \nmake breathtakingly revolutionary changes. When I look at the health \nsystem and its admittedly huge problems, I sometimes think that might \nnot be a bad idea. But it's also extremely risky. We need to remember \nthat despite the many flaws in our health system, many people are \npleased with it. We should be wary about making too radical changes \nthat could interfere with what's right in our system. Instead, we can \nexpand an existing part of the system that's been proven to provide \ncost-effective, high-quality care.\n  2. Health centers play a crucial role in health care, and are vastly \nunderappreciated. It's amazing to me how few people are aware of the \ntypes of services community health centers provide, and just how \nprominent they are in health care. After all, health centers care for \nclose to one out of very 20 Americans, one out of every 12 rural\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nresidents, one out of every 6 low-income children, and one of every 5 \nbabies born to low-income families.\n  3. Health centers truly target the health care access problem. By \ndefinition, health centers must be located in ``medically underserved'' \ncommunities--which simply means places where people have serious \nproblems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the \nproblem right at this source. Unlike other health care proposals, the \nREACH Initiative doesn't create problems of ``crowding out'' private \ninsurance by replacing private dollars spent on health insurance with \nfederal dollars.\n\n  4. Health centers are relatively cheap. Health centers can provide \nprimary and preventive care for one person for less than $1 dollar per \nday--about $350 per year. Even better, health centers are able to \nleverage each grant dollar from the federal government into additional \nfunding from other sources--meaning they can effectively turn one grant \ndollar into several dollars that can be used to address health care \nproblems. With an extra billion dollars a year--the goal of the REACH \nInitiative in its fifth year--health centers could be caring for an \nadditional 10 million people.\n  5. Expanding health center access would not be a government takeover \nof health care. New funding within the REACH Initiative. But this new \nfunding would not go to create a huge new government bureaucracy. \nInstead, the REACH Initiative would invest additional funds in private \norganizations that have consistently proven themselves to be efficient, \nhigh-quality, and cost-effective health care providers.\n  To me, all of these reasons point to one logical conclusion--a need \nfor drastically increased funding for health centers. Health centers \nare already helping millions of Americans get health care. But they can \nstill help millions more--pregnant women, children, and anyone else who \ndesperately needs care.\n  At the start of my remarks, I said that we were here to talk about \nand address the problem of health care access--but that's sort of a \ncold way to talk about it. So let me try again, but this time in human \nterms.\n  We're here to introduce the REACH Initiative to make sure that a \nyoung woman who has just found out she's pregnant--but who doesn't have \nhealth insurance--has a place to get prenatal care so she doesn't risk \nher health and her baby's health by waiting until late in the \npregnancy.\n  We're here to introduce the REACH Initiative to make sure that a 6-\nyear-old boy living in a heavily rural Missouri community--where there \nwouldn't otherwise be any health care providers at all--has a place to \nget regular checkups so he can stay health at home and in school.\n  We're here to make sure that a young couple without anywhere else to \ngo has a place to get their infant daughter immunized to protect her \nfrom a variety of dreaded diseases.\n  These individuals, and millions more like them, are the reasons why \nwe must make the goal of the REACH Initiative--doubled funding for \ncommunity health centers--a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S825-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 261--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n     DETENTION OF ANDREI BABITSKY BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN \n             FEDERATION AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Roth, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Dodd) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I wish to express the need to \nsupport responsible, significant, military health care reform. I \ncommend the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee and Republican \nleadership for making enactment of military health care reform a top \npriority in the Senate.\n  Our nation's military health care delivery system cries out for \nstrong, meaningful reform. The military health care delivery system is \nfacing some very unique challenges.\n  One of the critical challenges is how best to reconfigure the \nmilitary health\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\ncare delivery system so that it might continue to meet its military \nreadiness and peace-time obligations at a time of continuous change for \nour base and force structure. In the process of deciding how to \nproceed, I met with and heard from many military family members, \nveterans and military retirees from around the country. I was inundated \nwith suggestions for reform. In every meeting and every letter, I \nencountered retired service men and women who have problems with every \naspect of the military medical care system--with long waiting periods, \nwith access to the right kind of care, with access to needed \npharmaceutical drugs, and with the broken promise of lifetime health \ncare for military retirees and their spouses. I heard these concerns \nexpressed as I have traveled across the United States over the past \nseveral months.\n  My distinguished colleagues, the Republican Leader, Senator Lott, \nArmed Services Committee Chairman, Senator Warner, and Ranking Member, \nSenator Levin, introduced a bill that also addresses the military \nhealth care system. The bill is S.2087, the ``Military Health Care \nImprovements Act of 2000.'' I applaud my colleagues in rising to this \nchallenge, and I am pleased to see that portions of legislation I \nintroduced last month were included in their bill. However, I can not \ncosponsor this legislation because it does not do enough to reform the \nmilitary health care delivery system for our veterans, especially our \noldest veterans, retirees, and survivors.\n  I have several concerns with the legislation introduced yesterday.\n  One of the areas of greatest concern among military retirees and \ntheir families is the ``broken promise'' of lifetime medical care, \nespecially for those over-age 65. S. 2087 fails to meet what I think is \nthe most important requirement, the restoration of the broken promise \nof free lifetime medical care promised to retirees and their families \nwho entered the service prior to June 7, 1956. The major veteran \nservice organizations share my view that the number one priority is to \ntake care of these older military retirees and their spouses who were \npromised lifetime medical care benefits. I was proud to be an original \ncosponsor of S.2003 that restores the broken promise given to retirees \nwho entered the service prior to June 7, 1956. I pledge to work with \nthe Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services to \nfully restore the broken promise to our over-65 military retirees and \ntheir families.\n  In addition, there are some significant differences between S. 2013, \nthe ``Honoring Health Care Commitments to Service Members Past and \nPresent Act of 2000'' that I introduced in January with Senators \nCoverdell, Robb, Hagel, Jeffords and Bingaman, and the health care bill \nbeing introduced yesterday.\n  My legislation would help repair the ``broken promise'' given to \nMedicare-eligible military retirees and their families by restoring \ntheir access to military health care that was taken away when they \nturned 65. Additionally, S. 2013 offers health care options to retirees \nand would provide additional benefits to active duty servicemembers and \ntheir families. The hallmark of this legislation is that it offers \nseveral new choices to retirees and their families in their health care \ndelivery services.\n  S. 2013 was drafted with the help of The Military Coalition and The \nNational Military and Veteran's Alliance. The Military Coalition has \nstrongly endorsed S. 2013, stating, ``We applaud your leadership in \nintroducing comprehensive legislation aimed at correcting serious \ninequities in the military health care benefit.''\n  While S. 2087 promotes enrollment expansion in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program (FEHBP) demonstration for Medicare eligible \nbeneficiaries, it caps the enrollment levels to just 66,000 personnel. \nThis would preclude world-wide or even nation-wide enrollment, a \nfeature offered in my bill.\n  Additionally, S. 2087 expands TRICARE Senior Prime sites to only the \nmajor medical centers, not nation-wide like my bill. This would exclude \nhundreds of thousands of our retired servicemembers, only addressing \nthe needs of Medicare-eligible retirees and their spouses who happen to \nlive near a small number of hospitals.\n  Finally, S. 2087 only has a mail-order option for pharmacy \nrequirements of our Medicare-eligible retirees and their families and \nrequires a $150 deductible. My bill offers both a mail order and a \nretail pharmacy option. The mail order option only helps Medicare-\neligible retirees who require long-term medication like blood pressure \nbills. However, if the retiree or spouse needs medication in a timely \nmanner, it makes sense for them to be able to drive or walk to their \nlocal pharmacy and have their prescription filled. The bill I have \noffered allows for this option, The one introduced by my colleagues \nyesterday does not.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their efforts to address \nmany of these important military health care challenges. Not lost on \nany of us is the urgent need to address the over-age 65 issue since \nthere are reportedly 4,000 World War II, Korean and Vietnam War-era \nmilitary retirees dying every month. It is imperative that as changes \nare made to our nation's military force and continue to be made in the \nfuture with regard to base structure, that Congress not only stay \nfocused on bringing health care costs under control, but that steps be \ntaken to retain the health care coverage so critical to our nation's \nactive duty personnel, their families, retirees, and survivors. While \nthe world situation necessitates a modified force and base structure \ntransformed for the new millennium, it should not carry with it an \nabandonment of the responsibility that our nation has to assist those \nwho have served our country to obtain access to the health care \nservices they need.\n\n  Make no mistake, retiree health care is a readiness issue, as well. \nToday's servicemembers are acutely aware of retirees' \ndisenfranchisement from military health coverage, and exit surveys cite \nthis issue with increasing frequency as one of the factors in members' \ndecisions to leave service. In fact, a recent GAO study found that \n``access to medical and dental care in retirement'' was a significant \nsource of dissatisfaction among active duty officers in retention-\ncritical specialties.\n  I pledge to work closely with the Armed Services Committee, my \nrespected colleagues from the committee, and from both sides of the \naisle who have cosponsored my bill, as well as groups like the Military \nCoalition and the National Military Veterans Alliance, to work out our \ndifferences and not abandon the health care coverage needs of our \nnation's military retirees, their families, and survivors. We must pass \ncomprehensive military health care reform to fulfill our broken promise \nto our military retirees while bolstering retention and readiness among \ntoday's servicemembers by assuring them that retention promises will be \nfulfilled once their active service is over.\n  Mr. President, this year will be, in the words of the Joint Chiefs, \nthe year of health care reform. Whether my legislation, S. 2013--fully \nsupported by the major veteran service organizations representing over \n9 million members--is successful or not will depend on several factors: \nCongress' ability to realize real health care reform and provide the \nnecessary resources, the Pentagon's ability to work with private \nindustry to control costs on pharmaceuticals and health insurance \nplans, and the military retirees who utilize the system coming together \nand galvanizing support for the future of military health care. We can \nnot abandon the ``greatest generation'' who are responsible for the \nsuccesses and riches we currently enjoy in this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S829-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S829-S830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN MEMORY OF ``PEANUTS'' CREATOR CHARLES SCHULZ\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on February 12, we lost the \ncreator of the world's most popular comic strip, Charles Schulz. The \n``Peanuts'' comic strip was a daily staple for millions of people--not \nonly in America but around the world.\n  While Charles Schulz' legions of fans mourn the loss of his creative \ngenius, he was also a man with a wonderful family who cared deeply \nabout him. I want to express my deep sympathy to his wife, Jeanne \nSchulz, his five children (Monte, Craig, Meredith, Amy, and Jill), his \ntwo stepchildren and 18 grandchildren. Our hearts are with you.\n  For half a century, the ``Peanuts'' comic-strip has been part of the \nfabric\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\nof our national culture. Charles Schulz' illustrations have inspired us \nwith its wry humor and endearing cast of characters. Who has not been \ntouched by the trials and tribulations of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, \nLucy, and the rest of the Peanuts family?\n  Here is what some of Charles Schulz' peers had to say about his \nlegacy.\n  Rob Rogers, editorial cartoonist of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said \nof Charles Schulz' legacy to his profession:\n\n       Schulz revolutionized the comic strip. Not just with his \n     simply and accessible art style but also his strong character \n     development. He combined the innocence of childhood with the \n     cynicism of adulthood to create realistic, idiosyncratic and \n     empathetic icons.\n\n  Cartoonist Mort Walker, the creator of ``Beetle Bailey'' said of \nSchulz:\n\n       What he brought to the strips was a whole new attitude . . \n     . [He] brought in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff, \n     and somehow made it funny.\n\n  As one writer observed, Charlie Brown taught me\n\n     it's OK to lose. Losing doesn't mean giving up hope. No mater \n     how many times he missed the football, lost the big game, or \n     heard Lucy call him a blockhead, he still believed in \n     himself. This is the lesson that helped me get through \n     childhood and now helps me deal with the tangled kite strings \n     of adulthood.\n\n  Charles Schulz was born in Minneapolis, MN on November 26, 1922, and \nwas raised in St. Paul. He acquired an interest in cartooning while a \nteenager, but was drafted as an army infantryman in World War II before \nhe could fulfill his career ambition.\n  In 1947, Schulz started a feature in the St. Paul Pioneer Press \ncalled ``Li'l Folks.'' It was syndicated as Peanuts, launching an \nunprecedented 50-year run of over 18,000 comic strip installments.\n  At its peak, Peanuts appeared in close to 3,000 newspapers in 75 \ncountries and was published in over 20 different languages to more than \n355 million daily readers. Charles Schulz' television special, ``A \nCharlie Brown Christmas,'' has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, \nmore than 60 animated specials have been created based on ``Peanuts'' \ncharacters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and a hit Broadway musical \nabout the ``Peanuts'' characters also have been produced.\n  Charles Schulz' achievements are all the more remarkable because, \nthroughout his career, he had worked without any artistic assistants, \nunlike most syndicated cartoonists. Schulz painstakingly drew every \nline and frame in his comic strip for 50 years, and unparalleled \ncommitment to his art and profession.\n  In 1994, while speaking before the National Cartoonists Society, \nCharles Schulz said of his comic strip, ``There's still a market for \nthings that are clean and decent.'' Charles Schulz has given \ngenerations of children a cast of colorful characters to grow up with \nand to teach the small and large lessons of life.\n  In his farewell strip, Charles Schulz wrote, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, \nLinus, Lucy * * * how can I ever forget them * * *'' These characters \nwill stay with us forever and we will certainly never forget their \ncreator, Charles Schulz.\n  There is still something we can do for Charles Schulz and his family.\n  For the past several months, I have worked on legislation to award \nCharles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal for his outstanding career \nand community service.\n  In fact, on Thursday, February 10, just 2 days before Charles Schulz' \npassing, I formally introduced the legislation to award him the Gold \nMedal. While Charles Schulz can no longer personally receive this \nhonor, the posthumous award would be the proper gesture to his wife \nJeanne, their children, and to the millions of ``Peanuts'' fans around \nthe world.\n  As the world's preeminent cartoonist, Charles Schulz is more than \nqualified to join the 17 other Americans who have received the \nCongressional Gold Medal for their contribution to the Arts.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in posthumously awarding \nCharles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal. This would be one small \ntoken of our nation's great appreciation of this man who gave us all so \nmuch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S830-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNITION OF WIND RIVER MIDDLE SCHOOL'S MS. TRACI ECCLES\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last month I had the pleasure of \nvisiting Wind River Middle School in Stevenson, WA. One of the reasons \nwhy the students at this school excel is because of its teachers and \nthe commitment they demonstrate each day in their classrooms. One of \nthe teachers who has made a tremendous impact on the education of her \nstudents is Ms. Traci Eccles. Ms. Eccles is a dedicated professional, a \nstaff leader, a team player and most importantly, a teacher who \nencourages her students to grow. I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize Ms. Eccles' commitment to her students and award her with \nmy 32d Innovation in Education Award.\n  As a teacher of language arts to 7th and 8th grade students for more \nthan a decade, she is constantly working to improve the lives of her \nstudents. She has also teamed up with her colleagues to create school-\nwide programs on topics such as health and nutrition, student \ntolerance, and a hands-on study of the respective decades of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Six years ago, Ms. Eccles and her colleagues wanted to create more \ntolerance amongst their students and started a program to examine \nintolerance in the world and its impact. Eighth grade students must \nread a book by Elie Weisel, titled ``Night,'' that tells the stories of \nhuman suffering and degradation during the Holocaust. The students must \nalso keep journals and take part in discussions of current events.\n  Student reaction to the Tolerance Unit has been profound. At the end \nof the unit, teachers can see a much higher level of awareness among \nstudents reflected in how they treat and respond to each other. I \napplaud Ms. Eccles and her colleagues for taking the initiative and \ndeveloping a program that has impacted their students such a positive \nway.\n  In addition, Ms. Eccles took on another project to give students a \nfirst-hand look at their country's history through a program called the \nDecades Unit. The entire school is divided into different groups and \nparticipates in a week long program where students put together \nhistorical fashion shows, learn and perform popular dances of each \ndecade, and create a time-line outlining significant events in United \nStates history.\n  Ms. Eccles' great work deserves our recognition. Through their \ncreative ideas, dedication and hard work, Ms. Eccles and her fellow \nteachers have improved the lives of our children and created a greater \nsense of community and togetherness in their school.\n  My many visits to schools around Washington state have shown me that \nthe people who see our kids everyday are the ones who should have the \ngreatest say in their education. It is teachers like Ms. Eccles who are \nboth the true strength of our education system and who can prepare our \nkids with a foundation for the future. I will continue my work to give \nteachers like Ms. Eccles more freedom to innovate and improve the lives \nof our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S830-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S830-S831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATE AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in many ways, the life of Carter \nWoodson represents the history of his race in America.\n  As a young man in the late 1800s, he worked in the fields and in a \ncoal mine. He took a break from the grueling work to educate himself, \nenroll in high school and graduate after only two years of instruction. \nHe went back to the coal mines to support himself, attending school \nwhen he could, and eventually earned a doctorate in history from \nHarvard University. Mr. Woodson went on to become a passionate student \nand teacher of Black History, establishing an annual reflection on his \nculture's accomplishments and resilience: Black History Month.\n  In celebration of this month, I would like to recognize another \nleader who has worked hard to chronicle the history of people of \nAfrican heritage: Dr. James Cameron, founder of America's Black \nHolocaust Museum, located in Milwaukee. This museum is dedicated to \ndocumenting the injustices that African Americans have suffered, and to \nremind us at how far we've come as a society from the racism of the \npast.\n  Dr. Cameron, the only known living survivor of a lynch mob attack in \nthe\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\ncountry, founded America's Black Holocaust Museum in 1988 after an \ninspirational visit to the Yad Vashem Jewish Holocaust Memorial in \nIsrael--just as this museum was constructed to remind us of the \natrocities committed against Jewish people during World War II, Dr. \nCameron wanted to ensure that Americans would not forget what kind of \ninhumanity African Americans have endured.\n  Today, as I discovered on my own visit to the museum, it has grown to \nbecome a major educational and cultural center for the nation which \nthousands of people of many different backgrounds visit each year. It \nregularly hosts prominent exhibitions such as historical artifacts \ncollected from a wrecked slave ship and a Smithsonian exhibit on the \ncivil rights movement. America's Black History Museum also prepares \neducational material for teachers and worked with UW-Milwaukee to offer \nan on-site, for-credit course to undergraduate and graduate students.\n  The work of Dr. Cameron, and this month established by the hard work \nof Mr. Woodson, remind us that the protection of civil rights and civil \nliberties for all should continue to be a top priority. I strongly \nbelieve in equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, \ncreed, or gender. Everyone should have the same equal chance to get an \neducation or a job, or to own a home or live in the neighborhood of \ntheir choice. In other words, we all deserve a place at the starting \nline so that we can then use our own abilities, hard work and \ndedication to succeed in life.\n  Of course, our country has yet to fully live up to the promise of \nequal opportunity for all. While Congress tries to find ways to address \nthe crisis of discrimination, it is very important that everyone \nremember that we also have to respond on a personal level. No matter \nwhat answers Congress comes up with here in Washington, people need to \ntry to be role models and lead by example. By teaching us about the \nracial injustices of the past, celebrating the resilience of African \nAmericans and educating us about how to move forward from the prejudice \nand bias that plagues much of Black History, America's Black Holocaust \nMuseum is one such example.\n  This month, let's all take a moment to reflect on the history African \nAmericans and the many lessons that it teaches us about equality, \ndignity and harmony. The dedication of Carter Woodson and James Cameron \nto helping us remember deserves nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S831-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RETIREMENT OF SERGEANT MAJOR ANNETTE H. CASHAW\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Sergeant Major \nAnnette Cashaw who will retire from the United States Army in June \n2000, after more than 26 years of dedicated service.\n  Serving in positions of increasing trust and responsibility, Sergeant \nMajor Cashaw has displayed remarkable leadership, technical knowledge, \nand superb planning abilities throughout her entire career. Sergeant \nMajor Cashaw's exceptional abilities were notably acknowledged when she \nwas selected as the First Sergeant for the Data Systems Unit, White \nHouse Communications Agency. In addition to being responsible for 141 \njoint service personnel, she ensured that 9 million dollars in hand \nreceipt items were maintained without loss. Her direct involvement in \nmaintenance operations resulted in a net saving of over one hundred \nthousand dollars to the Army.\n  Upon completion of the Sergeant's Major Academy, Sergeant Major \nCashaw assumed the position of Sergeant Major for the Army's largest \nsoftware development organization, the Information Systems Software \nDevelopment Center at Fort Lee. Her exemplary performance of duty there \nresulted in her selection as the Secretary of the General Staff (a \nposition normally held by a Major) for the 19th Theater Army Area \nCommand in Korea.\n  Sergeant Major Cashaw culminated her career as the Sergeant Major of \nthe U.S. Army Information Systems Software Center. Her expert knowledge \nof all Army regulations and policies made her invaluable to the entire \ncommand. Soldiers benefitted from her mentoring and went on to win \nCECOM 2nd Quarter, 3rd Quarter, and 4th Quarter boards and CECOM \nsoldier of the year in 1998.\n  I am honoring Sergeant Major Cashaw on the Senate floor today as a \nway of thanking her for her faithful and honorable service to the Army \nand to the citizens of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S831-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF MARY ANAYA\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. \nMary Anaya of Roswell, New Mexico, who recently retired from the City \nCouncil after 18 years of service. As a long time resident, city \ncouncilor and community leader, Ms. Anaya has worked to better the \nRoswell community while holding true to her convictions with courage \nand grace. Though her tenacity alone is commendable, there is much more \nthat deserves recognition.\n  Ms. Anaya, who represented Ward 5, is an example of a true \nrepresentative, always putting her constituents' needs first. During \nthe time she served on the council, the people of Ward 5 could depend \non her thoughtful and considerate insight, knowing that their interests \nwere being diligently represented.\n  Roswell's Ward 5 is comprised of many of the city's low-income \nresidents. Ms. Anaya was a champion of issues her constituents faced on \na daily basis. She was an advocate of quality of life issues, such as \nhealth care, housing and community development. She worked tirelessly \nto improve primary health care, and as a result of her hard work, a \nprimary health care facility, La Casa de Buena Salud, was built in \nRoswell. Ms. Anaya was instrumental to the project's success. \nFurthermore, she spearheaded projects to rehabilitate housing for the \nelderly and low-income residents in Ward 5. Everyone deserves decent \nhousing, and many of the citizens of Ward 5 benefitted from Ms. Anaya's \nwork for this right. The creation of recreational areas was an issue \nthat she dedicated much of her time to, making places for the \ncommunity's children to play. She also worked to improve the city's \ninfrastructure, making the streets safer for the entire Roswell \ncommunity. Ms. Anaya always worked on behalf of the citizens of \nRoswell, and it is clear that because of her dedication, many people \nlive a better life.\n  As a council member, Ms. Anaya was an advocate for Hispanic causes. \nWhen an English-only speaking rule in the school system threatened the \neducational opportunities of the students, Ms. Anaya rose to overturn \nthe rule. She also fought to increase the hiring of Hispanics by the \nCity of Roswell, and her efforts were rewarded when the City hired \ntheir first Hispanic employee. As the Roswell Daily Record states: \n``Many people believe that over 50 years she and her husband, Pete, \nhave helped advance Hispanic causes in Roswell more than anyone else in \nthe city and have done it in a positive, productive way. We agree.''\n  Mary Anaya deserves special recognition for her steadfast work on \nbehalf of the citizens of Roswell. She performed her civic duties with \npride and joy, always working with a smile. On the council, she was an \nasset to Roswell, and as a citizen, she is an asset to us all. Her work \nwill be appreciated for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S831-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S831-S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL TRIO DAY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' \nattention to the celebration of National TRIO Day. National TRIO Day \nwas designated by concurrent resolution on February 24, 1986, by the \n99th Congress and is celebrated on the last Saturday of February each \nyear as a day of recognition for the Federal TRIO Program.\n  The Federal TRIO Program--consisting of the Talent Search, Upward \nBound, Upward Bound Math/Science, Veterans Upward Bound, Student \nSupport Services, Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement \nProgram, and Educational Achievement Centers--was established over 30 \nyears ago to assist low-income students overcome class, social, and \ncultural barriers to higher education.\n  Currently, 2,000 colleges, universities, and community agencies \nsponsor TRIO Programs, and over 780,000 low-income students between the \nages of 11 and 27 benefit from the services of the TRIO Programs. Most \ncome from families in\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nwhich neither parent graduated from college. These students, motivated \nby their hopes and aspirations, are living symbols of the American \ndream. Helping to lift them out of poverty benefits not only benefits \nthe students themselves, but our entire nation.\n  There are 62 TRIO Programs in Wisconsin and I have seen these \nprograms work at the local level. One inspirational story involves Dr. \nLo from La Crosse, Wisconsin. As a child, Dr. Lo fled a refugee camp in \nwar-torn Laos with his family and came to live in Wisconsin. Dr. Lo, \nwith hard work and the benefit of two TRIO programs, graduated from UW-\nLa Crosse with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology and went on to \nearn a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from Bastyr University in \nSeattle, Washington. He returned to Wisconsin to contribute to the La \nCrosse community through private practice at the La Crosse Natural \nHealth Center, Habitat for Humanity Family Selection Committee, and as \na member of the Equal Opportunity Commission for the city of La Crosse.\n  There is no limit to what TRIO participants can accomplish. Program \ngraduates have become successful in all spheres of society and have \ngone on to enjoy careers as doctors, lawyers, astronauts, television \nreporters, actors, state politicians and Members of Congress, to list a \nfew. Indeed, two of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Henry Bonilla and Representative Albert R. Wynn are \ngraduates of the TRIO Programs.\n  I have long supported TRIO and will continue to push for increased \nfunding for these important programs. I am proud to celebrate National \nTRIO Day and call much deserved attention to these vital programs. I \nalso encourage my colleagues to visit the TRIO Programs in their states \nand learn for themselves how successful these programs are for our \nNation's students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S832-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 83 submitted by \nmyself and Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 83) commending the \n     people of Iran for their commitment to the democratic process \n     and positive political reform on the occasion of Iran's \n     parliamentary elections.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate voted on H.R. \n1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. That bill will shortly be \nvoted on by the House and sent to the President. I hope he will sign it \nbecause it is an important signal that the United States will not \ntolerate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means \nof delivering them. We will not tolerate trafficking in missiles and \nthe technology with which to build them. I believe that is an important \nsignal for us to send.\n  I also think it is important we recognize what took place this week \nin Iran. This threat occurred, but in the midst of this, 80 percent of \nthe people in Iran turned out to vote. They are not interested in the \nentrenched policies of Ayatollah Khomeini and his harsh legacy. \nReformers dominated in the polls. Despite the best efforts of the \nhardline clerical institutions to disqualify and intimidate popular \ncandidates, the Iranian people had the courage of their convictions. \nThey want economic liberalization, they want freedom of the press, and \nthey want personal liberty.\n  We in the United States obviously share those convictions and are \nobviously heartened by what took place at the polls this week in Iran. \nIt should be noted and applauded, and this resolution does just that.\n  We say to the Iranian people: Congratulations. Thank you. This is a \ngood step in moving forward. At the same time, we want to say we will \nnot tolerate weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering \nthese weapons. We want to send those clear signals.\n  There is another thing which is going on in Iran. Earlier today, I \nhad a press conference with several other people about three men--Sirus \nZabihi-Moghaddam, Hedayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, and Manuchehr Khulusi--\nthree Baha'is who are on death row in prison facing imminent execution \nfor the simple reason of practicing their faith. That is it. They are \non death row facing imminent death for daring to practice their faith.\n  This cannot be tolerated. There are nearly 300,000 Baha'is in Iran. \nIt is the largest religious minority in the country. They have suffered \ncontinuous persecution for their peaceful beliefs. I remind the Iranian \npeople who have voted for freedom this week that this is part of it. \nThis is also something they have signed on to.\n  Nearly 50 years ago, the General Assembly of the United Nations--of \nwhich Iran is a member--adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. Since that time, this Universal Declaration has become the \nbedrock document for human rights. However, the Iranian Government \ncontinues to be an egregious violator.\n  I wish to read one portion of this document. Article 18 of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights states:\n\n       Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience \n     and religion; this right includes freedom to change his \n     religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community \n     with others and in public or private, to manifest his \n     religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and \n     observance.\n\n  This hour, I call on the Government of Iran--from whom the people of \nIran, by their clear vote this week, are seeking change--to ensure the \nsafety of these three individuals.\n  This hour, I call for the release of these individuals--Sirus Zabihi-\nMoghaddam, Hedayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, and Manuchehr Khulusi--whose \nonly crime was a sincere expression of their faith, which is a \nuniversal fundamental right.\n  Most importantly, I call upon the Government of Iran to provide \nfreedom of religion to its people--who are yearning for change, as \nwitnessed by the vote this week--including their peaceful yet \nbrutalized Baha'is community. I ask for their freedom to express their \nfaith as they see fit.\n  Our resolution is in addition to the bill that passed earlier today. \nIt congratulates the Iranian people and says: Let's take other steps \nforward. No weapons of mass destruction. But, also, let's recognize \nreligious freedom, as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \nwhich the Iranian Government has signed on to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution, S. Con. \nRes. 83, be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related to \nthe concurrent resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Con. Res. 83) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 83\n\n       Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran held parliamentary \n     elections on February 18, 2000;\n       Whereas more than 75 percent of the approximately \n     39,000,000 eligible voters cast ballots in the elections;\n       Whereas preliminary results indicate that reformers have \n     won a parliamentary majority, freeing Iran's parliament, the \n     Majlis, of hard-line domination for the first time since the \n     1979 Iranian revolution;\n       Whereas reformers won elections despite concerted efforts \n     by hard-line Iranian clergy to ban reformist forces from the \n     ballot; and\n       Whereas the elections show a clear preference by a majority \n     of Iranian voters for democracy, rule of law, and improved \n     relations with Western nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the people of Iran for their commitment to the \n     democratic process;\n       (2) congratulates reformist parliamentarians on their \n     recent electoral victory;\n       (3) reaffirms the desire of the United States to see free, \n     democratic political development, the restoration of the rule \n     of law, and full civil and political rights for all Iranians; \n     and\n       (4) calls on the Government of Iran to rejoin the community \n     of nations and renounce terrorism, opposition to the Middle \n     East\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\n     peace process, and the development and acquisition of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S833-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S833-S834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DETENTION OF ANDREI BABITSKY BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN \n             FEDERATION AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 261, submitted \nearlier by Senators Helms, Biden, Roth, Lott, and Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 261) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the detention of Andrei Babitsky by the \n     Government of the Russian Federation and freedom of the press \n     in Russia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the past 5 months the Government of \nRussia has waged a brutal war against Chechnya. The Kremlin's \nindiscriminate use of force has left countless thousands of innocents \ndead and hundreds of thousands homeless on the icy plains and in the \nsnow-covered mountains of the Caucasus.\n  We all have seen the photos of Grozny, a city subjected to a travesty \nnot witnessed in Europe since the siege of Stalingrad and the leveling \nof Warsaw in World War II. Indeed, what has been done to Grozny \nsurpasses even the havoc Milosevic wrought upon the towns and cities of \nBosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. It is difficult to believe, but it is \ntrue.\n  In a time when Western Governments have turned a blind eye to this \nconflict, the ability of journalists to report objectively on the \nhorrors of this war becomes all the more important to the effort to \nbring an end to this violence and establish a just peace.\n  Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to recognize this only too \nwell. As a consequence, freedom of the press, a cornerstone of \ndemocracy, has become another victim of his government and his war \nagainst Chechnya.\n  Mr. President, the Russian government is today systematically \ncensoring the press and attempting to use it to disseminate \nmisinformation about public events. Journalists in Russia who report on \nthe war and other matters in a manner contradicting the Putin \nGovernment do so at great risk. They are subject to intimidation, \nharassment, detention, and even violence by Russian authorities.\n  In one recent case, Russian police attempted to arrest a journalist \nand send him off to a psychiatric hospital, a ghoulish effort \nreminiscent of Putin's not to distant career in the Soviet KGB.\n  Nowhere has this suppression of the free press become more blatant \nand cruel than in the case of Andrei Babitsky, a ten year veteran \njournalist of our own Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.\n  Babitsky courageously and objectively covered the 1994-1996 Russo-\nChechen war as well as the current conflict. For his accounts of the \natrocities committed by Russian military and the resilience of the \nChechen resistance, he has paid an extremely high price.\n  In mid-January, he was seized in Chechnya by Russian forces and \ndetained. That is the last heard from him directly.\n  The Russian Government's response to inquiries about Babitsky's \nhealth and whereabouts have been contradictory and dismissive.\n  After nearly three weeks of asserting that Babitsky had not been \ndetained, that he was about to be freed--and, indeed, that he had been \nfreed, a Kremlin spokesman summarily announced on February 3 that his \ngovernment exchanged Babitsky for three Russian prisoners of war held \nby the Chechen resistance.\n  Chechen authorities deny that such an exchange ever took place. And, \nthe Kremlin has not provided one iota of credible evidence backing its \nversion of events. Today, the fate of Andrei Babitsky remains unknown. \nHe is a father with a loving and courageous wife and two children. We \nmust pray that Babitsky will return safely to his family.\n  Mr. President, it is with Andrei Babitsky in mind, I, along with \nSenator Biden, the Majority Leader, and Senator Roth, send to the desk \na resolution concerning the state of freedom of press in Russia. This \nresolution recounts the facts as we know them in the case of Andrei \nBabitsky, and it underscores that his detention and disappearance are \nnot isolated incidents but part of the Russian government's broader and \nsystematic repression of the press.\n  It expresses our belief that--and at that this point I shall read the \nconcluding elements of the pending resolution:\n\n       (1) The detention of Andrei Babitsky by the Government of \n     Russia and the misinformation it has issued concerning this \n     matter constitute reprehensible treatment of a civilian in a \n     conflict zone, in violation of the principles set forth in \n     Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, and demonstrate the \n     [Russian] Government's intolerance toward a free and open \n     press;\n       (2) The conduct by the Government of Russia leaves it \n     responsible for the safety of Andrei Babitsky;\n       (3) The Government of Russia should take steps to secure \n     the safe return of RFE/RL reporter Andrei Babitsky to his \n     family;\n       (4) The Government of Russia should provide a full \n     accounting of Mr. Babitsky's detention and the charges he \n     faced; and\n       (5) The Russian authorities should immediately halt its \n     harassment of journalists, foreign and domestic, who cover \n     the war in Chechnya and any other event in the Russian \n     Federation and should fully adhere to the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights which declares in Article 19 that \n     ``everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and \n     expression; this right includes the freedom to hold opinions \n     without interference and to seek, receive and impart \n     information and ideas through any media and regardless of \n     frontiers.''\n\n  No principle lies deeper in the heart of democracy than the right to \nfree speech. And the embodiment of that principle is a free press. Not \nonly is freedom of the press a cornerstone of democracy, it is a key \ncatalyst of democratic reform. Russia will not become a democracy if \nthe Kremlin continues to repress, intimidate, harass, and brutalize \nthose journalists who do not share its point view. Our ability to help \nRussia evolve into a democracy cannot be effective if we ignore such \nsystematic repression of the press.\n  I call upon my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n  Allow me to close on one point related to the disappearance of Andrei \nBabitsky, freedom of the press in Russia and the relationship between \nWashington and Moscow.\n  It has become public knowledge that some in these two capitals \ncontemplate a summit meeting in the near future between President \nClinton and President Vladimir Putin. If our government is serious \nabout determining the facts surrounding Andrei Babitsky's fate, if our \ngovernment is serious about protecting other journalists from such \nabuse, and if our government is serious about promoting democratic \nreform in Russia, the administration will promptly dismiss such \nproposed summits until Putin has provided a full and credible \naccounting of Babitsky's detention and his current whereabouts.\n  It is premature to consider summit meetings at a time when the \nRussian government remains contemptuously dismissive of Babitsky and \nour concerns about his safety, not to mention the international \ncommunity's call for a just peace in Chechnya.\n  The administration has repeatedly stated that the Kremlin will \nisolate itself through its barbaric conduct in Chechnya. Now is the \ntime for the administration to live up to its own words.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, in supporting a resolution \nregarding Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for Radio Liberty, who has been \nmissing in Russia since January.\n  Mr. Babitsky is a veteran reporter for Radio Liberty, the U.S.-funded \nradio broadcasting organization based in Prague. He has reported on \nRussia for over a decade, and reported on the Russo-Chechen war from \n1994 to 1996 and over the past several months.\n  In mid-January, Mr. Babitsky disappeared in Chechnya. Since then, \nRussian officials have issued contradictory statements about Mr. \nBabitsky's whereabouts and well-being. On January 26, a Russian \npresidential spokesman stated that Babitsky ``left Grozny and then \ndisappeared,'' and that Russian officials had no knowledge of his\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nwhereabouts. Two days later, Russian authorities acknowledged to \nofficials from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Mr. Babitsky had \nbeen detained, but that he would soon be released. Just a few days \nafter that, Russian officials stated that, instead of being released, \nMr. Babitsky had been handed to Chechen rebels in exchange for three \nRussian prisoners of war.\n  It is now late February. Mr. Babitsky still has not been heard from, \nand the Russian government has yet to provide a credible accounting of \nhis whereabouts.\n  The actions and statements of the Government of the Russian \nFederation are deeply troubling, not only because of what they may mean \nfor Mr. Babitsky's well-being, but for what they may portend about the \nfreedom of the press in Russia today. Mr. Babitsky is a journalist, \nworking for an American-supported news organization. His detention by \nthe Russian authorities, and his reported exchange with the Chechens, \nviolates fundamental norms embodied in the Geneva Conventions and \napplicable protocols. Equally troubling, the detention and mistreatment \nof a working journalist is a chilling indication that the Government of \nthe Russian Federation is not committed to a fundamental human right: \nfreedom of the press. These are not just the words of one United States \nSenator. In Russia itself, a leading journalists' union has stated that \nthe Babitsky case is ``not an isolated episode, but almost a turning \npoint in the struggle for a press that serves society and not the \nauthorities.''\n  Several weeks ago, the chairman and I wrote to Acting President Putin \nand urged Mr. Babitsky's release. Several other senators and members of \nthe other body have expressed similar views. Additionally, the \nSecretary of State has raised this matter with senior Russian \nofficials. In Russia, Europe and the United States, there has been \nuniversal condemnation of the Russian Government for its actions in \nthis matter.\n  Today we have decided to call additional attention to Mr. Babitsky's \nplight by introducing this sense of the Senate resolution, which \ncriticizes the Government of the Russian Federation for its actions in \nthe Babitsky matter and calls on Moscow to provide a full accounting of \nhis detention.\n  I hope it will get the attention of the Russian Government. I hope it \nwill help lead to the truth about the whereabouts of Mr. Babitsky. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 261) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 261\n\n       Whereas Andrei Babitsky, a dedicated and professional \n     journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) for \n     the last 10 years, reported on the 1994-1996 and the current \n     Russo-Chechen wars;\n       Whereas on December 27, 1999, the Russian Information \n     Committee (RIC) in Chechnya accused Babitsky of ``conspiracy \n     with Chechen rebels'' after he broadcast a story that shed \n     unfavorable light on Russian military actions in Chechnya;\n       Whereas on January 8, 2000, Russian security agents raided \n     Babitsky's apartment in Moscow and confiscated several items \n     and later ordered his wife, Ludmila Babitskaya, to report to \n     a local militia station in Moscow after she attempted to pick \n     up photographs taken by her husband in Chechnya;\n       Whereas on January 18, 2000, Babitsky was reportedly \n     detained by Russian authorities in Moscow but later reports \n     indicated that he was not formally arrested until January 27, \n     2000;\n       Whereas on January 26, 2000, Russian presidential spokesman \n     Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Babitsky ``left Grozny and \n     then disappeared'' and declared that Russian security \n     services had no idea as to his whereabouts and that ``his \n     security is not guaranteed'';\n       Whereas on January 28, 2000, Russian media officials told \n     RFE/RL that Babitsky would be released with apologies after \n     having been charged with participating in ``an illegal armed \n     formation'';\n       Whereas on February 2, 2000, Moscow officials announced \n     that Babitsky would be transferred from Naursky district near \n     Chechnya to Gudermes and then to Moscow where he would then \n     be released on his own recognizance;\n       Whereas on February 3, 2000, Russian presidential spokesman \n     Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Russian officials exchanged \n     Babitsky for 3 Russian prisoners of war and on the same day, \n     Vladimir Ustinov, acting Russian prosecutor general, said \n     Babitsky had been released and had gone over to the Chechens \n     on his own accord;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     repeatedly issued contradictory statements on the detention \n     of Andrei Babitsky and provided neither a credible accounting \n     of its detention of Babitsky nor any credible evidence of his \n     well-being;\n       Whereas United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     Mary Robinson stated on February 16 that Russian behavior in \n     Chechnya and the detention of Andrei Babitsky appears to \n     violate the Geneva conventions to which Russia is a \n     signatory;\n       Whereas on February 16, 2000, Russian Human Rights \n     Commissioner Oleg Mironov denounced Moscow's handling of \n     Babitsky as a violation of Russian law and international law \n     and stated that the situation surrounding Babitsky signals \n     ``that the same thing may happen to every reporter'';\n       Whereas the Union of Journalists in Russia declared on \n     February 16 that the case of Andrei Babitsky is ``not an \n     isolated episode, but almost a turning point in the struggle \n     for a press that serves society and not the authorities'' and \n     that ``the threat to freedom of speech in Russia has for the \n     first time in the last several years transformed into its \n     open and regular suppression'';\n       Whereas freedom of the press is both a central element of \n     democracy as well as a catalyst for democratic reform;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     repeatedly violated the principles of freedom of the press by \n     subjecting journalists who question or oppose its policies to \n     censorship, intimidation, harassment, incarceration, and \n     violence; by restricting beyond internationally accepted \n     limits their access to information; and by issuing misleading \n     and false information; and\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     egregiously restricted the efforts of journalists to report \n     on the indiscriminate brutality of Russia's use of force in \n     Chechnya: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the detention of Andrei Babitsky by the Government of \n     the Russian Federation and the misinformation the Government \n     of the Russian Federation has issued concerning this matter--\n       (A) constitute reprehensible treatment of a civilian in a \n     conflict zone in violation of the Geneva Conventions and \n     applicable protocols;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 262, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 262) entitled ``Peaceful Resolution \n     of the Conflict in Chechnya.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 262\n\n       Whereas the people of Chechnya are exercising the \n     legitimate right of self-defense against the indiscriminate \n     use of force by the Government of the Russian Federation;\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has used \n     disproportionate force in the bombings of civilian targets in \n     Chechnya which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of \n     innocent civilians and the displacement of well over 250,000 \n     others;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     refused to engage in negotiations with the Chechen resistance \n     toward a just peace and instead has charged Chechen President \n     Aslan Maskhadov with armed mutiny and issued a warrant for \n     his arrest;\n       Whereas Russian authorities deny access to regions in and \n     around Chechnya by the international community, including \n     officials of the United Nations, Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, and \n     maintain a virtual ban on access to Chechen civilians by \n     media and international humanitarian organizations, including \n     the International Federation of the Red Cross;\n       Whereas these restrictions severely limited the ability of \n     these organizations to ascertain the extent of the \n     humanitarian crisis and to provide humanitarian relief;\n       Whereas even limited testimony and general investigation by \n     international organizations credibly reported widespread \n     looting, summary executions, detentions, denial of safe \n     passage to fleeing civilians, torture and rape committed by \n     Russian soldiers;\n       Whereas there are credible reports of specific atrocities \n     committed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, including the \n     rampages in Alkhan-Yurt where 17 persons were killed in \n     December 1999 and in the Staropromyslovsky district of Grozny \n     where 44 persons were killed in December 1999; and the rapes \n     of Chechen prisoners in the Chernokosovo detention camp;\n       Whereas these credible reports indicate clear violations of \n     international human rights standards and law that must be \n     investigated, and those responsible must be held accountable; \n     and\n       Whereas United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     Mary Robinson proposed on February 20, 2000, the prosecution \n     of Russian military commanders for overseeing ``executions, \n     tortures, and rapes''; and\n       Whereas the Senate expresses its concern over the conflict \n     and humanitarian tragedy in Chechnya, and its desire for a \n     peaceful resolution and durable settlement to the conflict: \n     Now, therefore, be it.\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government of the Russian Federation--\n       (A) immediately cease its military operations in Chechnya \n     and initiate negotiations toward a just peace with the \n     leadership of the Chechen Government, including President \n     Aslan Maskhadov;\n       (B) allow into and around Chechnya international missions \n     to monitor and report on the situation there and to \n     investigate alleged atrocities and war crimes;\n       (C) allow international humanitarian agencies immediate \n     full and unimpeded access to Chechen civilians, including \n     those in refugee, detention and so called ``filtration \n     cramps'' or any other facility where citizens of Chechnya are \n     detained; and\n       (D) investigate fully the atrocities committed in Chechnya \n     including those alleged in Alkhan-Yurt, and Grozny, and \n     initiate prosecutions against those officers and soldiers \n     accused.\n       (2) the President of the United States of America--\n       (A) should promote peace negotiations between the \n     Government of the Russian Federation and the leadership of \n     the Chechen Government, including President Aslan Mashkadov, \n     through third party mediation by the OSCE, United Nations or \n     other appropriate parties;\n       (B) endorse the call of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights for an investigation of alleged \n     war crimes committed by the Russian military in Chechnya; and\n       (C) should take tangible steps to demonstrate to the \n     Government of the Russian Federation that the United States \n     strongly condemns its brutal conduct in Chechnya and its \n     unwillingness to find a just political solution to the \n     conflict in Chechnya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/24/senate-section/article/S835-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 824\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
