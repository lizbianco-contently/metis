The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 1 \nminute, the time not taken from either side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, also for the advice of our colleagues, the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and I continued work on the managers' \npackage, which we worked on over the weekend, last night, and we will \nbe prepared to present that fairly soon.\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Utah for just a \nmoment, I suspect what we would probably do at that time, when it is \nprepared, is to move to set aside other things so we could do that and \ngo forward with it.\n  I mention this because several Senators had asked about where it \nwas--it is a complex thing--to help make sure we get the drafting all \nright.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think we are just about done with the \ndrafting of it. I know staff on both the minority and the majority side \nare finishing that up as we speak, so I agree\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nwith the Senator. When we get that finally done, we will interrupt \neverything and set matters aside so we can pass the managers' \namendment.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is prepared to \noffer his amendment again. Could I ask the other side, how many further \ngun amendments are we going to have? I would at least like to know.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator asks a legitimate question. That is why I \nasked about the managers' package. Some are holding to see where the \nmanagers' package goes, and it will probably depend upon what happens \nwith the amendment of the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey.\n  Let me try to get a more specific answer. That does not answer the \nquestion of the Senator from Utah. As this debate starts--we are \nrunning some traplines now--I will try to get that answer for the \nSenator as quickly as I can.\n  Mr. HATCH. The reason I bring that up is we have had enough time on \ngun amendments, it seems to me. There has been a lot of getting \ntogether, and I have helped to lead that. I think it is about time we \nget on to the rest of this bill, which is much more important than the \ngun aspect of this bill. There is a huge number of things we do in this \nbill to try to stop juvenile crime in this country, and especially \nviolent juvenile crime. This bill will help to alleviate that. So I \nwant to finish the bill, and I think we ought to do the very best we \ncan to do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I would note that we had a list \nof over 90 amendments entered under a consent agreement last Friday. We \nhave pared that back to about a dozen or less. So we are making \nsignificant progress. I think what we want to do is make sure as \namendments are coming up, the few that are left, Senators are not \nblocked by objection, as the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, was \nyesterday, or Senator Lautenberg last Friday.\n  Now we can move on. We have gone from 90 down to about a dozen. The \nmanagers' package is making a lot of that possible. Again, I commend \nthe Senator from Utah for his work on this, and we should continue.\n  But while the Senator from New Jersey is debating his amendment, I \nwill try to get a clearer answer for the Senator from Utah.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say one other thing. This is an \namendment that has already been debated, and it was defeated. So it is \ncoming back again substantially in the same form.\n  Now, I was told yesterday that the minority believes they have \nnarrowed their amendments down to about eight. As I understood it, they \nfigured they would have three more gun amendments, including this, and \npossibly a fourth.\n  All we want to know is how many are we going to have and what are \nthey so we are sure of what is going to come up. But in all honesty, I \ndo not want to just keep debating the same subject over and over when \nwe have made real honest and decent efforts to try to resolve these \nproblems.\n  Be that as it may, I would like to know, as soon as I can, just \nexactly how many more gun amendments we are going to have to put up \nwith or are we going to do the rest of the bill. Are we going to get \nsomething seriously done about juvenile crime or are we going to make \npolitical points in the Chamber, to the extent Senators think they are \nmaking them?\n  That is what I am concerned about. I would like to pass this bill \nwhich will make a real difference on accountability, making kids who \ncommit violent acts responsible for their actions. For the first time, \nwe actually have prevention moneys, more than accountability moneys. We \nare doing something about the cultural problems in this society--not \nsomething, a whole lot about the cultural problems--that really will \nwork if we can just get this bill passed. Of course, we are going to \nget tougher on violent juveniles in the sentencing phase and a number \nof other ways from a law enforcement standpoint.\n  We have spent most of our time in the last 6 days--now 7 days--on gun \namendments. We have made a real effort to try to accommodate people on \nthe other side--and some on our own side--to resolve these matters. I \nthink we have largely resolved them. Be that as it may, we will go on \nfrom here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, I ask consent not to have my time \ncome from anybody else.\n  We are making progress. As I said, we had 90 possible amendments \nentered as a consent agreement last Friday. We pared that back to a \ndozen or less. The distinguished Senator from Utah said over the \nweekend that it appeared they would need about seven from their side. \nThey offered four. That leaves about three more.\n  I point out that sometimes this debate is wise. When the Craig \namendment first came up, the Senator from New Jersey, the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, and I came on the floor and said there were some \nvery serious problems with it, that part of the drafting was left out, \nthat it did things different from what the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCraig, had said it did. We were told by the Senator from Idaho that we \nwere flatout wrong, that there was no such thing. It was a good \namendment. It was adopted, then, on virtually a party line vote.\n  The next day, as soon as the press had analyzed it, they found \nexactly what the Senator from New York and I had said was accurate, \nthat what the Senator from Idaho said was not accurate. There was a \ngreat flapdoodle over it--that is from the early unpublished \nJefferson's ``Manual on Parliamentary Procedure,'' I tell Mr. Dove, the \nParliamentarian.\n  It comes back again now, redrafted. And then, after that, it was \npointed out that there were other errors, and we were told again we \nwere wrong. A third part of the draft is coming back. Frankly, Mr. \nPresident, sometimes the debate takes a little bit longer if amendments \ndo not do what the sponsors say they do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 362\n\n        (Purpose: To regulate the sale of firearms at gun shows)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from \nVermont.\n  I particularly pay a note of respect to our colleague from Utah, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and the manager on the Republican \nside, for this juvenile justice bill. I know how anxious he is to \neffect a compromise that permits us to move ahead with legislation \nwhich is constructive. I have never known him to obstruct for the sake \nof obstruction. I appreciate his interest in moving this bill, as we \nall would like to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendments and send a compromise gun show amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, I did not hear.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator restate his \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Surely. I first paid extensive compliments to the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There was no objection to that part.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to hear that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Did I hear an objection from the Senator from \nVermont?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I understand what the unanimous consent request is?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what I want to do is to see if we can \npresent a compromise position that takes care of some of the problems \nwhich still exist after we passed the Craig-Hatch amendment, which \ndiffers from my original language to an extent that I think makes it \nmore palatable to our friends on the other side. I would be happy to \ndiscuss those as I go through my presentation on the amendment. It is \nobvious that we want to do what we can.\n\n  While the Senator from Utah was occupied, I did say that I have never \nknown him to obstruct for the purpose of obstruction but, rather, to \neffect change. I think it is fair to say there is a significant amount \nof interest on the Republican side in the changes we have made to try \nto limit the definition of gun shows, to try to make certain we have \nnot increased the bureaucratic or the regulatory requirements such that \nsubstantially more paperwork is involved. We are not attempting to keep\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nfiles open on people for whom there is no discredited information, \nchanges of that nature.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Utah and other Members of the \nSenate will look at what we have and give us a chance to have a review \nof it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair notes that under the \nprevious order, the Senator has the right to send his amendment to the \ndesk, and the Chair does not interpret the unanimous consent request to \nbe anything other than that. Does that clarify the situation?\n  Mr. HATCH. His amendment will go in order after the amendments that \nwere----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. The Chair does not \ninterpret the unanimous consent request to change the order of the \npresentation of the amendments. It does interpret the request simply to \nbe to present the Senator's amendment at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. The reason I was concerned is that we set these in order \nby unanimous consent. I had to go to great lengths to get that done. \nThat is fine with me, if that is the understanding.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment numbered 362.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 362) is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank, again, the Senators from Utah and Vermont.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield? Could we have a \ncopy of the amendment. It is certainly nice to know what is going on. \nThat is what I am concerned about. If we are going to have amendments, \nI at least want to know what they are, because I have gone to great \nlengths to try to bring both sides together. I don't want to be blind-\nsided by amendments at the last minute here. I would like to at least \nknow what is in this amendment. I think I have a pretty good idea, but \nI would like to know.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Utah, \nthere is no intent to offer anything that hasn't been discussed or \nanything that is a radical change that further limits the activities of \nlegitimate transactions at a gun show.\n  This amendment which I send up now has been joined in its origination \nby Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. He has signed on as a cosponsor. \nHis input has been truly valuable in crafting a workable proposal. He \ncomes from a largely rural State where guns are a significant part of \nthe State's culture. I really appreciate his strong support of my \namendment.\n  This amendment is offered in a bipartisan fashion to finally close \nthe gun show loophole. I think it is time for us to come to an \nagreement on the gun show debate. It is very much in the minds of the \npublic. There was a poll just done, an ABC-Washington Post poll, which \nsaid, in response to the question, Would you support or oppose a law \nrequiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows? the \nsupport level was 89 percent. So it does not leave a lot of room for \ndoubt.\n  Last week the Senate did cast two votes on different gun show \nproposals. My amendment was defeated by a slim majority of 51 votes. \nObviously, we had Republican support. There were several absences, \nprimarily from the Democratic side, people were called away, some for \nemergencies and illness. And after our amendment was defeated, a couple \nof days later, the Hatch-Craig amendment was offered, and it passed by \nonly one vote, with five Senators not voting; there were a total of 95 \nvotes cast. The result was 48-47. So we are obviously in the same \nballpark when it comes to thinking about what ought to happen. People \nare very wary and upset by the fact that guns can be purchased without \nany identification of the buyer. I call it ``buyers anonymous.'' The \npublic is in obvious distress about the way things have been done in \nthe past.\n\n  We are not going to interrupt the process whereby people who are not \nfelons and are of sound mind can buy a gun. We are not looking to \ninterrupt the process of the interested purchaser in buying a gun. But \nwe know that, just as with other transactions--vehicles, for instance--\nthere is a recognition of who is buying a vehicle. The same thing ought \nto be true when we talk about guns.\n  So that is what brings us to the position we are in. I asked several \nSenators who were leaning to my position to make any suggestions as to \nhow we could improve the amendment that I originally offered. This new \nversion that we have sent to the desk reflects the suggestions of both \nRepublicans and Democrats. First, the definition of ``gun show'' is \nmodified. I have actually taken language from the Hatch-Craig amendment \nand included it. I point that out because I want to try to effect a \nconsensus, and that is why we have included this language from the \nHatch-Craig amendment in this revised version.\n  Now, my new language clarifies that we are only talking about events \nwhere firearms are exhibited and offered for sale. We are not talking \nabout transactions between individuals or neighbors.\n  The second change that we have made would clarify what qualifies as a \nfirearm sale or transaction. When drafting my original amendment, in \norder to prevent people from circumventing the background check by \ncompleting a sale outside the gun show that actually began in the show, \nbut is completed, for instance, in the parking lot, we wanted to close \nthat loophole. So while the original amendment defined ``firearms \ntransaction'' fairly broadly to cover any transaction that started in a \ngun show but was completed outside, we wanted to define that a little \nmore openly so some disagreement that occurred would perhaps have a \nchance to note the changes that were made and would encourage them to \njoin in with us and pass this legislation. Some of my colleagues have \nsuggested the original language was too broad, so I have narrowed it to \nensure that legitimate gun sellers are not subject to penalties.\n  Additionally, during the course of the debate, some of my opponents \nhave suggested that my amendment would lead to a national registry of \ngun owners. My amendment had nothing remotely resembling a national \nregistry. It simply required gun sales to go through an existing \nnational instant criminal background check system.\n  The problem is that some who oppose any kind of gun owner \nidentification as a new purchaser have always opposed the criminal \nbackground check system. They argue that it is the first step toward a \nnational registry of firearm owners. They raise the specter of a \nnational registry because they want to scare people away from \nreasonable, commonsense gun proposals.\n  Well, we are going to make certain that doesn't happen, because I \nbelieve there is no basis for that argument. I have made a modification \nto try to deal with that issue once and for all.\n\n  My amendment would change the Brady law to prevent the Federal \nGovernment from keeping any records on qualified purchasers--in other \nwords, law-abiding citizens who are allowed to buy a gun--for more than \n90 days. After 90 days, they have to scrap it if it has no value. The \nperson is not discredited in any way, has no criminal record, has no \nproblem with violence, has not been noted for violent behavior, has not \nhad any serious mental disorder, and we are satisfied to have those \nrecords expunged after 90 days because there is no value to them, for \none thing, and, secondly, it seems to suggest that what we want to have \nis, again, a registry on everybody. That is not the case.\n  Mr. President, law-abiding citizens don't have anything to worry \nabout. After 90 days, they can be absolutely sure that there will be no \nGovernment record of their gun transactions whatsoever.\n  Finally, Senator Kerrey, Senator Schumer, Senator Boxer, Senator \nKennedy, and I worked to streamline the requirements for gun show \npromoters. My revised amendment eliminates all unnecessary paperwork \nand bureaucratic redtape that was purportedly contained in the original \nLautenberg amendment. The reason I say ``purportedly,'' is because that \nis the way some\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\nof our colleagues on the other side interpret it. Well, I want to make \nsure that the record is clear and, thus, we were truly circumspect in \nthe way we asked for this data to be presented and for this amendment \nto be offered.\n  I thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have helped me work \non these issues. This is a compromise from my original position, but my \nmission is to accomplish the goal, and the goal very simply is to \nsatisfy the American people. It is not just curiosity; it is fear; it \nis concern; it is their belief that anybody who buys a gun ought not to \nbe anonymous in that purchase, especially when we know that so many of \nthose transactions have occurred at gun shows. So that is the purpose \nof this change. We need this amendment to close the gun show loopholes \nonce and for all.\n  Now, although the Hatch-Craig amendment may have generated a well-\nintentioned effort to address the gun show loophole, it did create \nadditional problems. If we leave the language in this bill as it \npresently is with the Hatch-Craig amendment, our gun laws are actually \ngoing to be weaker. I know that is not the intention of the authors, \nnor is it the desire of the American people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, thank you very much for giving the \nSenate a chance to undo the damage that it did by not voting for the \nLautenberg amendment in the first place and then adopting some \namendments that have problems. I thank Senator Kerrey, in particular, \nfor joining with the Senator from New Jersey. I think this combination \nis a very good one. It is a Senator from the East and a Senator from \nNebraska working together. I think it should pull us all together and \nput this amendment over the top.\n  I wanted to ask my friend if he saw the op-ed piece in the Los \nAngeles Times today written by Janet Reno?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I did see it. I was pleased to see it, as a matter of \nfact.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to say to my friend, quoting very briefly--then \nI will put this in the Record, and I will yield back--that Janet Reno, \nour law enforcement officer, says, ``The Senate proposal doesn't do \nenough to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.'' She said that the \n``U.S. Senate has . . . the opportunity to make our streets and \ncommunities safer by closing the loophole that lets felons, fugitives \nand other prohibited people buy deadly weapons at gun shows.'' She \nlaments the action that the Senate took. She points out that even \nthough some on the other side said this amendment would close the gun \nshow loophole, they do not, and she basically then says that the bill \nof Senator Lautenberg and Senator Kerrey does the job, and it follows \nthe recommendations of the Attorney General. She says there is still \ntime for the Senate to revisit this important issue and adopt \nlegislation that closes the gun show loophole once and for all.\n  I guess my final question to my friend is this: It is unusual to see \na Senator get up and offer once again an amendment that essentially he \noffered before. Does my friend have hope that we will get enough votes \non the other side to have a better outcome and to plug this loophole?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a strong feeling that we can pass this. It \nwould take many minds to change to make that happen. My colleagues on \nthe Republican side--I want to say I have had lots of private \nconversations with them--also want to see the loophole closed. While \nthe Hatch-Craig amendment passed, it was the intent of those who \nsupported it, and I am sure it closed the loophole. However, it is \ntechnically still open to loopholes through which lots of problems \ncould emerge.\n  As a consequence, I am hopeful that we will get strong support on \nthis amendment. The American public strongly support it--89 percent, I \npoint out. That is an enormous number.\n  What I am hoping is that finally the voices of the parents, those who \nare concerned who have seen violence in their schools, who have seen \nviolence in their streets, are heard. If we can, without harm to those \nwho want to observe a legitimate request, continue to do that, I am \nhopeful that we are going to be able to alert some of those who oppose \nit to the fact that we have taken great pains to satisfy their needs in \nthe revised Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. Let's \nclose the gun show loophole once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lautenberg for his work \non this. He is committed to it very strongly. We just have different \nviews on a number of issues about guns. I wish it weren't so. But we do \nhave some differences.\n  With regard to the gun shows, I think a lot of progress has been made \nsince the Lautenberg bill has made some movement toward a more centrist \nposition, but I believe--and I know Senator Hatch shares the belief \ndeeply--that it still does not go far enough in being a reasonable \nrestriction on the historic event of gun shows in America. They \ncontinue around the country. These are honest and law-abiding citizens, \noverwhelmingly, who attend. People collect antique weapons and so \nforth. We simply can't have these long delays before you can close a \ntransaction, because the show will be gone by then. This does not have \nqualified immunity. It gives the ATF the ability to in effect impose a \nnew tax.\n  There are some things that we just are not able to accept.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I sure would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator says this would give the ATF the ability to \nlevy a new tax. But under the modified proposal that we have, all we \nare doing is saying that a gun show operator--several thousand of them \na year--will simply have to pay the same relatively small fee that all \nlicensed gun dealers do. Will the Senator agree that this is no \ndifferent from what any licensed gun dealer has to pay, that basically \nwhat we are trying to do with this amendment is to say that if you have \na gun show where it is possible that guns will be sold, you need to be \nlicensed like everybody else and you need to pay a relatively small \nfee?\n\n  I ask the Senator that question.\n  Second, would the Senator agree that we have substantially reduced \nthe amount of regulations that gun show operators would have to comply \nwith in this amendment, that we struck, I think, three or four of the \nmost difficult regulations, leaving only the requirement to register \nlike all licensed dealers have to do and pay this small fee? They have \nto prove the identity of vendors when they check in at a gun show. That \nis just to verify the vendor is who they claim to be. And they have to \npost a sign indicating NISC background checks will be required.\n  Will the Senator agree that basically, first, there is a \nsubstantially reduced amount of regulations that we have in the first \namendment, and, second, that all this tax the Senator has referenced, \nwhich is a fee, is the same thing that other licensed gun dealers would \nhave to pay?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would certainly agree that the amendment as proposed \nhas listened to some of the concerns that made it unacceptable to begin \nwith, and it moved in a more moderate position. But I would still \nsuggest that this amendment is unacceptable for a number of different \nreasons. One of them is an additional tax and fee that can be imposed \nby the ATF on a transaction that previously was not taxed. It does not \nprovide the kind of qualified immunity that would induce people to do \nthe background checks and could, in fact, cause more black market sales \nof guns.\n  The bill as written, the Hatch-Craig amendment, would be mandatorily \nstronger than it was originally. And of course there were some \ntypographical errors in that first Hatch-Craig amendment, \nunfortunately, that I know Senator Lautenberg enjoyed railing about for \na long time. But that was admitted and has been corrected.\n  I believe the managers of the Hatch-Craig amendment answered the \nquestions that Attorney General Reno raised in her comments that were \nmade before some of these changes were made.\n  But let me say this. I have been a prosecutor for 17 years, 15 as a \nFederal prosecutor, and I prosecuted gun cases\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\naggressively; it was a high priority. Under this Project Triggerlock \nproposal, I sent out a newsletter on guns called ``Triggerlock News,'' \nto the local sheriffs and chiefs of police explaining to them what the \nFederal laws were.\n  Federal laws against guns are very strong. If you carry a gun during \na drug offense or a burglary, it is 5 years without parole consecutive \nto any punishment you get on the underlying offense. In Federal court \nyou have the Speedy Trial Act. People have to be tried promptly. In \nFederal court when you have a speedy trial and the individual is \nalready out on bail or parole, the judge usually will deny them bail. \nSo you could have a case where oftentimes these violent criminals are \ndenied bail, then they are tried within 60 days, and removed from the \ncommunity for 5 years and more. That was a high priority with me.\n  This administration under Attorney General Reno has allowed those \nprosecutions. I was a U.S. attorney appointed by President Bush. And \nPresident Clinton has now appointed all 93 U.S. attorneys around the \ncountry. His U.S. attorneys have allowed gun prosecutions to decline 40 \npercent, from 7,000 to 3,800. And, more than that, they have gone \nforward with this idea that the way to fight violent crime and keep \npeople from using guns illegally is to pass more laws. But they are not \nenforcing the laws they pass.\n  For example, there were 6,000 incidents of firearms carried on school \ngrounds last year, according to the President. And within the last \nseveral years this Congress, at the request of the President, passed a \nlaw to make it a Federal crime to carry a firearm on school grounds. \nYet out of 6,000 incidents, fewer than 10 cases were prosecuted each of \nthose 2 years. It is a Federal crime in America to deliver a firearm to \na teenager under most circumstances.\n  That Federal crime, that Federal law, was passed several years ago at \nthe request of the President. Yet his Department of Justice, Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno, prosecuted less than 10 of those in each of the \nlast 2 years. The assault weapons ban that was raised had less than 10 \nprosecutions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. When I finish I will be glad to yield. This is a very \nimportant question to me. We are trying to improve gun laws, and I am \nprepared to strengthen substantially the situation involving gun shows. \nI know Chairman Hatch is. I am filling in for him at this moment.\n  Is this just show? Is this all for debate, for TV and media and \npolitics? It seems to me that it is since after we pass the law, no one \never gets prosecuted for it. Only ten cases out of 6,000 in America \nlast year were prosecuted. What does that say about what we are going \nthrough here?\n  This bill has a number of changes in gun law. If a young person, a \nteenager, is convicted as a juvenile for a crime of violence, he or she \nwill not be able to possess a firearm later when they become an adult. \nUnder current law that is not so. If a teenager commits a violent crime \nat age 17, he is treated as a youthful offender or juvenile in juvenile \ncourt, and when he becomes an adult he can still possess a firearm. But \nan adult, if convicted at age 18 of a felony, cannot possess a gun.\n  We closed that loophole to make sure that we are focusing on people \nwho have a proven record of dangerous use of guns, rather than focusing \nover and over again on innocent people who use firearms.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There is one difference we have. Yes, prosecute those \nwho violate the law, no question. But very simply, that doesn't say you \nshouldn't prevent young people from getting guns before they violate \nthe law. The two people at Littleton, Klebold and Harris, had not \nviolated the law before--or were not detected.\n  It is of little consolation, it seems to me, to their parents and \ntheir families and the whole community that had they not killed \nthemselves they would have been prosecuted. They should be prosecuted. \nI am for laws as tough as my friend from Alabama is, but why shouldn't \nwe both do things to prevent young people and criminals from getting \nguns before they commit crimes, as well as prosecute them after they \ncommit crimes? The two are not contradictory.\n  I always hear ``let's do more prosecution'' as a substitute for also \npreventing criminals and young people from getting guns in the first \nplace so we won't have to prosecute them.\n  I ask my friend from Alabama, why is one in place of the other, as \nopposed to doing both alongside one another?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We are not against laws that rationally and effectively \nprevent people from having weapons they shouldn't possess. We added in \nthis bill a prohibition on what I think was a loophole on assault \nweapons, dealing with teenagers. Other violations of that kind are in \nthat bill, and that bill can provide more restrictions.\n  To me, it is a bizarre event that we are talking about a 3,000-\nprosecution decline and about passing this arcane law dealing with gun \nshows which may have some positive effect in reducing illegal gun \nsales.\n  So we are working with Members on that. We have probably five or more \ngun restriction provisions in this legislation. That is not going to \nsolve the fundamental problem if we are not going to have those laws in \nforce nor if we don't have a commitment from the Attorney General to do \nthat.\n  We heard from her own U.S. attorney in Richmond. They have adopted a \nprogram very similar to Project Triggerlock under President Bush. She \ncalled it Project Triggerlock with Steroids. They were aggressively \nprosecuting individuals who utilized guns illegally, and the \nPresident's own U.S. attorney attributed their aggressive prosecution \nof current gun laws for a 40-percent reduction in murder and a 21-\npercent reduction in violent crime.\n\n  I thought that was a stunning statistic. The President indicated he \nwanted to see that done nationwide in a radio address. Two days before, \nwe had a hearing on it. He had a radio address on this very subject, in \neffect, dealing with the massive decline in prosecutions that have \noccurred under his administration, and said he was directing his U.S. \nattorneys in the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury, \nof which ATF is a part, to increase their prosecutions.\n  Yet when we had Attorney General Reno testify just this month before \nthe Judiciary Committee, she said we are not making any big commitment \non that. She has a study going on and it has to be done individually \nand we are just not going to do what they did in Richmond.\n  The clear impression was that not only was she not in accord with \nwhat I believe the law of the United States requires, but that she \nwasn't even really in accord with the wishes of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I notice that the cosponsor of the amendment is on the \nfloor. I wonder if he might be able to speak since he is the principal \ncosponsor. Traditionally, we have let principal sponsors be allowed to \nspeak. The Senator is always courteous in all these occasions. Would \nthe Senator be willing to let him proceed?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sorry that I took so much time. I defer to Senator \nKerry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator didn't take too much time at all. It is \nwithin your right to do it. I do have a markup with the Finance \nCommittee and I appreciate very much the Senator yielding to me so I \ncan make a couple of points about this amendment.\n  First of all, I do believe in the second amendment. I believe in the \nright to bear arms. I think it has meaning. In the past, I measured \nwhether or not I will vote for changes in the law that restrict a \ncitizen's right to own a gun that reduces their right by imposing \nwaiting periods or increased licensing requirements by a simple test: \nWill this reduce the number of people who are having their rights \nviolated by either being shot at, shot, or killed as a consequence of \npeople who acquire guns illegally, using those guns to commit a crime?\n  I voted for Brady. I voted for the so-called assault rifle ban, \nthough it didn't really ban rifles; it banned some\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nfeatures. I feel confident when I vote for something that I think \nworks.\n  What we have here, and I think both sides are agreeing, is a \nsignificant loophole in the law. There are thousands of gun shows every \nyear where not only can law-abiding citizens go, but as a consequence \nof not having to be licensed--if you go to a Guns Unlimited in Omaha, \nNE, you have to get not just background checks but you have to get \npermits from the city of Omaha and the county sheriff. It takes a while \nbefore you buy a gun.\n  If you set up a gun show in Douglas County, no licensing requirements \nare necessary. You can buy any gun if you are a felon or mentally \nunstable, no background checks are required at all.\n  Both sides are saying we recognize that loophole needs to be closed. \nI noted last week, indeed, when the amendment was offered as a motion \nby Senator Hatch and Senator Craig, the headline of the Omaha World \nHerald said ``Republicans Close Gun Show Loophole.''\n  What I am trying to say with this amendment is two things. One, some \nobjections raised against the previous amendment talked about excessive \namounts of regulation. I found that to be a credible argument. Senator \nLautenberg was good enough to make significant changes in it, so all \nthat is left now is for a gun show operator to do the same thing that a \nlicensed dealer has to do, which is to register with ATF; they pay a \nsmall fee just as any licensed operator has to do; the vendor has to \nshow proof of identification--that is, the person who is selling--that \nverifies the vendor is who they claim to be. And then basically a sign \nhas to be posted notifying people, who are either vendors or there \nbuying, that NICS background checks are going to be done.\n  That is all that is required. It is a fairly simple imposition of \nregulations that are the same for anybody who goes to a licensed gun \ndealer. In addition, you have to comply with whatever the local law is, \nthe State law, or Federal law. That is all we are attempting to do.\n  I urge Senators who are considering whether or not to vote for this \namendment to look at the language of the law as it is currently \nproposed in the Juvenile Justice Act, as modified, because the loophole \nis still there. Perhaps the distinguished Senator from Utah can address \nthis, or somebody else who is a proponent of this. It says that special \nlicenses can be granted to people who are running gun shows. It does \nnot say that all gun show dealers have to register, as all licensed gun \ndealers do. It says some gun show operators can be granted special \nlicenses and then they will not have to do background checks, they will \nnot have to determine whether or not a person who is walking in to buy \na handgun is a felon, whether or not they are mentally unbalanced, \nwhether or not they have previous crimes they have committed. None of \nthis is going to be required if this gun show operator can get a \nspecial license.\n  You say maybe there are some special cases where a special license is \nrequired. I urge Members to look at the language. The language says a \nspecial license can be granted to a person who is engaged in the \nbusiness of dealing in firearms by, No. 1, buying or selling firearms \nsolely or primarily at gun shows.\n  That is going to exempt everybody. Anybody who is out there who says \nI do not have a gun shop, I am not a licensed gun dealer, all I am \ndoing is operating at gun shows, is going to be able to apply for a \nspecial license and be exempted.\n  You tell me how that is going to reduce the opportunity for a felon--\nagain, somebody who has committed crimes in the past with guns--to go \nto an operator who is engaged in a business primarily operating at gun \nshows and not be able to buy a dangerous weapon. The answer is, they \nwill still be able to buy. So if anybody believes we have closed this \nloophole as a consequence of the Juvenile Justice Act as it is \ncurrently amended, I urge you to look at the language. Anyone who is \nbuying or selling firearms solely or primarily at gun shows can be \ngiven a special license and then will not have to do background checks.\n  Second, for anybody who is buying or selling firearms as part of a \ngunsmith or firearm repair business or conduct of other activity, as in \nthis subsection, that seems not necessarily unreasonable. You can, I \nsuppose, craft this thing so special exemptions can be granted. But we \ndo not grant special exemptions for somebody who is out there as a \nlicensed gun dealer; they merely have to pay a small fee with the ATF \nand agree to do background checks.\n\n  If you talk to the licensed gun dealers today--many of whom opposed \nthose background checks to begin with--they say they now basically are \ncomfortable with it; it is operating relatively well, and it gives them \nincreased comfort when they sell a handgun, knowing they are selling it \nto somebody who is not a felon; either the local sheriff or local \npolice department signed off on it and said that person who has made \nthat purchase is somebody who is a law-abiding citizen, who is not a \nfelon, who does not have anything in his background that would indicate \nthe rest of the public is going to be at risk as a consequence of him \nowning a handgun.\n  This amendment corrects precisely what many people objected to in \noriginal language, and that is, it reduces the amount of regulation. \nBut it clearly says if you operate a gun show and you are selling guns, \nyou are going to have to do what every licensed dealer has to do. You \npay a fee to the ATF and you make certain you do background checks on \nanybody who is buying. That closes the loophole.\n  But current language as described here in law does not do that. \nCurrent language will still allow somebody who is primarily involved or \nsolely involved in operating gun shows--it will allow them to say we do \nnot have to get a license, we do not have to notify ATF, we don't have \nto do background checks, we can just set up shop.\n  You could even have a vendor at a gun show, under the proposal as \nthis Juvenile Justice Act has been changed, a vendor who is also \nillegal--no background checks, no analysis required of the vendor as \nwell.\n  There are other problems that can be identified. I am troubled as \nwell by the pawnshop exemption in the Juvenile Justice Act as \noriginally proposed, as is proposed today as well, because I think that \nalso unnecessarily puts the public at risk. That is what we are talking \nabout here.\n  All of us understand the Bill of Rights provides us with freedom but \nalso understand there are limits. I do not have unlimited first \namendment rights. If I libel or slander people, they can bring a case \nagainst me. I do not have an unlimited second amendment right. My \nsecond amendment right ends when I am a threat to somebody else.\n  This is not about restricting law-abiding citizens; it is about \ntrying to write the law so people who are intentionally committed to \nviolate the law have a more difficult time acquiring a weapon that will \nenable them to do grave bodily harm to, if not to kill, another member \nof our society. So I hope those who would genuinely want to close this \nloophole, who are looking for a way to basically level the playing \nfield for somebody who is out there selling guns through gun shows and \nlicensed gun dealers in the local community, want to have the same \nrules applying to both.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider what we will be doing if the \nJuvenile Justice Act, as modified, is enacted, and what we will be \ndoing if the amendment offered by my friend from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, and I is accepted. I hope this will be accepted. We have \nsignificant numbers of Americans who are saying we do want to reduce \nthis loophole, this risk that we see to our lives--not just our lives \nbut our children's lives as well.\n  I think it is an altogether reasonable amendment. I was surprised \ninitially there was much controversy over it. I regret there is \ncontroversy over it. I hope this amendment will be seen by those who \nsupport the right to bear arms as a reasonable way to make certain that \nall Americans, gun owners and non-gun-owners alike, not only have a \nright to own a gun but have a right to the safety and security that all \nof us want to have in our homes and in our neighborhoods.\n\n  The Senator from Alabama is gone. I will, in his absence, thank the \nSenator from Utah for allowing me to speak so I can get back to the \nfinance meeting.\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am going to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I just want to thank the Senator for getting here and \nmaking the speech. I am glad we could accommodate him. I am going to \naccommodate the Senator from Massachusetts now, and then hopefully I \nwill have something to say about this when he has finished.\n  I ask though, in the meantime, of the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, is there a possibility of us agreeing to a time agreement on \nthis since the main proponents on this have spoken to it?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Utah, \nwe have several colleagues who want to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator just consider that, and then maybe, while \nthe Senator from Massachusetts makes his remarks, chat with me and we \nwill see if we can come to agreement?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I have been waiting \npatiently. I certainly want to speak on this. I probably will speak for \nno more than 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think everybody is trying to get this bill over with at \nthis point. At least I hope so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I only need 2 minutes to make \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to defer remarks of mine until the \ndistinguished Senators from Massachusetts and New York and California \nspeak.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We know the three who are going to speak. During the time \nthey are speaking, I will run the traps on our side and try to get as \nconcise and accurate a time agreement as we can.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to have time agreements on the other \namendments, if we can. Will the Senator from Massachusetts give us some \nindication of how long he may speak? I will have to be gone from the \nfloor to the Finance Committee for a vote and I would like to know, if \nI may, how long the Senator will speak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Probably less than 15 minutes.\n  I would like to just be able to proceed.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand the Senator from Massachusetts, 10 or 15 \nminutes for sure, and then the Senator from New York at least 5 \nminutes, and then the Senator from California.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. I just want to have some idea. I would also like to have \nthe floor protected, and I know my colleague from Vermont will, while I \ngo to vote on this Finance Committee bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There will be no consents entered while the Senator is \ngone.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the debate and discussion here on \nthe floor of the Senate in regard to the prosecution of Federal crimes, \nand also during the period of the Judiciary Committee, I think we ought \nto really set the record straight. The record was set straight in the \nJudiciary Committee by the Attorney General, but it has been \nmisrepresented here on the floor of the Senate by those who ask why are \nwe considering this amendment when we are not really prosecuting all \nthe gun laws on the books with regard to this and somehow suggesting \nthat those of us who are concerned about the easy access of weaponry to \nchildren and criminal elements in our society really should pay more \nattention to the prosecutions and doing something to make it more \ndifficult for children and for those who should not own the weapons to \nown them.\n\n  The fact is, overall firearms prosecutions are up. Although the \nnumber of Federal prosecutions for low-level offenders--persons serving \nsentences of 3 years or less--is down, the number of higher-level \noffenders--those serving sentences of 5 or more years--is up by nearly \n30 percent in recent years.\n  At the same time, the total number of Federal and State prosecutions \nis up sharply. About 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for \nState and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992, 20,000 to 25,000.\n  As the Attorney General pointed out, those that ought to be handled \nat the local level are being handled by State prosecutors, and those \nthat are more serious are being handled by Federal prosecutors. That \nrecord has been made in the Judiciary Committee. Maybe those who oppose \nthis kind of common sense gun legislation get some kind of thrill out \nof misrepresenting the facts. The facts have been laid out by the \nAttorney General before the Judiciary Committee and they are as I have \nstated them, and as represented by the Justice Department.\n  By misrepresenting and saying total prosecutions by the Federal \nGovernment are down, they are telling half the story. They are not \nsaying what is happening in State and local prosecutions. When you look \nat State prosecutions, local prosecutions, and Federal prosecutions, \nthey are up, and up significantly. I think we ought to put that aside.\n  We are making worthwhile progress in the Senate on these gun control \nissues. I join in paying tribute to my colleagues--Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Schumer, Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, and \nothers on both sides of the aisle--who have been advancing sensible and \nresponsible and what I call common sense recommendations. That is what \nthey are. They are common sense recommendations which, when put into \neffect, are going to reduce the opportunity for easy access to weapons \nwhich are too often used either accidentally or intentionally, perhaps \neven in the increased incidents of suicide, or purposely by children or \nyoung people in this country.\n  One of the most important measures, which is before us, is closing \nthe gun show loophole and closing it not just part way but all the way. \nAs was pointed out, last week the Senate failed twice to close that \nflagrant loophole, and the inadequate amendments adopted were riddled \nwith so many loopholes of their own that the country was outraged by \nthe Senate's hypocrisy.\n  Now, on the third try, we have a chance to do the job right and close \nthe gun show loophole lock, stock, and barrel.\n  The gun show loophole is a hole below the waterline of our gun \ncontrol laws. It makes a mockery of responsible gun control. Yet, the \ninitial attempt by our Republican friends to close it was a travesty, \nas has been pointed out.\n  It left the gun show loophole wide open. It created a pawnshop \nloophole. It reduced background checks from 3 business days to 24 \nhours, including Sundays. It allowed the interstate sale of firearms, \npotentially undermining State laws across the country. It prevented gun \ntracing. And it created a sweeping immunity for gun sellers.\n  That action was the Senate at its irresponsible worst. It is time for \nus to stop buckling to the gun industry and do what is right.\n  There is a real chance that the tragedy in Littleton would never have \nhappened without the easy access to guns that the gun show loophole \nsupplies.\n  One incredible statistic summarizes the magnitude of the problem we \nface. In 1996, the most recent year for which information is available, \nhandguns were used to murder 9,390 people in the United States.\n\n  I might mention why it is difficult to get gun figures. We are using \n1996 figures because the power of the NRA prohibits the Centers for \nDisease Control from collecting that information. The only way they can \nget the information is to look at the death certificates, and that is \nenormously costly and takes an incredible amount of time. We are \nprohibited--the country is prohibited--from actually having the most \nrecent and accurate information about gun deaths. If it is not a \nproblem, why does the National Rifle Association oppose us in having \nthat kind of information? And they have opposed it. They prohibit us \nfrom getting that information, so we use the 1996 figures--9,390 people \nin the United States.\n  In countries with tough gun control laws, the firearm homicide rate \nis over 97 percent lower--97 percent. The number of handgun murders in \n1996 were 2 in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in \nCanada, and 213 in Germany. The case for strong gun control is \noverwhelming. It saves lives. It\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nsaves children. It saves whole communities.\n  Another shocking statistic makes the same point. Each day across \nAmerica, 13 more children die from gunshot wounds. That is the \nequivalent of one Littleton each day, every day somewhere in America.\n  How can the Senate continue to play ostrich--head in the sand, \nignoring this overwhelming need? How many more Littletons do we need? \nHow many more wake-up calls will it take? When will we finally do what \nit takes to keep children safe and stop sleepwalking through crisis \nafter crisis after crisis after crisis of gun violence?\n  If the Senate cannot even close the gun show loophole, we may well be \ncondemning communities across the country to a future Littleton tragedy \nof their own.\n  It is wrong for the Senate to say that easy access to guns had \nnothing to do with what happened at Columbine High School. It is wrong \nfor the Senate to whistle past the graveyard of Littleton. It is wrong \nfor the Senate to pretend to make minor adjustments in the gun laws \nwhen gaping loopholes, like the gun show loophole, needs to be closed. \nIt is wrong for the Senate to give the National Rifle Association a \nveto over the reforms that cry out to be taken in the wake of that \ntragedy.\n  Littleton shocked the conscience of the country, and it finally seems \nto have shocked the conscience of the Senate. It is clear that the \nSenate should return to the gun show loophole and try again to close it \nbefore more innocent lives are lost. And, like closing the gun show \nloophole, there are other urgent steps that need to be taken.\n  Gun laws work. The facts speak for themselves. It is long past time \nfor the Senate to act to say enough is enough.\n  We know many examples of how tough gun laws, in combination with \nother preventive measures, are having a direct impact in reducing \ncrime. In Massachusetts, we have some of the strongest gun laws in the \ncountry. There are tough restrictions on carrying concealed weapons. \nLocal law enforcement has discretion in issuing the permits required by \nlaw, and an individual must show a clear need.\n\n  The minimum age for sale of handguns across the board is 21.\n  There are increased penalties for felons who possess firearms.\n  Adults are liable if a child gets an improperly stored gun and uses \nit to kill or injure himself or someone else.\n  Firearms must be stored with child safety locks.\n  We have a gun-free schools law.\n  We have enhanced standards for licensing of gun dealers.\n  A permit is required for private sales.\n  Saturday night specials are banned.\n  Lost or stolen firearms must be reported.\n  These are common sense requirements that save lives and impose no \nproblem whatsoever for legitimate hunters and sports persons.\n  Look at what has happened in terms of firearm homicides in Boston. \nThese figures are reflected across our Commonwealth. We have seen in \n1993, 65; 62 in 1994; 64 in 1995; and then 39, 24, 26, 4. So far this \nyear, there has not been a single youth homicide in 128 schools. Tough \nlaw enforcement, tough gun control, tough preventive action. That is \nwhat we stand for. And the results are out there.\n  When we compare States with strong gun laws to those that have weak \ngun laws, the differences are significant.\n  In 1996, for Massachusetts, the number of gun deaths for persons 19 \nyears old or younger was 2 per 100,000.\n  In States that have the weakest gun laws, the numbers were \nsignificantly higher: 5.9 gun deaths per 100,000 in Indiana; 9.2 gun \ndeaths per 100,000 in Mississippi; 5.1 gun deaths per 100,000 in Utah; \n6.9 gun deaths per 100,000 in Idaho--2 gun deaths per 100,000 in \nMassachusetts.\n  It is clear that strong gun laws help reduce gun violence, yet when \nDemocrats have proposed steps to take guns out of the hands of young \npeople--proposals that would save lives--the Senate has too often said \nno.\n  The overwhelming majority of the American public wants to pass \nreasonable gun control measures.\n  The American people clearly want these common sense laws on the \nbooks, and they will just as clearly hold Congress accountable if we \nfail to act or only pretend to act. The lesson of the Senate's past \nfailed attempts to close the gun show loophole is clear: The American \npeople will hold us accountable if we refuse to act. Nothing \nconcentrates the minds of Members of Congress like the knowledge that \nthey are about to be hung out to dry at the next election. So let's \nconcentrate on closing the gun show loophole and the other blatant \nloopholes in the Nation's gun laws.\n  Just finally, I put in the Record that the ATF has examined the \nnumber of crime guns traced during 1996 and 1997 to federally licensed \nfirearm dealers and to federally licensed pawnbrokers. While 13 percent \nof the federally licensed dealers had one or more crime guns traced to \nthem, 35 percent of the federally licensed pawnbrokers had one or more \ncrime guns traced to them.\n  It seems that everything cries out for this particular amendment. \nLet's take action and do what is right for the children in America, the \nfamilies in America, and to reduce violence in America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I think, in fundamental principles, we are in accord on the efficacy. \nThe virtual elimination of guns in America, we cannot be together on. I \nthink the second amendment provides for that. But tough law \nenforcement, as the Senator said, tough gun control--I would say, tough \ngun prosecutions--and prevention do work.\n  The Boston project is a good model for America. One of my staff \nmembers has been there to try to analyze how it is they have achieved \ntheir successes. One of the reasons is they really enforce the law. \nThey go out and deal with these young gang members. If they have them \non probation, they monitor them. They talk to them. They say: You are \nsupposed to be at home at 7 o'clock at night. The probation officers do \nnot work from 9 to 5 in Boston. They will work from 1 until 10 o'clock \nat night, and they will go out with police officers and actually verify \nwhether or not those young people are complying with the probation and \nparole requirements placed on them. What is happening in America is our \ncourt systems are so overwhelmed with juvenile crime that they have not \nbeen able to even carry out their mandates.\n  If you give them probation, you need to make sure they honor and \ncomply with the terms of the probation. One possibility is to do drug \ntesting, so that they are not getting back on drugs which may be \ndriving them to crime. Another possibility is by going to school on \ntime; or if they have a job, showing up on time for it; if they have a \ncurfew placed on them, being home in their bed and not running the \nstreets at night.\n  These are the kinds of things in which Boston has invested. We asked: \nWell, what happens when a young person in Boston does not do what they \nsay--for example, they have been caught in a burglary, have been \nreleased on probation, and have been running around with a gang. The \njudge says: Don't hang around with that gang anymore; be in at 7 \no'clock; and be at school on time.\n  What happens if they do not go to school, and continue being a \ntruant? What happens if they do not come home at night when they are \nsupposed to or otherwise do not comply with the judge's order? In most \ncities, unfortunately, nothing happens.\n  If you care about children, you will make sure something happens, \nbecause we want to intervene early in their lives in order to direct \nthem on a new and healthy path. If we love these children, and really \ncare about them, we will not have this revolving-door justice that goes \non in America.\n  There was a night watchman killed by three young people in Alabama \njust 3 years ago when I was the attorney general of Alabama. I called \nthe chief of police and asked the chief: Chief, what is the criminal \nrecord on these three youngsters? They were out loose. One of them had \n5 prior arrests, another one had 5 prior arrests, and one had 15 prior \narrests. That is the pattern in America.\n  Fox Butterfield, who has written on this subject numerous times for \nthe New York Times, did a study of the Chicago juvenile court system. \nHe\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\nfound they spend 5 minutes per case. These children are not being \nconfronted effectively by the court system when they are beginning to \nget in trouble. We need to make that first brush with the law their \nlast. And it does include tough law enforcement. You have to be able to \ndiscipline children who refuse to take advantage of the opportunities \nthat have been given them.\n  So we do have money in here that would allow for alternative schools \nto be built, for drug treatment programs, for mental health and \ncounseling to occur, and for drug testing to find out whether young \npeople are on drugs. All of those funding programs, and many more, are \nhere to help strengthen juvenile justice.\n  I say to those who care about juvenile justice in America today, go \ndown and talk to your judges, your district attorneys, and your chiefs \nof police. Ask them what is needed in their local juvenile court system \nin order to make them better able to intervene and change the lives of \nyoung people who are getting in trouble. You will find that those \njudges will have a list of things they wish they could have. This bill \nwould fund virtually every one of them.\n\n  It would give matching funds to expand detention facilities. It would \ngive more money for drug treatment and other activities of this kind. \nIt would allow each community to make application for funds to fill the \nmissing blanks in their system so that they can have a comprehensive, \ncoordinated effort against crime.\n  I think we can make progress in that regard. I hope we can go on and \nmove this bill to final passage.\n  I see the Senator from New York would like to comment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Presiding Officer for yielding and the \nSenator from Alabama for his courtesy, as well as all the other \nSenators.\n  I think, my colleagues, this afternoon will be a moment of reckoning \non the floor of this Senate. The vote that will occur on closing the \ngun show loophole--really closing the gun show loophole--will be \nhistoric, because it will really mark the difference as to whether we \nare serious about moderate, carefully-thought-out measures on gun \ncontrol or whether we are going to continue the same game we have \nplayed for the last 4 years.\n  What game is that? The game is a simple one. When the public gets \naroused, all too often because of a tragedy, then some of us try to \ndeal with the causes of that tragedy in a variety of different ways, \nincluding reasonable restrictions preventing children, preventing \nfelons, from getting guns.\n  What in the past has occurred is, those who oppose us have said: Oh, \nwe agree with you. And they put in a substitute amendment which does \nnot close the loophole. They put in a substitute which makes it appear \nas if the problem is being solved but does not solve it. Then, \ninexorably, another tragedy occurs.\n\n  Today is the day we can stop that. We can stop it on a modest, simple \nmeasure to close the gun show loophole, to really close it.\n  Now, let me go over, for my colleagues--and then I want to talk a \nlittle bit about what the Senator from Alabama has said--the status of \nthe present legislation that has passed on the floor of the Senate and \nwhat we are attempting to do with the Lautenberg amendment this \nafternoon. Right now, after passage of the Hatch-Craig amendment, we \ngive with one hand and take away with another. There are, right now, \nthree types of people under the status of this legislation who can go \nto gun shows and sell guns: One is federally licensed dealers. These \npeople, since 1968, whether they sell at gun shows or anywhere else, \nhave to keep records and, since 1993, with the passage of the Brady \nlaw, have to do background checks. They always have and they will \ncontinue to, unless we repeal that for some unforeseen circumstance.\n  The second group of people is those who are not licensed dealers. \nUnder present law, they could show up at gun shows and sell guns \nwithout background checks, without recording processes. The Craig-Hatch \namendment correctly, as does the Lautenberg amendment, prevents that \nfrom happening. A background check would have to be done, as it should. \nThere shouldn't be any loopholes.\n  The country came together, in 1993, passed the Brady law, and it has \nworked. It has worked dramatically so. It has worked so that over \n250,000 felons who walked into licensed dealers were refused guns.\n  Let me show you how it has worked in the last week. Since last \nWednesday, May 12, 1999, when the Senate missed the opportunity to \nclose the gun show loophole once and for all, the FBI, using the Brady \nlaw's national instant check system, stopped 1,550 felons, fugitives, \nstalkers and others who should not have guns from buying licensed guns. \nIn one week, 1,500 people were stopped. But in that same week, sure as \nwe are here, some of those very same people went to gun shows and \nbought guns without a check. What kind of mindless system is there when \nthe dealer has to do the check but you can easily go to a gun show and \nget around it.\n  Over this past weekend, there were a minimum of 31 gun shows. In \nevery one of those gun shows, children, felons, the mentally \nincompetent, and stalkers could go buy guns without ever being \ndetected. Why?\n  Because of the public outcry about what occurred in Littleton, the \nSenator from Utah and the Senator from Idaho said: Fine, if you are not \na licensed dealer, you also have to engage in a background check. That \nwas their second attempt. The first attempt, of course, made it \nvoluntary, which made no sense. But then, after the outcry and after \nthe Senator from Vermont and myself got up on the floor late that \nevening and said, hey, this does not do what it is supposed to do, the \nnext day Senators from the other side, the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from Arizona, got together and said: Wait a minute, we thought \nwe were really closing the gun show loophole. It wasn't. And so this \nCraig-Hatch amendment evolved.\n  But the same darn thing occurred. So while closing the loophole for \nnonlicensed dealers, they opened it up for a whole new category of \npeople called special licensees. What was the reason to have a special \nlicensee? Nobody has figured that out. But a special licensee can go to \na gun show, under the status of the Hatch-Craig amendment, and not do a \nbackground check.\n\n  It is a shell game. On the one hand, we say we are not going to let \nunlicensed dealers do this, and then we say, but if you become a \nspecial licensee, you can.\n  The American people are just appalled at what this Senate is doing. A \nsimple measure like closing the gun show loophole, which can be done \neasily and quickly and noncontroversially, can't pass. We have to do an \nelaborate kabuki dance to make it seem as if we are doing something but \nnot do anything at all.\n  So this is a moment of reckoning for the Senate. Are we going to step \nup to the plate and just close the gun show loophole once and for all \nby passing the amendment this afternoon, or are we going to continue to \nplay games? I say to my colleagues, playing games won't do anymore. \nThere has been a sea change in the American people in the last few \nweeks, because they are fed up.\n  After Brady, something happened. Before the Brady law passed, the gun \nlobby would tell citizens throughout America, if Brady passes, the \nhunting rifle your Uncle Willy gave you when you were 14 will be \nconfiscated and some people in big black boots will knock on your door \nand take your guns. It was a message of fear.\n  Well, wherever I go in my great and diverse State, I ask people who \nare gun owners, has the Brady law interfered with your right to bear \narms? And every one says no. So the fear tactics that the NRA has used, \nthe scare tactics, the big lie is losing velocity. That is why they \nhave lost members, half a million, in the last few years. That is why \nthey are unable to garner support.\n  Now, because of the tragedy at Littleton, there seems to be a whole \nchange in public opinion. They say, enough already. It is not just \namong Democrats like myself who have been arguing for these changes for \nover a decade. You have two candidates for the Republican nomination \nfor Senate who have had the courage to say the NRA is not always right. \nIn 1996, no candidate, much as they wanted to,\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\ncould dare say that. That is as good an indication of the change in \npublic opinion as any.\n  I respect Elizabeth Dole; I respect John McCain. They do not agree \nwith me about everything on guns. I do not expect them to. But on \nlogical, rational methods of closing loopholes of a law that has \nreceived overwhelming public support and, more importantly, has been \nsuccessful, 1,500 felons last week stopped from getting guns by Brady, \nhow many of them went to gun shows to get around the law to buy those \nsame guns we don't know.\n  Not only did the Hatch-Craig amendment fail to deal with the gun show \nloophole; it added three more loopholes.\n  Pawnshops: There has been a law that has worked. It said, you are a \nperson; you go bring your gun to a pawnshop; before you retrieve it, \nlet there be a background check--no harm to anybody. That has been in \nplace since, I believe, 1997; it may have been 1996. It has worked. \nHundreds of felons, I think it is 254, have been caught going to \npawnshops, and all of a sudden we are going to open it up. Again, give \nwith one hand take away with the other.\n  What are we saying? Do we want to have a loud speaker go up and down \nthe streets of our country saying: Hey, felons, hey, kids, here are \nways to get around the Brady law; you don't need a background check. \nThat is what we are doing here in the Senate.\n  Then we have opened another loophole. This one is totally befuddling. \nThe instant check system has worked.\n  It was proposed by people who didn't agree with me when we wrote the \nBrady law. But we said let's see if this works.\n  Well, it has, in about three-quarters of the cases. So people can get \ntheir check instantly and then go out of the gun shop with their gun. \nNo problem, as far as I am concerned. Some people think a cooling off \nperiod is important, and it may be, but the main purpose we had in \npassing Brady was the background check. If you can do it quicker, fine. \nStill in about 25 percent of the cases the records are not in good \nshape, where there is a glitch in the computer, where the instant check \ndoesn't work.\n  Right now, the FBI has 72 hours to check. Why in God's name did we \nreduce that to 24 in the Hatch-Craig amendment? Why?\n  Let me tell you the particular relevance to gun shows, where it \napplies. If you have a gun show on Saturday, you have 72 hours to \ncheck. The FBI can go through their records on a Monday. If you have a \ngun show on Saturday and you only have 24 hours to check, there is no \ncheck at all. Under the Hatch-Craig proposal, you would have to give \nthat gun to someone even if they had committed 10 or 12 felonies. Why? \nIt did not hurt anybody; it only applied to 25 percent. Yet, we persist \nin creating new loopholes.\n  One final thing. Our system has always been one that has recognized \nStates rights. We said gun dealers can only sell within their State. \nUnder Hatch-Craig, that principle goes. You can go across the country \nto sell a gun at a gun show. Why?\n  So not only did we fail to completely close the gun show loophole in \nHatch-Craig, but we opened three new ones--in my judgment, three big \nones. Why? Well, I know why. We all know why. It is because of the \npower of the gun lobby, because of the power of the NRA. There is no \nother reason. I have been asking for a rational reason why, and you \nhear ``too much bureaucracy,'' or something like that.\n  Well, in this juvenile justice bill, we are creating a lot more \nbureaucracy to put more kids in prison who commit serious crimes. I \nagree with that. I am a pretty tough-on-crime guy. But we don't get up \non this side and say: too much bureaucracy. We don't hear colleagues on \nthe other side say: too much bureaucracy. That is a false argument if \nthere ever was one.\n  People want bureaucracy when they want Government to do something. If \nyou want to put kids or felons away, it is more bureaucracy, more \nprosecutors. I am for it, but it is more bureaucracy. More laws? I am \nfor it, but it is more bureaucracy. But when it comes to a law that \nwould stop the kids from getting guns, that would stop the felons from \ngetting guns, oh, no, no, then it is too much bureaucracy and we can't \nhave it. I have never understood the distinction.\n  So the bottom line is a simple one. In the legislation we passed by \none mere vote last week, we did not close the gun show loophole. We \nclosed one little loophole and opened up another one to take its place. \nIt is as wide open as it was before the legislation, and anyone, as my \ncolleague from Nebraska has pointed out, could become a special \nlicensee; and then we created three more loopholes.\n  Mr. President, we would have been better off without Hatch-Craig than \nwe would have been with it. It was easier to stop children and felons \nfrom getting guns before Hatch-Craig than it is now, if it were to \nbecome law. So who are we kidding?\n  Then one final argument to my colleagues, to my friends on the other \nside--the Senator from Alabama is not here, but he will be even more \nably represented by the Senator from Utah. That chart has been up here \nfor a long time. I think we have heard more talk about that chart than \nabout a lot of the legislation we are talking about. But that is fine. \nThat is a legitimate argument, in my judgment. But I ask my friends--\nthey say there is not enough prosecution of firearms violations. I \nagree with them. I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania, in the \nbudget last month, we put in a proposal to add $50 million to do what \nhas been done in Richmond, Philadelphia, and in Rochester, NY, to do \nbetter prosecutions of those who violate Federal firearms laws.\n  As you know, most of the firearms laws are State. It has never been a \nFederal responsibility. Folks on the other side want to make it one, \nand that is fine with me. I am not one who says the Federal Government \nshould not be involved in crime fighting. In fact, over my 10 years, I \nhave pushed the Federal Government to be involved in crime fighting. \nBut, again, why does prosecuting those who violate our firearms laws \ncontradict closing the gun show loophole? It doesn't. Both should be \ndone. They should go hand in hand.\n  As I mentioned before, in the debate we had with the Senator from \nIdaho a while back, there are grieving families in Littleton. There may \nbe prosecutions of some who gave guns to Mr. Klebold and Mr. Harris, \nwho created the tragedy. I am sure those prosecutions don't make the \nparents of the 13 dead children feel any better. I saw one of them \nbegging us on television at the rally in Denver last week. They would \nbeg us to do both--to prosecute those who violate firearms laws, but at \nthe same time prevent children like young Harris and Klebold from \ngetting guns to begin with.\n  A prosecution occurs after the crime. It sometimes deters crime \nbecause people don't want to be prosecuted. I have been tough on \ncrime--for mandatory minimum sentences, and for incarceration--my whole \ncareer. But, in God's name, don't use that which is a worthy cause as \nan excuse, as a substitute for simple, moderate things such as closing \nthe gun show loophole, closing the pawnshop loophole and allowing the \nFBI system to check when the instant check system doesn't work.\n  In conclusion, I know my friends from Nebraska and Utah wish to \nspeak. This afternoon will be a moment of reckoning on this floor. It \nwill determine, very simply, whether we are going to persist, as we \nhave in the last few years, about coming up with solutions that don't \ndo the job--that are almost designed not to do the job--or whether we \ncan actually do some real good in a simple measure, sponsored by the \nSenators from New Jersey and Nebraska, and close the gun show loophole. \nThe yeas and nays this afternoon will determine which side each Senator \nis on. The eyes of America will be upon this floor this afternoon. Let \nus pray we do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been working very closely with the \nDemocratic leadership to try to get this matter to a conclusion. As I \nunderstand it, including this gun amendment, there are two others, and \npossibly a third besides this amendment. We are going to try to finish \nthis bill.\n  Now, my personal impression is that they have gone too far. They are \npushing this way too far. As the manager of this bill, I have tried to \nbring both sides together, and we have made a real effort to do so. I \nam starting to question whether or not we are getting a good-faith \neffort on the other side.\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\n  Now, this is the second time we have debated the Lautenberg \namendment--the second time. To be honest with you, there is so much \nmore in this bill than just the gun matters. I have helped to \neffectuate compromise on the gun matters, which I believe has been to \nthe satisfaction of most all Democrats and most all Republicans--not \nall on either side. Here is where we are. We have fought back \namendments on one side. I was told by colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle they had cut their list of amendments to eight and that \nthree, maybe four, including this amendment, would be on gun control.\n  Today, they tell us that maybe they can agree to limit amendments. I \nhave chatted with one of the top leaders on the Democrat side. He said \nthey have agreed that we are going to get this done. But some have said \nmaybe they can agree to limit amendments, but only after a vote on the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  You see, they want to vote on Lautenberg, not just twice, but three, \nfour, five--who knows how many times. Who is holding up this bill? I \nhave to tell you, it isn't us. We will vote on Lautenberg, but I want \nto be sure that we have a unanimous consent agreement to vote on final \npassage.\n  I would like to vote on Lautenberg. But that is going to have to be \nthe good-faith deal, because that is what I have represented to the \nother side. I think it is time to put this matter to rest. I think we \ncan push these gun things only so far, especially when you have seen \nthe good-faith effort I have made, and others on our side, to try to \nresolve these problems. The gun issue is an evolutionary issue; there \nis no question about it. We are trying to find ways of satisfying the \nvast majority of Senators. So far, we have been able to do that except \nwith regard to the Lautenberg amendment. There is a very good reason \nwhy we will not vote for the Lautenberg amendment, or why we are going \nto vote for a tabling motion.\n  Much has been said about gun shows and how best to limit criminal \naccess to guns at these shows. Not much has been said about the black \nmarket push that is going to happen if we get too bureaucratic about \nit, where people won't go to gun shows, where they will just sell them \non the black market. That is the last thing on Earth I want, but that \nis what is going to happen.\n  I have to tell you, it is time to cut the rug. It is rug-cutting \ntime. We are giving them the Lautenberg vote not because we think it is \na worthy thing to do but because they are insisting on it. But there is \na time when good faith says we move the bill. If Lautenberg is passed, \nso be it. If it does not pass, then so be it.\n  I have been saying for a long time that there have been numerous \ndelays in debate on this matter. I have had some indications that there \nare going to be some more delays. We will have to see.\n  I am going to encourage my friends on the other side to limit the \ntime. Let's get time agreement. Let's move ahead. Let's save the time \nof everybody in the Senate, and let's get a bill that will do something \nabout juvenile justice in this country and about solving some of these \nserious problems we have.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes; I am happy to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have been here this morning, and, of course, the manager \nof the bill has been here all morning.\n  I want to say to everyone within the sound of my voice that nothing \nhas changed on this side of the aisle since yesterday. We have agreed \nto cut down our amendments from about 90 to a handful of amendments. We \nhave indicated that as far as gun amendments, we had a finite number of \nthose we were going to offer. I don't know what has gone on in the \ndebate here this morning. I have been trying to follow it as closely as \npossible. But my friend from Utah should realize that nothing has \nchanged since yesterday. We want to have a bill. We have worked hard to \ncut down the number of amendments. My friend, the manager of the bill, \nhas worked all weekend with the staff to pare down these amendments. In \nshort, we want a bill to go forward. We want to finally resolve \nsomething that the American people can be proud of. We have agreed not \nonly on the number of amendments but we have been very fair on the time \nallocation.\n  On this amendment today, there has been a good debate. We haven't \ntaken an inordinate amount of time.\n  In short, I say to my friend, who was kind enough to yield to me, \nthat nothing has changed since yesterday. We feel very strongly about \nour positions. We are happy to defend them, articulate, and advocate \nthem this morning.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I will take back the floor. The \nmajority leader has asked me to get a time agreement when we finally \nvote. I think we are there. If you are down to eight, or actually seven \nafter this one, I can get ours cut down once we know where we are, and \nthen we can have final passage, and hopefully before the end of the \nday. I think we can do it.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Utah, we have been waiting \nfor the managers' amendment to be accepted, agreed upon, and at that \ntime we will be in a position to lay out what our amendments are. We \nwill have time agreements on them.\n  As far as final passage, we know that there can be games played with \nthat unless we set a time certain for final passage. We want a bill \npassed. We want it to pass in a very short period of time. Nothing has \nchanged since yesterday on this side of the aisle. We want to move \nforward in an expeditious manner.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague's remarks. I believe him and \nhave great respect for him, as he knows.\n  Let me just say this: The managers' amendment is basically agreed to \nbetween the two managers. It is a matter of making the final drafting \nchanges, as I understand it. We intend to have that done and filed and \napproved, hopefully, and probably this afternoon, it seems to me. We \nwill try to do that. But let's move this ahead.\n  Let me just finish my remarks on this, because I forgot that the \ndistinguished Senator from California needs a chance to make her \nremarks. She said she would be 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. Let me just say that I want to defer to Senator \nKerrey because he has such time problems. I have cleared my deck this \nmorning so I can be here all day. I decided it would be fair to allow \nthe Senator from Nebraska to proceed.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to make remarks in rebuttal, if I may, \nbecause Senator Kerrey has already spoken. But if he needs to speak, I \nwill be happy to--if the Senator from California is going to speak for \n2 or 3 minutes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield, and wait until the Senator from Utah \nfinishes his remarks, and see where we are at that point.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I have been saying for a long time that how the Congress will deal \nwith firearms violence is an evolving process. We began this debate \nwith fairly ardent positions on both sides.\n  After several days of debate last week, Republicans took a step to \nrequire background checks at gun shows without substantial cost and \nregulatory burdens, and we passed the so-called bill on that, the \nHatch-Craig bill. There was some gloating on the other side of the \naisle, if I didn't misconstrue it. There were some Senators quoted \ntalking about eating crow. These comments were not constructive at all. \nThey made my job much more difficult on our side. We are here to do \nwhat is best for our children and to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States, including the second amendment. We are not here to score \ndebating points, it seems to me. That type of comment, it seems to me, \nis very unconstructive and not conducive to getting a bill that will \nhelp our children and our country as a whole.\n  I would note, however, that the evolution of this matter continues. \nThis time, the supporters of the Lautenberg amendment are making \nchanges to their proposal to bring it closer to our plan that we passed \nin the Hatch-Craig amendment. My sense and hope is that our efforts \nwill continue to evolve and we will be able to find common ground. That \nto me would be a great, great accomplishment. But I haven't seen that \nyet. We are evolving towards that.\n  I appreciate that my colleagues have recognized that the concerns we \nraised were legitimate and they have taken some steps in this current \namendment to address the concerns. But I certainly\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\ndon't think they have gone far enough. I think they have gone too far \nin making it look like the only matter to consider on this whole bill \nhappens to be guns.\n  Let's review how we got here. Under current law, non-licensed \nindividuals can sell firearms at a gun show without obtaining a \nbackground check. This was the loophole that the President, the \nLautenberg amendment sponsors, and others said they were concerned \nabout. Yet, the bill as amended last week now requires background \nchecks for these transactions at gun shows.\n  Under current law, persons who only want to sell firearms at a gun \nshow are not licensed at all and perform no background checks. Our bill \nas amended requires sellers to obtain a federal license to sell \nfirearms at a gun show. Because these special licensees, or temporary \ndealers, are now included in the Gun Control Act, they are subject to \nthe background check requirements.\n  Further, our bill as amended provides civil liability protection to \nthose sellers who complied with the background check requirements.\n  Our proposal also prevents the Federal Government from taxing \nbackground check transactions. The liability protection and tax relief \nwere powerful incentives for persons to have background checks.\n  That is why we put them in the Hatch-Craig amendment.\n  Last week, when we first debated the Lautenberg amendment, we pointed \nout several problems.\n  First, the Lautenberg amendment's definition of a gun show was, at \nbest, unfocused.\n  If two neighbors got together with 25 guns each and sold a gun, they \nwould have been surprised to find that they had created a gun show and \nwere criminals under the Lautenberg amendment because they did not \nconduct a background check or get a permit from the ATF.\n  We understand that the revised Lautenberg amendment now modifies the \ndefinition of ``gun show'' to conform with what is already in the bill, \nwhat we put in the Hatch-Craig amendment. It isn't totally that way \nbecause they still have their 50-person standard, and so forth, but \nbasically they have come our way on it.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain that the bill's \ncurrent definition of ``gun show'' would allow ``hundreds of guns'' to \nbe sold at flea markets that do not fall under the 10 or more exhibitor \nor 20 percent exhibitor rule. Of course, if a very few sellers were \nselling hundreds of firearms, they would in all likelihood be engaged \nin the business--and that is an important phrase--in the business of \nselling firearms without a license. Under current law, such persons are \nsubject to fines, prison sentences or both.\n  Secondly, the Lautenberg amendment allowed the imposition of taxes \nand fees on background checks that constitute a substantial cost for \ncomplying with the law. Now what does that do? That is going to force \npeople to not go to gun shows where they can legitimately sell them \nwith background checks now that we require it in this bill, and to go \noff and sell them on the black market.\n  What we are trying to do and what it seems to me will be the \ninevitable result of some of the approaches under the Lautenberg \namendment, will be that we will create a huge black market in guns, \nwhich is exactly the opposite of what we want to accomplish. I am sure \nthat the distinguished Senator from New Jersey does not want to \naccomplish that, nor anybody else on this floor, but think it through. \nIt doesn't take many brains to realize that is what will happen.\n  We understand the revised Lautenberg amendment does not ``impose'' \ntaxes on sellers and purchasers. However, the tax to which we objected \nis paid by the person or entity that conducts the background check, not \nto a nonlicensed buyer or seller. Of course, the licensee, special \nlicensee or special registrants now in this bill will pass this fee on \nto the buyer or seller who will have to pay it. Of course, they will \npass it on. They will not just do this out of the goodness of their \nheart. As they do that, people will go into the black market to sell \ntheir guns, the exact opposite of what the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey and I and others, who are really trying to do something \nconstructive in this area, want to occur.\n  In short, notwithstanding its appearance, the revised Lautenberg \namendment allows for an ATF taxing authority loophole. The revised \namendment seemingly concludes that we were right, but does not correct \nthe problem. So on this provision we have a major concern.\n  Third, the Lautenberg amendment required gun show organizers to \nobtain advanced permission from the ATF before holding a gun show. It \ndoesn't take many brains to realize that is something nobody wants to \nagree with who believes that gun shows are a time-honored right in this \nsociety under the second amendment.\n  We understand that the revised Lautenberg amendment currently before \nthe Senate that will be at the end of this amendment chain to be voted \nupon eliminates the advance permission requirement. However, gun show \norganizers are still required to keep extensive records, so there is a \nsubstantial burden that would be required, overregulatory burden.\n\n  Fourth, the Lautenberg amendment imposed extensive recordkeeping \nrequirements for sales between nonlicensed individuals, thus driving up \nthe cost of the background check and intruding into the privacy of law-\nabiding citizens.\n  That is just typical of what we have to face around here in the zeal \nto score points on guns. We understand that the revised Lautenberg \namendment may require less records to be kept and may require the \nFederal Government to destroy records held by the instant check \noperator, yet dealers must still keep all records on the buyer. \nFurther, the implication that requiring records to be destroyed after \n90 days conveys a new benefit is not accurate. 18 U.S.C. section \n922(t)(2)(C) already requires the instant check operator to destroy \nrecords of checks that were approved, and the FBI currently destroys \nthe records after 90 days. There is no new benefit in this system \ncompared to current law. So the Lautenberg amendment does not improve \ncurrent law at all, it just obscures it.\n  Some have complained that the Republican plan promotes unaccountable \ninterstate gun peddling by gun dealers. Under current law, a dealer \nfrom one State can go to a gun show in another State and solicit sales. \nHe must return home to his licensed premises, however, to ship the \nfirearm. And the shipment must be to a licensed dealer. That is current \nlaw.\n  Our amendment allows one federally licensed firearms dealer to \ndeliver the firearm to another federally licensed firearms dealer who \nis located out of State. He still cannot deliver a firearm to a \nnonlicensed individual, but only to a licensed dealer. Thus, the \npurchasing dealer will have to log the firearm into his inventory, will \nbe subject to inspection by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nto find that firearm, and will have to conduct a background check to \nsell a firearm to a nonlicensed dealer. This is about the most \nregulated sale of a firearm for which the Federal law provides.\n  Next, some have stated that the current bill's provision for granting \ncivil liability protection to people who comply with the background \ncheck requirement is not prudent. They say that the revised Lautenberg \namendment provides no immunity for people who transfer guns to felons \nand others who intend to use the guns to commit violent crimes or \nfelonies.\n  The bill, as amended, recognizes that persons who act properly with \nfirearms--this is the amendment by Hatch-Craig--including firearms \ntransactions, should not be subject to suit. Indeed, only yesterday, \nthe Senate recognized the value of providing limited immunities to \npersons who act properly with firearms, by bestowing qualified immunity \non persons who properly use child safety laws. This is a key incentive \nin the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee child safety lock amendment. The same reasons \nfor affording civil liability protection apply here. Keep in mind we \nhave evolved towards having something that brings both sides together. \nThe current Lautenberg amendment split both sides apart and will \nresult, in my opinion, in more black market sales in this country, to \nthe detriment of the country.\n  Further, some complain that our bill dismisses certain suits. These \nare only those suits at which nonlicensed individuals have voluntarily \nsold a firearm\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\nthrough a licensed dealer who conducted a background check. If persons \nare now voluntarily having background checks performed at gun shows, \nthey should not be penalized for doing so. That is something we want to \nencourage. We want to give incentives for that.\n\n  I also note that the bill provides no immunities for criminal sales \nof firearms. If a seller knowingly transfers a firearm to a buyer who \nwill use that firearm to commit a crime of violence or a drug \ntrafficking crime, he is subject to severe criminal penalties. Further, \nif the seller is convicted of that offense, the bill expressly provides \nthat he is not entitled to civil immunities. Thus, he could be sued for \ncompensatory and punitive damages.\n  Some have complained that the bill, as amended, does not impose stiff \nenough penalties on special licensees and special registrants for the \nfailure to obtain a background check. However, current law suspends the \nlicense and imposes a fine on dealers who do not conduct a background \ncheck. Our bill maintains the current penalties for background check \nfailures and imposes tough mandatory minimums for the knowing transfer \nof a firearm to a juvenile who will use that firearm in a crime of \nviolence. That is a major change. And we put it in our bill. In fact, a \nlot of these things that were requested by the President we have in the \nbill. We had them in there before he requested them. I suspect he might \nhave had somebody look at the bill.\n  Further, through our aggressive firearms prosecution program, the \nCUFF Program, and the prosecution reporting requirement, we ensure that \nsome of these violations actually will be prosecuted by the Attorney \nGeneral--something that hasn't been undertaken in earnest over the last \n6 years.\n  Remember, of the thousands of possible cases, the Attorney General \nonly prosecuted one Brady case, one Brady background check violation, \nfrom 1996 through 1998. Of the thousands they claim, 225,000 turned \nback felons, one prosecution.\n  The Lautenberg amendment not only fails to include the tough \nmandatory minimums found in the Republican plan, it acquiesces in the \nAttorney General's almost complete failure to prosecute Brady \nviolations. This makes no sense. If we in Congress pass criminal \nstatutes, it is the duty of the Attorney General to enforce those laws. \nOur bill recognizes that we have a problem at the Department of Justice \nand our bill does something about it. Some have also stated that our \nbill has the potential for invading the privacy of gun owners by \nnonspecial registrants and special licensees to conduct background \nchecks. This argument goes that by requiring the Instant Check operator \nto destroy records of an approved background check immediately, special \nlicensees and special registrants will be able to conduct background \nchecks on anyone, even non-gun buyers, and there will be no audit trail \nto catch them.\n\n  Of course, special licensees and special registrants will have to \nundergo a background check, a field examination, and an interview just \nto obtain their license or registration. And they must keep records of \nthe persons for whom they used the Instant Check system. Thus, the ATF \ncan take these records, contact the persons listed, and determine if \nthey attempted to purchase a gun using the services of the special \nlicensee or the special registrant. If they did not, the special \nlicensee or the special registrant will be held accountable, just as \ndealers are now.\n  Further, gun owners would much rather entrust their privacy interests \nto special licensees and special registrants than to the Federal \nGovernment. The argument that more record keeping on lawful gun \nownership by the Federal Government would protect privacy better than \nless record keeping by the Federal Government carries little weight.\n  Mr. President, all of these concerns are less than compelling. The \nplain fact of the matter is that the revised Lautenberg amendment, \nthough improved to look more like the Republican proposal, is still not \nas good as the current bill as amended.\n  The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide qualified \nimmunity to persons who obey the law and act appropriately with \nfirearms, even after the Senate voted only yesterday to provide \nqualified immunity when parents properly use child safety devices or \nchild trigger locks.\n  The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide tax relief to \nlicensees and others who perform background checks. And the revised \nLautenberg amendment still fails to relieve gun show operators or \norganizers of substantial new recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  Some are complaining that the 24-hour requirement for instant check \nis not good enough. They would require 3 days. But gun shows only last \n3 days. If we do not have a 24-hour instant check requirement, the gun \nshow is going to be over. The ATF has the technology and the funding to \nget the job done in 24 hours, and it should. We should not force people \ninto a black market where there are no licenses, no records, and no \nbackground checks. We do not need to do that.\n  Further, we even offered to make the background check requirement for \nspecial licensees express. But my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle rejected this, or objected to my modification of my own \namendment, one of the few times in my 23 years where a Senator was \nrefused the right to modify his own amendment to please the other \nside--even though it was not necessary, in my view, and I think in the \nview of any reasonable person who looks at it.\n  I want to make sure that persons who sell a substantial number of \nguns come inside the gun show and get a Federal license. These special \nlicensees must submit to a background check and an ATF interview, they \nmust comply with the Gun Control Act, and they must conduct background \nchecks--something that has evolved into something that both sides ought \nto be willing to agree to.\n  Mr. President, there is one firearm-related provision on which I hope \nwe can reach bipartisan agreement. And that is the treatment of pawn \nshops, gunsmiths and repair shops that have traditionally been exempt \nfrom the requirement to conduct background checks when they simply \nreturn a firearm to its owner. Prior to the 1993 Brady law, States \nrequired pawn shops to report the pawn of a firearm to State or local \nlaw enforcement agencies. Thus, there was already a state law check on \nthe firearm. The Brady law, however, when it passed inadvertently \nrequired a Federal background check on returned firearms in addition to \nthe state check. The pawn shops raised concerns because State law \nalready required them to undergo a background check and because waiting \non a background check to be returned before returning a firearm to its \nrightful owner affected their business.\n  Because these were real concerns, many in Congress supported an \nexemption to the Brady law which exempted pawn shops, gunsmiths, and \nrepair shops from the Federal background check. It passed the Congress \nas part of the 1994 crime bill. Many of the people attacking the Hatch-\nCraig amendment's so-called pawn shop loophole voted to do the same \nthing in 1994 when the crime bill passed. Frankly, if what we included \nin the Hatch-Craig amendment is a loophole, it was a loophole when \nSenator Lautenberg voted for the crime bill in 1994 and when President \nClinton signed it into law.\n  Indeed, after the Brady law passed, Senator Schumer even wrote a \nletter to the Treasury Department asking them to draft regulations to \nexempt pawn shops from the Federal background check requirement. To be \nfair, however, I should note that then-Congressman Schumer did vote \nagainst the amendment to the 1994 crime bill that provided the \nstatutory exemption for pawn shops, but he still took a position in his \n1994 letter to the Treasury Department which is consistent with our \namendment.\n  If the pawn shop exemption from a Federal background check is a \nloophole now, it was a loophole in 1994 when Senator Schumer asked the \nTreasury Department to draft it.\n  The Craig amendment that we passed last Wednesday simply restored the \nexemption for pawn shops that had been part of the Brady law for 4 \nyears. Thus, this was not a major change in law, but a change back to \nhow the Brady law read from 1994 to November 1998 when the exemption \nlapsed as the Instant Check system became effective.\n  However, I know that the good Senator from New York has legitimate\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nconcerns and wants to address those concerns. Neither of us want a \nperson to commit a crime and then get a firearm. However, I believe \nneither of us want to overburden legitimate business transactions.\n  As I have stated repeatedly--it is my goal to find common ground on \nthese issues. Wherever possible, I want to do what's best for our \nchildren and the public in a manner which is consistent with our oath \nas Senator to uphold the Constitution. Frankly, I viewed this provision \nas a technical matter--one which should not be politicized.\n  I just have a minute more to go, maybe a minute and a half, because I \nknow there is limited time here.\n  Let me just sum it up.\n  Thus, the revised Lautenberg amendment is a small step in the right \ndirection. And I sincerely appreciate that step. However, in my view, \nit fails to go far enough, and it may create more problems than \ncurrently exist.\n  The current bill as amended strikes the appropriate balance between \nthe privacy interests of law abiding citizens and the public interest \nin preventing criminals from obtaining guns. The powerful incentives \nincluded in our plan will ensure that persons comply with the mandatory \nbackground check requirement on all sales at gun shows. The Republican \nplan also gives law abiding gun owners the peace of mind that they have \nnot inadvertently transferred a firearm to a felon, and requires the \nAttorney General to begin prosecuting the criminals who violate the \nexisting gun control laws, something that has not been done, now, for a \nnumber of years, maybe the whole time of this administration--since the \nBrady bill.\n\n  Accordingly, when the time arrives, I will move to table the revised \nLautenberg amendment in order to allow the bill as currently amended to \nstand, because I think it will do a better job of accomplishing what \neverybody here seems to want, everything the current Lautenberg \namendment will do.\n  I am sorry this took so long. I apologize to my colleagues, but it \nwas important to make these points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I never knew how much control I had over \nthe schedule of debate, other than to find any time I step off the \nfloor for a few minutes I can almost be guaranteed my friend from Utah \nwill have a criticism of the way we are handling things over here.\n  So, while we are both on the floor, I tell him we have pared back to \na dozen or fewer from the 90 possible amendments entered in the consent \nagreement last Friday. We have made significant progress. But also, \nbecause a number of Senators have pulled down amendments over here, \namendments on our side, we have done it notwithstanding what we had to \nput up with when the Senator from New York and I were virtually \nridiculed when we pointed out the flaws in the original Craig-Hatch gun \nlegislation, something that took 2 days of voting and revoting as they \ndrafted and redrafted and redrafted it, as the flaws became evident.\n  They do not want to have up-or-down votes; they want to table \neverything. We have not done that on one the other side came up with \nyesterday that would have walked all over our State legislatures. That \nwas voted down.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are going to have a series of votes \nthis afternoon. If Senators will work at it, we can finish this bill \ntoday. But I say, as I said before, it is the Senators who should set \nthe schedule, it is the Senators who should set the debate, and not the \ngun lobbies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah said we are trying \nto make this amendment look like the Republican amendment. I may want \nto look like the Senator from Utah in many other ways, but we did not \ntry to make this amendment resemble in two very key ways the amendment \nthat was adopted last week.\n  I appreciate very much the concern about the regulation. In fact, as \nI said, the Senator from New Jersey made a number of changes to reduce \nthe regulatory requirements. All we have left are the same regulatory \nrequirements that all licensed gun dealers have to go through.\n  We will see about 3.5 million handguns sold this year through \nlicensed dealers and 2 million in nonlicensed environments. What we are \ntrying to do, for those of us who believe that background checks--there \nare some who do not. There are some who voted against the Brady bill \nand did not like the background checks. That is fine, but I think they \nhave worked. They have reduced in America the number of felons who have \nhandguns. They have reduced the number of people who are dangerous with \nguns from having handguns. It is generally accepted that the evidence \nshows Brady has worked and it has made America safer as a consequence.\n  What we have, though, is a regulatory differential. All of us can \nunderstand that. If one group of people are regulated one way and \nanother group of people are regulated another way, it can produce some \nsignificant distortions in people's behavior.\n  Right now, it is easier to go to the 2,000 to 3,000 gun shows every \nyear and buy a handgun or another gun than it is from a licensed \ndealer. Why? Because you do not have to go through a background check. \nYou do not have to do the same things that you do through a licensed \ndealer. I do not know if the concern about the black market was raised \nwhen Brady was passed. Perhaps it was. We did not create a black market \nwith Brady. We still have people who are either felons or who should \nnot have handguns, who are mentally unstable, or have something in \ntheir background that makes them, in the judgment of law enforcement, \ndangerous to own a gun.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I have 9 minutes left.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield on that point, it is not Brady \nwe are talking about. It is gun shows we are trying to resolve, and if \nwe do not resolve it right, you are going to create a black market.\n  Mr. KERREY. But the Senator said his fear with the regulation is that \nwe are going to have black markets. All we do--and I urge colleagues, \nespecially the public to listen--is we say to a gun show operator, like \nevery other licensed dealer, a gun show promoter has to register with \nATF and pay a small fee.\n  We are not passing on the cost of the background check. Brady does \nnot allow that. I voted against that. It does not allow us to pass on \nthe cost of the background check. All it says to the gun show operator \nis you have to do the same thing a licensed gun dealer has to do. You \nhave to register with ATF and pay a small fee.\n  Secondly, the gun show vendor has to show proof of identification \nwhen they check in at the gun show to verify they are who they claim to \nbe. And the third requirement, hardly a prohibitive burden, in my \njudgment, is they have to notify people at the show that there are \ngoing to be background checks. You can do that with a sign.\n  Neither one of these three things is what I call a burdensome \nregulation, for gosh sakes. They are what licensed dealers have to do, \nexactly what licensed dealers have to do.\n  Again, last week when the Craig-Hatch amendment was adopted, the \nheadline in the Omaha World Herald was: ``Republicans Close Gun Show \nLoophole.'' Under this amendment, this is what you can do to get an \nexception. It is true gun shows will have to do background checks, \nexcept for people who have special licenses. Look who gets a special \nlicense: Somebody who is buying or selling firearms solely or primarily \nat gun shows. That is the first exception. Basically, I am saying, yes, \nif you are a gun show, you have to do a background check, you have to \ndo everything a licensed dealer has to do unless you are a gun show. If \nyou are a gun show, you do not have to do it. That is one of the \nexceptions provided in this law.\n  Again, if you want to go home and say, yes, I voted to close the gun \nshow loophole, right in this thing it says I can get a special license \nto operate a gun show without having to do background checks if I am \nbuying or selling firearms solely or primarily through gun shows. It \ndoes not get the job done.\n  We impose regulations on licensed gun dealers. I have consulted \nlicensed gun dealers in Nebraska. I said earlier, I am a supporter of \nthe second amendment. I believe the right to bear arms\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nmeans something. I believe the right to bear arms does not give me an \nunlimited right to bear arms, just as the first amendment does not give \nme an unlimited right to speak.\n  There are limitations on my right to bear arms. These are reasonable \nlimitations to keep all the rest of us safe. The leading cause of death \nof teenagers in the United States of America is homicides and suicides. \nWe are the only industrial Nation that has that.\n  We are not talking about picking up guns. We are trying to put \nsomething together that, like Brady, will reduce the opportunity of \nfelons and people who have other things in their background which might \nmake them an unreliable owner to have access to guns.\n  This is not an unreasonable regulation. This is exactly what licensed \ngun dealers have to do. The Craig-Hatch amendment simply does not get \nthe job done because it allows somebody to say: I am going to get a \nspecial exemption because I am a gun show operator.\n  Secondly, I do not know the history regarding the loophole having to \ndo with pawnshops, but for gosh sakes, we do not want to allow somebody \nto basically go in to a pawnshop and say: Here is my 357 Magnum, and I \nwould like to get a certificate.\n  Maybe they stole it. A high percentage of people are concerned about \npawnshops doing business, but we want that person to have to go through \na background check when they pick up that gun. It has to be that a \nfairly significant percentage of those guns have been stolen and \nacquired in some way we suspect may put other law-abiding citizens at \nrisk. It is not unreasonable when they come back to redeem their \nhandgun that they have to go through a background check. That is not an \nunreasonable limitation of their second amendment right to bear arms. \nThat is a reasonable limitation.\n  We understand that in a civil society, we have to give up a little \nbit of freedom from time to time in order to have a civil society. We \ndo that. I do not have an unlimited right in freedoms. I have \nresponsibilities as well, Mr. President.\n  This amendment corrects a deficiency in the Hatch-Craig amendment \nthat is terribly important. It will make Americans safer. It will \nreduce the chances at gun shows that people who are dangerous who \nshould not have guns will be able to buy them. It will reduce that \nchance.\n  Is it going to solve all the problems that are associated with \njuvenile crime and violence in America? Absolutely not. But it is \nabsolutely reasonable to say that if you are a gun show, we are going \nto regulate you when it comes to background checks the same way we do a \nlicensed dealer, the same way that we regulate anybody who wants to set \nup a licensed operation: a license from ATF and they have to do \nbackground checks.\n  Sometimes they have local ordinances that are even more severe. In \nOmaha, you have to go to both the police department and to the \nsheriff's office in order to eventually do a transaction when you are \npurchasing a handgun. It may have seemed unreasonable in the beginning, \nbut it is working. It is making our country safer.\n  I hope colleagues who are genuinely trying to close this loophole \nwill consider that this amendment gets the job done; this amendment \nwill make America safer. It is not an unreasonable change in our law. \nFor those of us who believe the right to bear arms has meaning, it is a \nreasonable change. In fact, I think it is going to make it more likely \nthat we will keep the laws that will allow law-abiding Americans to own \nguns and use those guns to hunt, to target practice, and all the other \nlegal applications for which, obviously, guns are used. I hope this \namendment is considered seriously by colleagues who want to close this \nloophole and they will support the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is now 12:19. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from California wants 3 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that she be granted 3 minutes to make her statement, and then I \nalso want to have 1 minute to finish my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah for \nextending me this courtesy.\n  I have been sitting on the Senate floor since about 10 this morning \nlistening to what has been a very fine debate. What I would like to do \nin these 3 minutes is put this whole debate into the context of \nreality.\n  We can talk theoretically, but I think reality has finally begun to \nhit the American people. I think that is why we have seen, finally, \nproper attention given to sensible gun laws.\n  We can see here in the 11 years of the Vietnam war, tragically we \nlost 58,168 of our finest people. That is 58,168 families devastated--\ndevastated--by such a loss. Who knows what the potential of those \npeople would have been? Certainly we know that war brought this country \nto its knees, and whether you supported it or did not, everyone--\neveryone--grieves that loss.\n  In 11 years in America in the war at home, 396,572 gun deaths, I say \nto my friends on both sides of the aisle, 11 years, almost 400,000 of \nour people killed; 396,572 families devastated. Many of those are \nchildren. Every day in this country we have the equivalent of a \nColumbine loss. Thirteen children a day are killed in my home State of \nCalifornia. The No. 1 cause of death to children in my home State--\nGunshots.\n  So what are we trying to do in this debate with the juvenile justice \nbill on both sides? I think we want to make this country safer for \nchildren. The debate comes on how you do it.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah said: You're pushing gun \namendments on us. And just how far do you want to go?\n  My answer, as just one Senator, is: As long as it takes to change \nthis. We have to change the reality that our children face.\n  When you ask parents today, do they feel secure when they send their \nkids off to school, no, they don't.\n  One of the things we could do is close the gun show loophole. Senator \nLautenberg offered us that opportunity. It was voted down narrowly. He \nand Senator Kerrey have teamed up. They have made a few changes which I \nthink strengthen the amendment. We want to try again to close the gun \nshow loophole.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed in the Los Angeles Times by \nJanet Reno be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Los Angeles Times]\n\n                   Let's Close the Gun Show Loophole\n\n                            (By Janet Reno)\n\n       The U.S. Senate has a historic opportunity to make our \n     streets and communities safer by closing the loophole that \n     lets felons, fugitives and other prohibited people buy deadly \n     weapons at gun shows without Brady background checks. Last \n     week, the Senate passed an amendment that not only fails to \n     close the loophole but creates new ones, letting criminals \n     redeem their guns from pawnbrokers without background checks, \n     weakening the Brady checks that currently are made at gun \n     shows and, for the first time in more than 30 years, allowing \n     federal firearms dealers to cross state lines to sell guns.\n       I have watched this debate unfold with sadness, but I \n     remain committed to working with the Senate on this issue. In \n     1993, we worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Brady \n     law, which has prevented more than 250,000 felons and others \n     who should not have guns from getting them. I am hopeful that \n     we can regain this spirit of bipartisanship and, together, \n     take the common-sense step of expanding the Brady law's \n     protections to gun shows.\n       So far, the Senate has passed two gun show amendments, but \n     neither one actually closes the gun show loophole. Although \n     the second proposal is in some ways better than the original, \n     regrettably--and contrary to some reports--the modified \n     amendment leaves the most dangerous loopholes of the original \n     amendment untouched and adds at least one more, by weakening \n     the Brady checks currently done at gun shows.\n       While the new proposal would require some buyers to get \n     background checks at gun shows, it would not ensure that all \n     such sales go through a check. Moreover, it cuts back the \n     time that law enforcement has to complete a Brady background \n     check from three business days to 24 hours, even though the \n     court records that are sometimes needed to finish the check \n     are unavailable on weekends when most gun shows take place. \n     This increases the chances that criminals will be able to buy \n     weapons at weekend gun shows, because if the background check \n     cannot be completed within 24 hours, the criminal can get the \n     gun. Although more than 70% of Brady background checks can be \n     completed within minutes, some require law enforcement \n     officers to track down additional records.\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n       With all of the flaws and loopholes created by this \n     amendment, even in its modified version, is there a better \n     alternative? Fortunately, there is. Last November, President \n     Clinton directed Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and me to \n     make recommendations on closing the gun show loophole. We \n     published a report in January that lays out a streamlined \n     approach using federally licensed firearms dealers to do all \n     the background checks at gun shows, even for unlicensed \n     sellers. We also proposed a way to get limited information \n     about the makes and models of guns sold so that we would have \n     the ability to trace the guns if they were later used in a \n     crime. In contrast, the amendment passed Friday will decrease \n     our tracing ability, because checks will be done by people \n     who have no obligation to cooperate with tracing requests.\n       Our proposal allows gun shows as we know them to continue \n     but ensures that no one who is barred from having a gun can \n     buy one at a gun show. The carefully drafted bill by Sen. \n     Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) follows many of our \n     recommendations.\n       There is still time for the Senate to revisit this \n     important issue and adopt legislation that plugs the gun show \n     loophole once and for all. We want to work with Congress to \n     develop sound, workable and effective proposals to close \n     loopholes in our gun laws. The current amendment, even as \n     modified, moves us in the wrong direction.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I simply say that Janet Reno has talked here about why it \nis important to try to finally close this loophole. She points out that \nthe Senators on the other side who offered their loophole closing \nsimply did not close the loophole. Senator Kerrey pointed out that new \ndesignation of dealers who were exempted.\n  The pawnshop loophole, let me talk about that, my friends. This \nweakens the law from its current status.\n  I ask for 30 additional seconds, and then I will close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The pawnshop loophole, which was opened up by my friends \non the other side, if you are going to a pawnshop, you are five times \nmore likely to be a criminal. What they do is to say no background \nchecks anymore. What else do they do to weaken the current law? They \nsay that you can only have 24 hours to finish the background check at a \ngun show.\n  My friends, in 20 percent of those cases they need more time; they \nhave to call the FBI. The FBI is telling us that isn't a good step; it \nis going the create more death and destruction.\n  So, in closing, let me urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto finally close this loophole in the right way and support the \nLautenberg-Kerrey legislation.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Utah for his generous \nspirit in giving me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. I may need a little bit more than that because of Senator \nKerrey's remarks and the remarks of the Senator from California. So I \nwill ask unanimous consent when I do that.\n  Senator Kerrey says a lot of pawnshop guns could be stolen. But let \nme remind the Senator that State law already requires a check with \nState or local law enforcement agencies. If the gun is stolen, the \nState law catches this. So the Lautenberg amendment does not do \nanything particularly good on that.\n  Without the special license provision, gunsmiths and others will not \ngo into a regulated gun show. It is just that simple. These people \ngenerally do not have to be licensed now. Under the bill as currently \namended, we require them to keep records and to comply with all of the \nprovisions of the Gun Control Act. If we regulate gun shows without a \nspecial licensee, we will force these people into the black market. So \nlet's require them to be licensed. That is one of the points I was \nmaking there. All the other points I made I do not think have been \nrebutted at all.\n  Mr. President, we now reach that point where we have the debate on \nfour amendments, 10 minutes equally divided. We will begin with the \nWellstone amendment No. 358; then we will go to the Sessions amendment \nNo. 357; then to the Ashcroft amendment No. 361; and then the Santorum \namendment No. 360, with the votes to occur beginning at 1 p.m., as I \nunderstand it.\n  Should we go with Sessions first? I will be happy to do that. Let me \nrearrange the order. We will start with Sessions amendment No. 357, \nthen Wellstone amendment No. 358, then Ashcroft amendment No. 361, and \nthen Santorum amendment No. 360. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 357\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is there a time agreement on this \ndebate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, from time to time, those of us in \nCongress hear complaints about governmental literature, brochures, \npamphlets, and booklets paid for by the taxpayers who believe there is \ncontained within them messages, content, material, tendencies, and \nphilosophies that they believe are unjustified.\n  It is not possible, frankly, for us to manage that, as probably most \npeople think we do. Particularly, this juvenile crime bill will produce \nabout $1 billion in new spending for juvenile crime, and over half of \nthat will be for prevention. Much of it will then be used, as part of \nthe prevention effort, to produce certain literature that will be used \nin schools and other organizations.\n  So the question is: What do we do about it? Someone suggested that, \nwell, you need to pass a law that prohibits them from spending money \nwhich says things that may offend me. I am not sure how we could write \na law that would say that. I am not sure we even ought to attempt to do \nthat.\n  But there is a problem, a disquiet, an unease in America about some \nof the material getting printed at taxpayers' expense. Both liberals \nand conservatives sometimes are not happy with material. So I thought \nthis would be a suggestion that we might try with regard to the funds \nexpended under this juvenile offender accountability grant program that \nwe have.\n  There would be a disclaimer, language placed on all literature funded \nby this bill. It would simply say this: ``These materials are printed \nat Government expense.''\n  In addition, it would have these words: ``If you object to the \naccuracy of the material, the completeness of the material, the \nrepresentations in the material, including objections to the material's \ncharacterizations of persons' religious beliefs, you are encouraged to \ndirect your comments to the Office of the Attorney General of the \nUnited States.''\n  It directs the Attorney General to designate an office. There is an \naddress that will be put on the literature to receive the material and \nto periodically, every 6 months, send a summary to the Congress of what \nthe comments received were, because we are funding these materials.\n  When we send a grant to a certain community to do a drug treatment \nprogram, a mental health program, or an antiviolence program, the \nMembers of this body may not know what was in that material. Oftentimes \npeople get it and they do not like it. They think it is inaccurate or \nunfair. I think they ought to have a chance to express that.\n  I do not know how anybody could believe this would be an \nobjectionable thing. If the Government is going to fund the literature, \npeople ought to be told that they can object and where they can send \ntheir objection. If there are numerous objections, we can take a look \nat them. If it is inaccurate or discriminates against a particular \ngroup, then we ought to be prepared to ask questions in our oversight \ncapacity in Congress. As chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, \nwe have oversight over the Office of Juvenile Justice programs. We look \nat Office of Juvenile Justice programs. So if we are getting a lot of \ncomplaints about the material, we can raise that with them and make \nsure they are exercising legitimate supervision over those materials.\n\n  It is a simple amendment. I do not think it would cost anything. The \nAttorney General could certainly be able to receive these materials, \nassemble them, and summarize them for the Congress. They could be \nmaintained so that if anybody wanted to, they could go read the \ncomplaints. I think it would result in high-quality literature. In \nfact, I think that if a person knows when they are producing literature \nthat it is required to put on it information concerning complaints and \nwriting the Attorney General of the United States, they are probably \ngoing to take more care to see that the material is produced accurately \nand fairly.\n  Those are the comments I have on that at this time.\n  On the other matter regarding gun shows, I think that what is \nfrustrating\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nthe people that I am hearing from, and that I think most of us are \nhearing from, is that people who go to gun shows are good people. A gun \nshow is a traditional thing.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They are getting tired of being blamed. These are good \npeople. The murder rate in Washington, DC, is one of the highest in \nAmerica. Who suggests that the guns criminals have here come from gun \nshows? That is not where guns used in crime are coming from. What I am \nhearing is, let us prosecute the criminals with the guns. That is why \nGeneral Reno's comments are, to me, frustrating, almost irritating, \nbecause during her watch we have seen a collapse of the prosecution of \ncriminals with guns, a 40-percent decline. At the same time, we want to \nshift burdens on people who are not committing crimes. That is what is \ncausing the tension here.\n  Senator Hatch has worked very hard with the Members of the Democratic \nParty to try to reach an agreement in which we can maintain accurate \ncontrols over guns that are sold in gun shows and so forth but, at the \nsame time, not burden excessively innocent people.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not know of any opposition to the \namendment or anybody to speak on it. I wonder if the minority will \nyield back its time?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we reserve the time in \nopposition to this amendment and we move on to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the \ntime charged to the proponents on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the \ntime charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 358, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment, as modified, be sent to the desk. I believe this has been \ncleared with the other side. It is technical. There were some original \ncosponsors, Senator Mikulski and Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is the \nchange that was sent? I am sorry.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The amount of money originally was improperly \ndesignated. I also added two original cosponsors.\n  Mr. HATCH. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 358), as modified, is printed in \ntoday's Record under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just start out by saying that \none of the real weaknesses in this legislation as it is now written is \nthat there is no specificity about the allowable use of funding for \nschool-based counseling or mental health services to all students \nthrough qualified counselors or psychologists or social workers.\n  My colleague, Senator Sessions, has referred to other activities that \ncan be used to prevent juvenile delinquency, but this phrase is vague. \nIt gives no encouragement to schools to use the funding that they need \nto have the counselors.\n  The only place where we really might see an opportunity for \ncounseling services would be in boot camps and community-based projects \nand services, but kids already have to be delinquents in order to \nreceive this kind of counseling.\n  Mr. President, what I say here today is that I do not know about \nother colleagues, but as I travel Minnesota, what I hear more than \nanything else, above and beyond the need to get tougher on guns, is, \nSenator, we need more counselors. We need to have an infrastructure of \nsupport for our children in our schools. This amendment is the 100,000 \nschool counselors amendment.\n  This amendment would call for funding from the Federal Government, on \na one-third, one-third, one-third matching basis. It would be $340 \nmillion a year over the next 5 years. Now, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle may stand up and say: This is $340 million a year.\n  To that, I say to my colleagues on the other side: When are we going \nto get serious? We continue to talk about children. We continue to talk \nabout our concern for children. Now we are talking more and more about \nour concern for at-risk children. Now we are talking more and more \nabout how to get to kids before they get into trouble. And what we hear \nall across our land from our educators, from women and men who are \nworking with children every day, is that we don't have the funding for \ncounselors.\n  Mr. President, right now we have an average of about 1 counselor per \n500 students across the land. One counselor for 500 students. That \ncounselor can't even begin to reach out and help some of the kids who \nare in trouble.\n  This is a huge weakness in this legislation. If we want to get to \nkids before they get into trouble, if we want to respond to the voice \nin the country about what we need to do better--and I hear this from \neveryone in Minnesota--then we need to support this 100,000 school \ncounselors amendment. There is nothing we can do that would be more \nimportant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? Who yields time in opposition to the amendment? Who \nyields time in opposition to the Wellstone amendment No. 358?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Missouri is here, and when he is \nready, I will yield to him.\n  Mr. President, I am not hearing every day that what we need as a No. \n1 priority of schools in America is more counselors. There are a lot of \nneeds in schools. Maybe we need to expand Head Start, maybe we need \nother programs, maybe we need computers, or mentoring programs, some of \nwhich work well. We have not had hearings on it. This is an issue that \nought to be raised in the Senator's Education Committee, and it ought \nnot to be part of a crime bill at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me once again start by complimenting \nthe Senator from Minnesota's commitment to the problems associated with \nmental health conditions.\n  I share his commitment, but I have a number of grave concerns about \nhis amendment to provide $1 billion a year in new funding to hire over \n100,000 school-based mental health personnel.\n  As I noted in my statement yesterday, there is no evidence whatsoever \nto support the assertion that the recent tragedies in Colorado and \nOregon would have been prevented by having more school counselors.\n  Let me reiterate what I observed yesterday: it has been reported that \nboth Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gotten fairly extensive \nindividual counseling, had undergone anger-management training and had \ngotten affirmative evaluations from counselors.\n  One of Dylan Klebold's teachers had expressed concern about some of \nthe things he was writing in English class to a counselor.\n  It has also been reported that the 15-year-old Oregon killer, Kip \nKinkel was currently in counseling, along with his parents, when he \nkilled them and went on to kill two of his classmates and injure a \nnumber of others.\n  Please don't misunderstand me, Mr. President, I do not want in any \nway to undercut the very fine and vital work done by counselors in my \nstate of Utah\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nand around the country. I respect them. Their work is important and \nvaluable and I support their efforts 100 percent.\n  I merely make the point that more counselors would not have prevented \nthese recent tragedies.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I have an \nalmost knee-jerk reaction whenever I hear that the federal government \nis--once again--attempting to micromanage public education.\n  I believe that we can best support our local schools by adequately \nfunding current federal education programs and allowing state and local \neducation agencies the flexibility to make important education \ndecisions unencumbered by federal regulation.\n  I sincerely beleive that $1 billion of new federal taxpayer dollars \nwill not do as much to encourage a renewed commitment to strengthen \nmental health outreach as local school boards, parent groups and local \ncivic mental health and law enforcement organizations working together.\n  This amendment is a Washington knows best, big money, unfunded answer \nto complicated questions that can best be addressed through local \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I get am getting a little tired of seeing some of our \ncolleagues throwing money at issues without regard to costs. I am \ngeting a little tired of hearing that the answer to everything around \nhere is simply to throw more money at it. There is no question that \ncounselors can be effective, but a lot of other things are too, and we \nhave a lot of effective programs in this bill. Frankly, it is time to \nget this bill passed and quit delaying it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is a modified amendment. It is for $340 million a \nyear, not $1 billion, as the Senator said. All Senators should know \nthat.\n  Second of all, I get a little tired of Senators talking about how \nmuch we care about kids and education, and we can't have our schools \nand school districts put in some money, which we will match, so we can \nhave more support services for these kids. We gave $8 billion more for \nthe Pentagon than the President wanted. We got money for breaks for oil \ncompanies and money for breaks for all sorts of other special \ninterests. But all of a sudden we don't have the money to provide \nresources for these school districts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we continue to throw money at these \nproblems and not solve them. First, the Senator's bill called for $1 \nbillion and now it calls for $340,000,000. Which one is it? And how do \nwe know that this latest amount is what is needed? We can't keep \npulling extraordinary amounts of money out of thin air and justify \nspending the amounts because problems may exist. We continue to take \ntime on this floor to delay a bill that can help solve these problems. \nThe fact is that we take care of a lot of these problems in the bill \nwithout throwing an inordinate amount of money toward them.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I resent the accusation that this is \ntaking up time and delaying this bill.\n  Senator, if you were worried about at-risk kids and helping kids \nbefore they get into trouble and wind up incarcerated and committing \nviolent crimes, then you would want to support the kind of support \nservices we can provide in schools.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't want to take too much time, but I \nwill take 30 more seconds.\n  Look, you are not the only Senator on this floor who cares about \nkids. I have a record of 23 years of leading a fight for most of the \nchildren's programs that have passed here. And every one of them takes \ninto carefull consideration how much money should or should not be \nspent--child care, the child health insurance bill; you name it, I have \nbeen there. Right now, I am raising over $2 million for the Pediatric \nAIDS Foundation. I don't need to be lectured by the Senator from \nMinnesota, whose answer to everything is to throw more money at every \nproblem.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to respond to that comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object, unless it is for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I can do it in 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator, I would never criticize your record. You are \na friend. But I intend to respond to the remarks you made on the floor \nof the Senate that this kind of an amendment is taking up people's time \nand delaying passage of this bill. This is very relevant to what we \nneed to do to help kids before they get into trouble. I am surprised \nthat my colleague, with all of his good work, doesn't understand that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 361\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will proceed to \namendment No. 361, sponsored by Senator Ashcroft, with 10 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to thank a number of Senators \nbefore I begin making my remarks because this amendment is the \nculmination of the work of a number of individuals, including Senators \nHutchison, DeWine, Allard, Abraham of Michigan, Gregg of New Hampshire, \nHelms of North Carolina, and Senator Coverdell of Georgia. All of these \nindividuals participated to assemble the components of this amendment, \nwhich is an amendment designed to promote safety in our schools and to \nprevent violence in our schools. So I thank all of those Senators. If \nany of them comes to the floor, I will happily yield to them for them \nto give particular emphasis to the items they brought to the table \nhere.\n  This amendment contains a number of provisions that give schools and \ncommunities additional ways to prevent youth violence. It would free \nlocal school districts to put Federal money to use where the Federal \nmoney will do the most good to prevent future violence.\n  Under this amendment, schools will be able to choose where best to \nspend Federal resources under titles 4 and 6 of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. These are allowable uses which would include \nviolence prevention training, school safety equipment such as metal \ndetectors, or for school resource officers.\n  The amendment clarifies that nothing in Federal law stands in the way \nof a local decision to introduce a dress code or school uniform policy. \nWithout taking the time at this moment, a number of schools would like \nto be able to do this. In the places where they have been able to do \nit, they have found that it reduces violence and increases student \nproductivity. It has been good.\n  This would allow schools, if they are going to use their Federal \nresources, to use them, and one of the permissible ways would be to \ninvest in establishing such a policy.\n  The amendment contains a provision that provides certain liability \nprotections for school personnel when they undertake reasonable actions \nto maintain order and discipline in safe educational circumstances or \nto promote an environment of safety for education. This is a very \nimportant provision. This one, sponsored by Senator Coverdell of \nGeorgia, offers teachers limited civil liability against frivolous and \narbitrary lawsuits.\n  We don't really need for teachers, who need to be involved in \ndisciplining students, to be thinking about the fact that they are \ngoing to be sued if they exercise the right kind of discipline.\n  The limits are reasonable. They are against frivolous and arbitrary \nlawsuits--the kind of limit that we placed to help encourage \nvolunteerism last year when we had the Volunteer Protection Act. That \nis the kind of thing we want to do to make sure that teachers can have \nbetter control and are free to take necessary steps to provide \ndiscipline in the classroom.\n\n  Senator Helms' language makes certain that a school discipline record \nfollows a student when a student transfers to another public or private \nschool. The language allows schools to run background checks on any \nschool employee who works with children. I think this is reasonable. We \nshould\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nknow who the individuals are who are employed in our schools. Providing \nthis kind of capacity and opportunity is a step in the right direction, \na step forward. It is necessary for schools, especially given the \nmobility of students and families, to be able to know about the \ndiscipline record of a student who comes to the school. Learning too \nlate can be a deadly matter, as I learned a few years ago in a tragic \ncase in St. Louis, where a student transferred from one school to the \nnext and the discipline record didn't follow. And before they learned \nof this student's propensity to stalk young women, he murdered another \nstudent, stalking a woman, a young woman, into the restroom of a high \nschool.\n  Senator DeWine has a provision that allows the coordination of \nadolescent mental health and substance abuse services. That is part of \nthis amendment.\n  The amendment includes language from Senator Abraham that allows \nschools to use Safe and Drug Free Schools funds for drug testing. \nStudents who are the subject of serious discipline problems may well be \nbetter off if we have the capacity of asking them to undergo drug \ntests. We fund it and provide the availability or the freedom to use \nfunds in that respect.\n  I really want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this task \nforce: Senators DeWine, Hutchinson, Gregg, Allard, Coverdell, Helms, \nand Hatch.\n  I look forward to the passage of these proposals that are included in \nthis education task force package: The amendments on school safety and \nviolence prevention, and safety and security in our schools.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  By the way, the Chair informs the Senator from Missouri that his time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri thanks the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the Sessions \namendment No. 357, and I understand there is time in opposition. Am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining on that time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, notwithstanding my friendship with the \nSenator from Alabama, I will oppose his amendment.\n  The amendment mandates that all Federal, State, or local governments \nand nongovernmental entities that receive any funds under this bill \nhave to place a written disclaimer on all materials produced or \ndistributed to the public.\n  The amendment also mandates the Attorney General report every six \nmonths to Congress on all public comments received based on these \ndisclaimers, although it doesn't say how many hundreds of people may \nhave to be hired to do this.\n  The amendment is unfortunate. We are trying to pass a serious and \ncomprehensive bill to address juvenile crime. I don't understand why \nthe other side would be insisting on placing a one-paragraph disclaimer \non all publications from any entity that receives funds under this \nbill. It would apply to any nonprofit organization that uses Federal \nsupport under this bill.\n\n  For example, suppose the Boys and Girls Clubs used it to set up an \nafterschool process. Do they have to put a disclaimer on it? Suppose \nthey have a leaflet passed out saying: Come at 5:30 to play softball, \nbut we want you to have this disclaimer, and if you have any comments \nabout it, write to the Attorney General so the Attorney General can \nreport to the Congress.\n  I can see it: I was called out at third base. I don't think I was \nout. What is the Attorney General going to do about this?\n  That is what this disclaimer asks for.\n  What about the Red Cross? Well, they gave me a lousy cookie when I \ncame in to donate blood. I want to know what the Attorney General is \ngoing to do about it.\n  The amendment is also dangerous because it can siphon off funds that \ncan be used to prevent juvenile crime and punish juvenile offenders. It \nplaces an unfunded mandate on Federal, State, and local governments. It \ntakes resources away from real crime-fighting programs. Nobody knows \nhow much it is going to cost State, Federal, and local governments and \nnonprofit organizations to comply with this disclaimer requirement.\n  How much does it cost the Department of Justice? I would like to know \nhow much it is going to cost for the 6-month reporting requirements. \nObviously, the Department of Justice should have people devoted to \ncrime fighting and who will be there to tally reports. And it will not \nbe fanciful to think of somebody who got called out at third base in a \nsoftball game put together by the Boys and Girls Clubs who thinks the \nAttorney General should look into it.\n  The Department of Justice already prints its name and address on all \npublications. Why a further unfunded mandate?\n  Unless we have questions and answers about how much it is going to \ncost and how much it is going to take away from real crime fighting, I \nwould oppose it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? This is in opposition to the \nAshcroft amendment.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe we have 5 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is harmless, though I question how \neffective and useful it is.\n  It provides for some coordinated mental health services at the level. \nBut there is already some limited mental health coverage in the \nunderlying bill. And I find it interesting that the Senator from \nMissouri rejected our proposal to give SAMHSA the resources to really \ndo the job.\n  The amendment provides for background checks on school employees. \nThat's already allowable under current law.\n  It allows schools to require uniforms. There is nothing to prohibit \nthat now.\n  It creates a Commission on Character. That is fine.\n  But if we really wanted to make a difference, we would fulfill the \ncommitment made last year to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 new \nteachers. Teachers should not have to do crowd control.\n  If we really wanted to make a difference, we would help communities \nbuild new classrooms and schools and modernize their facilities. This \nmeans smaller classes and smaller schools, so teachers and school \nofficials get to know the children they teach. You have heard of ``road \nrage.'' Well some schools have ``hall rage,'' where hallways are so \ncrowded they actually increase violence in schools.\n  If we really wanted to make a difference, we would expand after \nschool programs to attend to children in the afternoons--keeping them \noff the streets and out of trouble. Each day, 5 million children are \nleft home alone after school, and that is unacceptable.\n  If you asked parents what is most important to reducing youth \nviolence--uniforms or smaller classes--I am certain that smaller \nclasses would win hands down.\n  If you asked parents what is most important--a character commission \nor after school programs--the after school programs would win hands \ndown.\n  If you asked parents what is most important--to reiterate that you \ncan conduct background checks on teachers or building more classrooms \nand better classrooms--the better classrooms would win hands down.\n  So I see nothing harmful in this amendment, but I hope we can get to \nthe real issues that concern parents and communities--smaller classes, \nbetter schools, more after school programs.\n  I withhold the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is time being reserved?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on this amendment has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 360\n\n  We will now move to amendment No. 360.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to support my amendment. The \namendment is offered to address a problem in this country which we have \ntalked a lot about here, which is the short amount of time that people \nserve\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\nin prison and, in fact, are sentenced to prison for the most violent of \ncrimes in our society.\n  The chart says the average prison time served for rape in this \ncountry is only 5\\1/2\\ years, and that, by the way, is a slight \nincrease over the past dozen or so years. Average prison time served \nfor child molestation is 4 years; 4 years for child molestation. The \naverage time served for homicide is just 8 years.\n  These statistics are for time served. Time sentenced, in many cases, \nis just a little bit more than that, but not significantly more than \nthat.\n  It is a very serious problem, particularly in the area of raping and \nsexually molesting a child, where the recidivism rate is very high, \nwhere we are putting back on the street to terrorize our citizenry, \npeople who should be incarcerated for a much longer period of time.\n  A group of Members, Matt Salmon in the House of Representatives, and \nI in the Senate, have introduced a bill called Aimee's law, named after \nAimee Willard, a victim of a horrible rape and murder in the city of \nPhiladelphia by a man, Arthur Bomar, who was released from prison in \nNevada--released after murdering someone in Nevada, released after not \nserving his full sentence. By the way, he was violent in Nevada and had \nassaulted a woman while in prison, but Nevada let him out early. \nUnfortunately, Arthur Bomar found Aimee Willard and Aimee was brutally \nmurdered and raped.\n  Aimee's mom, Gail Willard, has put together a group of people who \nsaid it is time to get people who are convicted of these horrible \ncrimes to serve out their sentences and to send a message to States--\nmany States in this country have very light sentences for many of these \ncrimes--to send a message to States that we want tougher sentencing \nlaws on the books for these violent crimes and violent criminals.\n  Matt Salmon introduced in the House, and I introduced an amendment in \nthe Senate, which does something very simple: If someone is released \nfrom prison as a result of these kinds of violent acts, they are \nreleased from prison and go to another State and they commit one of \nthese crimes, that the State that released that prisoner has to pay the \ncosts of apprehension, prosecution, and incarceration to the State that \nhas to deal with this person that they let out of jail.\n  It takes the Federal funding stream--we have Federal funds that go to \nall the States--and basically takes some of those Federal funds and \nshifts them from one State to another. It is a matter of disignating \nsome Federal funds, rather than to Pennsylvania, because Pennsylvania \nlet someone out early and that convicted felon went to Ohio and \ncommitted a crime--Pennsylvania would lose Federal funds--to Ohio to \npay for the apprehension, prosecution and incarceration of that \ncriminal.\n  This is a bill supported by 39 victims' rights organizations, \nincluding: KlaasKids Foundation and Polly Klaas' father, Marc Klaas; \nFred Goldman; Gail Willard; the Fraternal Order of Police; Law \nEnforcement Alliance of America; International Children's Rights \nResource Center; Justice for All; National Association of Crime \nVictims' Rights; the Women's Coalition.\n  The above mentioned people and organizations and a variety of other \nnational organizations consider this one of their highest priority \nbills, to send a message that if a State has very lenient sentencings \nand they let someone out, that State will get hit with a bill; that \nState will lose some of their Federal block grant funds.\n  We want tougher sentences and we want truth in sentences. We have \nprovisions in this amendment that say if you don't live up to truth in \nsentencing and you are not a truth-in-sentencing State, you can be \nliable if someone gets out of jail in one of those States and goes to \nanother State and commits a similar crime. You can lose Federal funds.\n  We are trying to send a very clear message that these crimes should \nbe dealt with seriously. A child molester who receives 4 years in \nprison, when you consider the recidivism rate, is an abomination.\n  We have 134,000 convicted sex offenders right now living in our \ncommunities because of these kind of laws and because of the \nenforcement and prosecution and leniency by our courts or by our parole \nsystems. We have to do something about this to protect our children, to \nprotect our society from the rapists and child molesters and murderers \nin our society.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator has 5 minutes in \nopposition.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not oppose this amendment. I think it \nis, as drafted, extremely complicated and can create a great deal of \nproblems with some States to the extent it overrides their ability to \nmake determinations of who they go after and how. I understand what the \nSenator from Pennsylvania wants. I encourage that we accept the \namendment.\n  Of course, he is entitled to a vote if he wishes, and between now and \nconference we might work more on the language to see if there are areas \nof unnecessary complication that could be removed.\n  I do not oppose the amendment. I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Santorum amendment aims at trying to \nreduce the number of tragedies that result when persons convicted of \nserious offenses obtain early release and then repeat the offense.\n  But the mechanism it selects to advance that goal is so unworkable \nthat it will undermine its laudable purpose. The same crime is defined \ndifferently by different States. Average terms of imprisonment imposed \nby States are different from average actual lengths of imprisonment. \nIndeed, that is part of the problem. Those are just two of the \nunworkable parts of Sec. (c)(1)(C)(ii).\n  One big problem in Sec. (c)(1)(B) is that the cost of incarceration \nof an individual can't be known unless one can predict his or her life \nexpectancy.\n  An unworkable procedure will not help this cause. It will set it \nback, I am afraid, and I cannot vote for it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am saddened by the tragic \ncircumstances that have motivated my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania to offer his amendment. It is understandable that \nconcerned citizens hope to avoid crime committed by people who are \nreleased from prison. And I might favor states increasing the length of \nsentences of violent offenders. But that choice should be that of the \nstates, and not one essentially forced on states by the Federal \nGovernment for fear of losing their criminal assistance funds. That \nview by itself leads me to oppose this amendment, although the \nparticular way in which this amendment will operate causes me \nparticular concern.\n  States are not mere appendages of the federal government to be called \nupon to do the Federal Government's bidding every time we think we've \ngot a good idea. State sentencing for state crime is a state matter.\n  The amendment provides that in any case in which a person is \nconvicted of murder, rape, or a dangerous sexual offense as defined by \nstate law, and that person previously has been convicted of that \noffense in another state, the state of the prior conviction will have \ndeducted from the federal criminal justice funds it receives, and \ntransferred to the state where the subsequent offense occurred, the \ncost of the apprehension, prosecution, and incarceration of the \noffender, unless the original state has: (1) adopted the federal truth \nin sentencing guidelines; (2) imposed a sentence on persons for these \noffenses that is at least 10 percent above the average term of \nimprisonment for that offense that is imposed in all states; and (3) \nmade the particular offender serve at least 85 percent of his sentence.\n  Mr. President, my opposition to this provision is based primarily on \nfederalism. States should be free to adopt the sentences that they \nchoose. They should also be able to adopt the parole policies of their \nchoice. States that impose short sentences or lenient parole policies \nwill bear most of the cost themselves if released criminals commit \nfuture offenses.\n  Under this amendment, states must adopt the federal sentencing \nguidelines if they wish to be certain to avoid losing federal funds. \nThe states will have their sentencing policies for these offenses not \ndrafted by their state legislators in their state capitals, nor even by \nCongress. State judges will lose the ability to exercise whatever \ndiscretion in sentencing their states permit. Instead, the unelected \nbureaucrats of the\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nUnited States Sentencing Commission will set the sentences for state \ncriminals who commit these offenses. I have no criticism of these \nindividuals pursuing the task that Congress has given them, \nparticularly since their work is subject to congressional review. But \nthey were not and should not be given the power to set state sentences, \nunanswerable to the states who will be forced to silently acquiesce to \ntheir efforts.\n  In addition, a state seeking to retain its federal funding by \ncomplying with the three conditions of this amendment would incur much \ngreater expense than any loss of funds it would sustain if it were not \nto comply with the conditions. States who seek to sentence at more than \n110 percent of the average will be required to spend huge sums on new \nprisons to hold these offenders. In addition to construction costs, \nthere will be additional costs of personnel and other operating \nexpenses. Such long sentences will also mean that the states will incur \nhuge medical expenses for older prisoners, for fear of losing federal \nfunds if they were released and committed new offenses. If a state \nwanted to incur these costs without this amendment, it could do so, but \nthis bill will for all practical purposes force states to do so without \nfunding any of the resulting costs. In addition, states sentencing for \nsuch a long duration may not be sentencing wisely. Some offenders \ndeserve parole. Not all offenders are incorrigible. Some offenders can \nbe helped by religion or counseling to lead law abiding lives, \nreturning to their families, safely living among the community, \navoiding the need for states to incur costly prison expenses, and \nactually becoming productive, taxpaying citizens. This amendment \nessentially deprives a state of that choice, and may result in the \nunjustified continuation of imprisonment of certain persons, harming \nthat person, his family, the community, and taxpayers generally.\n  The 110 percent of the national average sentence requirement is \ntroubling for other reasons as well. By definition, half the states \nwill be below average, and even a larger number will not sentence for \n110 percent or more of the national average. That will mean that most \nstates will not be able to avoid the risk of losing their federal \nfunds, no matter how hard they try to comply with the amendment's \nconditions. And since the average is not static, a state that is above \n110 percent in one year may not be at that level the following year. As \na result, the amendment would result in states continuously increasing \ntheir sentences in what will probably be a vain effort to be one of the \nabove average states. And how will the average be calculated? Is a 99 \nyear sentence longer or shorter than a life sentence? Is a death \nsentence imposed after 5 years longer or shorter than a life sentence \nwithout parole? I suppose states will have an incentive under this bill \nto adopt not only a death penalty, but to sentence the defendant to \n1000 years besides. It is not Washington's business whether or not a \nstate has a death penalty for state crimes. That decision should be \nmade by the people of a state and no one else, consistent with \nconstitutional requirements.\n  Apart from opposing this amendment on federalism grounds, I also note \nthe existence of significant drafting problems that will result in what \nI am sure the sponsors would consider to be unintended consequences. \nFor instance, the amendment defines ``murder'' and ``rape'' by \nreference to state law. But some states will never be in a situation in \nwhich a person convicted of murder has been released from serving a \nmurder sentence or rape sentence in their state. For instance, Vermont \nhas no crime of rape, but only sexual assault. No one can be convicted \nof rape who was convicted of rape previously in Vermont. Wisconsin has \nno rape or murder statutes, but simply intentional homicide and sexual \nassault. One can well imagine that if this amendment passes, states \nwill manipulate the label placed on various conduct so that it can make \nsure to convict persons for ``murder'' or ``rape'' however defined \nunder another state's law--and in such a way as now not remotely \nconsidered to constitute these crimes--while convicting persons in \ntheir own state for ``intentional homicide'' or ``sexual assault.'' \nThat kind of manipulation will produce virtual anarchy. While the House \ncompanion bill avoids this particular problem because it defines these \noffenses without regard to state law, I note that the House bill is \nequally objectionable in its own way, since the crimes that it covers \nare broader than the Senate bill, extending to crimes that few would \nconsider exceptionally serious, and thus causing greater expense to the \nstates than the Senate bill if loss of funds is to be avoided. \nMoreover, under the House bill, unlike this amendment, a state is never \nfree from the risk of losing funding, since it will be liable for a \nreleased offender's offense for the rest of his life, regardless of the \nlength of his sentence or actual imprisonment before release.\n  We have eliminated parole at the federal level. But there are many \nfewer federal than state parolees. If a state would rather spend money \non education or effective prevention programs than on very long \nsentences, it should be able to do so without federal interference. \nSome prisoners may deserve parole. Others may not. And so long as there \nis parole, as in every other human endeavor, mistakes will occasionally \nbe made, sometimes with serious consequences. The people who make those \ndecisions and the state lawmakers--not federal lawmakers--should \ncontinue to set parole policy, and they should continue to be held \naccountable by the people of their states for those decisions. The \ntrack record of Congress in knowing just how crime should be punished \nshould give pause to anyone who thinks states and the American people \nwould necessarily benefit more from a congressionally mandated approach \nto this issue than from experimentation among the states.\n  Mr. President, I sympathize with those who are the victims of crimes \ncaused by parolees. I understand the sincere motives of my colleagues \nwho support this legislation. But I strongly believe that it is \nmisguided and runs counter to our system of federalism. It will cost \nstates billions of dollars without any guarantee of retaining full \nfederal funding. It may prevent sensible parole policies in particular \ncases. I have also pointed out a number of practical problems with the \namendment's drafting. For all of these reasons, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \nask for the yeas and nays on all four of the remaining amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I have offered this amendment with \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Harkin. This amendment would provide $340 \nmillion a year for 100,000 school counselors, social workers and child \npsychologists to back them up.\n  Everywhere you go, you hear from people at the school district level: \nWe will contribute money, but can you get some money to us so we can \nhave more counselors in our school so that we can give more support to \nthese kids before they get into trouble?\n  You will not hear your education community and your teachers and men \nand women who work with children talk about anything more than the need \nto have more counselors. One counsel for 500 students or 1,000 students \ncannot identify these kids in trouble, cannot help these kids. If we \nreally care about providing these services, then we are going to be \nwilling to make the investment.\n  I hope this amendment will have a very strong vote.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is this amendment No. 358?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. This amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965, originally to provide $1 billion more but modified now to provide \n$340 million, after modification, a year in new funding to hire 141,000 \nschool-based mental health personnel: 100,000 school counselors, 21,000 \nschool psychologists, and 20,000 school social workers. These funds \nhave to be matched by the States and localities.\n  Now look, this is another attempt to micromanage our educational \nsystem in this country from Washington. It is an expensive add-on that \nshould not be on this particular bill.\n  I made the case earlier that we are in favor of counselors, but there \nis a limit to everything, and the counselors may or may not be the \nanswer here, especially in the Klebold matter--in the Columbine matter, \nand a number of other matters where the boys were under counseling.\n  The fact of the matter is, this is another ``Let's throw money at \nit'' at the cost of society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What amendment are we on now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 355.\n  Mr. FRIST. Parliamentary inquiry. Is this the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is the Frist-Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are returning to an amendment that was \noffered at the end of last week, which is a very simple amendment as \nwritten. It addresses a fundamental issue that is at the heart of the \njuvenile justice issue and discussion in the last week. It has to do \nwith bombs and guns in schools. It is as simple as that.\n  It addresses the issue of how to make our schools as safe as we \npossibly can. We start with, I believe, the juvenile justice bill which \nhas made real progress but absolutely to my mind must include an \namendment that addresses this issue of guns in schools and bombs in \nschools in an area where we, because of previous legislation that we \npassed, have created a loophole that means that a student coming into a \nschool who has a firearm may be treated very differently from a student \nwho comes in the next day to that school with a firearm. The goal of \nour amendment is that any child who comes into a school with a gun or a \nbomb will be treated equally, will be treated fairly, will not be \ndiscriminated against one way or another.\n  Our amendment ends a mixed message that the Federal Government today, \nbecause of legislation we passed, sends to American students on the \nissue of firearms in schools. ``Firearms,'' for the purpose of this \namendment, are bombs and guns in schools.\n  We look at Littleton, CO, with 15 dead and 23 wounded. We look at \nPearl, MS, with 2 dead and 7 wounded; Paducah, KY, 3 dead, 5 wounded; \nJonesboro, AR, 5 dead, 10 wounded; Springfield, OR, 2 dead, 22 wounded.\n  These are all shootings, horrific shootings. They claimed the lives \nof 27 students and teachers. Thus, we come back to this simple \namendment which closes a loophole that we created that has to do with \nguns and bombs and firearms in schools.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a law which I have \nstrongly supported, and I have worked very, very hard in the past two \nCongresses to improve, to modernize, to strengthen. Under that act, a \nstudent with a disability who is in possession of a gun or a firearm at \nschool is treated differently than a student who is not disabled or who \nis not in special education.\n  Again, it goes back to that fundamental issue of one child in a \nspecial education class who brings a gun or a bomb to school is treated \npreferentially compared to another child who does not have a disability \nor is not in special education who brings a gun or a bomb to school.\n  All of us represent States and have our own constituency. Therefore, \nI look at my home State of Tennessee. The Individual with Disabilities \nEducation Act conflicts with our zero tolerance law which says that \nstudents may be expelled for 1 year if they bring a bomb or a gun or a \nfirearm to school. That is zero tolerance. It is the law of the land in \nTennessee. Yet, we have passed in this body Federal legislation which \nsays there is a certain group of students, about 14 percent of students \nin the State of Tennessee, to whom that does not apply. We have a whole \ndifferent set of standards. What our amendment does is it says, no, if \nyou bring a bomb or a gun to school, you are going to be treated like \nevery other student.\n  Under IDEA, local school authorities have several hoops to remove a \ndangerous special education student who brings a gun into the \nclassroom. School personnel may suspend the child for up to 10 days. \nSchool personnel may place the child in an interim alternative \neducational setting for 45 days. School personnel may ask a hearing \nofficer to place a child in an interim alternative educational setting \nfor up to 45 days if it is proven that that child is a threat to others \nin his current placement. School personnel may conduct a manifestation \ndetermination review to determine whether or not there is a link \nbetween that child's disability and walking into the room with a gun or \na bomb.\n  If the behavior is not a manifestation of that disability, the child \nmay be expelled but is still given educational services. If the hearing \nofficer determines that the behavior of bringing that gun into the \nclassroom was a manifestation of the disability, the student can go \nright back into that school, right back into that current placement, \nand that is the problem. Let me repeat. If the hearing officer \ndetermines that the behavior of bringing a gun into the classroom was a \nmanifestation of the disability, the student can go back into the \nclassroom.\n\n  People say that does not happen. It does happen. In my own State of \nTennessee, in Nashville, just over a 1-year period, there were eight \nstudents who brought guns into school who were caught and of those \neight, six were in special education. Three of those six, it was found \nthat bringing a gun into the school was a manifestation of their \ndisability and, therefore, they ended up back in the classroom. \nStudents who were not in special education were expelled under the law \nunder which 86 percent of the other students fall.\n  Clearly, the way we have set up this federally mandated disciplinary \nprocedure with this loophole sends students a mixed message about guns \nin our schools. It basically says if you are in special education, you \nare going to be treated in a special way if you bring a gun into \nschool, but if you are not in special education, you are going to be \ntreated like everybody else and you are going to be expelled. What a \nmixed message when we are talking about guns. When we are talking about \nthe shootings, the 27 deaths in our classrooms and schools that we have \nwitnessed, we must respond.\n  As earlier stated, if a student with a disability is expelled, that \nstudent\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nmust be provided alternative educational services while a nondisabled \nstudent, somebody who is not in special education who is expelled for \nthe same offense, will not necessarily receive alternative educational \nservices, which just shows how we are treating a student who comes into \nthe classroom with a gun differently if they happen to be disabled \ncompared to other students.\n  The amendment that I, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Helms, Senator \nCoverdell, and Senator Allard, as the initial sponsors, have put \nforward, allows principals and other qualified school personnel the \nflexibility to do something that seems so basic. And that is, to treat \nall students the same if they bring a gun into the classroom, period. \nNo more complicated than that. It does not matter race, it does not \nmatter financial status, it does not matter educational status, \neverybody gets treated the same.\n\n  It allows school authorities to discipline all students in the same \nway if they bring a gun, we are not talking about threats, and we are \nnot talking about even other weapons. We have this amendment focused on \nguns and bombs coming into the schoolroom.\n  This amendment does not force local school authorities to have a \nuniform disciplinary policy. We recognize that every situation needs to \nbe judged as just that, an individual, unique situation. It simply \ngives them the flexibility to enforce discipline in that local school \nas they see fit, with the overall objective to assure, to ensure, to \nguarantee the safety of those students whom every day we send into \nthose classrooms.\n  The amendment is firearms specific. There have been others who have \nasked us to at least look at expanding it to other weapons, but we have \nthis amendment really quite narrow; we are talking about guns and \nfirearms.\n  I mentioned the Nashville statistics. These statistics are really \nhard to obtain. You always hesitate, when that is the case, to \ngeneralize. So I want to make it very clear, I do not want to \ngeneralize, but I do want to illustrate how, in one community where I \nlive, this loophole has the potential for causing real harm, I believe.\n  In the 1997-1998 school year in Nashville, TN there were eight \nfirearms infractions. Of those eight, six were students with a \ndisability. They were in special education.\n  I might add that overall in the State of Tennessee it is between 13 \nand 14 percent, or about one out of eight students, who are in special \neducation classes.\n  Of these six special education students, three were expelled outright \nbecause they found, in the manifestation process, that the disability \nand their bringing a gun into the classroom were unrelated. Three of \nthose students were not expelled, because the possession of the firearm \nwas found to be a manifestation of that child's disability. It was \nthree students who went right back into the classroom, again, \npotentially putting the lives of others in danger.\n  We might hear, well, nobody has been killed yet in the last year or \nthe last 2 years. Really, I think that is a whole separate issue. The \nwhole idea is that we are treating people differently who have brought \na gun or a firearm into the room.\n  These statistics show that three people out of the eight had come \nback into the classroom because a manifestation of their disability was \nbringing a gun into the classroom. It is kind of hard to imagine, but \nthat is what the ruling was.\n  With that, let me close and simply say that when it comes to \npossession of a firearm or a gun, the Federal Government really should \nnot, I believe, be tying the hands of our local education authorities, \nof our local schools, our principals, our teachers, those who are in \ncharge of discipline.\n  Again, I say this. When we are focusing on guns and firearms in the \nclassroom, I just find it hard to believe, and really there is \nabsolutely no excuse for any student to intentionally bring a gun or a \nbomb to school.\n  Students with disabilities really should not be able to hide behind, \nnot their disability, I want to be very clear. What is happening is we \nset this structure up, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nwith this single provision that allows certain students to potentially \nhide behind the legislation, not their disability, but behind the \nlegislation and, thus, avoid punishment that a nondisabled student \nwould undergo.\n  The amendment is simple. It is straightforward. It means that all \nstudents will be treated equally if they bring a firearm in the room. I \nurge its support and hope it will be brought to a vote shortly.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a colloquy or engage in any \nkind of questions and answers?\n  Mr. FRIST. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee knows I have \nthe highest respect for him. In fact, I have always found him to be a \nvery thoughtful Senator, especially when it comes to the issues of \ndisability policy.\n  When the Senator first came to the Senate, he became chairman of the \nthen-existing Disability Policy Subcommittee in the Labor and Education \nCommittee, and I was his ranking member. I thought he did a great job.\n  As a matter of fact, under his chairmanship, we were able to get \nthrough the revisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, which we had been attempting to do for several years. In fact, it \ntook 3 long years to get all the groups to finally agree on the \nrevisions and the amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. I say that as a way of background.\n  The Senator from Tennessee was very heavily involved in that process. \nWe were able to get the bill passed in May, I think it was, of 1997. It \nwas strongly supported in the Senate and in the House, and passed, and \nwas signed into law by the President.\n  My friend from Tennessee gave an example of the students in his home \ncommunity. He gave an example of eight students, six of whom were \ndisabled, at least under an IEP, as I understand it; and that three, as \nI understand it, were expelled right away because it was not a \nmanifestation; but then he made the statement that three went right \nback into the classroom.\n  The Senator, in a private conversation, told me about this once \nbefore. If I am not mistaken, was this not during the school year of \n1995-1996 or 1996-1997?\n  Mr. FRIST. It was 1997-1998.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It was 1997-1998. So the regulations under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act amendments did not go into \neffect until March of 1999. That is 2 months ago.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee that school he is talking about \nwas still operating under the old system. The old system said you could \nplace a child with a disability in an interim educational setting for \nup to 45 days if the child brought a gun to school. That is the old \nbill.\n  The new bill says, the one for which the regulations just came out a \ncouple months ago--the Senator is right, a decision is made, and if it \nis not a manifestation of a disability, they can be expelled \nimmediately. If, however, it is a manifestation of a disability, the \nchild can be placed, under the old bill, for up to 45 days in an \ninterim educational setting, and then if the school officials believe \nthe child is still a danger, if the child is likely to injure himself \nor others, they can go to an impartial hearing, order that the child be \nplaced for an additional 45 days in the interim educational \nsetting, then at the end of that 45 days, they can do another 45 days, \nas long as it is decided that child is a danger either to himself or to \nothers.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee, the example you gave is under the \nold bill. The new bill says that at the end of 45 days, the school can \ngo to an impartial hearing officer and keep that child out for another \n45 days. I ask the Senator if that is not a correct interpretation?\n  Mr. FRIST. The 1999 statistics have been that there have been nine \nfirearm violations, nine firearm infractions this year as of yesterday. \nOf these nine infractions, four involved special education students. In \ntwo of these cases, the students were expelled but given alternative \nservices. One was not expelled because the possession, walking into the \nschool with a firearm, was found to be a manifestation of the \ndisability. He is back in school today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know that I heard the Senator. If he could speak \na little slower, I would appreciate it. I understand that you said \nrecently. I do not know if you have given me----\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The statistics from yesterday for 1999.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The figures you gave were for calendar year 1999.\n  Mr. FRIST. The figures I gave 15 minutes ago in my presentation were \nfrom 1997-1998. I just gave you the ones for 1999.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What you said is that for 1999, this school year; I do \nnot know if the Senator means the school year of 1999 or January until \nnow.\n  Mr. FRIST. The statistics as of yesterday, up until about 24 hours \nago, there were nine infractions over the previous 10 months in \nNashville, TN. Four of those were special education students, four of \nthe nine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Four of the nine were special ed. Two were expelled \nbecause it was determined not to be a manifestation. What happened to \nthe other two?\n  Mr. FRIST. One right now is back in the classroom. And because of the \nfinding, during that 45-day period you spoke of, that it was a \nmanifestation of the disability, they could not treat the student like \nanybody else.\n  The other student case is now pending, winding its way through the \nbureaucratic determination process.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator, you say that this one child was put \nin an interim setting for 45 days. Now this child is back in the \nclassroom. Can the Senator tell me, did the principal or did the school \nofficials ask for a hearing to keep the child in the alternative \nsetting for an additional 45 days, which they are allowed to do under \nthe new law? Did they do that?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will have to check and get back with you. I think the \nSenator's point is important. That is why I spelled it out earlier. For \na student with a disability, you have the 10 days which you can be \nremoved from the process. If you brought a gun into the schoolroom, you \ncan be removed for 10 days. Then you have a 45-day period during which \nthis determination is made. If you brought the gun because you had a \ndisability, you can, as I have demonstrated with this most recent \nstudent from a month ago, plus the three from last year, you can go \nback into the classroom during that 45-day period. I think that is the \nissue that we want to close, which is basically saying, it doesn't \nmatter whether you have a disability or not, if you walk into a \nclassroom with a gun, you should be treated like everybody else.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from Tennessee--and surely we can \nget this right; it may take a little bit of discussion, but I think we \ncan get it right--the situation he just described is true to the point \nwhere the child can be put in an alternative setting for up to 45 days. \nUnder the new law, which, I again point out, just went into effect this \nyear, the school can keep that child out not only for 45 days but for \nanother 45 days and another 45 days. All the school has to do is go to \nthe impartial hearing officer and say: This kid brought a gun to \nschool. It is a manifestation of his disability, but under these \ncircumstances, this kid is a danger to these other students and should \nbe kept in an alternative setting for another 45 days.\n\n  Is it not true that the school can do that? So that if the facts are, \nas the Senator said, the kid is back in the classroom; obviously the \nschool officials felt the kid was not a danger to anyone and they let \nhim back in the school.\n  So I ask the Senator, is that not local control? The local school \nofficials had to decide that child was not a danger and let him back \nin. There is no other way it could happen. I ask the Senator if that is \nnot so?\n  Mr. FRIST. That what is not so?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me try again. The kid brought the gun----\n  Mr. FRIST. This is our wording: School personnel may discipline a \nchild with a disability who carries or possesses a gun or firearm to or \nat a school, on school premises or at a school function under the \njurisdiction of the State or local education agency in the same manner \nin which such personnel may discipline a child without a disability, \nperiod. That is all we are saying. I don't see how you cannot agree \nthat you should treat every child who comes into a school with a gun or \nbomb the same. How can you separate one group of people out?\n  Again, I am committed to individuals with disabilities, but how can \nyou separate them out and say, we are going to treat you differently \nand allow you to go back in the classroom, whether it is 10 days, 45 \ndays, 35 days; you can argue that all you want, you can go back into \nthe classroom, but any child who doesn't have a disability, you are \nout? That just doesn't make sense.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let us look into that.\n  Mr. FRIST. You can look into it. But your 10 days or 45 days is \nmissing the point of the amendment. The amendment is what I just read. \nYou treat everybody the same.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, let us look at that. I think the Senator said he \nsupports IDEA. He supports the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. The fact is that we do treat children with disabilities different \nthan we treat other children. Does every child in a school have an IEP, \nI ask the Senator?\n  Mr. FRIST. No. But my whole argument is, should they bring a bomb \ninto the schoolroom, would you treat them differently and let them go \nback in. That is what I am saying. There are some times that you cannot \nsegregate a group of people and say, you get a special privilege when \nit comes to bombs and guns coming to the school room. That is the point \nthat I am making.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me respond to the Senator on that. I am trying to \nfollow this logically and not to get too inflamed here.\n  If we believe that a child with a disability is treated differently \nthan a child without a disability--we accept that. A child with a \ndisability has an individual education program. There are certain laws \nthat we have passed which if a State wants to accept Federal moneys, \nthey abide by. No local education agency has to abide by the laws of \nIDEA if they don't want to take the money. Now, they would still have \nto provide a free and appropriate public education to kids under \nFederal court rulings.\n  Again, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, that as long as we treat \nchildren with disabilities differently, and we do because they are \ndisabled, we then take it to the step that the Senator said. Should we \ntreat a disabled child who brings a gun to school differently from a \nchild who is not disabled? I think that is a good question. At first \nblush, it might seem to the casual observer that no, they should be \ntreated the same.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee, let's take two children. One is \na child with no disability, has an IQ of 120, has good grades, comes \nfrom a pretty decent family, who all of a sudden gets a mean streak and \nbrings a gun to school. That is one kid.\n  Let's say we have another kid. He has an IQ of 60. He is mentally \nretarded. He has cerebral palsy. His lifetime has been one of being \npicked on by other kids and made fun of. Because of IDEA, he is now in \na regular classroom. Some kids come up to him and they say, look, \njunior, we know your old man has a gun at home and he has a couple of \npistols. If you don't bring one of those pistols to us tomorrow, we are \ngoing to cut your ears off. The kid has an IQ of 60. He is mentally \nretarded. He has cerebral palsy, maybe even suffers a little bit from \nschizophrenia, I don't know. The kid is terrified. He goes home. He \nsneaks the old man's gun. He takes it to these kids, and he gets caught \nby the principal or someone who sees the gun. Should that child be \ntreated differently than the kid with a 120 IQ, who knew exactly what \nhe was doing and who had a mean streak and brought that gun to school?\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator can say yes. I say no.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me respond to the question. They absolutely should. If \ntwo children walk in, regardless of their IQ, the one with a 120 IQ has \na gun, and the next one has a gun and has an IQ of 60, when it comes to \nremoval from the room and being kept out, they should be treated \nexactly the same. It should be by local control. It doesn't mean let \nthem in or keep them out, it means having the decision made by the \nprincipal and not by the well-intended legislation that has this huge \nloophole in it.\n  Treat every child who brings a gun or a bomb to the room the same, \nregardless of who they are or how empathetic you can make the story \nseem. The big thing is that you treat them the same. It is the \nprincipal and the teacher and\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\nthe people locally who decide, not the Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now, I believe the Senator made a very important point \nthere in his first comment to me. The Senator said that if two kids--\nthe ones I described--bring a gun to school, they should be treated \nexactly the same in terms of removal. I agree with the Senator. In \nterms of removal, they should be treated the same. Today, under IDEA, \nthey are treated the same.\n  I am going to stick with my example of the two kids who bring a gun \nto school. Right now, under IDEA, the principal can call up the police \nand say come and get these kids, and they get them and haul them to the \npolice station. They don't care whether the kid is under an IEP or not. \nI agree with the Senator; in terms of removal, they should be the same. \nAnd they are the same today. In terms of getting them out of the \nclassroom immediately, they are treated the same.\n  Where the difference occurs is later on during the 45-day period, \nwhere it is examined as to why the kid brought the gun to school, and \nwhether it was a manifestation of his disability or not.\n  I ask my friend from Tennessee this straightforward question: Is it \ntrue that under IDEA, as it is today, if a disabled child brings a gun \nto school and a nondisabled child brings a gun to school, they are both \ntreated the same in terms of removal?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is totally incorrect. I just gave you an example \nwhere there were eight students in Tennessee. One was expelled because \nhe did not have the disability, and three others were back in the \nclassroom. Do you call that being treated the same? Absolutely not.\n  The whole purpose of my amendment is that, if you bring a gun or a \nbomb to the classroom, you be treated exactly the same. And if you \ndon't have a disability, if you aren't in a special education class, \nyou are out of school, no questions asked. If you have a disability, \nthere are at least three out of eight chances you are back in the \nclassroom within 45 days. That is not the case.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me try again. Let's talk about removal. Talk about \nday one. Two kids bring a gun to school. One is disabled and one is \nnot. Is it true that the principal can immediately expel both students \non that day and get them out of school?\n  Mr. FRIST. No. He can suspend, not expel. That student has to go \nthrough a manifestation process, an initial 10 days and then 45 days \nwith a determination, and that student can be back in the classroom, as \nhas been demonstrated in Nashville, TN, and other places. Anybody can \ncheck their own statistics.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will yield to my colleague from Missouri for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Tennessee, when a \nstudent is subject to an IEP and is disciplined for bringing a gun to \nschool now, is it not an immediate discipline of expulsion for a year \nas it is for others; is it for a limited period of time? What is that \nfirst interval of discipline that is provided for under IDEA?\n  Mr. FRIST. Under IDEA, for students with a disability who bring a gun \nto school, there is an initial 10-day period in which they can be taken \nout and then a 45-day period during which that manifestation process \ntakes place.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If I may pursue an additional question. So there is a \ndisparity right away. The student without an IEP is expelled for a \nyear.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is zero tolerance in Tennessee and in most States \ntoday. If you don't have an IEP, or are not disabled, you are expelled \nunder zero tolerance for a year.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Under an IEP, you have an initial 10-day suspension, \nand legal proceedings start to determine whether or not the carrying of \nthe gun, brandishing of the gun, or bringing the pipe bomb or a firearm \ninto the classroom was a manifestation of your disability?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. When you talk about a manifestation of a disability, \nwhat does that mean? That you bring a gun to school because you are \ndisabled? Is that what you are saying? Or could that mean because you \nare severely emotionally disturbed, for instance?\n  Mr. FRIST. It certainly could. The manifestation process is a \ncomplicated process and one to reach out to people. The term can \ncertainly mean that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So it could be that a student who is severely \nemotionally disturbed is protected from being expelled for a full year, \nbased on the fact that he is severely and emotionally disturbed and \nthat resulted in the bringing of the gun to school?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Then the suspension--if you got past the 10 days, you \ncould suspend the student for 45 days.\n  Mr. FRIST. During which that so-called manifestation process takes \nplace.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is related to whether or not his disability or \nspecial education status caused or was related to the bringing and \nbrandishing of the gun?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Now, these determination proceedings, do they involve \nsubstantial expense for the school?\n  Mr. FRIST. They certainly do, and it is very expensive. The process \nitself is a process that I think can be important and useful. So the \noverall manifestation process, as we look at IDEA, is something that I \nam not necessarily critical of. It is the idea of taking a disability \nand saying the disability and bringing a gun mean that you are back in \nthe school with unequal treatment.\n  But the answer is yes. I travel around Tennessee and people tell me \nthis manifestation process can be very expensive because it involves \nlawyers.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thousands of dollars?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, thousands of dollars.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That lasts 45 days, according to the Senator from Iowa, \nand you have to have another hearing to have another 45 days.\n  Mr. FRIST. There can be an extension for another 45 days if a \ndetermination is made. You go for 45 days, and it can go another 45, \nalthough, usually if it is a manifestation, after 45 days the student \nis back in school.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The theory of the legislation probably provides a basis \nfor having this series of bureaucratic trials and hearings every 45 \ndays as people are litigating whether or not you could keep a very, \nvery dangerous person out of school.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is the way it is written, to take 45 days. Your \nfundamental question is, did the disability cause you to bring the gun \nto school?\n  That is hard to imagine, to be honest. It seems that if it is the \ncause, you would not want to put them back in school. The idea of \nhaving 45 days and another 45 days if they are threatening, as the \nSenator from Iowa mentioned, conceptually, that is pretty good. Imagine \nthat it is manic depression, or something frustrating, something that \ncan be treated, and a kid is violent underneath, and they did bring a \ngun to school. You are going to want to give the kid the benefit of the \ndoubt. You are not going to say keep them out another 45 days and then \nanother. If the kid comes in and says, ``I am sorry,'' you say, ``Go \nback to school.''\n  That is just treating people differently because they happen to have \nthat particular illness and you are getting them back in the school. \nAll I am saying is let's equalize it and keep treating them the same.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Earlier the Senator said that it is hard to imagine a \nperson would have brought a gun to school based on a disability. But in \nfact the determination from Davidson County, Nashville, TN, is that \nover the last couple of years they apparently found that a number of \nthe individuals involved--two in 1 year and three from another year--\nthe determination was made in this process that bringing the gun was \nrelated to a disability and therefore the student was not to be treated \nthe same as other students but would have a very tactical set of \nbureaucratic rights to remain in school, or reenter school.\n  It seems to me that goes to the heart of what we are talking about--\nwhether or not a student who has a problem that causes the student to \nbe involved in bringing a gun--that is, the manifestation proceedings. \nPart of the evidence or manifestation of the problem is that you come \nto school with a gun. That provides the authority for reentering \nschool. The fact that you have a problem which causes you to bring guns \nto school becomes your license to get back into school.\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\n  I think that describes the loophole we have talked about. We created \nit here in the Senate.\n  Am I getting to the heart of it?\n  Mr. FRIST. No. It is that loophole that has been created.\n  I will tell you what my theory is as I look and talk to people around \nTennessee. Whether people are supporting individual disabilities or \nnot, it is not about that. It has to do with the great fear I have in \nthis unequal treatment of people, and allowing that special group of \npeople with an offense of bringing a gun to school or a bomb to school \nto go back into school when you don't let anybody else to go back into \nschool. I will tell you, to me, that is a potentially devastating \nloophole we have created. It hasn't anything to do with the disability. \nThat is my greatest fear. That is why the amendment is on the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for an observation and again for a \nquestion?\n  I say to the Senator from Missouri, again, I don't mind people making \na decision one way or another on these things. I hope we base it on \nfactual circumstances. The fact is that what the Senator, my friend \nfrom Missouri, just described is the idea in the old law, going back 20 \nyears. We had the 45-day period, at the end of which kids can go back \nto school. We changed that. The final regulations on that didn't become \nfinal until March of this year when we put the 45 days in, at the end \nof which, if the school officials believe that the child is still a \ndanger, they can go to a hearing officer, and say, hey, because of all \nthese reasons, that kid should be kept out of school for another 45 \ndays.\n  I say to my friend from Tennessee that I don't have that much lack of \nfaith in my school principals and officials. If they look at this kid \nand say, wait a minute, this kid is a danger, they are going to throw \nup their hands and say, oh, my gosh. They want to protect their \nschools, and they are going to go to a hearing officer and say, wait a \nminute, keep that kid out.\n  So I want to make it clear that what my friend is talking about is \nthe old law. That is all I want to make clear.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is important to accept the fact that you \nhave faith in the school administrator and the principal, because under \nthe proposal of the Senator from Tennessee, and under my proposal and \nunder the Gun-Free Schools Act for schools, which we passed, a \nprincipal has the discretion of being able to allow a student to \nreenter. And, if you trust the principals, you trust the school \nofficial, that is an available opportunity as it exists and would exist \nif we were to pass this amendment providing for uniformity, because we \nallow the treatment under our proposal to be identical to the treatment \nfor any other student not the subject of an IEP. And principals have \nthe discretion to allow such other students back into the classroom.\n\n  So what we want to do is not punish anybody, we want to allow that \nprincipal to exercise his discretion in a way that is likely to promote \nsafety in the classroom and in a way that it does not hamstring the \nprincipal.\n  Just to give you an idea, people do not understand, and I didn't \nunderstand, what a manifestation determination is. This is a flow chart \nof how a manifestation determination is made under IDEA. This is a very \nserious process. To go through these kinds of processes and to have to \njump through these legal hoops and to cause the school districts--the \ncheapest hearing I have been able to talk to a school superintendent \nabout in my State is between $7,500 and $10,000, just to conduct a \nhearing to do in the special settings what the principal is able to do \ngiven his need to protect the safety of the school environment on his \nown in another setting.\n  I think that is what we are looking at. We are not here to try to say \nthat we want to abuse individuals who are the subject of IEPs. We \npassed the statutory framework designed to help disabled children. We \nwant them to get a good education. But I submit to you that among those \nmost exposed to the threat to safety and security in the schools when a \nstudent with a disability comes with a weapon are other disabled \nstudents.\n  This is not a question of pitting students with a disability against \nother students in the classroom, this is a question about safety and \nsecurity in the classroom and allowing those individuals charged with \nthe awesome responsibility of providing for the education of our \nyoungsters the authority to take the steps that are necessary, absent \nintermeddling bureaucratic barriers from Washington, to secure the \nschool environment.\n  Given the fact that every principal has the authority in other \nsettings to be able to reenter a student who is appropriately at a \nstage to reenter the classroom, this bill would not prevent principals \nfrom having the same approach to students who were the subject of IEPs.\n  Mr. FRIST. I don't want to keep going back to the underlying \namendment. We again have discussed this, and we have debated it. It \nreally comes back to treating people the same under this concept of \nguns and violence in the school. I think we may come down to a \nfundamental disagreement that you believe the current legislation will \ncover and take care of what is happening, that if they have a \ndisability and a manifestation of bringing that gun to school is \nrelated to the disability, it is OK for them to come back to school if \nsomebody says they are not threatened.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the school officials say it is OK.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is right. I think that is going to be different, \nbecause we are basically going to say let these school principals and \nofficials make the ultimate decision, and not an officer who happens to \nbe assigned to manage that particular case, who is going to develop a \nrelationship with that student and family, and who says, ``Please let \nhim go back to school.''\n  Let's treat everybody the same. Let the authorities, the principals, \nthe teachers, make that decision instead of separating them out, since \nwe know they come back into the school.\n  Let me again read the amendment.\n\n       School personnel may discipline a child with a disability \n     who carries, or possesses, a gun, or firearm to or at school, \n     on school premises, or at a school function under the \n     jurisdiction of a State or a local educational agency in the \n     same manner in which such personnel may discipline a child \n     without a disability.\n\n  Again, I have given examples of people going back into the \nschoolroom. Let me give two other examples.\n  This is an article in the Washington Times.\n\n       Fairfax County, Virginia, school officials learned that a \n     group of students were in possession of a loaded .357 magnum \n     handgun on school property. They moved quickly to expel the \n     six students. Five students were expelled. One student, a \n     special education student who had a learning disability, who \n     had what they called a ``weakness in written language \n     skills,'' continued to receive an education. School officials \n     reported that this child bragged to other teachers and \n     students that he could not be expelled because he was in \n     special education.\n\n  That is the signal we have sent through IDEA, through this loophole \nin our legislation, not the overall legislation. The overall \nlegislation is great.\n  In the Cobb County school system in Atlanta, not too far from where I \nam, two students, who were initially expelled for bringing a handgun \nand ammunition clip to school, were also protected by IDEA because they \nwere special education students. There is just too much of this special \ntreatment.\n  Our simple amendment basically says, disabled or not, educational \nstatus or not, whoever you are, you need to be treated the same where \nsuch personnel ``may discipline'' a child the same without a \ndisability.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the amendment also not seek services for these kids \nunder paragraph (b), ``ceasing to provide education''?\n  Mr. FRIST. We basically say we will treat those students with a gun \nor a firearm the same as nondisabled students.\n  The whole cessation of services we are not here to debate. Everyone \nwill be treated the same, whether disabled or not disabled.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is part of the amendment?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, but nondisabled students have cessation \nof services. The 85 percent of American students out there not \nclassified as disabled have cessation of services.\n  Treat them the same.\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. One of the reasons I think the Senator will find the \nParent Teachers Association, Association of Police Chiefs and other \npolice around the country opposing this amendment is they think the \nworst thing we could possibly do would be to take kids who are \nseverely--emotionally or otherwise--disabled and throw them out on the \nstreets.\n  Mr. FRIST. We are not saying that. We are saying treat them the same. \nWe are not telling them they have to cease services.\n  I hope you have more respect for the services that will be needed and \nhelpful. We are not saying you have to cease services. You can still \nprovide the services. We are saying treat everybody the same.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The reality of the situation and the reason we have \nIDEA--and we hear it all the time; I hear it from my principals, too, I \nsay to my friend from Missouri--sometimes it is tough to put up with \nthe kids with special needs. They need a lot of attention. Sometimes \nthey are a little raucous. Sometimes the principals throw up their \nhands and want to get them out of the classrooms. The teachers want to \nget them out of the classrooms. They are hard to deal with. These are \nkids with disabilities.\n  Time after time, for every story either of my friends relates about \nprincipals or others who are at wit's end because of a kid, I can come \nup with ten other stories of parents with kids who are disabled and how \nthose kids were mistreated in school.\n  The reality of the situation is--and this is only my feeling--if you \ntake two kids, one disabled maybe with a learning disability, maybe \nwith other problems, who has been mainstreamed in school, expel him as \nyou do a regular student and leave it up to the principal to say, OK, \nyou can let him back in when you want, I think that principal will have \na lot of pressure on him to let one kid back in, maybe, depending on \nthe circumstances, but that disabled kid, that kid causes a lot of \nproblems, costs a lot of money, we will keep him out.\n  I am just telling Senators that has been the situation for the past \n30 to 50 years in this country. That is why we have IDEA. That is why \nwe have individualized education programs for these kids. That is the \nreality of the situation.\n  Mr. FRIST. But the Senator from Iowa understands that we are not \nsaying keep the students out forever. We are saying if you keep the \nnondisabled student out for the rest of the year, you should be able to \nkeep the disabled student out for the rest of the year.\n  In fact, if you look at nondisabled students in terms of cessation of \nservices, because the implication is people are so bad and mean they \nwill cut off services, if you look at the nonspecial ed students in \nNashville, TN expelled under zero tolerance, 55 percent of those are \nprovided services.\n  I guess the Senator argues that of the disabled there will be such \nintense discrimination against that group of people, and I understand \nSenator Harkin has fought the battles here for 20 years, and I respect \nthat tremendously. I guess I have more faith in our principals and in \nour schools that if you treat everybody the same, that is exactly what \nyou will do.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the Senator from Missouri and then the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. What I appear to be hearing is if they are treated the \nsame as nondisabled students, that is kind of a discrimination.\n  That is equity and parity in treatment. It doesn't stack up to \ndiscrimination, in my judgment.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee is aware of the letter from \nthe National School Boards Association regarding the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment to S. 254.\n  Mr. FRIST. I have not seen that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is an interesting letter on behalf of the Nation's \n95,000 local school board members. This is from the executive director, \nAnne L. Bryant, executive director of the National School Boards \nAssociation:\n\n       The National School Boards Association urges you to support \n     the Frist-Ashcroft amendment to S. 254 that would enhance the \n     safety of all students from gun violence.\n\n  We are not talking about the vast number of individuals that are \nparticipants in the IDEA program. The number is vast, with 13 or 14 \npercent in Tennessee, and 13 or 14 percent of the students in Missouri \nand Iowa. These are not people who show up for school with guns very \noften. When some of them do, they are threatening the others.\n  When a person shows up with explosives or a gun at school, the \nobjective there ought to be school safety. It ought to be to address \nthat.\n  The amendment provides school officials with the discretion to \nsuspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act in the same manner as other students in cases where they \nbring firearms to school.\n  It has been stated there is a lot of opposition. This is a letter \nfrom the 95,000 members of the School Boards Association stating this \nis the right thing to do.\n  Mr. FRIST. I think we have been very careful to try to get this \namendment as tight and focused as we could, talking about guns in the \nclassroom, bombs in the classroom.\n  We have gone so far to put wording in the bill to say they \nintentionally have to bring that gun into the school or the classroom. \nWe have done our best to get it as narrow and focused as we possibly \ncan.\n  It comes down to safety. We are on the juvenile justice bill. We had \nthese terrible 27 deaths from guns in classrooms, and this bill goes \nright at the heart. Again, not the disability community or individuals \nwith disabilities. I count myself among their greatest advocates, but I \nam concerned that with the loophole we created that something drastic, \ndevastating, is going to happen because of this loophole where we are \ntreating students with disabilities in special education, allowing them \nto return to the classroom, but not letting anybody else return to the \nclassroom.\n  We are treating them differently, where people who brought a gun to \nthe classroom can return 45 days later.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In specific inquiries to the individuals who provided \nthe Senator with the information from the Davidson County school \nsystem, is it their view that this loophole exposes the system and the \nstudents in the system to a risk they would not otherwise be exposed \nto?\n  Mr. FRIST. I talked with the officials in the major urban areas where \nthe concentration of people are throughout Tennessee. There is general \nagreement of people who are on the front line in the schools, who are \nresponsible for the safety of our children who are there every day. \nThey say, Senator Frist, we know you are the advocate for individuals \nwith disabilities, but how could you create a huge loophole that puts \nour children at risk? That is why I am here.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me ask the Senator----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator answer a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Did the Senator from Vermont have a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to volunteer this point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Come on over. We are all friends.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I listened very carefully. I think when you get right \ndown to it the basic question is, in the final analysis, should the \nschool have to afford an alternative education situation and pay for \nit. It is a matter of dollars and cents. It has nothing to do with the \nsafety of the children or anything else.\n  Under the circumstances you are dealing with here, if a child comes \nin with a gun, if it is somebody without an IEP or whatever, they can \nbe thrown out of school and they can be let back into school. That is \nentirely the discretion of the school officials. They can say this is \nan aberration or whatever.\n  If a child with a disability comes in, then you go through the 45 \ndays to assess as to whether or not it was as a result of a disability. \nIf it was not the result of a disability, then the child can be \ndisciplined as any other child. If, on the other hand, it was the \nresult of a disability, then they are required to provide an \nalternative educational situation. It may or may not cost something. \nBut that child is not in the classroom. So no child goes back into the \nclassroom if they are a threat to the classroom.\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n  What it comes down to, and what the school officials object to, as I \nunderstand it, is they have to set up a special 45-day program for this \nchild, and pay for it. The reason is not to protect the school or \nprotect the kids; it is to make sure they do not have to provide the \nfunds. You can keep those 45 days going forever. Then that costs money. \nSo this is not a safety question. This is a money question. The school \nboards are saying they don't want to pay for those 45 days. That is \nwhat they are saying.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is not what I heard. Basically, what I hear from the \nsuperintendents and the principals is the safety end of it. The expense \nis expensive, it has been pointed out. What I am dealing with is the \nsafety end of it, the fact that our principals' hands are tied because \nof the way the legislation is written, because of the threat of \nlawyers, of trial lawyers who threaten to sue the school, the school \nsystem, based on our bill that they basically are saying the students \ncome back in the classroom, when the student without the disability is \nout for the school year.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask him if his experience has been similar to mine. I \nhave probably gone to 30 or 40 school districts in the last 3 months, \nvisiting school districts. I have found people are very concerned about \nthe safety of students. My own view of it has been totally different \nfrom that suggested by the Senator from Vermont, saying that school \nsafety is not the question here. I talked to one superintendent. This \ndid not happen to be an IEP student who carried the gun to school but \nwho threatened to kill other students in school seven times.\n  Of course, because of the problems in effecting discipline, they kept \nthe student in school. Finally the student shot another student. Safety \nissues are involved here. Make no mistake about it. When someone brings \na gun into the school, safety issues are involved.\n  Mr. FRIST. There have been 27 people murdered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This is not just a financial issue when someone brings \na pipe bomb to school. That is a safety issue. Sure it costs money to \nput the person in alternative settings, and it costs money to have a \nhearing every month and a half, every 45 days. Those are massive costs. \nI will not deny those are very serious costs. But let us not suggest--\nat least to the school districts that I dealt with--that there are no \nsafety issues involved when people bring guns and pipe bombs to school. \nDoes that comport with the Senator's experience in Tennessee?\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, it does. The purpose of the amendment is just that. \nIt goes back to having safe schools. That is what we have been debating \nso much over the last several days.\n  I will yield the floor. Other people want to go forward, but let me \njust close and say the purpose of this amendment is real simple. That \nis to get rid of a loophole which allows one group of students to be \ntreated differently. If they both brought a gun to the school, the \nloophole being that a group of students are ending up back in school \nwhere one group of students is expelled. All this amendment says is, \nlet's treat everybody the same and let's have those decisions made \nlocally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would just like to sum it up. What we \nare talking about are the problems we have had from the beginning of \ntime, the problems that children with disabilities have and how we \nhandle them. The reason we created IDEA, the reason it was passed, is \nthat we were not allowing the children with disabilities to get any \neducation. It went to the U.S. Supreme Court. A consensus decision by a \nnumber of courts, I should say, was reached, in which they determined \nthat if you are going to provide a free and appropriate education \ngenerally to the public, you have to have an appropriate education for \nchildren with disabilities. And we funded that. We required that. That \nis why we are here today.\n  What we are now dealing with is we do not want to provide those \nservices. If a student has a disability and provided a threat to the \nschool, it is perfectly clear, if it is a result of a disability, you \nhave to provide that child with an education as the Constitution \nrequires, because, if it was the result of a disability, he is not \nreally responsible for it, so you have to provide it. That gets \nexpensive.\n  If it was not part of the disability, then the child is just treated \nas any other child and there is no need for a different or additional \nIEP, away from the classroom setting; the child gets treated and \nhandled like anyone else.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it the Senator's position, then, if a student is the \nsubject of a IEP, a special education student, and brings a gun to \nschool and it is determined that student did not bring it as a \nmanifestation of the disability----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it your position, then, that the school can expel \nhim with no responsibility to provide services?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is not correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. They have to provide services for him. They have to \nprovide services.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Wait a second. Apparently, there appears to be a \ndifference between you and the Senator from Iowa. I was just going to \nindicate--is it your view in the event the dismissal comes because the \ngun was not a manifestation, that there is no responsibility?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. He is just treated like anyone else at that point as \nfar as discipline, is my understanding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might interject myself into this a little bit?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator from Missouri that services \nalways have to be provided. Educational, medical, mental health, those \nkinds of services do have to be provided. But if it was not a \nmanifestation of a disability, of course, the kid can be expelled from \nschool.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So the distinction is not that the law provides that \nthere can be no services, or will be none, your view is directly \ncontrary to that of the Senator from Vermont, that services must be \nprovided on a continuing basis, even if it was not a manifestation. But \nhe can be kept out of the school?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is in the law.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is in the law. That is why I was asking the \nSenator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. He may not have to return to the school.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Not providing them at the school. That is where you do \nget into expensive treatments, where you get to $60,000, $70,000, \n$80,000 a year to provide the student with individualized home-based \neducation.\n  But the point is, the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee, which I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate \nin with him, is to provide an equity in services. When you suggest that \nthere is an equity for those who are subject to an IEP, but the \nviolation is not a manifestation of the disability, that there is not \nany requirement for services, that is simply not true. The law provides \nthe services must continue.\n  I think the fundamental point the Senator from Tennessee and I want \nto make is this. There are not very many people who are bringing guns \nto school. There are very few of them. And even fewer who would bring \nguns or pipe bombs to school are students with a disability.\n  But for those who do, the school officials ought not to have to go \nthrough torturous legal proceedings and laborious determinations of \nmanifestations and the like for those who bring pipe bombs and guns to \nschool. We ought to be able to trust the principals to say: You don't \nbelong here in school. You will come back in the same manner that other \nstudents do.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I might point out, under your theory here, if a child \nwith a disability comes in, and it is not a manifestation of \ndisability, they are not entitled, under the IDEA, to have any \neducation at all. You just get rid of them, like you get rid of the one \nwho came in who was not disabled.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is exactly the kind of parity we are talking \nabout. If\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\na person brings a weapon to school, the principal has the right to say: \nYou do not belong in school and you are not going to disrupt or \nthreaten the safety of this school environment and you are not entitled \nto special services, especially in cases where bringing a weapon to \nschool had nothing to do with your disability.\n  I believe it ought to be the case, and this amendment provides we \ngive school administration officials the kind of discretion they have \nin their own States and under the Gun-Free Schools Act we passed a \ncouple years ago where the principal has the discretion to expel them \nfor a year, with the discretion to allow them to reenter on his or her \ndetermination or school authorities' determination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Under these circumstances which we are talking about--\nexpelled but not a manifestation--then a child is expelled from school \nbut is still entitled to educational services. That is the difference. \nThat means an additional expense. The child who does not have a \ndisability and is thrown out of school has to find another school, has \nto get a tutor or do something else. We are all talking dollars and \ncents. We are talking about a cost that is added by virtue of the fact \nthat you must provide special services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri--\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator from Vermont will yield for a question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from Missouri, as long as it takes \nto reach some parameters on this, the fact is, the principal's hands \nare not tied right now in getting kids out of school immediately. Will \nthe Senator agree with that or not? No?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. For expelling students.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Getting them out of the school immediately if they bring \na gun to school.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. For the first 10 days, they can get them out of school.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Forty-five days.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Then it takes additional proceedings to get to the 45-\nday period.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, it doesn't; no, no, it doesn't; no, it doesn't. No.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. On the 11th day, you have to start a different regime \nthat includes providing separate services, education in another setting \nif you don't provide it at school.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But they can keep them out of the school for 45 days.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They can keep them out of a regular classroom.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Wherever they brought the gun to school, they can keep \nthem out of that school for 45 days. The law is pretty clear. I don't \nknow what we are debating here.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In all deference to the Senator, the law is clear and \nthe law provides substantial disparate or different treatment, and the \ntreatment which is different causes very serious problems in the real \nworld. It causes problems because we let students who bring guns into \nschool back into the school system because of this system.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let's take it one step at a time, I say to my friend. I \nam trying to get to this one point. Are the principal's hands tied if a \nkid brings a gun to school--I don't care if they are disabled or not. \nIn getting that kid immediately out of school for up to 45 days, I \nthink the law is clear, they can do that; they don't have to show \nanything.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They have responsibilities when they do that that they \ndon't have with other students.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I am just saying----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So if you are talking about hands tied, you may not tie \ntheir hands, but you force them to busy their hands doing a whole \nvariety of other things.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I say to my friend----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That results in those kids showing up in school far \nearlier than they otherwise would. It may not work that way on the \nfloor of the Senate, but that is the way it works in school.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to take it step by step.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Step by step. The first step is getting the kid out of \nschool because there is a clear danger. You want to get him out of \nthere.\n  I want to make it clear, we all understand that a principal can get \nthat kid out of school. They can call the police station right now and \nsay: Come and get this kid; he has a gun. They can take him down to the \npolice station. The police can do it. They have that right now. Even if \nthe kid is severely disabled, one can say, please come and pick him up \nand take him to the police station now. Their hands are not tied. I \nwant to take the first step in getting the kid with a gun out of the \nschool. I just hope that my friend will agree that the principal can do \nthat.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. You are asking me that question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The principal can do that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. And this amendment is designed to extend the quality of \ntreatment that you appear to admire at the first of the process through \nthe process adequately so that we protect the safety of the school \nenvironment for a much longer period of time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK. Now, my friend and I agree that the principal can get \nthe kid out immediately. Let's take the second step: timeframe. For a \ndisabled kid, it can be up to 45 days. They don't have to do anything. \nThey can keep him out for 45 days. They don't have to show anything. \nThey can keep him out for 45 days.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They do have to do things.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Provide services in education.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is different than with other students.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. When we take these steps, let's tell the whole story \nabout each step.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For the disabled child, they do have to continue to \nprovide services.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If they don't let him back in, for that student, they \nhave to set up some other school for him, and that could even be a \nschool that is housed with a full-time teacher and all the kinds of \nassistance the student might need.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It would be in an alternative setting to be determined \namong the parents, the hearing officer and the school.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. And that is totally different than it is for a \nnondisabled student.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with you.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Good, good. Here we are, for the first 10 days, both \ncan be sent out of school, but after the 10th day----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think then while we agree that the principal can get \nthe kid out right away and can get him out for 45 days, our \ndisagreement, it seems to me, is not so much on getting the kid out of \nthe school immediately and getting the immediate danger out; it seems \nto me our disagreement is what happens later, what happens with those \nkids later on, how are they treated and how, if at all, they are let \nback in the school. That seems to be our disagreement.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is a very significant point here, and if I just \ntake you to the schools, and the best information we have in this \ndebate is what the Senator from Tennessee has brought us, that they are \ntreated deferentially and a significant number of them are back in \nschools prematurely because the schools feel like they have to let them \nback in at a time when, according to their testimony, they are \nuncomfortable about it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I think we can work through this. I hope. We may \nnot always agree. I am trying to get down to the nub of the problem.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And it seems to me that we do agree. I understood----\n  Mr. FRIST. This Senator does not agree.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield further?\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me get organized here. I yield to the Senator from \nIowa. Please refer back to me and then I will recognize the others, and \nwe will have an orderly process here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The point I am trying to make is that in the initial \nstatement of my friend from Tennessee, the Senator talked about the \nLittleton school shooting and kids bringing guns to school and getting \nthese dangerous kids out of school. I agree.\n  I just wanted to make the point very clearly that in terms of a child \nbringing a gun to school, a principal right now can deal with a kid who \nis disabled just as they can with a kid who is not disabled, in terms \nof getting that kid out of school, having the police haul them away, \nhave them book him, have them charge him with a crime or anything else. \nI just wanted to make that point very clear, that they can get those \nkids out of that school.\n  Now we are going to get into the next stage about what happens with \nthose kids. That is the only point I want to make. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a short period?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. For the last 45 minutes, we have had the Senator from Iowa \ntalking to me or talking to the body trying to explain so everybody can \nunderstand this process that we have set up for individuals with \ndisabilities, which is a good process overall because they are very \ncomplex issues.\n  We have a 10-day period where we have one set of rules which I agree \nthat basically you do the same for an individual with a disability and \nnondisability. Then you have a 45-day period, which, as the chart that \nwe saw earlier shows, in terms of a manifestation process, is confusing \nand is a difficult process. It is an evolving process and one that has \nchanged over time so that we can adequately consider individuals with \ntheir disabilities and what their special needs are.\n\n  Our point, and I know the Senator from Iowa keeps shifting away from \nit, but I am going to keep coming back to it, because the amendment is \nso simple. Our point is to close a loophole that if a disabled student \nbrings a gun or a bomb in the classroom, they end up back in this \nclassroom. If you do not have a disability you are not in the \nclassroom. That is a loophole.\n  The point I want to make is, we can march through the whole 10-day \nperiod, 45-day period, another 45-day period of threatening and all \nthat. That is the whole point, that we have barrier after barrier after \nbarrier for a group of people who brought a gun into the classroom, \nwith our children around, and they brought a gun there. We have all \nthese barriers set up for one group of students, but for the other \ngroup of students they are out for that year. We say, treat them both \nthe same. That is all the amendment does.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is, unfortunately, not the way the courts have \nruled as to how a State has to handle those situations. Students with \ndisabilities are entitled to an IEP. They are entitled to special \neducation and related services. They can be denied going back into the \nclassroom if they are in any way a threat to that classroom. But they \nare entitled to services. That isn't going to change. And this law will \nnot change.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Does the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. On what basis does the court say they are entitled to \nan IEP?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That goes back to the 14th amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, isn't \nit?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Based on constitutional decisions that were levied back \nin the late 1960s and 1970s, which determined that you had to give an \nequal opportunity to children with disabilities. Part of that equal \nopportunity is appropriate education, which takes into consideration \nthe nature of the disability.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield to me to elaborate a little \nfurther?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Missouri that prior to the two \n1972 cases, the PARC case and the Mills case, it was found by the \ncourts, and by others, that there were millions of kids in our country \nwho were denied an education simply because of their disability.\n  In both the PARC case--that is the Pennsylvania Association of \nRetarded Children--and the Mills case here in the District, the courts \nsaid, basically, look, if a State provides a free public education to \nits children--now, a State does not have to, States do not have to \nprovide a free public education; there is no constitutional mandate for \nthat, by the way. But the court said, if a State provides a free public \neducation, under the 14th amendment to the Constitution it cannot deny \na free public education, just as it cannot deny it to a child who is \nblack, because of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, it cannot \ndeny a free public education to a child with a disability; and, \nfurthermore, the court said, because of the disability, the education \nmust not only be free but appropriate.\n  So I say to my friend--and I will just go through this a little bit \nlonger--the States, then, were faced with a constitutional mandate that \nthey had to provide a free appropriate public education to kids with \ndisabilities.\n  The States were panic stricken. How were they ever going to afford to \ndo this? They came to Congress. Congress said: OK. We will set up a \nlaw. We called it the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \npassed in 1975. Both the Senator from Vermont and I were in the House \nat the time. We set up a law, and we said: OK. We want to have some \nnational standards. We do not want to have 50 different standards. We \nwant to set up national standards for providing services to kids with \ndisabilities. We do not want 50 different things out there.\n\n  So we set up IDEA. We said our objective was to provide 40 percent of \nthe funding. By the way, we haven't, and we ought to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Glad to have your support on that, Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I always have. We ought to fully fund IDEA. But I just \nwant to walk through this.\n  So we set up IDEA, and we said, if you, State of Missouri, would like \nto have the money we can provide, then you have to adhere to IDEA. No \nState, including the State of Missouri, has to abide by any of the \nprovisions in IDEA if they do not want to accept any of the money.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to point out, the Senator was questioning \nabout whether or not this was a constitutional mandate. It is a \nconstitutional mandate on the States that they have to provide a free \nand appropriate public education. IDEA says to the States: We will help \nyou with money. Here are the rules of the game.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have been traveling in my State and talking with \neducators. I have never had any issue that is of more concern to them \nthan the problems of enforcing discipline caused by the IDEA Act. What \nwe are doing in our schools today is not required by the Constitution. \nAnd sooner or later the people are going to rise up and put an end to \nit.\n  Let me just share this thought with you. Taking a gun to school by a \nyoungster is a Federal crime. What if they are put in jail, do they \nhave to be sent back to the school? That is just the point.\n  Let me read this letter I received just a few weeks ago from one of \nAlabama's most experienced attorneys general:\n  He has been a leader in the State Attorney General Association.\n\n       Dear Jeff:\n       I am writing you this letter concerning my general outrage \n     over the laws of the Federal Government and how they are \n     being administered in relation to school violence.\n       I had already been having meetings with our Superintendent \n     of Education concerning new rules and interpretations of \n     rules based on what I believe to be the Federal Disabilities \n     Act.\n       The general thrust of the matter is that violent children \n     are being kept in school because of the Federal Rules \n     relative to disabilities.\n       I can point to at least seven to nine occasions in Baldwin \n     County--\n\n  His county----\n\n     in which I believe expulsion was called for, but could not be \n     accomplished because of the interpretation of the \n     Disabilities Act.\n       I realize that mental disorders can be a disability, but \n     the primary concern should be\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\n     the safety of the children who are not causing any \n     difficulties.\n       Our schools simply do not have sufficient resources for one \n     on one education and I would hope that you and other members \n     of Alabama's delegation would review this problem which I \n     believe to be epidemic throughout this Country.\n\n  Here is an editorial in the Mobile Press Register about a 14-year-old \nstudent classified as ``EC,'' emotionally conflicted. He had to be \nassigned an aide to go to school, to go to class with him. One aide to \nthis one student because of his problems, an aide assigned to him \nduring school hours and during bus rides to and from school. The \nstudent was accused of assaulting his aide while the aide tried to stop \nhim from trying to wreck the schoolbus.\n\n  These are the kinds of things that have happened all over America. \nThis bill does not go far enough, in my opinion. It only says, if you \nbring a deadly weapon to school, and in violation of Federal law, you \nhave to be treated like everybody else, and you do not get special \nprotections because you are emotionally conflicted.\n  In fact, emotionally conflicted kids may often be the most dangerous \nones, the ones most likely to come back in, say, 6 months from now and \nkill some innocent child in a classroom or shoot their teacher. This is \na good step forward. I would like to, if I could, be listed as a \ncosponsor of the legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on so many matters of \neducation. I just wanted to share those remarks.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the remarks.\n  I, again, point out, if the child is violent and it is not a \nmanifestation of their disability, they can be treated like anyone else \nas far as removal from school. If it is a manifestation, then special \nrules apply. Those special rules may well determine that they not be in \nthe general education classroom. That process may require maybe an aide \nto be assigned to them. That is the way the law works.\n  Many, many students who have disabilities have special aides assigned \nto them. We cannot let these kinds of very difficult incidents of \nviolence throw out the whole law. We have to examine exactly how you \nhandle students with disabilities, and situations where the disability \nresults in school violence. In such cases they can be removed from the \nclassroom; they can be removed from the school.\n  But they must to be provided an appropriate education under the law.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If a child is emotionally conflicted and brought a gun \nto school on one occasion, why do we think he might not do that on \nanother occasion, even some months later? It is a safety question for \nthe school.\n  This is a modest step in the sense that it doesn't say you can do \nanything if he beats up another student; it just says that if he brings \na deadly weapon to the school, he can be treated like any other student \nand be removed. I think that is a good step and support the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. They can be removed either way. It is just a question \nwhere they end up--whether they end up going outside of the school and \njoining a gang or whether they get a special educational situation \noutside of the classroom, outside of the school. Those are the kinds of \nproblems we must address whether or not they have a disability.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All I would say is the district attorney, David \nWhetstone, is a reasonable man. He is very concerned. I am hearing \nrepeatedly from school superintendents and principals that no matter \nwhat we say about, in theory, how this law works, in practicality, it \nis endangering the lives of students, disrupting classrooms, causing \nteachers to quit, and costing untold amounts of money. In fact, the \nsuperintendent from Vermont did testify that 20 percent of his county's \nbudget goes to special education students. Somehow we have gotten out \nof sync here. We need to move back to a more modest ground, I say.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I say if the Congress achieves what we are trying to \ndo, particularly what the Republicans are trying to do, fully fund \nIDEA, then many of those concerns would go away. But we are far, far \nfrom providing the State and local governments the money we told them \nwe would.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You have been a champion of that, but even then our \ngoal is to do 40 percent, not 100 percent.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I was referring to about 100 percent of the 40 percent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We haven't even honored our commitment to do 40 \npercent. But even then, 60 percent of it would be carried by the local \nschool system.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. You are accurate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to respond to my friend from Alabama.\n  It seems to me the argument is, it costs too much money to take care \nof kids with disabilities. I remind my friend from Alabama, that \nSupreme Court right across the street, less than 2 months ago, had a \ncase from Iowa, the Garrett F. case. Here was a kid who was on a \nbreathing device in school every day, had to have a nurse with him \nevery day because they had to clean the phlegm out of his throat and \nhis lungs. He was on a breathing device, severely disabled. His mind \nwas fine, mind was great--the kid knew what was going on, a good \nstudent.\n  The school didn't like it because it was costing them a lot of \nmoney--I say to my friend from Alabama--so they took the case to the \nSupreme Court. That Supreme Court over there, in a 7-2 decision, \nincluding some of the most conservative Members of that Court, said \nthat under the Constitution of the United States they had to provide \nthat opportunity. We can argue about how we provide it, but, please, \ndon't tell me that somehow, because these kids cost a lot of money, we \nhave to give them less in their lives than kids who are not disabled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am glad to yield to one of you, and then I am \nyielding myself off the floor. I yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to bring the attention of the \nSenate to what I believe to be the law in this situation, that absent \nspecification in the IDEA law itself, the extension of continuing \nservices is not required according to, I think, the best on-point legal \ndecisions in cases where a person would otherwise have forfeited his \nright to school because of the disciplinary problem.\n  The case of Virginia Department of Education v. Riley, from the \nFourth Circuit, found that the plain language of IDEA did not condition \nthe receipt of IDEA funds on the continued provision of educational \nservices to expelled children with disabilities and that in order for \nCongress to place conditions on the State's receipt of funds, Congress \nmust do so clearly and unambiguously. Therefore, that is one of the \nreasons the law was changed following that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What was the date of that case?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is prior to the change in the law, I say to the \nSenator from Iowa. I am explaining, that is one of the reasons the law \nwas changed. I think you changed the law, and the source of the mandate \nthat services be provided, according to that case and according to the \nresponse of the Congress, was the change of the law.\n  So the Constitution does not provide a mandate that people have to be \ngiven continuing services forever in discipline cases, which has been \nsuggested.\n  The point is, the Constitution hasn't been so construed, I don't \nbelieve. I think what the law has basically said is that that comes \nfrom what we did in the amendment of the law a year or two ago. Was \nthat in 1997? Given that, if the source of that responsibility is the \nlaw, it becomes clear to me that we can change the law and alter the \nresponsibility.\n  Now, I think this has been both entertaining and somewhat \ninstructive.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to say to my friend from Missouri--\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to let the Senator from Missouri finish so I can \ndepart.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. How nice.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to tell him he is right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If the Senator wants to tell me I am right, first of \nall, I need reinforcements here to catch me when I fall over. But I am \ndelighted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to say that the Senator was right and I misspoke\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\nmyself. That Court across the street said the law was clear, that they \nhad to do it. It was not the Constitution.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I want to get back to the fundamental point, and there \nare about three of them. I will try to make these quickly: One, that \nthe law does provide for differential treatment. If it didn't provide \nfor differential treatment, we wouldn't have the law. As a matter of \nfact, part of it was in response to this Fourth Circuit opinion, and \nthe Congress acted. In so providing, we created a big loophole for guns \nand firearms in the school.\n  We basically provided a basis for differential treatment for people \nwho are the subject of IEPs, these special education students, who \nmight be--I forget what the Senator from Alabama said--emotionally \ndistressed, or troubled, or severely emotionally distressed. They might \nbe able to come to school and have different treatment if they carry a \ngun to school than if someone else does.\n  The simple fact is that the Senator from Tennessee and I believe we \nought to give authority to school principals to deal with such cases as \nforthrightly as they do with other cases. This is in light of the fact \nthat when you get out, not in the Chamber of the Senate, not in the \ntheory of the bureaucracy, but when you get out into local schools, the \nlaw operates to constrain those school officials to have students come \nback to school who have carried guns to school and pipe bombs to \nschool. They have carried them in, and it is not in the best interest, \naccording to school officials, to have the students back in, but they \nare back in.\n  We simply want to liberate school principals and school officials to \nsay to people who bring guns and pipe bombs, firearms, to school, you \ncan't do that, you are out until we say you can come back, in the same \nway we say that under the Gun-Free Schools Act, which is the Federal \nGovernment's mandate, students are entitled to go to school in a place \nthat is not full of guns and firearms.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for according me this opportunity to \nmake that simple statement, that we want to provide parity for \nstudents: No matter who you are, when you bring firearms and guns to \nschool, we want the principal to be able to send you home.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think that narrows it down to all that I am saying \nwhich is, yes, they do that, but they have to provide an alternative \neducational circumstance, which is something different than other \npeople without disabilities may not have been entitled to.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Vermont yield to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has just yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Vermont thanks the Senator from Vermont. \nThe Senator from Vermont will now take the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been a good debate here by the \nSenators from Missouri, Iowa, Vermont, Tennessee, and others who have \nspoken about this. I know these are extremely important amendments, \nespecially to the primary sponsors, and the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Missouri, and the others.\n  My perspective is that as ranking member and floor manager on this \nside of the bill, I look at a whole lot of amendments. At one time, we \nhad a couple hundred amendments. We whittled those down. Dozens of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have agreed to withhold their \namendments. I spent the weekend talking with Senators, asking them to \nwithhold their amendments. And they did. Others we were able to get in \na managers' agreement, a managers' package, something I am still \nwaiting to hear back on from the other side. I assume we will get that. \nMany Senators on both sides will see the bulk of their amendments in \nthe managers' package. But at some point we have to go on.\n  I suggest, for whatever it is worth, whatever is done, whatever is \npassed, whether it is the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, or \nwhether it is the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, this issue will \nbe in conference. The Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont, \nas the two main conferees, will have to try to work out yet another \noverall compromise. We have had debate for almost 2 hours. We are \nbeyond reasonable to ask that the Senator from Missouri and the Senator \nfrom Iowa simply allow the Senate to accept both amendments by a voice \nvote. They will be in the bill. The practical effect of that, I might \nsay, will not be any different if a vote were to be had on the floor \nbecause we still have an issue that will be resolved ultimately in \nconference. The one difference will be that we have had a debate that \nextended for almost 2 hours. The debate will then be completed and we \ncould go on to other issues.\n  I would like to see us finish this bill tonight. I am not propounding \nthis as a unanimous consent request, but I am suggesting it to the \nSenators. The Senator from Utah is not on the floor, and I don't wish \nto speak for him, but the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nVermont would find that agreeable.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. When the Senator says accept the two amendments by voice \nvote, does he mean the Harkin proposal and ours?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, to accept them both. My reason for doing that is----\n  Mr. FRIST. That would be unacceptable. We spent a lot of time talking \nabout the fundamentals. We have spent a lot of time debating this. We \nwill object to that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am not doing this as a unanimous consent request. It is \njust an idea. The Senators have an absolute right, on both sides, to \nask for a vote on their amendments. My concern is going forward, \nespecially even if we have votes on them, the practical results will be \nmuch the same because we are still going to have to revisit it in the \ncommittee of conference.\n  We can finish this bill tonight. I just throw it out for what it is \nworth. I have been here 25 years and I know the Senator has a right to \nget a vote on his amendment. I am just trying to get to the practical \nresult, which will, in the end, still be the same.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nCollins as a cosponsor, along with Senator Sessions, if he has not \nalready been added, to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is no need for this amendment. IDEA \nalready contains provisions to ensure that schools are able to remove \ntruly dangerous children from the classroom. But it also ensures that \nthese children receive the services they need--not only educational \nservices, but counseling, behavior modification, and other related \nservices--so that their bad behavior will hopefully not happen again. \nThis makes more sense than simply sending kids out of the streets, \nwhich is exactly what the Frist-Ashcroft amendment proposes to do.\n  The worst example of what happens when students are sent home without \nnecessary services happened last year in Springfield, Oregon. When Kip \nKinkle brought a weapon to school, he was immediately suspended. He \nwent home with his gun, killed his parents, then returned to school and \nstarted firing.\n  The greatest protection a school can provide to its students and \ncommunity is to be aware of the warning signs of danger and provide the \nservices that can prevent the student from using violence.\n  Why would we want to strip those very protections from our schools \nand communities by amending IDEA to end all services to students with \ndisabilities? In fact, why don't we have these protections in place \nregarding all children, not just those children served under IDEA?\n  Although several of our colleagues here today have pointed to all \nsorts of horror stories allegedly involving IDEA students, I would urge \nmy colleagues to be get the facts straight.\n  (1) For the vast majority of children with disabilities, most \ndiscipline problems can be handled by implementing their individualized \neducational plan, which now includes behavior management strategies.\n  (2) IDEA currently allows a school to suspend a child for up to 10 \ndays per incident.\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n  (3) Moreover, IDEA allows a school to discipline a child with a \ndisability just like it would discipline any other child, so long as \nthat child's behavior is not a manifestation of his or her disability.\n  Mr. President, IDEA took three long years to reauthorize, and was the \nproduct of bipartisan negotiations involving both chambers of Congress \nand the Administration, with extensive public input.\n  The IDEA regulations have just been issued, and they particularly \nstrengthen the area of disciplinary procedures.\n  In many places, schools are only starting to use the tools that are \navailable to them under current law in cases where disciplinary actions \nthat could be prevented with early intervention.\n  In fact, GAO is currently doing a study as to whether schools have \nenough flexibility to discipline children with disabilities.\n  In this letter I received dated April 29, they stated that work on \nthis study should be delayed for two reasons:\n  (1) ``Nationwide data on school discipline for special education \nstudents is not currently available, but is being collected this \nyear,'' and\n  (2) ``IDEA regulations have only recently been published, allowing \ninsufficient time for their results to be felt and measured.''\n  I ask that the text of this letter be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. President, at this point I believe it is not necessary and in \nfact it would be unconscionable and premature to amend the IDEA and \nrisk compromising the implementation of this landmark legislation.\n  Special education students should not be the scapegoats here. And let \nme state again, not one of the children involved in the tragedies that \nwe have witnessed over the past two years was a special ed. student. We \nneed to focus this legislation on strengthening all schools for all of \nour children, and stop blaming IDEA.\n  Mr. President, I want to join with the sheriffs, district attorneys, \nleaders of police organizations, violence prevention scholars, and \nschool psychologists and counselors, in urging all my colleagues to \nvote against the Frist-Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the pending \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, to enhance school \nsafety. This bill is based in large part on the work of the Republican \nJuvenile Crime Task Force, on which I served. I am pleased to see that \nthe amendment includes three provisions I proposed to the Task Force to \nhelp make our children's schools safer.\n  The first provision authorizes the use of funds to train school \npersonnel, including custodians and bus drivers. These key people on \nand near school grounds can be helpful in finding suspicious objects, \npipe bombs, or other means of harm if they had the proper training. \nThese personnel can be utilized for identifying potential threats, \ncrisis preparedness, and emergency response. I intend to build on this \nwork in the FY 2000 Treasury appropriations bill by supporting the role \nof the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in training school \npersonnel in the detection of weapons and explosives.\n  The second provision authorizes the use of funds for the purchase of \nschool security equipment and technologies, such as metal detectors, \nelectronic locks, and surveillance equipment. This provision is based \non S. 996, the ``Students Learning in Safe Schools Act of 1999'' which \nI introduced on May 11, 1999.\n  The third provision would invest more resources in School Resource \nOfficers, including community policing officers. This important \ninitiative expands the Cops in Schools program which I was pleased to \nauthor as S. 2235 in the 105th Congress. This bill was enacted into law \nin 1998 and this Spring the Justice Department is making $60 million \navailable for this program in this year alone. School Resource Officers \nwould work in cooperation with children, parents, teachers and \nprincipals to identify dangers and potentially dangerous kids before \nviolence erupts and innocent children get hurt.\n  The Ashcroft Amendment includes many other important provisions to \nenhance school safety. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in \nfavor of this amendment.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me briefly comment on what I think is \nmost appropriate. We have spent a couple of hours on the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment. It is a pretty clear and pretty straightforward amendment. \nWe have debated some very useful aspects. I would like a vote on this \namendment, because I think it will improve safety in our schools. It \ncloses this loophole. I feel very strongly about not postponing it \nuntil later, or deferring it, or handling it in conference. I would \nlike to see an up-or-down vote on it and move on after that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have had a pretty good debate, and it \nhas been said that it has taken 2 hours. That doesn't bother me. I have \nspent years on this bill. I spent years on it. I spent my entire \nlifetime with a disabled brother. Do you think 2 hours means anything \nto me? It doesn't mean anything to me. We spent 3 years on this bill--3 \nyears--bringing IDEA up to date. Do you think 2 hours bothers me? Not a \nbit.\n  I am going to say something to my friend from Tennessee. He is a good \nman; he has a good heart. I am going to read back to my friend from \nTennessee his words spoken on the floor May 14, 1997. The issue then \nwas a Gorton amendment, which would basically have turned back to the \nlocal school districts the power to basically discipline kids with \ndisabilities. I want to read back to my friend from Tennessee what he \nsaid then:\n\n       Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong \n     opposition as well to this amendment before the Senate, put \n     forth by the Senator from Washington, an amendment which \n     would instruct local education agencies to set out their own \n     policy--a potentially very different policy--in disciplining \n     students with disabilities. In short, under his amendment, \n     each school district potentially would have its own distinct \n     policy in disciplining disabled children. And with 16,000 \n     school districts, the potential for conflicting policies is \n     very real. And I am afraid this would be a turn-back to the \n     pre-1975 era before IDEA. Is this a double standard? I say \n     no. Clearly, we have outlined a process whereby students, if \n     there is a manifestation of a disability, would go down one \n     process. And if a discipline problem was not a manifestation \n     of a disability, that student would be treated just like \n     everyone else.\n\n  I am continuing to quote from the statement of the Senator from \nTennessee on May 14, 1997:\n\n       I think this is fair, this is equitable. Remember, if \n     behavior is not a result of that disability, all students are \n     treated the same in this bill. If behavior is secondary to a \n     disability, there is a very clear process which is outlined \n     in detail. Yes, it does take several pages to outline that, \n     but it sets up a balance between the school, between school \n     boards, between parents, and between children.\n\n  Senator Gorton claims this amendment is about local control, and I \nfeel that it will be used, I am afraid, to turn back the hands of the \nclock to the pre-1975 conditions where we know that children with \ndisabilities were excluded from the opportunity to receive a free and \nappropriate public education.\n\n  I say to my friend in Tennessee that he was right then. Mr. \nPresident, he was right then. Now we are caught up with the issue of \nguns and bombs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator was always kind enough to yield to me. I \nwould certainly respond with the same kind of favor in response to the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Does the Senator from Iowa believe there should be two \nstandards, if one child with a disability walks into a school with a \ngun and a child without a disability walks in with a gun, if there is a \nzero tolerance policy for the States, the individual who walks in with \nthe gun should be back in classroom within 45 days when the person \nwithout a disability is totally disallowed?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Tennessee, I use his own words. \nHe said this is a ``double standard.'' I say no.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me also say that in this bill, if you look on page 3, \nlines 1 through 8, in terms of intentional or not intentional, in terms \nof whether or not someone brings a gun or a firearm----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Where is the Senator reading from?\n  Mr. FRIST. In terms of ``intent.'' We have narrowed this bill so \nspecifically\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nin terms of an individual bringing a gun or a firearm with intent into \nthe classroom that they should all be treated the same. I think it is \nimportant that is what this amendment is all about is equal treatment, \nfair treatment, the same treatment, whether or not you have a \ndisability, whatever your educational status is, that you are treated \nthe same, if you bring a gun into the classroom or you bring a firearm \ninto the classroom.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the Senator talking about subsection (a)(2) on page 3?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I read that. It says, ``Nothing in clause (I)(1) shall be \nconstrued to prevent a child with a disability who is disciplined \npursuant to the authority provided under clause 1''--that is, \nexpulsion--``from asserting a defense that the carrying or possession \nof the gun or firearm was unintentional or innocent.''\n  I ask the Senator, to whom does that child assert the defense?\n  Mr. FRIST. To whom?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. To the people he jeopardizes by bringing into that \nclassroom a gun. Is it intentional or not intentional when you come in? \nIt should not matter other than it is intentional. He needs to be \ntreated the same as everyone else. If you are placed out of the \nclassroom, if you do not have a disability, you ought to be placed out \nof the classroom for that same period of time whether you have a \ndisability. All children should be treated the same.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have already been through that. I don't know if we \nneed to go over it again. We have already decided that if a kid brings \na gun to school, the principal can take that kid out of that school \nimmediately, can call the police and have the police come and haul them \naway.\n  Does the Senator disagree with that?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is the not issue. It is who ends up back in the \nclassroom. I pointed out again and again the statistics of individuals \nwith disabilities, because of this special loophole, who end up within \n45 days back in the classroom bringing a gun the first time, the second \ntime, and ending up back in the classroom. If you do not have a \ndisability, you cannot end up in the classroom. Let's treat everyone \nthe same if they bring a gun or if they bring a bomb into the \nclassroom. That is what the amendment is about.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator says a kid can assert a defense that the \ncarrying or possession was unintentional. I ask, to whom? It doesn't \nspell it out here. They can assert a defense. But assert it to whom? \nThe principal?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes. To the local authority, to the principal, to the \nteacher. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He can assert that defense.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That it was unintentional. And what kind of process is \nset up which would ensure that there would be a fair and impartial \nhearing on that?\n  Mr. FRIST. The same process that applies to every other student, the \nother 85 percent of the students in the classroom. That is the whole \npoint. Let's treat everyone the same. If they come into a classroom \nwith a gun or a bomb, you treat them the same. The local authorities \ndo. The principal does. The teachers do. That is the whole point. Let's \ntreat them the same. It is what equity is all about when we are talking \nabout guns in the classroom, or firearms and bombs in the classroom. \nYou treat them the same. They don't end up back in the classroom.\n  That is the fundamental essence of what this amendment is all about. \nYou treat them the same.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might remind the Senator that he started off talking \nabout the Littleton incident. I am going to get into this, because I \nthink it is important. I ask the Senator--I will start with a \nstatement. I hope it is not disputable that in the last 39 months there \nhave been eight school shootings in which kids have died. How many of \nthose shootings involved a kid with disabilities? I ask the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. I have not seen those statistics. I would be happy to take \na look at them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will say it and open it up to any repudiation. There \nhave been eight school shootings in 39 months. Not one of those \ninvolved a kid with a disability--not one. Yet we have an amendment \ngoing after kids with disabilities. Yet not one involved a kid with a \ndisability. In fact, I will point out that four of the kids killed at \nLittleton were kids with disabilities.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Of course, I yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. How many people have to die or be murdered before the \nSenator from Iowa is willing to close this loophole? Do you want to \nwait? Is that the point of using statistics? Wait until people are \nmurdered? We know people with disabilities who bring a firearm or a \nbomb to school are ending up back in school when students without \ndisabilities are not. Do you want to wait until statistics show people \nare murdered?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. That is why we changed IDEA 2 years ago, I say to my \nfriend, to provide that whoever brings a gun or weapon to school can be \nimmediately removed by the police and taken down to the police station. \nThat is why we did that.\n  Mr. FRIST. That gets them out for 10 days?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mr. FRIST. Then what?\n  Mr. HARKIN. During that 45 days, I say to my friend, during the 45 \ndays--he should know this; I am sure he does--during the 45 days there \nis an Individualized Education Program, an IEP, developed during that \n45 days. That IEP will address behavior modification, therapy services, \nand intervention to make sure the behavior does not occur again. This \nIEP protects not just the child but protects the school. The only way a \nschool needs to let a kid back in is if that kid is meeting the \nobjectives in the IEP and the school wants them back in. That is the \nprocess.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. There were eight students in Tennessee a year and a half \nago brought firearms in the school. We have gone through this, I know. \nTwo had no disability and were expelled. They are out. Six of the eight \nwere disabled students, individuals with disabilities, and were in \nspecial education. For three of those who brought the gun to the \nclassroom, it was related to a manifestation of their disability. It \nhas to be that the individuals with disabilities have individual needs \nthat have to be addressed. They should be addressed. Constitutionally, \nthey should be addressed. Ethically, they should be addressed.\n  When it comes to a firearm, or a when it comes to a bomb, after those \n45 days, three of those eight students in Tennessee who brought a bomb \nto the classroom, or a gun, or firearm, firearm, deadly weapon, ended \nup back in school through this loophole when none of the other students \nwithout a disability had that loophole. They entered back into the \nschool.\n  When you keep saying get them out for 10 days, in truth, whether it \nis 35 or 45 days, they are back in the classroom and treated in a \ndifferent way. I say treat them the same.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I ask my friend from Tennessee, was that under the \nold law or the new law?\n  Mr. FRIST. Those eight, may have been under the old law, I am not \nsure. I gave other statistics with the nine students from this year. I \nwill have to check on that.\n\n  I don't want to stress the statistics too much. I keep using them \nbecause I have a great fear something bad will happen as a result of \nthe law we created.\n  I can say on the 45-day period which we have talked about and worked \non writing together, if a person is a threat during that 45 days, and \nyour team says you are a threat, the Senator is exactly right, they can \nbe kept out another 45 days. After that 45 days, what? I guess it can \nkeep going on. We have great faith in that.\n  As someone who has, as the Senator, seen a lot of individuals with \ndisabilities, if somebody brings a gun into the classroom and they are \nexpelled like everybody else for 10 days and go through a manifestation \nperiod, I don't know exactly how to know whether that individual is \nthreatening. We have to go through all the disabilities. That will be a \ntough diagnosis to make in terms of saying, no, you are too threatening \nto go back when parents are there who are saying go back; teachers, \nlawyers, who say he hasn't done anything over the last 15 or 20 days, \nmaybe we should let him go back.\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\n  That is what our bill gets out. Treat everybody the same, if you have \na disability or no disability. If you bring a gun or firearm to school, \nyou should be treated the same. The same applies to cessation of \nservices. You should be subjected to the decisionmaking of the local \nprincipals and teachers in terms of services, as well as in terms of \nexpulsion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Tennessee that the example he \nkeeps using in Tennessee did occur under the old law, not the new law. \nI hope we can forget about using that example.\n  Under the new law we passed, we do provide that 45 days can be \nextended indefinitely if the school officials feel that child is a \nthreat either to himself or herself or to the school.\n  Again, I just hope that example is not used because it confuses \npeople. We shouldn't be confusing people when the new law is different \nthan the old law.\n  I take a back seat to no one when it comes to the issue of safety in \nschools. I just put two daughters through public schools all their \nlives. One just graduated from college; my second daughter is a senior \nin public high school--student body president, too, I might add. Why \nnot brag? If you can't brag about your kids, what can you brag about?\n  Both my wife and I have always been concerned about safety at school. \nWe have talked a lot about it with our daughter, Jenny, so I don't take \na back seat to anyone in terms of safety. There are few things as \ncritical to any parent as making sure the kids are safe when they go \nout the door in the morning and when they come home in the afternoon.\n  I think the recent tragedies in Colorado are the culmination, the end \nresult, of eight school shootings in 39 months--Oregon, Kentucky, \nMississippi. I point out, again, to my friend from Tennessee, the kid \nin Oregon was expelled, went home, got a gun and came back and shot \nkids. I don't know if expulsion helped in that case.\n  If you want to base this on the fact that expulsion will make the \nkids safer in school, I say look what happened in Oregon. It didn't \nseem to work there.\n  I do believe that what has happened during these 39 months and what \nhappened in Littleton is, indeed, a call to action to our families, to \nour churches, schools and communities.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just getting on a roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield to his friend on the other side?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to ask the Senator, this debate has gone on for \nquite a well. It has been one of the better debates I have seen or \nlistened to, on both sides.\n  It is clear we have a difference of opinion. It is clear both sides \nthink they have a legitimate case to make. I know the distinguished \nSenator is one of the champions for persons with disabilities, as am I. \nWe have worked closely together through the years. I understand the \ndifficulties that are involved here. I understand his sincerity. I also \nunderstand the sincerity of the Senator from Missouri and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. They are decent people. They are good men. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee is a major force on the Labor Committee, as is the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  We are in the middle of a bill that really needs to be passed now. \nThis is our seventh day on this bill. It is not a full-blown crime bill \nthat took a tremendous amount of time. This is a limited, narrow bill \nwith a lot of provisions that will make a difference with regard to \nchildren in our society. I would like to bring it to conclusion.\n  I guess I am asking my friend from Iowa, can we get an idea of how \nmuch time the Senator desires? I will talk to my people on my side to \ntry and shorten our time so we can proceed with the rest of the \namendments on this bill and hopefully lock in the final time agreement \non all the remaining amendments and a final vote certain so everybody \nin the Senate will know what we are doing. I just want to ask my \ncolleague if he will cooperate with me and set a time agreement so we \ncan move this bill ahead, rather than have this stay in the logjam it \nis in.\n  It is a sincere set of differences. It seems to me the way to resolve \nthose differences is time honored. We go to a vote on this amendment \nand then I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment be the \nSenator's amendment which rebuts this amendment. So we go to a vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Iowa and let the chips fall where \nthey may.\n  I don't see any reason to delay this bill when I am willing to make \nthat offer. I will see that the Senator gets an amendment immediately \nfollowing.\n  If you win, you win; if you lose on this one, you lose.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator is thinking over his \noffer, and he will yield without losing his right to the floor, during \nthe few moments when the Senator from Utah was otherwise engaged on the \nSenate floor and I discussed this with him, I made a suggestion that we \nactually accept both the amendments--the amendment of the Senators from \nTennessee and Missouri and the amendment that the Senator from Iowa \nwould have--knowing that it goes to conference, where the distinguished \nSenator from Utah will be the Chair, I will be the ranking member from \nthe Senate. This whole issue is going to have to be revisited in \nconference, anyway. I can guarantee from my experience that it will be \ndifferent from the other body.\n  I suggest that as a possible way out. I have a couple of reasons for \ndoing that: No. 1, with 25 years experience, it is a pragmatic way to \ndo it; secondly, this is the juvenile justice bill. Earlier this \nafternoon, I was speaking about crimes against senior citizens. If we \nstay on this much longer, the juveniles we are talking about today will \nbe senior citizens that we may want to protect tomorrow.\n  I would like to bring this to an end. We have an agreement. I think \nthere will be time agreements on anything left. The distinguished \nSenator from Utah and I are going to very soon propose a package of \nmanagers' amendments that wipes out a lot of the deadwood and perhaps \nwe could go forward.\n  I throw that suggestion out again. I know the Senator from Tennessee \nsaid he would not find that acceptable, and of course he, as any \nSenator, has an absolute right--the Senator from Missouri, as any other \nMember, has an absolute right to have a vote one way or the other on \ntheir amendment or in relation to it.\n  However, I ask the Senators that they might want to consider that.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield further.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield further without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I can understand why the Senators from Missouri and \nTennessee want a vote on their amendment. I can understand why the \nSenator wants a vote on his amendment. It is a legitimate way to \nresolve an issue. I don't know which way the votes will go on either \nissue and I take a great interest in this as well. But there will be a \nconference and we will probably resolve these issues in the best \ninterests of all.\n  My position is we have had a lengthy debate. I have deliberately \nstayed off the floor because I wanted Senators to have a free and open \ndebate on this. But it seems to me we have had the debate. Basically, \nboth sides have really explained their positions. Everybody knows what \nthey are.\n  My suggestion is we go to a vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Missouri, up or down, and then if they \nlose, they lose. Then I will ask unanimous consent, whether they win or \nlose, that the Senator be entitled to immediately bring up his \namendment which would undo everything they are doing and we go up or \ndown on a vote there. And we even could have an additional period of \ntime so people could hear one last explanation on the differences \nbetween the two sides.\n  What I want to avoid is a filibuster. I want to avoid the Senator \nfeeling he has to now delay this whole bill because he feels deeply \nabout this issue. I feel deeply about it, too. I think these Senators \non this side feel deeply about it. You feel deeply about it. Frankly, \nthere is still a conference where we can work with both sides to see if \nwe can resolve this as we go to conference. But I would like to be able \nto push this bill forward, because it is an important bill and every \nday we delay--we all know once we get it through the Senate, the\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nbill has to come through the House. Then we have to go through \nconference. Then we have to send it down to the President. If he signs \nit, then it becomes law.\n  We are talking weeks or months before we can get a juvenile justice \nbill passed that might prevent more Columbine High School massacres. \nBut we have to get this done.\n  We also have a supplemental appropriations bill that has to be \nbrought up, because it is important. It is not fair to hold this bill \nhostage--either side--now. It is not fair to hold this bill hostage \nbecause of a dispute that literally is a legitimate dispute on both \nsides that can be resolved by voting. Let the chips fall where they \nmay. I have had to do that. I have had to eat a lot of stuff here on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As have I.\n  Mr. HATCH. As has the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  As floor managers, we are trying to bring people together. I say to \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa, I believe he has faith that I will \nalways try to do what is right for persons with disabilities. I will \nuse my optimum good efforts to try to make sure this matter is resolved \nin a manner that is credible and acceptable to both sides--or at least \nas acceptable as can be to both sides. But I would like to set a time \nlimit for further debate, which I hope will not be very long because \nyou have been debating now for hours. I think virtually everything has \nbeen said that needs to be said. Then let's just go to those votes.\n  The Senator is not on a list right now, to come up, I do not believe, \nafter this amendment. But I will get you on the list. I will ask \nunanimous consent you be given that privilege. I think it is fair. I \nthink it is a way of resolving this. I don't want to see a filibuster \nhere at the last minute on a bill of this importance when this could be \nresolved through voting and when I am giving the Senator a shot at his \namendment, which basically rebuts theirs, immediately following it. I \nthink that is fair. It is a reasonable way of doing it.\n  You are dealing with two managers who have done their utmost to bend \nover backwards for everybody on the floor. I have even bent over \nbackwards for the Senator from Minnesota, time after time--I finally \ngot a smile out of him. It is the only time he smiled all day.\n\n  But I would like to see my friend from Iowa do that. If he would, I \nwould personally appreciate it. I would like to get this bill done, at \nleast pushed forward as far as we can. I believe we can finish this \nbill tonight if we have time today. We have had 7 days on this bill. I \nwould hate to go on 8 days, but I would even do that if we have time \nagreements on all these amendments, time agreements on when we vote, \nand let the chips fall where they may and let's go at it.\n  I intend to call up an amendment as soon as these two are disposed \nof, if that is what we do, and we will move ahead on the other \namendments and we will try to shorten the time on all the amendments. I \nam asking the distinguished Senator from Iowa to shorten the time, \nagree to a time agreement, and I will certainly live up to asking \nunanimous consent and getting his amendment immediately following the \namendment of the distinguished Senators from Tennessee and Missouri.\n  Will the Senator please help me in that regard--help us, Senator \nLeahy and me?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will respond to my friend from Utah, and he is my \nfriend and someone I like a lot, and respect a lot.\n  Mr. HATCH. And vice versa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He has made a very impassioned plea here, and I know he \nfeels strongly about the bill.\n  But I just have to respond this way. This bill may be cited as the \nViolent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation \nAct of 1999.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. That is if we ever get it passed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Kids with disabilities haven't been shooting anybody. I \nmean, let's be honest about it. The reason this bill is here on this \nfloor is because of what happened in Littleton, CO. The Senator from \nTennessee, when he first started out----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point, just on that point? \nI am sorry to interrupt him, but this bill has been in the works for 2 \nsolid years. We have worked with our colleagues on the other side \nrepeatedly. I think the distinguished Senator from Vermont and I are \ntogether on the managers' package. It is very comprehensive. This is \nnot some quick thing. We have worked very hard on it. Littleton--yes--\n--\n  Mr. HARKIN. But what precipitated bringing it to the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would have brought it to the floor before Littleton, but \nwe didn't have the time to do it. But it certainly helped.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Everyone hears talk about school shootings and school \nviolence. As I have pointed out, as I said to my friend from Utah, \nthere have been eight school shootings in 39 months and 27 have been \nkilled. Not one of those involved a kid with a disability. Not one. Two \nyears? We spent 3 long years, and I spent years before that, working \nwith IDEA. We spent 3 years hammering out an agreement because there \nwas this clash between the school boards and the principals and the \nteachers and the parents of kids with disabilities--3 years we sat in \nrooms around here.\n  Mr. HATCH. And I am a strong supporter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We finally got it resolved. I can remember as though it \nwas yesterday when we went to the Mansfield Room. It was Newt Gingrich, \nit was Trent Lott, there were Democrats and Republicans and the \ndisability community and representatives of the principals and the \nschool boards. We sat in that room right there, that Mansfield Room, \nand we all said hallelujah, we all agree. We didn't all get what we \nwanted. Parents had to give up something. Principals gave up something. \nBut we got a bill we all agreed we were going to live with and work \nwith.\n\n  We agreed in that room that we were not going to go back and make \nchanges on this bill. We were going to give it a chance to work. These \nare the changes we made.\n  I say again to my friend from Tennessee, he keeps bringing up this \nexample--that happened under the old law, not the new one. The new law, \nI say to my friend, the regulations for the new IDEA, just went into \neffect in March of this year. I have been on the Department of \nEducation for a year to get these regs out, but they received them in \nMarch. We have not even given it a chance to work. Yet, that great \nbipartisan effort, that bipartisan solution that we had that culminated \nin the IDEA amendments of 1997, somehow is now being torn apart.\n  Why? Because of school shootings--what is going on?--when none of \nthese kids were disabled?\n  I know the Senator from Missouri is a nice guy. The last thing he \nwould want to do is to be mean to anybody. But I have to tell you, if \nyou back up and see it from where I am coming from, I have to tell you \nhonestly, with all my heart, this is almost scapegoating kids with \ndisabilities. I know you do not mean to do that. But I have talked to \nso many parents out there. They talked to me about this amendment and \nsaid: Why are they scapegoating my kids? My kids didn't shoot anybody. \nMy kids with disabilities haven't done anything. Why are we doing this?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield without losing the right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me please finish. This amendment does not belong in \nthis bill.\n  If I am going--if I am taking time, I say to my friend, the only \nreason I am taking time is because I think there are a lot of Senators \nhere who do not understand what is going on. They have not had the \nprivilege I have had of working on disability issues for 25 years. I \nbelieve they need to be informed.\n  It took us 2 hours today simply to get us to agree that if a kid \nbrings a gun to a school, regardless of whether that kid is disabled or \nnot, they can kick him out right away and take him to the police \nstation. It took us 2 hours just to get that agreement.\n  Now we are onto another phase, and that phase is what happens after \nthey are removed. I do not think it has been fully fleshed out yet as \nto why there is a process set up for kids with disabilities. Then we \nhave to get to the third stage and that is what happens at that point \nin time, at the end of 45 days. If I take some time, I say to my friend \nfrom Utah, it is because I believe I\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\nhave an obligation to my families with kids with disabilities--\n  Mr. HATCH. I know that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. To be able to look them in the eye and say: I did \neverything humanly possible to make sure that every Senator who comes \ndown and casts that vote knows exactly what that vote is about. I do \nnot believe I have done my job yet. I, obviously, have not done my job \nyet.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. And I am going to take more time to do my job.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am suggesting we take some more time, but that we agree \non a time limit so everybody in the Senate knows. What that does for \nyou--you are concerned about Senators learning, knowing what to do and \nhearing your position--when they know there is a time certain, that is \nwhen Senators generally try to listen. I am not asking you not to take \nmore time. I am not asking you to not filibuster. I am asking you--\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just not certain how much time it is going to take \nme. That is why---\n  Mr. HATCH. I am asking you to set a reasonable time limit. I am also \nsuggesting, as somebody who has been around here as long as the Senator \nfrom Iowa, that the time-honored way to resolve these matters when you \nhave a legitimate, honest difference of belief is to vote. Right now, \nthe Senator does not have the right to a vote on his amendment, as I \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have my amendment filed.\n  Mr. HATCH. You cannot bring it up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have my amendment filed.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want your amendment to come up after this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have my amendment filed.\n  Mr. HATCH. You cannot get it up in this context without unanimous \nconsent. I will get that for you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I can get it up anytime.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure you can. What I am saying is, let's vote, but do it \nafter you have a reasonable time to explain your position. But let's \nset a time limit so 99 Senators are not held up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder--\n  Mr. HARKIN. I still have the right to the floor. I yield, again, \nwithout losing my right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are trying to do a number of things. \nOne, the Senator from Utah and I are reflecting our respective parties. \nWe want to get through the bill, get a final vote one way or another \nand do it in such a way as to protect Senators on both sides of the \naisle. He has a responsibility for his side of the aisle, and I have \nresponsibility for my side of the aisle. I take that responsibility \nstrongly. Senators have a right to be heard and a right to vote. But at \nsome point, we have to wrap it up and vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. May I suggest this: Senators may have good, strong debates \non this--and I yield to nobody in my admiration of the Senator from \nIowa and what he has done. I have taken his lead on so many issues \ninvolving the disabled because he is a recognized national expert on \nthis.\n  My suggestion, another possibility, is we set this matter aside and \nstart voting on some of the things we have already done. We finished \ndebate, or all but the last couple of minutes of debate, on the \nLautenberg amendment. Let's vote on that. Let's vote on something on \nthe chairman's side of the aisle and maybe set it in such a way that \nthose votes will come within a few minutes of each other.\n\n  During that time, Senators will be able to talk more. The Senator \nfrom Utah and I will be able to bring up the managers' amendment and \nthen see if it is possible to have time agreements, but time agreements \nin such a way that Senators will know this amendment comes up at this \ntime, this amendment comes up at another time, so there will be more \nfocus.\n  I suggest that as a possibility. We also know that as much as we \ntalk, oftentimes these things are worked out during a rollcall vote. \nThat is one way we can do it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take just a moment. I certainly \npay tribute to the--I have not heard more passionate, more heartfelt, \nmore substantive, more powerful oratory and argument on the floor of \nthe Senate than what Senator Harkin has done. I thank him as a friend.\n  I say to my colleagues, if I can get their attention for a moment--\nSenator Leahy and Senator Hatch--if there is agreement to see what can \nbe resolved in discussions while Senators come to agreement with one \nanother, I would be very pleased, on behalf of myself and Senator \nKennedy, to have the pending amendment laid aside and we will just go \nright to this disproportionate issue, which is a complicated and \nimportant debate. I am ready to do that right now. If you want to try \nto work this out, I am ready to ask consent to lay the pending \namendments aside and go right to this amendment and the debate and we \nhave time set for it. I want to make that clear.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield again without losing his right to \nthe floor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin \nbe permitted to offer his amendment, and that the regular order be, for \nvoting purposes: the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, then the Harkin \namendment--so Senator Harkin's amendment will immediately follow--then \nthe Wellstone amendment and then the Lautenberg amendment, and then we \nwill have one from our side as well at that point. Is there any \nobjection to that order?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am putting it in the order I think you want to be in.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the right to object, and I say this----\n  Mr. HATCH. This is not the vote. I am just putting the order \ntogether.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand. I am saying if there is a vote on the Frist \namendment, then what kind of time is allotted to the Senator from Iowa \nfor his amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. We have to agree on this. We are not setting time limits.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You are just setting the order.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to set a time----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will you read that again?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am asking unanimous consent that the order of the next \ngroup of amendments to be voted upon be Frist-Ashcroft, Harkin, \nWellstone and then Lautenberg and then one from our side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think there may be some people here who may want--I \ndon't know what the majority leader's predisposition is on this. Maybe \nsome people want to move to Wellstone and vote on that before they get \nto this. I hate to preclude that possibility with a unanimous-consent \nrequest that this is the only order we will take. I would object to \nthat.\n  Mr. HATCH. You would object to having yours put into the appropriate \norder?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Only if that order is locked in totally.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is locked in, but it is locked in in a way that \nprotects you--that is what I am trying to do here--so everybody knows \nwhat the matter is. I am putting in an order so that you can \nimmediately follow the Frist amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You say that upon completion of a vote on the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment----\n  Mr. HATCH. Then you have a right to call up your amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then I have a right.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what I am saying.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Don't put it in that wording because that locks in the \norder and because there may be votes before the Frist amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, there will not be votes before Frist.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Why? This protects you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We may want to lay it aside and go to another amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. We can do that. This is to benefit you. You don't give up \none\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nthing other than you get in line; you are not in line now, behind the \nFrist amendment. To be frank with you, my purpose is to give you a shot \nat your amendment. If theirs happens to be adopted, you have a shot at \nyours which does away with theirs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Actually, it does not do away with it. It modifies it; it \ndoes not do away with it.\n  Mr. HATCH. But it puts you in a position, and you don't lose a thing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nsuggest, again, what I suggested earlier: if this can be set aside, go \nto the Lautenberg amendment and vote on it very quickly, one on your \nside that can be voted on quickly thereafter, and then go back to the \nFrist-Ashcroft amendment, partly so that we can talk during the votes. \nI don't make that as a request, but I suggest that really as a way out \nof all of this without giving up anything.\n  Mr. HATCH. With the same understanding that Senator Harkin has the \nright to the floor, that is just not acceptable. The Senators from \nMissouri and Tennessee want a vote on their amendment. They are willing \nto go ahead with Senator Harkin's amendment immediately following, if I \nunderstand it, and let the chips fall where they may.\n  I just want to move this ahead. I am trying to protect you so you are \nin order to come in at that point. If you don't want to, that is fine \nwith me. It is an advantage to you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know that it makes a lot of difference.\n  Mr. HATCH. It keeps the thing focused so people know what you are \ntalking about. To me, that is a reasonable request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well----\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me withdraw it then. I don't care. What I am trying to \ndo, I say to Senator Harkin again without you losing the right to the \nfloor, I am trying to move this ahead. I am making a legitimate good-\nfaith effort to move it ahead. It is apparent that we are not going to \nhave a vote until we have the Ashcroft-Frist, Frist-Ashcroft amendment \nvoted on.\n\n  I would like, then, to give you the opportunity to have your \namendment called up, which modifies their amendment. Then we will have \na vote on your amendment. Then we go and just keep going down the line, \nas we have done. We are not going to move ahead until we vote on this \namendment. If you are going to filibuster, that is another matter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator that I may still move to table the \nFrist-Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a right the Senator has.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a right to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I may move to table; whereupon, after that motion to \ntable is dispensed with, one way or the other--obviously, I am sure I \nwould lose on that--the bill then becomes open to amendment. I may have \nsome amendments to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Amendments or an amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Amendments. And that could only occur, if I understand \nthe parliamentary procedure, after a motion to table is dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No amendment is in order at this point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. At this point.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. If I move to table the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment, and that is disposed of, as I understand the unanimous-\nconsent request, the bill then would be open for amendment--or the \namendment would be open then after there is an action on it, on that \namendment, on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Frist amendment were tabled, the \nquestion would recur on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. No. What would happen if the Frist amendment were not \ntabled?\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry. I do not think the Lautenberg \namendment is next on that list.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might, Mr. President, reclaiming my right to the \nfloor----\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I have that parliamentary inquiry? I just want to \nknow, what is the order? I do not think Lautenberg is next.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On the parliamentary inquiry, I just want to read from \nthe unanimous-consent request, Order No. 8.\n\n       Ordered further, That the following amendments be the only \n     remaining first degree amendments in order, with relevant \n     second degree amendments in order thereto only after a vote \n     on or in relation to the first degree amendment and the \n     amendments limited to time agreements, where noted, all to be \n     equally divided in the usual form.\n\n  So, obviously, a tabling motion would be a vote in relation, and \ntherefore reading that, I submit, that then relevant second-degree \namendments would be in order. I make that parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is correct that a \nsecond-degree amendment would be in order if the motion to table Frist \nfails.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. What I propose does not change that at all. If we put \nthese amendments in order, the Frist-Ashcroft, Harkin and Wellstone and \nLautenberg, that still does not take away your right to move to table \nand then file a second-degree amendment, if you desire to. We would \nhave to dispose of the Frist-Ashcroft amendment first. And you would \nhave every right to do that.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that correct? All I am doing is setting the order in \nwhich these things would follow. He would not be deprived of moving to \ntable the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, and if it is not tabled of offering \namendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Offering amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the understanding of the unanimous \nconsent request, a vote on Frist would include either a motion to table \nor an up-or-down.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If your interpretation of your consent request \nis that a vote on Frist includes a vote to table, then we would be \ncorrect in that we have agreement on that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I think we would.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You want to read that unanimous consent request again? I \nam still----\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be permitted \nto offer his amendment, and that the regular order be the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment, and if there is a motion to table by Senator \nHarkin, and it is not tabled, then it would be open for----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Or any motion to table.\n  Mr. HATCH. Any motion to table, and it is not tabled, then it would \nbe open for a second-degree amendment. But immediately following the \ndisposition of that would be the Harkin amendment with the same \nconditions, the Wellstone amendment with the same conditions, and the \nLautenberg amendment with the same conditions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, then under his proposal, \nhow many second-degree amendments could be offered to the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment if, in fact, the tabling motion was not agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How many angels can dance on a pin?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not hear the response.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the motion to table the Frist amendment \nfails, then that amendment is open to relevant second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Relevant second-degree amendments, in the plural?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me ask one other question about this unanimous \nconsent request. Let's say someone wants to set this aside and move on \nto another amendment. Would that be allowed under this proposal?\n  Mr. HATCH. With unanimous consent, it would.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That would require unanimous consent, I would assume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would require unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just as it does now.\n  The unanimous consent request, again, because I really want to \nprotect my rights, and I just want to make sure my rights are fully and \nadequately protected, I ask the Senator if perhaps it could be reduced \nto writing or something just so I can take a look at it. I\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nam going to be here for a while talking anyway.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. We will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to make sure my rights are protected. That is \nall. I just want to look at it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw my unanimous consent request at this particular \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. We may want to set this aside for that purpose. If we do, \nI will ask the Senator, would the Senator please give some \nconsideration to my request that we have a time agreement--I am not \nsuggesting what time, but that we have a time agreement on the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment so that everybody here knows what is going on? Then \npeople will listen to his recitation of what he believes as to the \nsituation. Can you give us a time agreement?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not at this time I cannot, I say to my friend. I cannot \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I said, I take a backseat to no one in \nmy concern for safety in schools, having a daughter who is a senior in \nhigh school now and a daughter who just graduated from college, both of \nwhom have attended public schools all of their lives.\n  I daresay that what has precipitated this bill has been the recent \ntragedy in Littleton, CO, and the eight shootings over 39 months in our \npublic schools in America. These tragedies have, indeed, called us to \naction, called us as families, churches, schools, communities, parents, \nteachers, and, yes, as lawmakers.\n  I hope these tragedies lead us all to take positive and constructive \nsteps to reduce the likelihood of any recurrence. We want to make sure \nall of our schools are places of learning, not of fear.\n  But we should not let this tragedy of Littleton lead us into \nemotional, unfounded, though well-intentioned actions which can harm \nthe most vulnerable in our society, and those are our kids with \ndisabilities.\n  I know that the amendment is well-intentioned. The Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Missouri are good people. But this would \namend the Individuals with Disabilities Act, and I believe in the \ndeepest part of my being that this amendment will have just the \nopposite effect. If enacted, it will do a couple of things. It will \nmake our schools and communities less safe, and it will turn the clock \nback on all the advances we have made in our country to ensure that \nkids with disabilities have a fair shot at the American dream.\n  This amendment targets a group of students who are more likely to be \nthe victims of school violence than the perpetrators. It is the kids \nwith disabilities, now mainstreamed into our schools, who are beat up \non, preyed upon, made fun of by nondisabled kids. Time and time again, \nit is the kids with disabilities who are the victims of the violence. \nThis has been true for a long time, a long time.\n  Why are we singling them out with this amendment? None, not one, of \nthe eight school shootings in the last 39 months was perpetrated by a \nchild in special education. So why do we have this amendment?\n  Well, I just want to point out, sadly, four of the students shot in \nthe rampage at Columbine High School were special ed kids --four of \nthem. So why are we singling out kids with disabilities? Why are we \nchanging a law that we passed 2 years ago, that we just got the \nregulations issued in March of this year, which has not had even an \nopportunity to work? Why are we doing it?\n  Well, I forget which Senator it was who said, well, we do not want to \nwait until something bad happens. My gosh, under that philosophy, what \nelse can we do to our schools? How about all the kids with \ndisabilities? What are we going to do with them if we don't want to \nwait until something bad happens? That philosophy can take you down a \nlot of alleys, a lot of dead-end alleys. I think the answer to ``we \ndon't want to wait till something bad happens'' is exactly why we \npassed the amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct 2 years ago. That is why we have said, if a kid is violent, brings \na gun to school, they can get them out immediately to protect the \nschool.\n  I hope everyone heard here today--we finally got an agreement on that \npoint--that if a kid brings a gun to a school, regardless of whether \nthat kid is disabled or not, they can call up the police and have that \nkid hauled down to the police station immediately, immediately. Now, \nwhen there is some thought around here that somehow because a kid is \ndisabled, the principal has to go through all kinds of hoops to get \nthem out of school, I say that is not true. And we finally at least got \nthat nailed down today.\n  I yield to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to ask the Senator one question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield for another inquiry from the \nmanager?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been trying to avoid a filibuster here on a bill \nthat I think everybody admits is very important. The Senator has \nindicated he is willing to filibuster. And as somebody who has been \naround here a long time, who knows how to do it, I recognize one when I \nsee one.\n\n  Let me make an offer here that I think is superfair. I have tried to \nmake an offer that the Senator get in line right behind this amendment \nso he has every shot at his amendment.\n  Let me ask Senators Frist and Ashcroft, as well, would both sides be \nwilling--since we know 60 votes is the key, would both sides be willing \nto do this: That we call up for a vote, after another reasonable time \nfor final debate here, but hopefully a very short time, call up the \nAshcroft-Frist/Frist-Ashcroft amendment? And if it does not get 60 \nvotes and we call yours up right after, if neither of them gets 60 \nvotes, we pull them both, rather than have a filibuster here--excuse \nme, Lautenberg and Frist. OK.\n  Let me ask, I have to ask the Senator from Vermont. It has been \nsuggested that since we had had problems with this amendment, which is \n60 votes, if they don't get 60 votes, they pull it. We do the same with \nthe Lautenberg; if he doesn't get 60 votes, we pull that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You are going to have to ask Senator Lautenberg that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Are you talking about the--\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I didn't hear the question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to make sure I understand this. If the Senator from \nUtah is suggesting that if the most hotly contested gun amendment does \nnot get 60 votes, we throw it out--\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. --I don't think anybody is going to accept that.\n  Mr. HATCH. We throw this one out and that one out.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think there is a better way of doing that. I was \ndiscussing it with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. I would \nlike to listen to his suggestion.\n  Mr. LOTT. Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ABRAHAM). The Senator from Iowa has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator from Iowa yield to me?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Of course.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think everybody is trying in good faith to find a way to \ndeal with this issue and move on. I thought that idea just proposed \nmight work, but it looks as if that would be objected to.\n  What I would like to propose as an alternative--and it is being typed \nup now, and we want both sides to look at it--is that we go forward. We \nset aside the pending amendment, and we go forward with a series of \nvotes, including probably the managers' package, which a lot of people \nhave been interested in and concerned about. They would be able to see \nwhat it was. And then go to the Lautenberg amendment and have a vote. \nThen go to a Smith-Jeffords amendment and have a vote. Then go to \nWellstone and have a vote, and then to a McConnell.\n  So we would have a series of stacked votes while we continue to work \nto see how we can resolve other outstanding issues. But rather than \njust continuing to talk back and forth without making progress, looking \nat the hour here, if we could have a series of, I believe it would be \nfive votes--six votes now--I think that would be one way to give us \ntime so we could make progress and\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\ngive us time to continue to work on these other issues.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Has the Smith-Jeffords amendment been sent up and discussed? We have \nseveral amendments that have already been offered, and I do not know \nwhy we are--maybe I do know why and I just don't want to realize after \nthis very amiable discussion, Mr. Leader, that we had earlier about how \nwe were going to cooperate and let the public hear what we are really \ndoing here.\n  I ask--we have several amendments, on both sides--what would the \nregular order be, Mr. Leader? As I understand it, the Parliamentarian \ncan answer that. There was no Smith-Jeffords in there. We have an \norder, and it would be nice to not suddenly suggest that perhaps 60 \nvotes would do it. And then we could hear--\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, 60 votes--it was suggested.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In good fellowship, I know.\n  Mr. LOTT. It was suggested. This is not taking everything in the \nexact order. We have been moving the order around back and forth since \nMonday. For instance, the managers' amendment--usually you don't do \nthat until the last thing. In a show of good faith, an indication from \nSenator Leahy was that Senators would like to have that done and see \nwhat is in it. We would put that first in the pecking order, which \nwould not be the way it is always done, but it would be constructive. \nThen Lautenberg, I think, would be the next pending thing. And these \nothers, I am not sure of the exact order they are in, but I propose \nthat we do them that way so we can move forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I might say, if the Senator from Iowa will \nyield so I may respond.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I find much in the proposal--I realize it is going to be \ntyped up and has not been made yet, but the proposal by the Senator \nfrom Mississippi is a good one for moving us forward. I am not sure the \nmanagers' package would even need a rollcall vote. If that is the case, \nthe first rollcall vote will be on the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Jersey, and the next one would be--well, it would be whatever order \nthe distinguished leader has spoken. Again, based on the experience I \nhave had managing bills, I tend to agree with the distinguished \nmajority leader. This might be a good way to get us moving. I also \nsuggest that it protects the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from \nMissouri, and the Senator from Tennessee. But it moves us forward.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right. We are having this typed up now. We will get copies \nto the managers on both sides and the leadership. But I believe this is \none way to keep the bill going. We have had a good lengthy discussion \ntoday, and there is a fundamental disagreement on this. At some point, \nI hope the Senator from Iowa--like on Lautenberg and on these others, \nwe worked through this without second-degreeing, without obstructing. \nYou all have had some amendments you don't like, and we have had a few \namendments we don't like, but in the end you vote. If you win, you win; \nif you lose, you lose. It still has to go to conference and all that. I \nhope we can get an agreement on this. I don't think anybody is \ndisadvantaged. I think everybody will think they have had a fair shot. \nSenators Frist, Ashcroft and the Senator from Iowa can talk during the \nvotes and see if we can't find a way to bring it to a conclusion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Iowa to yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I still have the floor. I will yield without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My question is really vis-a-vis the Senator from Iowa \nto my colleague from Utah. The amendment I have been trying to get on \nthe floor is the Wellstone-Kennedy amendment dealing with \ndisproportionate minority confinement. I assume when we listed the \namendments that already has a 2-hour limit set.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Iowa will yield, he is getting to be a \nreally good traffic cop here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Red light, green light.\n  Mr. LOTT. If your understanding is that you would like to have your \nvote maybe earlier in the lineup, I don't see a problem with that. We \ntry to alternate, Republican and Democrat.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine. We already have a 2-hour time limit on \nthat. We agreed on that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Two hours more debate?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is on disproportionate minority confinement. It is \nthe amendment I have with Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is another amendment. Don't you have another \nWellstone amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have another one.\n  Mr. LOTT. This is regarding your other Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have been waiting on the floor forever. I am pleased \nat what the Senator from Iowa is doing. The one laid aside is going \ninto the managers' package. I have been waiting patiently. When you put \nit in order, please put in the Wellstone-Kennedy amendment, which deals \nwith a very important question that we have been trying to debate for \ndays.\n  Mr. LOTT. This one is No. 356, identified as a Wellstone amendment. \nIt is not the amendment you are speaking of. If I understand you \ncorrectly, you are talking about a Kennedy-Wellstone amendment, and you \nneed 2 more hours for debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This has been agreed to for days. That is right. The \namendment, I am assuming, in the sequence that we are talking about is \nthe Wellstone-Kennedy amendment dealing with disproportionate minority \nconfinement. Two hours to be equally divided is the agreement on that. \nNo. 356 has been allegedly put in the managers' amendment. If we can \nplease put this one on the list.\n  Mr. HATCH. Nobody ever agreed to 2 hours. I don't know if we ever had \nan agreement on that. Of course you have to have enough time to argue, \nbut I hope it is not 2 hours.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has the floor, and I \nask if he will yield without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield under those conditions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask if it might be in order to suggest the absence of a \nquorum, which I am not doing, but to do that under a unanimous consent, \nthat at the completion of it the Senator from Iowa would be allowed to \nreclaim the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask the Senator from Iowa if he will be willing to have a \nvote on his amendment in the sequence we are talking about here?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to see the lay of the land before I answer a \nquestion like that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am inquiring because I had nobody to ask that. You all \nhave had a good, full debate. I wondered if you would not be ready to \ngo to a vote now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, I don't feel that I am. I haven't even finished my \nstatement yet. As I said earlier to my friend from Utah, I believe \nthere are a lot of misperceptions out there on this amendment, and \nbeing the poor debater that I am and the poor teacher that I am, I \ndon't believe that I have fully and adequately represented what this \nmeans to families with kids with disabilities. It will probably take a \nlittle longer simply because I am so poor at getting across my point, \nit seems. So I am going to have to take a look at that before I make \nany decisions. I am not going to answer hypothetical questions.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield to the leader to do that. I \nask unanimous consent that when the quorum call is dispensed with, this \nSenator, the Senator from Iowa, be given the right to the floor at that \npoint in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield the floor, you will have the \nfloor when we return, too. That was agreed to. I will put in a quorum \ncall to try to work this out.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivileges of the floor be granted to Lucille Zeph for the pendency of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under the previous arrangement, I further suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me make it clear at the beginning, Mr. President, we \ndon't want to in any way dispossess the Senator from Iowa from his \nopportunity to be further heard, if he so desires, on his position with \nregard to the Ashcroft-Frist amendment. I ask in this agreement that \nthat discussion be set aside and we go to four other amendments and \nhave the debate and stacked votes on those amendments.\n  I will state the agreement which Senator Daschle had a chance to \nreview. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set \naside and the Senate proceed immediately to the managers' package, and \nfollowing that amendment, the following amendments be considered for \nvotes in the following sequence, under time agreements where noted, in \nthe usual form.\n  I want to emphasize, the managers' package would go first; there \nwould be some description of that. We understand that would probably \nnot require a recorded vote. I further ask consent that the amendments \nbe voted in the order listed below, with 2 minutes for debate prior to \neach vote for explanation. In other words, we will have 2 hours of \ndebate on the first one, then go to the other amendments, but before \nthe actual votes occur there will be 2 minutes for final explanation, \nand that all provisions of the consent agreement of May 14 be in place.\n  The amendments are as follows: The Wellstone disproportionate \nminority amendment, for 2 hours of debate; the McConnell amendment \nregarding public schools, 30 minutes; the Boxer amendment regarding \nafterschool time, 10 minutes; and the Gordon Smith-Jeffords amendment \nregarding pawnshops. We will specify the time when we have had a chance \nto review that.\n\n  That is the order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there \nare no second-degrees; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be the usual agreement of no second-degrees prior \nto a vote on the motion to table.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, a Wellstone-Kennedy amendment is \nlisted?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, frankly, this is \naddressing the amendment which is pending, and it is rather complex. I \nwould be grateful for an opportunity to look at this agreement if it is \nwritten up. I would like to have a chance to consider it.\n  Mr. LOTT. As I told the Senator from Iowa--and I believe Senator \nFrist has been on the floor most of the time--this is in no way \nintended or will not disadvantage or eliminate this amendment. It will \njust set it aside so we can make some progress on amendments where time \nagreements are already locked in. We will have votes on those \namendments at the end of those agreed-to times.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just remind \neveryone that we have approximately 24 hours left of this week. In that \ntimeframe we have to do not only the rest of this bill but the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The only way we are going to finish \nthis is if everybody is willing to cooperate a little bit more and \nindulge the leadership and the managers of this bill in such a fashion \nthat will allow completion.\n  It has been difficult, and, I must say, increasingly frustrating, for \nthose who have tried to work through all of this in a way that would \nallow some reasonable conclusion. It seems the longer we work on it, \nthe more everyone's back is up. It is essential we work together and \ntry to resolve this matter. We have been on this bill now for over a \nweek. It is time to bring it to a successful conclusion.\n  I ask the cooperation in the remaining hours of this debate on the \npart of Members on both sides, so that we can finish it.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for his comments. I very strongly \nfeel the same way. We have come a long way on this bill. The underlying \nbill was one that had bipartisan support.\n  We have narrowed down the number of amendments to a finite list. \nSenator Reid has worked very diligently to accomplish that. We must \ndeal with the supplemental appropriations bill before we go. In order \nto do that, we will have to have some cooperation.\n  I have been criticized because I have maybe tried to be too fair, \neverybody has that fair, straight-up shot: No second-degrees, make your \npoint, have the vote, win some, lose some. If we go with that attitude, \nwe can complete this list and the other amendments and complete this \nbill and do the supplemental.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nthink this is a good step forward. The Senator from Utah and I and the \nSenator from South Dakota and the Senator from Mississippi have worked \nvery hard, along with appropriate other people, to cut down the list.\n  I ask one question, because it is one we are obviously going to be \nasked: Under this agreement, when will we vote on the Lautenberg gun \namendment? When would the leader expect we would be voting on the \nLautenberg amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. There will be an effort for that to be either the first or \nthe second vote. The pending business, I believe, would be the \nAshcroft-Frist issue. We would have to dispose of that and then we \nwould go to, I hope, a series of additional stacked amendments which \nwould lead off, I presume, with Lautenberg right at the front.\n  In order to do that before we did Ashcroft-Frist, we would have to \nget another agreement. I would like to do it because I think that is an \nissue that a lot of people feel very strongly about. I would like to do \nit like the rest. It is time to vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished leader is saying it would not be voted \non tonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. No, it would not be voted on tonight. What we would do, for \nthese four amendments, is debate and then vote, and the pending \nbusiness would be the Frist-Ashcroft amendment at the end of that. I \nwant to make that clear so you are not dispositioned by that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it possible to modify this consent request to say \nthe Frist-Ashcroft amendment would be the pending business at the \nconclusion of this vote, and no later at the onset of the business \ntomorrow morning?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the status. But I would be glad to modify it to \nthat extent, because it just confirms what the status is, procedurally, \nanyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent as \namended?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with Senator Ashcroft with one provision, if we \nsay ``Senator Harkin retaining the right to the floor when the Senate \nreturns to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment.''\n  I have the right to the floor now. I had the floor. I just want to \nmake sure when this amendment comes back up that I have the right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is that the procedure? Did he have the floor anyway?\n  I am told you have that right anyway, so I don't think we give \nanything up by including it in the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Then I would add we would then pass this amendment by voice \nvote. I was just kidding, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That last part was not included.\n  Mr. LOTT. That was not there.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was not included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are now anxiously awaiting the comments \nof the Senator from Minnesota. We hope he will feel free to condense \nhis time. Oh, the managers' amendment would be first. We expect there \nwould be stacked votes in sequence between 7:30 and 8.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have a managers' amendment which has been \ncleared on both sides as far as I know. This amendment is a compilation \nof amendments by Members on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I now ask unanimous consent that any pending amendments be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 363\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send a managers' amendment to the desk \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes en bloc an amendment numbered 363.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Chairman and I have been able to put \ntogether a managers' amendment and a package of amendments that improve \nS. 254 in a number of ways that should please Members from both sides \nof the aisle. We have accomplished this task by finding the middle \nground, and the bill will be a better one for it.\n  I said last week during the Senate's consideration of this bill that \nwe should not care whether a proposal comes from the Republican or \nDemocratic side of the aisle. A good proposal that works should get the \nsupport of all of us. Our first question should be whether a program or \nproposal will help our children effectively, not whether it is a \nDemocratic or Republican proposal.\n  This managers' amendment and package of amendments reflects that \nphilosophy. It shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets \nto work, we can make significant progress. I commend the Chairman for \nhis leadership in this effort and I am glad we were able to work \ntogether constructively to improve this bill.\n  Many Members had good additions and modifications to make to this \nbill, and we have agreed to accept them in the managers' package of \namendments.\n  In addition to the amendments included in the package, the chairman \nand I have worked together on a managers' amendment to address a number \nof my longstanding concerns with the underlying bill. Let me explain \nwhat those changes accomplish.\n  I noted my concern at the beginning of this debate that the State \nprerogative to handle juvenile offenders would be undermined by this \nbill. The changes we made to the underlying bill in the managers' \namendment satisfies my concerns. For example, S. 254 as introduced \nwould repeal the very first section of the Federal Criminal Code \ndealing with ``Correction of Youthful Offenders.'' This is the section \nthat establishes a clear presumption that the States--not the federal \ngovernment--should handle most juvenile offenders--18 U.S.C. section \n5001. While the original S. 254 would repeal that provision, the \nmanagers' amendment retains it in slightly modified form.\n  In addition, the original S. 254 would require Federal prosecutors to \nrefer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of ``concurrent \njurisdiction . . . over both the offense and the juvenile.'' This \nlanguage created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal prosecutors \ncould avoid referral by simply claiming there was no ``concurrent'' \njurisdiction over the ``offense'' due to linguistic or other \ndifferences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the \njuvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference \nin how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they \nwere different offenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could \nhave allowed federal prosecutors to end-run the presumption of referral \nto the State.\n  We fix this in the managers' amendment, and clarify that whenever the \nfederal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the same \nconduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal \nprosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances.\n  Finally, I was concerned that, contrary to current law, a federal \nprosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile in federal court \nwould not be subject to any judicial review. The managers' amendment \nwould permit such judicial review, except in cases involving serious \nviolent or serious drug offenses.\n  Another area of concern has been the ease with which S. 254 would \nallow federal prosecutors to prosecute juveniles 14 years and older as \nadults for any felony.\n  While I have long favored simplifying and streamlining current \nfederal procedures for trying juveniles, I believe that judicial review \nis an important check in the system, particularly when you are dealing \nwith children. S. 254 included a ``reverse waiver'' proposal allowing \nfor judicial review of most cases in which a juvenile is charged as an \nadult in federal court. I had suggested a similar proposal last year. \nThe managers' amendment makes important improvements to that provision.\n  First, S. 254 gives a juvenile defendant only 20 days to file a \nreverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first \nappearance. This time is too short, and could lapse before the juvenile \nis indicted and is aware of the actual charges. The managers' amendment \nextends the time to make a reverse waiver motion to 30 days, which \nbegins at the time the juvenile defendant appears to answer an \nindictment.\n  Second, S. 254 requires the juvenile defendant to show by ``clear and \nconvincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile \nrather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, \nparticularly under strict time limits. Thus, the managers' amendment \nchanges this standard to a ``preponderance'' of the evidence.\n  As initially introduced, S. 254 would require juvenile criminal \nrecords for any federal offense, no matter how petty, to be sent to the \nFBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as he grew into an \nadult, with no possibility of expungement from the FBI's database.\n  The managers' amendment makes important changes to this record \nrequirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI will be limited to \nacts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In addition, \nunder the managements' amendment, a juvenile would be able after 5 \nyears to petition the court to have the criminal record removed from \nthe FBI database, if the juvenile can show by clear and convincing \nevidence that he or she is no longer a danger to the community. \nExpungement of records from the FBI's database does not apply to \njuveniles convicted of rape, murder, or certain other serious felonies.\n  Much of the debate over reforming our juvenile justice system has \nfocused on how we treat juvenile offenders who are held in State \ncustody. The Federal government for years has required States, in order \nto qualify for certain grant funds, to provide certain core \nprotections, including separating juveniles from adult inmates, keeping \nstatus offenders out of secure facilities, and focusing prevention \nefforts to reduce disproportionate confinement of minority youth.\n  In the last Congress, S. 10 either eliminated or gutted each of these \ncore protections. The chairman and Senator Sessions significantly \nimproved S. 254 in this regard, and I commend them for that. The \nmanagers' amendment continues to make progress on the ``sight and sound \nseparation'' protection and the ``jail removal'' protection.\n  Specifically, the managers amendment would make clear that when \nparents in rural areas give their consent to have their children \ndetained in adult jails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their \nconsent at any time. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's \ndetention must determine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, \nand may review that detention--as the judge must periodically--in the \npresence of the juvenile.\n  The managers' amendment also clarifies that juvenile offenders in \nrural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while \nawaiting a court appearance, but only when no alternative facilities \nare available and\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\nappropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to make the court \nappearance or travel is unsafe to undertake.\n  The managers' amendment contains a significant improvement in the \nsight and sound separation requirement for juvenile offenders in both \nFederal and State custody. S. 254 has been criticized for allowing \n``brief and incidental'' proximity between juveniles and adult inmates. \nThis amendment fixes that by incorporating the guidance in current \nregulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult prisoners. \nSpecifically, the managers' amendment would require separation of \njuveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ``brief, inadvertent or \naccidental'' proximity in non-residential areas, which may include \ndining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, entry \nareas, and passageways.\n  I am pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a \nnumber of Members remain concerned, as do I, about how S. 254 changes \nthe disproportionate minority confinement protection in current law. \nThis will be an important debate, and I continue to believe we should \nsupport an amendment intended to correct that part of S. 254.\n  S. 254 includes a $200 million per year Juvenile Delinquency \nPrevention Challenge Grant to fund both primary prevention and \nintervention uses after juveniles have had contact with the juvenile \njustice system. I and a number of other members were concerned that in \nthe competition for grant dollars, the primary prevention uses would \nlose out to intervention uses in crucial decisions on how this grant \nmoney would be spent.\n  With the help of Senator Kohl, we have included in the managers' \namendment a clear earmark that 80 percent of the money, or $160 million \nper year if the program is fully funded, is to be used for primary \nprevention uses and the other 20 percent is to be used for intervention \nuses. Together with the 25-percent earmark, or about $112 million per \nyear if that program is fully funded, for primary prevention in the \nJuvenile Accountability Block Grant that was passed by the Senate in \nthe Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment, this bill now reflects a \nsubstantial amount of solid funding for primary prevention uses.\n  I expressed some concern when the Senate passed the Hatch-Biden-\nSessions amendment authorizing $50 million per year for prosecutors and \ndifferent kinds of assistance to prosecutors to speed up prosecution of \njuvenile offenders. I pointed out that this amendment did not authorize \nany additional money for judges, public defenders, counselors, or \ncorrections officers. The consequence would be to only exacerbate the \nbacklog in juvenile justice systems rather than helping it.\n  The managers' amendment fixes that by providing $50 million per year \navailable in grant funds to be used for increased resources to State \njuvenile court judges, juvenile prosecutors, juvenile public defenders, \nand other juvenile court system personnel.\n  I mentioned before that S. 254 includes a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution urging States to try juveniles 10 to 14 years old as adults \nfor crimes, such as murder, that would carry the death penalty if \ncommitted by an adult--the resolution does not urge the death penalty \nfor such children. While Vermont is probably one of the few States that \nexpressly allows for the trial of juveniles 10 years and older as \nadults for certain crimes, I do not believe that this is a matter on \nwhich the Senate must or should opine. The managers' amendment \ncorrectly deletes that sense-of-the-Senate from the bill.\n  These improvements to S. 254 in both the managers' amendment and in \nthe managers' package of amendments make this bill worthy of our \nsupport, and I am glad to do so.\n  The chairman and I have agreed that Members from both sides of the \naisle had good additions and modifications to make to this bill, and we \nhave agreed to accept them in the managers' amendment. Let me give some \nexamples of amendments we have agreed to incorporate into the bill.\n  Senators Landrieu and Schumer proposed amendments to the Juvenile \nDelinquency Prevention Challenge Grant program to help abused, foster, \nand adopted children so they will not fall through the cracks and \nbecome at-risk for delinquency;\n  Senator Durbin sponsored an amendment to help schools use caller-ID \nto deal with bomb threats;\n  Senator Feingold sponsored an important amendment to clarify the \nintent requirement in the new gang crime so it has a better chance of \nwithstanding a constitutional challenge;\n  Senators Sessions, Robb, Allard, and Byrd joined together on an \namendment to authorize a national hotline for confidential reporting of \npeople who have threatened school violence. This important proposal was \nfirst proposed by Senator Robb in a more comprehensive amendment that \nwas tabled in a party line vote;\n  Senators Kohl, Biden, Dorgan, Dodd, and others from both sides of the \naisle, including Senator Hatch, have made a number of good proposals \nfor prevention and intervention of juvenile crime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, to talk a little bit about a program we \nunderstand has been accepted by the Senate for inclusion in this bill.\n  Five years ago, during the last re-authorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, Senator Dodd, Senator Nunn and I included \na provision in that Act to allow for several pilot projects around the \nnation centered on increasing character education in our schools.\n  That legislation helped foster the growth of the Character Counts \nmovement across a few schools in a few states.\n  The amendment that the Senate has agreed to accept today will expand \nupon that effort. The bill provides $25 million in funding for \ncharacter education through the Department of Education, including $15 \nmillion for schools and $10 million for after-school programs.\n  My colleagues have heard me talk before about the Character Counts \nprogram, where children and teachers use six pillars of character and \nincorporate them into their daily lessons. Things like trustworthiness, \nrespect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.\n  After five years, I believe that I can say that the effort to bring \ncharacter education to our schools has been a success. In New Mexico, \n200,000 kids and 90 percent of our schools participate in some form of \ncharacter education. Teachers tell me that character education has \nempowered them in a fabulous way to teach and reinforce positive \nbehavior by their students.\n  Schools which have utilized Character Counts report lower instances \nof truancy, classroom disruptions and student violence. Character \nCounts makes schools better places to learn for our children, and \nteaches them values in the process.\n  And it's not just the teachers who want to bring this program to our \nnation's children. Parents believe that it is important too. A recent \nsurvey by the Superintendent of the Albuquerque Public Schools found \nthat 84 percent of parents felt that strengthening education programs \nwhich teach character and integrity should be a high priority for their \nschools. Improving character education is the number three overall \nconcern parents express about the quality of their children's education \nin Albuqerque. The amendment accepted today will allow more schools to \naddress this concern.\n  I have heard colleagues say that six percent of all juvenile \ncriminals commit 60% of all of the violent crime in America. This bill \nwill encourage states to treat this small percentage of violent \njuvenile offenders like adults and get them off of the streets.\n  It is obvious that there are a lot of very good kids out there, \nworking hard every day to go to school, study hard and improve their \nlives. Character education will help the adults in their lives to teach \nthem to make good decisions, based on things like respect, caring, and \nresponsibility.\n  I understand that the Senate also has accepted two other Domenici \namendments to allow states to use some of their portion of the $450 \nmillion Accountability block grant program and part of the $200 million \nDelinquency Prevention Challenge grant program to fund character \neducation initiatives. This will provide states with additional \nresources to incorporate character education in their schools, if they \nchoose to do so.\n  I have seen this work in New Mexico, and I am pleased that the Senate \nhas\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\nagreed to help bring Character Counts to other areas of the country \nwhere maybe it has not caught on quite as well as it has in my state or \nConnecticut. I thank the Senate for accepting my amendments and I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n           preventing Delinquency Through Character Education\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico in offering this amendment to provide support \nfor character education projects in schools and in after-school \nprograms. These programs, organized around character education, would \nprovide alternatives to youth at risk of delinquency and work \nspecifically to reduce delinquency, school discipline problems and \ntruancy and to improve student achievement, overall school performance, \nand youths' positive involvement in their community. Our amendment--\nwhich I understand will be considered as part of the managers' \npackage--would authorize no less than $25 million per year for \ncharacter education in schools and in after-school settings.\n  I am not here today to claim that character education is the answer \nto all the questions that have been posed to us as policy makers, \nparents and community members in the wake of the tragedy at Littleton, \nCO.\n  But character education is part of the answer. Today's children have \nso many obstacles to overcome, including violence, drug use, peer and \ncultural influences, and too much unsupervised time on their hands. As \na society, we must find ways to help these children become responsible \ncitizens, to distinguish between right and wrong. To do this, we must \nbuild on traditional education by nurturing students' character.\n  That is fundamentally what character education is about--it is about \nreinforcing those elements of character which bind us together into \ncommunities and into this great nation. Ideas like--trustworthiness, \nrespect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship--underlie all \nof our government and civic organizations. We must reinforce these \nbeliefs with our children at every opportunity.\n  Parents have the primary responsibility here. Churches and other \ncommunity organizations support these efforts. Schools are a key part \nof the equation. And these ideas must be a part of a child's day--after \nschool--when they are often unsupervised and most risk of negative \nbehaviors.\n  And that is what this amendment does. It would set aside $25 million \nfor school-based and after-school programs in character education. \nSchools could use these funds to work with parents and develop a \ncharacter education program for their schools. We have seen so many \nsuccessful programs in schools in my state; indeed, over 10,000 \nstudents currently participate in these activities. And the schools \nreport amazing turn-around with reduced absenteeism, discipline \nproblems, graffiti and fighting and improved student achievement and \nstudent participation in positive extra-curricular activities.\n  In addition, this amendment would support afterschool programs that \nare organized around character education. These out of school hours are \na key opportunity for our youth. We can provide enriched academic \nactivities, sports and the arts. Or we can leave them to the \nalternatives--smoking, drug use, teen pregnancy, delinquency, and \ncrime. I believe the better route is supervised, quality after school \nprograms--and these programs will be even stronger with the inclusion \nof a character education focus, such as provided in this amendment.\n  I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for his dedication \nto our children and to character education. I am pleased to be here \nwith him again today to move forward this critical initiative that \ntruly gets at the core of delinquency.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \naccepting the mentoring amendment that I offered, and I want to thank \nmy colleague Mr. Dorgan for cosponsoring this amendment.\n  I believe that youth mentoring is an important piece of our effort to \ndecrease violence among our young people. This amendment encourages us \nto take youth mentoring seriously. It asks states to develop criteria \nfor assessing the quality and effectiveness of mentoring programs and \nto reward those programs that do a good job. It also asks the \nDepartments of Justice and Education to disseminate information on best \nmentoring practices, so that mentors can receive guidance on how to \nmake the best use of their time with students.\n  Since the school shooting in Littleton, Colorado, a few weeks ago, \nCongress and the nation have been grappling with the question ``How do \nwe prevent such a terrible tragedy?'' The answer to this question is \ncomplex, and, as we know from our debate here on the floor of the \nSenate, there are many different points of view as to what more we \nshould do to keep our kids healthy and safe.\n  I believe that one of the things we must do is increase the amount of \nquality time our young people have with caring, responsible adults. \nWithout a doubt, the most important adult in a child's life is that \nchild's parent. But even the most committed, well-intentioned parents \ncannot be with their children 24 hours a day. And often young people, \nespecially teenagers, feel uncomfortable talking to their parents about \nsensitive or troubling issues.\n  That is why it is important that young people have someone in their \nlives they can turn to in troubling times. Now, some kids are fortunate \nenough to have a trusted aunt, uncle, or family friend in whom they can \nconfide. But some are not so lucky. Fortunately there are caring adults \nwho volunteer their time to become that trusted friend--we call them \nmentors.\n  We cannot know for certain that having mentors would have stopped the \ntwo teenagers in Littleton from harming their classmates. But we know \nthat the young men were troubled. And if we can increase the number of \nindividuals who are close enough to a young person to detect problems \nwhen they arise, we increase our chances of keeping those problems from \nspiraling out of control.\n  Mr. President, we know that mentoring works. In 1995 a Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters of America Impact Study showed that at-risk young people \nwith mentors were 46% less likely to begin using illegal drugs; 27% \nless likely to begin using alcohol; 53% less likely to skip school; 37% \nless likely to skip a class; and 33% less likely to hit someone than \nat-risk children without mentors.\n  In a 1989 Louis Harris poll, 73% of students said their mentors \nhelped raise their goals and expectations.\n  And a Partners for Youth study completed in 1993 revealed that out of \n200 non-violent juvenile offenders who participated in a mentoring \nrelationship, nearly 80% avoided re-arrest.\n  I believe in the power of mentoring, because I've seen it firsthand \nin my own state of Nebraska. In Nebraska, we have a fantastic program \nrun by Tom and Nancy Osborne called TeamMates. TeamMates is a school-\nbased program that pairs adult volunteers one-on-one with middle and \nhigh school students.\n  The Osbornes created TeamMates quite simply because they saw an unmet \nneed. They realized that there are a lot of bright and capable young \npeople out there who receive too little support and encouragement. In \norder to reach their potential to become good citizens and productive \nmembers of their community, these young men and women just need a \nhelping hand.\n  Tom and Nancy started TeamMates in 1991, and the success they saw in \nthat first year inspired them to continue. They started out with 25 \nmatches, and of the students in those matches, 20 graduated from \nhigh school and 18 pursued postsecondary education.\n\n  The response to TeamMates has been highly encouraging. Principals and \nadministrators have commented on the positive attitude change they see \nin students in just the first year of their relationship with a mentor. \nAnd 99% of the mentors choose to continue their relationship with their \nstudents after the first year.\n  Right now there are 475 TeamMate matches throughout Nebraska. And \nthey hope to have a total of 900 a year from now.\n  We have another terrific mentoring program in Omaha called All Our \nKids, which began in 1989 at McMillan Junior High School. At present, \nnearly 80 mentors are providing guidance to at-risk junior and senior \nhigh school students.\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\n  And All Our Kids enjoys a strong relationship with the Omaha Public \nSchools System. OPS staff work closely with All Our Kids staff to \nidentify students who need the services provided by its long-term \nmentoring and scholarship program.\n  With our help, TeamMates, All Our Kids, and other promising mentoring \nprograms throughout the nation will be able to expand the horizons of \nmore young people by providing them with caring adults to show them the \nway.\n  I also want to thank the managers for accepting my Sense of the \nSenate urging the President of the United States to allow each Federal \nemployee to take one hour a week to serve as a mentor to a young person \nin need.\n  Recently, Jim Otto, Nebraska State Director of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, called me and said, ``I read what you said about the \nimportance of youth mentoring, and I want to let you know that I'm a \nmentor in the TeamMates mentoring program in Lincoln. I want you to \nknow it's been a great experience.''\n  Jim said he was fortunate that his employer allowed him to take one \nhour a week of administrative leave to spend time with his student. But \nhe also said that some of his colleagues in other Federal agencies and \ndepartments were not so fortunate. Many employees would like to become \nmentors, but they just can't take time away from work.\n  Now, we have a lot of dedicated individuals throughout the nation who \nserve as mentors. Several members of my own staff participate in the \nEverybody Wins program in the D.C. Public Schools. And, as I mentioned \nearlier, we have great mentoring programs in Nebraska. But we need more \nadults to say, ``I want to make a difference.''\n  The purpose of this legislation is to enable more adults to take the \ntime to contribute to the well-being of their communities. It's just \none hour a week, but in a child's life it can make a world of \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, whether it's helping a student take an interest in \nschoolwork, helping build a young person's self-esteem, or helping a \nyoung man or woman communicate more effectively with parents, friends, \nand teachers, a mentor can be that invaluable safety net that keeps a \nchild from falling into despair.\n  Now, there are many steps we can take to try to prevent violent acts \nonce an individual reaches that point of desperation, but it is better \nfor all of us if we intervene before that point--and it is also less \ncostly.\n  With additional support for good mentoring programs we will be able \nto reach more young people before they become lost to substance abuse, \nisolation, or any other destructive behavior that leads them to commit \nacts of violence against themselves or others. In helping these \nprograms continue their good work, we raise the hopes of more of our \nchildren. And when our children's hopes are high, we all benefit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am glad to be a cosponsor of the \nmentoring amendment offered by my colleague from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, \nand I commend him for his work on this issue. I also want to thank the \nmanagers of this bill for accepting our amendment.\n  When it comes to juvenile delinquency, I subscribe to the notion that \n``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' I think it makes a \ngreat deal of sense to spend a dollar now to try and prevent young \npeople from becoming criminals in order to save the thousands of \ndollars it would cost later to incarcerate and rehabilitate them.\n  I believe one of the most effective forms of prevention is mentoring. \nI have seen firsthand that mentoring can make an important difference \nin a child's life through my participation in a wonderful program \nstarted by Senator Jeffords called Everybody Wins. Every week, I have \nthe privilege of spending an hour or so with a boy named Jamal. It has \nbeen a pleasure to watch him learn and grow into a fine, confident, \nyoung man.\n  I would encourage any of my colleagues who want to make a real \ndifference to become a mentor. At-risk young people with mentors are 46 \npercent less likely to use illegal drugs and half as likely to skip \nschool than at-risk youth without mentors. Nearly three-quarters of \nyoung people with mentors indicate that their mentors have helped to \nraise their goals and expectations.\n  Unfortunately, there are too many at-risk youth who do not have an \nadult willing or able to give them the regular, individual attention \nthey need. The amendment offered by Senator Kerrey and I would help to \nensure that exemplary youth or family mentoring programs in each of our \nstates are funded by the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Challenge \nGrant program established in this bill. I believe this would be a good \ninvestment in our young people, and I again thank my colleagues for \ntheir support of this amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation to the \nmanagers of this bill for agreeing to include in the manager's package \nmy amendment to authorize the FAST (Families and Schools Together) \nprogram.\n  Over the last few weeks, we have all spent much time mourning lost \nchildren--whether they are lost to bullets or to the lure of a violent \nculture, whether they end their lives holding a gun or facing one. And \nwe have spent much time discussing the many factors that can lead our \nyoung people to become lost. We can blame guns, or mindless T.V., or \nsavage movies, or violent video games, or illegal drugs. But we know \nthat a child is most likely to be lost--most likely to fall under the \ninfluence of these evils--when he or she is alone, cut off from \nparents, teachers, and the community.\n  FAST is a successful program that finds troubled youth and reconnects \nthem with their schools and families. FAST brings at-risk children, \nparents, and educators together to help them learn to succeed at home, \nin school, and in their communities. FAST helps ensure that youth \nviolence does not proliferate to our schools and communities by \nempowering parents, helping to improve children's behavior and \nperformance in school, preventing substance abuse, and providing \nsupport and networking for families by linking them to community \nresources and services.\n  Currently, the FAST program--which was created in my home state of \nWisconsin--is being implemented in 484 schools in 34 States and five \ncountries. It has received numerous national honors and awards, and is \nsupported by the Department of Education, Department of Justice, Office \nof Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention, Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Office of National Drug Control Policy, Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services Administration, National Institute of Mental \nHealth, Head Start, the Harvard/Ford Foundation, and the United Way of \nAmerica.\n  My amendment is simple and effective. It authorizes $12 million a \nyear for the next five years to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Programs in the Department of Justice for FAST sites and \nprograms. Of this amount, $10 million will go toward the implementation \nof local FAST sites and programs and $2 million will be used for \nresearch and evaluation of FAST. This amendment will allow more \ncommunities across the nation to reap the benefits of FAST--and will go \na long way toward preventing youth violence in this country.\n  Mr. President, one of the best ways to prevent youth violence is by \nbuilding and preserving close, healthy relationships within families. \nThe FAST program is instrumental in achieving this goal, and has been \nproven to work in reducing behavioral problems among troubled youth. I \nam pleased that Senators Hatch and Leahy have recognized the importance \nof this small, yet vitally important program by including the FAST \namendment in the manager's package. I thank them for their efforts in \nworking with me on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n        behavioral and social science research on youth violence\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are offering an amendment to the \njuvenile justice bill to authorize funding for the National Institutes \nof Health to carry out a broad-based initiative for basic research into \nyouth violence. This research will look into the fundamental cause of \nsuch violence and will be linked to research on the most effective ways \nto prevent it.\n  Clearly, we must do more to enhance our understanding of the \nfundamental psychological, behavioral, and social factors that \ncontribute to violence by young people.\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\n  NIH currently provides modest support for behavioral research related \nto violence, but the research is seriously under-funded in light of the \nobvious magnitude of the problem. In addition, the current funding is \nspread across many NIH Institutes and some important areas are not \nfunded at all.\n  This coordinated initiative, relying on the Office of Behavioral and \nSocial Sciences Research at NIH, will enable NIH to respond more \nquickly to the crisis of youth violence, eliminate the gaps in current \nknowledge, and focus more effectively on the important high priority \nquestions that scientists in the field have identified.\n  Violence is also a public health problem, and it is as perilous as \nany epidemic. The tragic shooting rampage by the two students in \nColorado shocked the country into a greater sense of urgency about \nyouth violence. Many elements contribute to violent behavior, and it is \nseldom traced to any single cause.\n  These causes need to be better understood if we are to design \neffective methods for treatment and prevention. We also need a greater \nunderstanding of how to apply the knowledge that we already have.\n  More effective school, family and community prevention activities can \nbe designed on the basis of what we learn from research and from the \npractical experience of clinicians, educators, and social scientists. \nThe goal of part of this research effort will be to develop better \norganizational models of effective partnerships among scientists, \npublic agencies, and community members. The research will also address \nthe psychological impact of violence on the victims, since many \nperpetrators of violence were themselves victims of violence earlier in \ntheir lives.\n  Our proposal for greater NIH research is an essential part of the \nanswer we are seeking to the tragedies of juvenile violence, and I urge \nthe Senate to support it.\n\n\n                              FAST Program\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Kohl's \namendment which was included into the Juvenile Justice bill's Manager's \nPackage. Mr. President, Senator Kohl's amendment would expand the \nFamilies and Schools Together or FAST program to reach the many at-risk \nstudents in need. FAST is an award winning drug abuse prevention \nprogram that supports and empowers parents to be the best line of \ndefense between their children and the dangers of drug abuse. The \nprogram uses a cooperative approach that gives parents professional \nsupport to prevent and confront drug abuse in the home.\n  I am proud to report, Mr. President, that the FAST program, which has \nreceived many awards and honors since its development 10 years ago, was \nfounded in my home state of Wisconsin by Dr. Lynn McDonald. Dr. \nMcDonald is one of the nation's experts on the prevention of drug abuse \nby young people. The unique FAST program is today being used in 484 \nschools in 34 states and five countries.\n  Research indicates that to be most effective, substance abuse \nprevention education should be initiated when children are young. \nResearchers also believe that prevention efforts that focus on family \nand peer relationships can greatly reduce risk factors for our \nchildren. While no one solution will rid our country of the problem of \nyouth drug abuse, it is critical that we make available to students, \nparents and schools successful programs that can make a difference. \nFAST has a proven track record: it has been tried, adapted, implemented \nand studied. It is clearly a program that has proven successful and \nshould be expanded to reach more families in need.\n  It is important to note, Mr. President, that we are not powerless to \nhelp prevent destructive behaviors, such as drug abuse, in our \nchildren. The FAST program requires a strong, committed partnership \nbetween schools and families to help the students at risk and to \nintervene successfully to prevent the downward cycle of drug abuse, \nwhich too often leads to youth violence.\n  I support this amendment, Mr. President, because I know that FAST is \na prevention program which helps young children at risk for developing \nproblems later on--by working with them and their families early on. \nSenator Kohl's amendment is a wise investment at the front end to catch \nstudents before their risky behavior results in tragic consequences for \nthemselves and their families. With assistance from the FAST program, \nfamilies become their own child's best prevention resource.\n\n\n                           WORKER PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have been engaged over the last week \nin the important, and at times difficult, task of defining how the \nnation will address the problem of youth violence and crime. Our goal \nis to develop steps that will be more effective in protecting society \nagainst juvenile crime and enabling youth to become productive and \nsuccessful members of our society.\n  We must also protect the rights of the men and women in the criminal \nsystem responsible for working with juvenile offenders. It is in the \nnation's interest to ensure that states which receive federal dollars \nfor their juvenile justice programs administer these programs in a \nmanner that protects the worker, the juvenile offender, and ultimately, \nthe taxpayers and citizens.\n  This amendment will ensure that workers who provide juvenile justice \nservices do not lose their jobs, their existing bargaining rights, or a \nloss of benefits if their program receives federal funds.\n  This is not a new concept. Since enactment of the Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention Act in 1974, Congress has recognized the \nimportance of making sure that the rights of state workers are \nprotected in juvenile justice programs funded with federal money. \nCurrent law provides that the distribution of federal funds for state \njuvenile justice programs will not displace workers, negatively reduce \ntheir wages, or impair existing collective bargaining agreements.\n  The intent of the current law, and of this amendment, is two-fold: to \nprotect workers' rights, and to protect the safety of juvenile \noffenders. For almost 25 years, the law has protected the employment \nrights of tens of thousands of state workers in the court system and \nthe juvenile justice system. These men and women, whose jobs are funded \nthrough grants to the states, are at the core of our juvenile justice \nsystem. They perform vital work, supervising and training troubled \nyouths in the courts and in the parole system. Even with the \nprotections under current law, and even when workers are covered by \ncollective bargaining agreements, these are not high paying jobs. \nSalaries go from the high teens to the low thirty thousand dollar \nrange.\n  The law also ensures the quality of the services provided by these \nworkers. Protecting the rights of current, experienced workers \nmaintains the stability of the workforce and ensures that well-trained, \nqualified personnel are staffing the juvenile justice system. If we are \nserious about protecting society against violent youth--if we are \nserious about rehabilitating young people and safely returning them to \nsociety, then we need well-trained and experienced workers and a stable \nworkforce with adequate skills and training in our juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  This amendment will make sure that existing collective bargaining \nagreements, and the rights under those agreements, would not be \ndisturbed when a state program receives a federal grant. The amendment \nwill prevent displacement of current workers when a program receives a \nfederal grant. For workers who are not covered by a collective \nbargaining agreement, this amendment may be the only job protection \nthey have when their program is funded under a federal grant.\n  We all agree that the juvenile justice system must be improved. Let's \nalso agree that preserving the existing rights of state juvenile \njustice workers, and preventing disruption of existing employment \nrelationships, are essential components that must be part of an \nimproved system. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n\n\n               demonstration program for high risk youth\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, America is struggling with a disturbing and \ngrowing trend of youth violence. While it is true that crime is \ngenerally down in many urban and suburban areas, it is equally true \nthat crime committed by teens has risen sharply over the past few years \nand it is expected to continue to rise. Crime experts who study \ndemographics warn of a coming crime wave\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nbased on the number of children who currently are younger than 10 years \nold. These experts warn that if current trends are not changed, we \nmight someday look back at our current juvenile crime epidemic as ``the \ngood old days.''\n  Thirty years ago, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an official of the \nJohnson Administration, wrote that when a community's families are \nshattered, crime, violence and rage ``are not only to be expected, they \nare virtually inevitable.'' He wrote those words in 1965. Since then, \narrests of violent juvenile criminals have tripled.\n  If we have learned anything from this debate and from all the \nresearch that has been done on juvenile violence, it is that there is \nno magic bullet, no single solution or panacea to the problem of rising \njuvenile crime. Juvenile crime is a complex problem that demands a \nmyriad of responses. It is a problem that demands a partnership \nsolution involving family, community, religious institutions, the \nmedia, the schools and law enforcement.\n  The amendment I am offering today with Senator Lieberman is a multi-\ntiered approach. First, the proposal targets youth who are at the \nhighest risk of leading lives that are unproductive and negative; youth \nwho have been or are likely to be incarcerated. Second, it brings \ntogether representatives of local government, juvenile detention \nproviders, local law enforcement, probation officers, youth street \nworkers, local educational agencies, and religious institutions to \nprovide highly intensive, coordinated, and effective intervention \nservices to high risk youth.\n  We provide seed money ($4 million a year with a 30% match) to enable \nthe establishment of a collaborative partnership in 12 cities: Boston, \nNew York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Denver, Seattle, \nCleveland, San Francisco, Austin, Memphis, and Indianapolis. We also \nprovide grants to grass roots entities in 8 cities to fund intervention \nmodels that establish violence-free zones through mediation, mentoring, \ncoordination with law enforcement and local agency partnerships and the \ndevelopment of long term intervention strategies.\n  Research has documented that this is the approach that yields \nsustainable results. According to Public Private Ventures, Inc., which \nhas been engaged in the study of programs for children, youth and \nfamilies, interventions for seriously at-risk older youth and youth who \nhave already become involved with the juvenile justice system require \nan innovative joining of youth development and crime reduction \nstrategies. This amendment does just that.\n  At the same time we must recognize that government solutions are \nlimited. Government is ultimately powerless to form the human \nconscience that chooses between right and wrong. Locking away juveniles \nmight prevent them from committing further crimes, but it does not \naddress the fact that violence is symptomatic of a much deeper, moral \nand spiritual void in our Nation.\n  In the battle against violent crime, solid families are America's \nstrongest line of defense. But government can be an effective tool if \nit joins private institutions (families, churches, schools, community \ngroups, and non-profit organizations) in preventing and confronting \njuvenile crime with the moral ideals that defeat despair and nurture \nlives.\n  This amendment is a step in that direction and I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                  ``PARTNERSHIPS FOR HIGH-RISK YOUTH''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Gregg's ``Partnerships for High \nRisk Youth'' amendment. This amendment establishes a national \ndemonstration project to identify the most effective practices and \nprograms for reducing youth violence. This initiative will provide 12 \nhigh-risk cities across the nation with funds to carry out local \ndemonstration projects. These initiatives will help us learn much more \nabout the best programs for reducing youth violence. Communities across \nthe country will benefit from the knowledge.\n  The most successful violence prevention programs take a comprehensive \napproach to youth violence. The goal is to reach out to youth and their \nfamilies on a variety of levels. Diverse groups--law enforcement, \nschools, mental health professionals, religious organizations, parents, \nand teachers--all need to join forces. This amendment supports this \nvital type of cooperation. The knowledge we gain will save lives. \nCommunities across the country will be able to learn from these \nsuccessful models and develop similar programs in their own towns and \ncities.\n  Boston has long understood the importance of community cooperation, \nand many of the ideas we have discussed have proven effective there. \nBoston's strategy is based on three strong commitments--tough law \nenforcement, heavy emphasis on crime prevention (including drug \ntreatment), and effective gun control. Neglect of any one of these \ncommitments undermines the whole strategy.\n  Several years ago, concerned groups in Boston joined forces to \ndevelop community-based solutions that made youth violence ``everyone's \nbusiness.'' Successful partnerships have included the pairing of mental \nhealth professionals, police and probation officers and school \nadministrators with clergy, community leaders, and even gang members \nthemselves. Statistics show that this strategy works. During the period \nfrom July 1995 through December 1997, there was only one juvenile death \nin Boston that involved a firearm.\n  Boston's Ten Point Coalition has received national acclaim for its \nwork with troubled youth. This is exactly the type of program that \nSenator Gregg's amendment will support. The Ten Point Coalition which \nwas founded by Rev. Eugene Rivers, is an ecumenical group of clergy and \nlay leaders who are working to mobilize the community on issues \naffecting African-American youth--especially those at risk. The \nCoalition is committed to helping at-risk children reach their full \npotential, and it offers training, technical assistance, resource \ndevelopment, and networking opportunities to churches and other \ncommunity groups interested in mentoring, advocacy, economic \nalternatives, and violence prevention. Its goal is to build a coalition \nof churches nationwide, united in their commitment to changing \nchildren's lives and reducing violence.\n  This amendment will help outstanding initiatives like this across the \ncountry, and I urge the Senate to support it.\n\n\n       violence prevention training for early childhood educators\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one of the best ways to approach juvenile \njustice is to prevent violent offenses from occurring in the first \nplace. Therefore, I am pleased to offer the ``Violence Prevention \nTraining for Early Childhood Educators'' amendment to S. 254, which is \naimed at preventing the development of violence in children at the \nearliest ages so that they never grow up to become juvenile offenders. \nThis amendment--which I understand will be contained in the Managers' \namendment at the conclusion of consideration of the bill--would \nauthorize no less than $15 million in grants for teachers to learn \nviolence prevention skills.\n  All of us have been shaken by the tragedy at Littleton, CO. Americans \nare left searching for answers to many questions. How could these \nteenagers have committed such brutality? What happened to the innocence \nand joy of youth? How can society help prevent such violent, deadly \nbehavior from happening again?\n  One of the most effective solutions is to begin violence prevention \nat an early age. This program is a carefully thought-out program aimed \nat true prevention. It is designed to help early childhood educators--\nthe people who work directly with young children in preschools, child \ncare centers, and elementary schools--learn the skills necessary to \nprevent violent behavior in young children. This amendment would \nprovide support to programs that prepare these professionals so that \nearly childhood teachers, child care providers, and counselors are able \nto teach children how to resolve conflicts without violence. In \naddition, these professionals are in the perfect position to reach out \nand extend these lessons to parents and help whole families adopt these \npowerful skills.\n  Research has demonstrated that aggressive behavior in early childhood \nis the single best predictor of aggression in later years. Children \nobserve and imitate aggressive behavior over the course of many years. \nThey certainly\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\nhave plenty of exposure to violence, both in the streets and at home. A \nBoston hospital found that 1 out of every 10 children seen in their \nprimary care clinic had witnessed a shooting or stabbing before the age \nof 6.\n  I am disheartened to report that in my home State of Connecticut, 1 \nin 10 teens have been physically abused. Alarmingly, more than a third \nof teenage boys report that they have guns or could get one in less \nthan a day. In these circumstances, aggression becomes very well-\nlearned by the time a child reaches adolescence.\n  We must provide children with strategies for altering the negative \ninfluences of exposure to violence. Early childhood offers a critical \nperiod for overcoming the risk of violent behavior and later juvenile \ndelinquency. And the proper training of professionals who work with \nyoung children offers one of the most effective avenues for reaching \nthese kids.\n  This is not to suggest that early childhood professionals would \nreplace parents as a source of teaching social skills and acceptable \nbehavior. Instead, these teachers should demonstrate these skills with \nthe children in their care and be encouraged to work with the whole \nfamily to address conflict without violence and aggression.\n  In 1992, Congress enacted similar legislation to provide grants for \nprograms that train professionals in early childhood education and \nviolence counseling. These grants funded some remarkable programs. In \nmy home state, a program at Eastern Connecticut State University \ntrained students--half of whom were minority, low-income individuals--\nto be teachers in their own communities, and trained child care \nproviders in violence prevention with young children.\n  Unfortunately, just as these efforts were getting off the ground and \nstarting to show promising results, the funding for the program was \nrescinded as part of the major 1994 rescission bill. Looking back, \nafter the horrible events in Littleton, CO, Springfield, OR, and too \nmany other communities, I think we can clearly see that was a mistake. \nHindsight is always clearer--but let's not make the same mistake going \nforward. Let's reinvest in these efforts so that we can prevent our \nchildren from developing into violent juvenile offenders.\n  Preventing future acts of violence is an issue that rises above \npartisan politics. I think we can all agree that steps need to be taken \nto reduce the development of violent behavior in children. Please join \nme in this effort to begin creating a safer society for everyone, \nespecially our children.\n\n\n                           truancy prevention\n\n  Mr. DODD. As many of my colleagues know, I have worked consistently \nfor the last several years to address what I believe is one of the key \n``gateway'' offenses leading to delinquency and serious crime among our \nyouth--Truancy. Working with Senator Sessions, we have been able to \ninclude language encouraging states and local communities to pursue \ntruancy prevention programs with the assistance they will receive under \nthis bill. I want to thank Senator Sessions for working with me on this \neffort.\n  Truancy is a dangerous and growing trend in our nation's schools. It \nnot only prevents our children from receiving the education they need, \nbut it is often the first warning of more serious problems to come. \nTruant students are at greater risk of falling into substance abuse, \ngangs, and violent behavior. For many students, truancy is the \nbeginning of a lifetime of problems.\n  It is estimated that, in the past ten years, truancy has increased by \nas much as 67 percent. On an average school day, in the United States, \nas many as 15 percent of junior and senior high school students are not \nin school. In some urban schools, absentee rates approach 50 percent. \nAlarmingly, the problem is becoming increasingly prevalent in our \nelementary schools. Almost one quarter of Connecticut's truants were 13 \nor younger.\n  By some estimates, truants cost our nation more than $240 billion in \nlost earnings and forgone taxes over their lifetimes. Yet this sum does \nnot include the billions more in dollars spent on law enforcement, \nfoster care, prisons, public assistance, health care and other social \nservices.\n  Fortunately, truancy is a solvable problem. Many communities, \nincluding many in Connecticut, have set up early intervention \nprograms--to reach out and prevent truancy before it leads to \ndelinquency and more serious criminal behavior. A number of Connecticut \ncities have brought back truant officers, hired drop-out prevention \nworkers, held parents accountable for their students absences, denied \ncredit to students with unexecused absences, and have created truancy \ncourts.\n  These programs are showing signs of success. Several towns have \nreported dramatic drops in daytime burglary rates--some as much as 75 \npercent--after instituting truancy prevention initiatives.\n  Unfortunately, communities have had difficulty implementing these \nprograms as truancy is considered an educational rather than a criminal \njustice issue, and, with growing classroom enrollments, many \nfinancially-strapped schools simply do not have the resources to \nadequately address this problem.\n  The provision that Senator Sessions and I are adding to the juvenile \njustice bill will ensure that communities have the wherewithal they \nneed to respond to this increasingly serious problem. The legislation's \ngoal is to promote anti-truancy partneships between law enforcement \nagencies, schools, parents, and, community organizations. While each \ncommunity must create a program which works for it, I believe that \nthere are certain key components of successful programs.\n  First, parents must be involved in all truancy prevention activities \nand they must be given incentives to face up to their own \nresponsibilities. Second, students must understand that they will face \nfirm sanctions for truancy. Third, all hubs of this partnership wheel--\nlaw enforcement, educational agencies, parents, and youth serving \norganizations--must work together to help solve this problem.\n  Truancy is an early warning that a child is heading in the wrong \ndirection. I am hopeful that states and communities will use this new \nauthority to support high quality truancy partnership projects. And we \ncan move on to spend more time celebrating the accomplishments of our \nchildren than grieving over lost opportunities to stop the cycle \nleading to violent crime.\n\n\n                     federal son of sam legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last year, I introduced a bill to correct \nproblems with the Federal Son of Sam Law, as those problems were \nperceived by the United States Supreme Court. Today, I am reintroducing \nthis legislation, which deals with a continuing problem. The New York \nstatute analyzed by the Supreme Court, as well as the Federal statute \nwhich I seek to amend, forfeited the proceeds from any expressive work \nof a criminal, and dedicated those proceeds to the victims of the \nperpetrators crime. Because of constitutional deficiencies cited by the \nCourt, the Federal statute has never been applied, and without changes, \nit is highly unlikely that it ever will be. Without this bill, \ncriminals can become wealthy from the fruits of their crimes, while \nvictims and their families are exploited.\n  The bill I now introduce attempts to correct constitutional \ndeficiencies cited by the Supreme Court in striking down New York's Son \nof Sam law. In its decision striking down New York's law, the Court \nfound the statute to be both over inclusive and under inclusive: Over \ninclusive because the statute included all expressive works, no matter \nhow tangentially related to the crime; under inclusive because the \nstatute included only expressive works, not other forms of property.\n  To correct the deficiencies perceived by the Court, this bill changes \nsignificantly the concepts of the Federal statute. Because the Court \ncriticized the statute for singling out speech, this bill is all \nencompassing: It includes various types of property related to the \ncrime from which a criminal might profit. Because the Court criticized \nthe statute for being over inclusive, including the process from all \nworks, no matter how remotely connected to the crime, this bill limits \nthe property to be forfeited to the enhanced value of property \nattributable to the offense. Because the Court found fault with the \nstatute for not requiring a conviction, this bill requires a \nconviction.\n  The bill also attempts to take advantage of the long legal history of \nforfeiture. Pirate ships and their contents\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nwere once forfeited to the government. More recent case law addresses \nthe concept of forfeiting any property used in the commission of drug \nrelated crimes, or proceeds from those crimes. I hope that courts \ninterpreting this statute will look to this legal history and find it \nbinding or persuasive.\n  The bill utilizes the Commerce Clause authority of Congress to \nforfeit property associated with State crimes. This means that if funds \nare transferred through banking channels, if UPS or FedEx are used, if \nthe airwaves are utilized, or if the telephone is used to transfer the \nproperty, to transfer funds, or to make a profit, the property can be \nforfeited. In State cases, this bill allows the State Attorney General \nto proceed first. We do not seek to preempt State law, only to see that \nthere is a law in place which will ensure that criminals do not profit \nat the expense of their victims and the families of victims.\n  One last improvement which this bill makes over the former statutes: \nThe old statue include only crimes which resulted in physical harm to \nanother, this bill includes other crimes. Examples of crimes probably \nnot included under the old statute, but included here are terrorizing, \nkidnaping, bank robbery, and embezzlement.\n  Mr. President, our Federal statute, enacted to ensure that criminals \nnot profit at the expense of their victims and victim's families, is \nnot used today because it is perceived to be unconstitutional. I \nbelieve victims of crime deserve quick action on this bill, drafted to \nensure that they are not the source of profits to those who committed \ncrimes against them. I ask for your support.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 352\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I just want to be clear about the civil liability \nprovisions. Does this bill create civil liability immunity for gun \nmanufacturers, dealers of guns accessed in the home, or manufacturers \nor distributors of safety devices?\n  Mr. KOHL. No. It creates civil liability immunity only for gun \nowners.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Does this bill create civil liability immunity only for \ngun owners who use a safety device?\n  Mr. KOHL. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Does that immunity apply if the gun owner is negligent--\neven if he doesn't actually give anyone permission to use the gun, but \nfor example leaves the key to the lock sitting next to the gun?\n  Mr. KOHL. No.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And is it correct that this section does not change in \nany way existing product liability law?\n  Mr. KOHL. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And, finally, is it correct that any pending suits \nagainst gun owners would be allowed to continue?\n  Mr. KOHL. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator once again. On another matter, I want \nto make equally clear for the record exactly what a ``secure gun \nstorage or safety device'' is and is not. Specifically, would the \nSenator from Wisconsin agree with me that the definition of such \ndevices in our amendment is intended solely to include personalized \nguns, lockable devices which either are affixed to a firearm directly, \nor to secure locked containers or safes.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would agree.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Finally, would you further concur with me that our \ndefinition of a ``secure gun storage or safety device'' is not intended \nto include a permanent feature of a home or motor vehicle, such as a \ncloset or glove box, even though such environments also may be locked?\n  Mr. KOHL. I would agree.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the past several days, we have \ndebated the best practices and programs for preventing youth violence. \nWe have disagreed on a number of issues including the need to restrict \nguns, invest in after-school care, and expand counseling services and \nmental health services for troubled youths and children. But there is \none issue that members on both sides of the aisle agree on--parents \nplay an important role in their children's lives.\n  Everywhere we look, children are under assault: from violence and \nneglect; from the break-up of families; from the temptations of \nalcohol, tobacco, sex, and drug abuse; from greed, materialism, and the \nmedia. These are not new problems, but in our time, they have become \nincreasingly serious. Against this bleak backdrop, the struggle to \nraise children and to support families, emotionally as well as \npractically, has become more difficult.\n  Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and \ndaughters--to feed them, to shelter them, to talk to them, to teach \nthem to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop \nphysically and emotionally, and to make countless daily decisions that \ninfluence their growth and development.\n  Parents are the most important influence in their children's lives, \nbut they are being pulled in many different directions. Healthy \ndevelopment depends on strong parental guidance. Spending time together \nis an essential part of building positive parent-child relationships. \nYet time together is increasingly scarce.\n  Parents are eating fewer meals and having fewer conversations with \ntheir children. Between 1988 and 1995, a significant drop took place in \nparent-child activities. Sixty-two percent of mothers reported eating \ndinner with their child on a daily basis in 1988, but only 55% reported \ndoing so in 1995. Fifty percent ate dinner with their child in 1988, \nbut this rate dropped to 42% in 1995.\n  We need to support parents, not attack and blame them. Sylvia Hewlett \nand Cornel West said it best in the title of their recent book, ``The \nWar Against Parents.'' That's exactly how it feels for many of today's \nparents. Like parents before them, they struggle to keep children at \nthe center of their lives. But major obstacles stand in their way, \nundermining their efforts.\n  Over the course of the last thirty years, public policy and private \ndecision-making have often tilted heavily against the activities that \ncomprise the essence of parenting. A myopic government increasingly \nfails to protect or support parents, while the competitive forces in \nthe marketplace are allowed to take up more and more time. We talk as \nthough we value families but act as though families are a last \npriority. Sooner or later, worn-out parents get the message that \ndevoting their best time to raising children is a lonely, thankless \nundertaking that cuts against the grain of other activities that are \napparently valued more highly by society.\n  Last week, I spent time in Boston talking to students about violence \nand other issues affecting their lives. I asked them whether they felt \ntheir parents were too busy to talk to them--and 3/4ths of the students \nraised their hands.\n  Parents need to spend more time listening to children--and the nation \nagrees. A recent Newsweek poll asked, ``How important is it for the \ncountry to pay more attention to teenagers and their problems?'' \nEighty-nine percent of those polled replied that it is very important. \nIf parents are not raising their children, we need to worry about who \nis.\n  The wrong kind of parenting can cause problems as well. Inconsistent \nor overly harsh discipline, may lead children to develop aggressive \nbehavior. Inconsistent discipline is often associated with poor \nbehavior in school and at home. These children also tend to have more \ntrouble establishing strong relationships with their family, their \nteachers and their fellow students.\n  Parenting and coaching classes can make a significant difference in \navoiding such problems. A recent study published in the American \nPsychological Association's Journal of Consulting and Clinical \nPsychology found that mothers who participated in Head Start parenting \nprograms showed a decrease in their use of harsh criticism and an \nincrease in their use of positive and competent discipline. The \nchildren were happier and their behavior was more satisfactory than \nchildren whose mothers did not receive parenting education.\n  When parents have the skills to deal effectively with their children, \nthey are less likely to be abusive. Unfortunately, too many parents \nlack these essential skills. Each year over 3 million children are \nidentified as victims of abuse or neglect. The consequences are \ndevastating. Traumatized children are more likely to have alcohol and \nsubstance abuse problems and learning problems. They are also more \nlikely to be arrested as juveniles and to engage in abusive behavior \ntoward their own children when they become parents.\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\n  We know that suffering abuse as a child is strongly related to \nsubsequent delinquency and abusive behavior later in life. But improved \nparenting skills can help break this vicious cycle. Parenting support \nand education have been proven to reduce abuse. In the Prenatal and \nEarly Infancy Project, high-risk mothers were randomly assigned to one \nof two groups. One group received visits by specially trained nurses \nwho provided coaching in parenting skills and other advice and support. \nThe other group received no services. For those who received the \nassistance, child abuse was reduced by 80% in the first 2 years. 15 \nyears after the services ended, these mothers had only one-third as \nmany arrests, and their children were only half as likely to be \ndelinquent.\n  Law enforcement officials also recognize the benefits of training \nparents. More than 9 out 10 police chiefs (92%) agreed with the \nstatement, ``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested \nmore in programs to help children and youth get off to a good start'' \nby ``fully funding Head Start for infants and toddlers, preventing \nchild abuse, providing parenting training for high-risk families, \nimproving schools, and providing after school programs and mentoring.''\n  These law enforcement officers are right. Parenting classes in \nconjunction with early education programs improve caregiver skills they \nalso reduce crime dramatically and they reduce the likelihood of later \ndelinquent behavior. A High/Scope Foundation study at the Perry \nPreschool in Michigan provided at-risk 3 and 4 year-olds with a quality \nHead Start-style preschool program, supplemented by weekly in-home \ncoaching for parents. Two decades later years later, by age 27, those \nwho had been denied the services as toddlers were five times more \nlikely to be chronic lawbreakers.\n  A similar program in Syracuse provided child development and health \nservices for at-risk infants and toddlers and parenting support for \ntheir mothers and fathers. The study found that kids denied the \nservices were ten times more likely to be delinquent by age 16.\n  We pay a high price for abuse and neglect. In addition to its \ndamaging psychological consequences, it is estimated that $22 billion \nis spent each year on services for abused children, their families, and \nfoster care families. Investing in prevention programs, particularly \nparent support and education, will significantly reduce these abuse-\nrelated expenditures.\n  There is no question that investing in parents will pay-off. When we \ndon't make this investment, we all pay more later, not just in terms of \nlives and fear, but also in tax dollars.\n  The ``Parenting As Prevention'' Act, which Senator Stevens and I are \nproposing, will fund several initiatives that will improve parenting \nskills.\n  To identify the best parenting practices, a National Parenting \nSupport and Education Commission will be established. The Commission \nwill identify the most effective parenting practices, including the \nbest strategies for disciplining children and youth, the best \napproaches for building integrity and character, and the best \ntechniques for ensuring healthy brain development.\n  The Commission will also conduct a review of existing parenting \nsupport and education programs, and will provide Congress and the \nAdministration with a detailed report of its findings. Perhaps, most \nimportant, essential parenting information will also be provided to \nparents--no new family will leave a hospital or adoption agency without \ninformation on how to best care for a baby. In Massachusetts, such an \ninitiative is already underway.\n  Our amendment also supports the establishment of a grant program to \nstrenghthen state initiatives for supporting and educating parents. \nBlock grants will go directly from the Department of Health and Human \nServices to the states. Each state will establish their own Parenting \nSupport and Education Council to award local grants. States will use \ntheir funds to establish support and education resource centers for \nparents and to strengthen support programs for children and teenagers. \nThe grant program will support a wide variety of parental support \ninitiatives including: home visitation for mothers of new babies; the \ndistribution of parenting and early childhood development materials; \nthe development of support programs for parents of young children and \nteenagers; respite care for parents of children with special needs; and \nthe creation of a national toll free number that will offer counseling \nand referral services for parents.\n  Finally, our amendment will improve mental health services for \nviolence-related stress. Regional centers around the country will be \nestablished to provide special training and research in psychological \ncounseling and treatment. We know that the early years are essential to \nhealthy development and that inadequate care during this critical \nperiod can have a devastating impact on future behavior. To reverse the \nimpact of negative early experiences, regional centers on psychological \nand trauma response will identify the best practices for dealing with \nthese problems. In the long run, successful early intervention is the \nbest way to modify the culture of violence instilled in so many youth.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Investing in parents \nand children is one of the best ways to prevent youth violence and we \nclearly need to do more in order to achieve this important goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for this amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                              MIT,\n\n\n                                       Family Resource Center,\n\n                                      Cambridge, MA, May 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: It is with pleasure that I write to \n     express my full and enthusiastic support for your Amendment \n     to S. 254 entitled ``PARENTING AS PREVENTION.''\n       The provision of the Amendment, including the establishment \n     of a Parenting Support and Education Commission, a State and \n     Local Parenting Support and Education Grant Program, and \n     Grants to Address the Problems of Violence Related Stress to \n     Parents and Children, could not be more needed, or more \n     timely. I am confident that the Amendment will make a major \n     contribution in addressing the pressing needs of parents in \n     our country, and thus in preventing the tragic problems among \n     children and youth that confront our nation today.\n       You are to be commended for your leadership in bringing \n     forward this critically important legislative initiative.\n       In addition to serving as Administrator of Parenting \n     Programs at MIT, I am Chief Consultant to the Harvard \n     Parenting Projects and Director of the Harvard Project on the \n     Parenting of Adolescents at the Harvard School of Public \n     Health.

I have working at parenting \n     education for two decades. I have taught parent education to \n     lawyers, social workers, teachers, parents and students in k-\n     12 settings in some of the most violent neighborhoods in \n     Chicago. I have been able to prove that it does help children \n     and parents to have more options, to understand the needs of \n     children and others and to choose non-violent solutions to \n     problems.\n       I have also been working for several years on parent \n     advocacy groups to professionalize parent education and get \n     some consensus regarding best practices. We need support and \n     resources to do this. Many of us have been doing this for \n     years at our own expense because we know how important parent \n     education and support is to parents and future parents. Thank \n     you for your efforts and please call upon me in any way I can \n     to support your good work. We need this Act to do our good \n     work.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                            Dana McDermott Murphy,\n       Adjunct Professor, Family Studies Program--Loyola of \n     Chicago; Coordinator, Parent Education Initiative, The Latin \n     School of Chicago; Member, Advisory Council of the National \n     Parent Education Network; and Member, Advisory Board of the \n     Parenting Project-Boca Raton, FL.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Websters International, Inc.,\n\n                                                     May 18, 1999.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     c/o Parenting Coalition International,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am in support of the Stevens/\n     Kennedy Amendment to S. 254 subtitled; PARENTING AS \n     PREVENTION.\n       This is a most critical time in America's history. All of \n     us need to realize, recognize,\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n     and support the premise that parents are the single most \n     important factor in determining the success or failure of \n     their child. Beyond a doubt, based on the very latest \n     research, parents are their child's most influential \n     teachers. Therefore, it stands to reason that parents truly \n     desire to learn the skills and attitudes they need in order \n     to be the best parent they can be for their child. Those \n     skills and attitudes do not come naturally; they are learned. \n     We need programs that will ensure that parents are taught \n     those skills and attitudes using the most positive methods \n     available. Too many of them have learned negative parenting \n     through the bad examples of their own parents.\n       We must start sending positive messages to our children \n     instead of the poor, often confusing scenarios, we present to \n     them now. I believe providing the states with funds to help \n     them implement such programs would be most desirable, but \n     only if we have a true method of determining that the monies \n     are being spent correctly on parenting materials that have \n     been proven to make a difference in the lives of both parents \n     and their children, and that such programs are making a \n     difference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gretchen Gleaves,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   The Heaths,\n\n                                      Haverford, PA, May 18, 1999.\n     Belinda Rollins,\n     President, Parenting Coalition International, Inc., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Belinda: Thank you for the privilege of reviewing and \n     commenting on the provocative Stevens-Kennedy Amendment to S. \n     254.\n       Establishing a Parenting Support and Education Commission \n     must be a component of any effort to improve the lives of \n     America's children. Parents, defined broadly as anyone who \n     has made a commitment to care for a child from now until the \n     child reaches adulthood, provide their children with \n     continuity of understanding and love as those children move \n     through their growing years. That continuity is vital given \n     the complexity of the society in which our children live, the \n     range of experiences that they have and the vast number of \n     choices which they have to make.\n       Senator Kennedy and his staff are to be congratulated for \n     incorporating into the existing bill this additional \n     component that will provide a means of strengthening parents' \n     ability to nurture their children.\n       My experience of over thirty years of working with parents \n     as well as consulting with parent programs world wide has led \n     me to recognize the need for a Commission that focuses on the \n     role of parents in the lives of their children, the effects \n     of that role on the parents themselves and how to support \n     parents that they may more effectively nurture their \n     children. The Commission to be created by this bill will \n     address these needs in at least three ways.\n       (1) Establishing such a commission will give recognition to \n     the importance of parents in the lives of their children. No \n     educational or social agency provides the continuity of love \n     and care that parents give to children. This commission will \n     keep in the national consciousness the unique role of the \n     parent.\n       (2) The Commission will provide a means for investigating \n     in depth social issues related to parenting. For example, \n     rather than the public argument over whether or not mothers \n     should work the commission could investigate the conditions \n     that allow parents to have the time they need with their \n     children while also carrying on their own lives and earning \n     an income for their families.\n       (3) Having state and local initiatives, as described in the \n     bill, will provide a means for raising issues from the local \n     level to national attention as well as a means of passing \n     down current research and information.\n       This amendment to S. 254 adds a significant component to \n     the national agenda of supporting children by recognizing the \n     important role that parents have in the lives of their \n     children and by providing support and information to parents \n     that will enhance their ability to nurture their children.\n       Again let me thank you for giving me an opportunity to \n     respond to this innovative amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Harriet Heath, Ph.D.,\n     Director, The Parent Center, Bryn Mawr College.\n                                  ____\n\n       Belinda: Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to \n     review this amendment. I am amazed that you were able to get \n     it put together and through the channels to be added to the \n     bill. Congratulations.\n       I hope my letter supports the amendment is the way you had \n     hoped.\n       I do have some comments on the amendment itself, as I think \n     you were also asking for. I find it fascinating the groups \n     you have included and see the political reasons for doing so. \n     Your political savvy is amazing and so necessary if you are \n     going to achieve your goals. And I am so glad that you are \n     there working towards the betterment of parents.\n       A few comments: In your list of Commission members you need \n     people knowledgeable about parental development and about the \n     role of the parent in child development. I am not sure I am \n     saying this very clearly but the writing on parents tends to \n     focus on what parents do with and to their children, not on \n     the determinants of the parental behavior themselves. \n     Parenting tends not be discussed as it affects the parent \n     except for specific periods such as the early adjustments to \n     parenthood and parenting the adolescent when the mother may \n     be menopausal and the father seeing limits to what he may \n     accomplish.\n       I am uneasy about the dichotomy that seems to exist in the \n     8th and 9th listing. A good parenting education program, not \n     including that produced through the media, has a strong \n     supportive component.\n       In 8 are you speaking of family support programs that \n     provide social and medical services as well as parenting \n     education and support or are you referring to parent programs \n     that are defined as totally emotionally supportive of parents \n     without a content component except what the parents offer \n     each other?\n       Speaking of ``best practices'' gives me visions of a cook \n     book. It implies there are good recipes and all we have to do \n     is identify them. I have not yet figured out how to write \n     these sections but so much of parenting is developing plans \n     for specific situations. Planning involves considering \n     several key factors which include obvious such as the \n     developmental level of the child, the temperament pattern, \n     the needs, and the less often mentioned factors such as what \n     are the parents' values and beliefs. The fact that parents \n     deal with the issues they face by considering key factors \n     must be recognized, and supported because, as we all know, \n     one approach does not meet the needs of all children. But \n     maybe all this is too complex for a bill.\n       One other issue--for future consideration. You pass over \n     the elementary school years. They are a time when parents can \n     delight in their children as those children are old enough to \n     explore new skills, discuss ideas and just enjoy each other. \n     These are also the years parents can do so much in preparing \n     their children for the adolescence. It is a time of giving \n     them that factual information they can use when making \n     decisions about drugs, sex, etc. It is the time for \n     developing decision making skills. And maybe most of all it \n     is the time of deepening the loving relationship that will \n     carry them both through the teen ages.\n       All of this may be too much for the bill. I look forward to \n     the continuation of the discussion.\n       Again, thank you Belinda for the work you are doing and for \n     including me in it.\n       I will send you a paper copy of the letter. Should it go \n     somewhere else also?\n       Best wishes. See you Friday,\n     Harriet.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Fight Crime; Invest in Kids,\n\n                                                     May 18, 1999.\n     Re Stevens-Kennedy Amendment to Juvenile Crime Legislation.\n\n       Dear Senator: As an organization led by over 500 police \n     chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, victims of violence, leaders \n     of police organizations, and violence prevention scholars, we \n     write in support of the Stevens-Kennedy ``Parenting as \n     Prevention Act'' amendment to S. 254.\n       Today, kids are being raised in households where both \n     parents must work. In many cases, single, working parents \n     raise children on their own. These new stresses are \n     compounded by our increasingly mobile society. Parents often \n     lack nearby grandparents and other close relatives to share \n     the work of raising a child as well as provide coaching and \n     emotional support.\n       The Stevens-Kennedy amendment recognizes that we must help \n     parents face today's challenges in raising a child from the \n     toddler to teen years. We all have a vital stake in seeing \n     that children are provided with the best quality parenting \n     because it is a critical factor in determining if a child \n     will grow up to be a criminal or a contributing citizen and \n     good neighbor.\n       Programs that help parent raise infants and toddlers \n     supporting parents have been shown to dramatically reduce \n     child abuse and neglect and other factors that increase the \n     chances for kids to later engage in criminal behavior. For \n     example, the Prenatal and Early Infancy Project (PEIP) \n     randomly assigned half of a group of at-risk mothers to \n     receive visits by specially trained nurses who provide \n     coaching in parenting skills and other advice and support. \n     Rigorous studies show the program not only reduced child \n     abuse by 80% in the first two years, but that fifteen years \n     after the services ended, these mothers had only one-third as \n     many arrests, and their children were only half as likely to \n     be delinquent.\n       The amendment would also help parents who struggle in the \n     volatile teen years by offering advice, family counseling, \n     and other services. Research demonstrates that parental \n     involvement is critical in the teen years for the healthy \n     development of kids, and to help troubled kids get back on \n     track. For example, the Multi-Systemic Therapy program for \n     teens already involved in serious crime works closely with \n     the teens' parents and in replications around the country it \n     has been shown to cut long-term rates of re-arrest by up to \n     70%.\n       The Stevens-Kennedy amendment provides much needed \n     resources to treat victims of abuse and neglect, sexual \n     abuse, violence, and other traumas. Research shows that when \n     children are directly abused, or even when they witness \n     violence in their lives, their developing brain's anatomy and \n     chemistry is altered--a sound, or some other stimulus can \n     ``flip the switch'' and their heart races as their mind \n     becomes concentrated on flight . . . or fight. As opposed to \n     the myth that children are infinitely resilient, Bruce\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\n     Perry of Baylor College of Medicine says, ``If anything we \n     now know that children are more vulnerable to trauma than \n     adults.'' Perry estimates that over 5 million children in the \n     United States witness or experience traumatizing violence \n     every year, including 1 million who are victims of abuse or \n     neglect.\n       Programs that help parents raise responsible, healthy \n     adults save lives and money. For example, a RAND cost-benefit \n     estimate of the PEIP program concluded that the savings to \n     the government alone (excluding other benefits to society at \n     large) were four times the costs, and that figure did not \n     include many savings, such as expected lower welfare costs \n     for the children beyond age 15, nor the extra taxes they may \n     pay as adults. RAND found that government savings from the \n     program exceeded program costs by the time the kids were four \n     years old.\n       If we can be of further help as you consider this \n     amendment, please don't hesitate to call us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Sanford A. Newman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of \nthe Parenting As Prevention Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Summary of the Stevens Amendment--Parenting as Prevention Act\n\n       The Parenting as Prevention Act addresses youth violence \n     and juvenile delinquency by providing support and training to \n     parents and potential parents to improve their parenting \n     skill and focusing attention on brain stimulation to improve \n     early childhood development.\n       A Rand study shows that for every dollar invested in \n     parenting and improving early childhood education through \n     brain stimulation, at least $4 are saved in later prison \n     costs, rehabilitation costs, special education expense, \n     welfare payments, etc. GAO puts the savings at above $7 for \n     every dollar invested.\n       This state block grant program would be administered by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services and developed in \n     cooperation with the Attorney General who has responsibility \n     for juvenile justice prevention programs such as the Boys and \n     Girls Club, the Secretary of Education who provides some \n     support to early childhood learning, the Secretary of Housing \n     and Urban Development who would help distribute materials on \n     parenting through public housing programs, the Secretary of \n     Labor who offers parent training to welfare mothers as part \n     of the Welfare to Work program, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     who operates the WIC program and distributes information to \n     rural America through the Cooperative Extension Service, and \n     the Department of Defense who runs child care centers and \n     provides other services to children of military families.\n       A National Parenting Support and Education Commission would \n     be established to identify the best practices for parenting \n     on issues ranging from discipline to character development to \n     brain development to gun safety (Eddie Eagle). It would \n     review existing parenting support and education programs and \n     report back to Congress and the Administration on which ones \n     are most effective.\n       The Commission would publish materials for parents in \n     various formats on parenting practices and brain stimulation \n     or distribute already available materials. No new family \n     would come home from the hospital or adoption agency without \n     information on how to raise the baby. Referral information on \n     existing federal, state, and local programs would also be \n     collated on one sheet of paper for distribution which would \n     include eligibility criteria, phone numbers, and addresses.\n       The Commission must wrap up its work within 18 months. Such \n     funds as are necessary are authorized for appropriation.\n       A State and Local Parenting Support and Education Grant \n     Program is established which would provide a block grant to \n     states with a small state minimum: States with Indian \n     populations over 2% would provide 2% of the money to tribes.\n       The State would establish a State Parenting Support and \n     Education Council to award grants at the local level which \n     would include state government, bipartisan representation \n     from the state legislation, and interested groups to be \n     appointed by the Governor. If a state had an existing group, \n     it could use that.\n       The State Council could award grants for:\n       (1) Parenting support programs for young children including \n     distribution of parenting materials on brain development and \n     best parenting practices; one on one visits to mothers of new \n     babies on brain development and best parenting practices \n     (cited as the best way to reduce child abuse, a leading cause \n     of juvenile delinquency and violent crime); and parent \n     training programs.\n       (2) Parenting support for teenagers including providing \n     parenting materials in conjunction with existing programs \n     such as Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA, after school programs, \n     and parent training classes, support groups, and mentors.\n       (3) Parenting support and education resource centers \n     including a national 800 toll free number offer counseling, \n     parenting advice, and referral to existing programs; and \n     respite care for parents with children with special needs \n     (retarded, mentally ill, behavior disorders, FAS/FAE).\n       A state which got a grant to provide a statewide program or \n     a local group would only have to report back every two years, \n     but would have to use specific performance measures, i.e. \n     things like improvement in IQ scores, school achievement \n     tests.\n       No more than 5% of the money could be used for \n     administrative costs. The typical rate is 18-30 percent.\n       A state would have to maintain its existing effort, i.e. it \n     can't cut its existing state program and replace it with a \n     federal grant.\n       The program is authorized at such sums as are necessary.\n       Finally, the bill creates a program to reverse bad brain \n     wiring caused by exposure to physical or sexual abuse or \n     family/community violence. Research shows early intervention \n     to be much more effective than later rehabilitation efforts \n     as an adult.\n       Again, best practices for dealing with these problems would \n     be identified by regional centers of excellence on \n     psychological trauma and response.\n       Indian tribes, Native Hawaiians and other non-profits would \n     be eligible for grants which would last for 3 years.\n       This program is authorized at such sums as are necessary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 363) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator will withhold. The Senate is not in order. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 364\n\n    (Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to disproportionate \n                         minority confinement)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feingold, and Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 364.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 129, strike lines 6 through 14, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(24) address juvenile delinquency prevention efforts and \n     system improvement efforts designed to reduce, without \n     establishing or requiring numerical standards or quotas, the \n     disproportionate number of juvenile members of racial \n     minority groups who come into contact with the juvenile \n     justice system.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me talk in a general way about \nthis. This legislation deals with juvenile justice. This amendment \nfocuses on the justice part. We speak to what is called \ndisproportionate minority confinement. What that really means, in \nconcrete terms, to use one example, is African American kids ages 10 to \n17 make up 15 percent of the population, but 26 percent of all juvenile \narrests, 32 percent of delinquency referrals to juvenile court, 46 \npercent of juveniles in public long-term institutions, and 52 percent \nof cases judicially waived to criminal court; that is, adult court.\n  In the current legislation, what we have done is we turn the clock \nback a long ways. In the past, since the late 1980s, we have always \ntried to deal with this question of disproportionate minority \nconfinement. What this legislation does is to essentially reverse this \nprogress. I think, roughly speaking, about 33 percent of the \npopulation, ages 10 to 17, are minority youth. They represent about 66 \npercent, or thereabouts, of kids who are now incarcerated. The question \nis, Why?\n  There are lots of different reasons. Let me just list some that come \nfrom Department of Justice reports, some lessons that have been learned \nfrom some five different States. Some of the factors that can \ncontribute to minority overrepresentation can be: racial ethnic bias, \ninsufficient diversion options, system labeling, barriers to parental \nadvocacy, poor juvenile justice/community integration, low-income jobs, \nfew job opportunities, few community support services, inadequate \nhealth and\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nwelfare resources, inadequate early childhood education, inadequate \neducation quality, lack of cultural education, single-parent homes, \neconomic stress, limited time for supervision. The factors go on.\n  But the key to an effective juvenile justice system is to treat every \noffender as an individual, to treat every offender fairly, and to \nprovide the needed services to all. All youth who come into contact \nwith the juvenile justice system should receive fair treatment. Surely \nevery Senator agrees with that proposition.\n  The disproportionate minority confinement requirement in the current \nlaw is bringing about change and focusing attention on the problem. The \ncurrent law says we call upon States to try to come to terms with this \nquestion. We call upon States to collect the data. We call upon States \nto think about whether or not there are steps that can be taken, and to \nput into effect some of these programs and some of the steps that could \nbe taken to deal with this problem, to bring about more fairness, to \nend some of the discrimination.\n  As you look at this graph here, when you have 15 percent of young \npeople ages 10 to 17, African American, but 46 percent of the juveniles \nin public, long-term institutions are African American kids, this ought \nto bother all of us. We ought to come to terms with this.\n  William Raspberry wrote in the Washington Post last week:\n\n       These numbers strongly imply not disproportionate \n     lawlessness, but dissimilar treatment throughout the juvenile \n     justice system.\n       At the very least, they are the type of numbers that ought \n     to prompt criminal justice authorities across America to take \n     a closer look at what they are doing.\n\n  That is what is so incredible about this legislation right now. It is \nas if starting in the late 1980s and then going to 1993 we recognized \nthis problem, and in our juvenile justice legislation, up to this bill, \nwe have said to States: You need to collect the data; you need to look \nat this problem; you need to try to address this problem.\n  This piece of legislation essentially guts this effort, and the \namendment that we have offered is essentially the same House language \nthat is now in their juvenile justice bill. It addresses juvenile \ndelinquency prevention efforts and system improvement efforts designed \nto reduce, without establishing or requiring numerical standards or \nquotas--that is very important--efforts designed to reduce, without \nestablishing or requiring numerical standards or quotas, the \ndisproportionate number of juvenile members of minority groups who come \ninto contact with the juvenile justice system.\n  There were close to 400 votes--I want my colleagues to listen to \nthis--400 votes in the House of Representatives for this amendment that \nwe now bring to the Senate floor.\n  The current law talked about the need to address this problem, to \nreduce the proportion of juveniles detained or confined in secure \ndetention facilities, jails and lockups, who are members of minority \ngroups if such proportion exceeds the proportion such group represents \nin the general population.\n  S. 254 guts the current law and talks about segments of the juvenile \npopulation. What does that mean? Boys? Girls? It does not deal with the \nissue of race and the severe overrepresentation of young kids of color \nwho are locked up. That is the issue.\n  This amendment that I bring to the floor with Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Feingold, and Senator Feinstein essentially says that we call \nupon the States to address the juvenile delinquency prevention efforts \nand system improvement efforts designed to reduce, without establishing \nor requiring numerical standards or quotas, the disproportionate number \nof juvenile members of minority groups who come into contact with the \njuvenile justice system.\n  This is an eminently reasonable amendment, but it goes to the heart \nof the debate about racial justice in our country. S. 254 undermines \nthis DMC core requirement of the Juvenile Delinquency and Prevention \nAct which directs States to identify this disproportionate confinement, \nto assess the reasons it exits, and to develop strategies to address \nthe disproportionate number of minority children in confinement.\n  This legislation, S. 254, as now written, takes those efforts--some \ngood efforts by our States, some 40 States involved with this--and \nbasically heads these efforts for the scrap heap. This is a huge step \nbackward.\n  This amendment has nothing to do with quotas. It does not require or \nsuggest the use of numerical quotas for arrests or release of any \njuvenile from custody based on race. No State's funding is based upon \nquotas or anything else. But this amendment does put the Senate on \nrecord supporting the disproportionate minority confinement core \nrequirement which now is in existing law that addresses a very serious \nand a very real problem.\n  It is well-documented that in every State--nearly every State--\nincluding my State of Minnesota, minority youth are overrepresented at \nevery stage of the juvenile justice system, particularly in secure \nconfinement. For example, a study in California showed that minority \nyouth consistently received more severe punishments and were more \nlikely to receive jail time than white youth who committed the same \noffenses.\n\n  Another study in Portland, OR, found minority youth being locked up \nat a rate several times higher than their arrest rates.\n  We ought to be concerned when, roughly speaking, 7 out of every 10 \nyouths in secure confinement are minority juveniles in our country, a \nrate more than double their percentage of the youth population. Should \nwe be concerned about that? Isn't this juvenile justice legislation? \nLet's look at the justice part.\n  We have close to 7 out of 10 kids who are in confinement in our \ncountry today who are locked up, incarcerated--juveniles, who are kids \nof color, minority kids, double their percentage of the population. We \nhave way too many examples of kids having committed the same offense as \nwhite kids but receiving stiffer sentences or winding up incarcerated, \nand it is not right. It is unconscionable. It is unacceptable.\n  I do not think this whole problem of disproportionate minority \nconfinement is the product of bigoted or racist authorities, though \nthere is too much bigotry and there is too much racism. It is far more \ncomplex, and it results from all kinds of things, including the \nlikelihood that minority youth are more likely to be poor, they are \ngoing to be unable to find work, uneducated, or, as William Raspberry \nsuggests in his column, or they are politically unconnected, which \nmeans they will be less likely to have their children released to their \ncustody by police officers and judges.\n  From William Raspberry's piece:\n\n       It may result in a tendency of white officials to basically \n     look at white kids as troubled youth and black offenders as \n     troublemakers, gangsters or predators.\n\n  Forty States are doing good work. The Department of Justice issued a \nreport several months ago which talked about some of the lessons \nlearned from five States. I began to talk about some of those lessons \nearlier on and the kinds of efforts these States--Arizona, Iowa, North \nCarolina, Florida, and Oregon--are taking.\n  I believe Senator Kennedy will come down and speak shortly on this \namendment and then I will follow up his remarks. I am anxious to hear \nwhat my colleague from Utah has to say because he has been a Senator \nwho has been extremely sensitive to these issues.\n  This does not make any sense. We have language in our current \nlegislation that deals with this problem of the disproportionate number \nof kids of color who are locked up so we can find out what is going on \nand how we can do better. States all across the Nation are collecting \nthe data and trying to find out what is wrong and trying to do better.\n  This current legislation before the Senate really turns the clock \nback. Why as a nation do we not want to come to terms with this \nquestion? Again, let me be clear about this, the current law talks \nabout the need to reduce the proportion of juveniles who are detained \nor secured, confined in these secure detention facilities, the \ndisproportionate number of minority groups, and then S. 254 comes along \nand talks about segments of the juvenile population.\n  This basically undermines the efforts that are underway. We are not \ntalking about segments of the population. We are talking about race \nand, as a matter\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\nof fact, it is very important that we continue to identify some of the \nproblems we have to confront as a nation that deal with race. We are \nnot talking about segments of the population; we are talking about the \nquestion of race.\n  Our amendment--I want every Senator to focus his or her attention on \nthis--takes the House language, which was passed by 400 votes, and we \ntalk about the importance of addressing the juvenile delinquency \nprevention efforts and system improvement efforts designed to reduce, \nwithout establishing or requiring numerical standards or quotas, the \ndisproportionate number of juvenile members of minority groups who come \ninto contact with the juvenile justice system.\n  The current law, before this piece of legislation, acknowledges race \nis an issue. Whether we want to talk about it or not, whether we want \nto recognize it or not, whether we are comfortable with it or not, this \nisn't an issue that arose overnight.\n  In 1988, over a decade ago, the Coalition for Juvenile Justice \nreleased a report to Congress on race in the system called ``The \nDelicate Balance.'' They made the point, and this became part of the \nlaw that we had to do better as a nation, that we should be troubled by \nthis, that we should be troubled that close to 70 percent of the kids \nwho are locked up are kids of color, minority youth.\n  We want to make sure there is no discrimination. We want to make sure \nkids are treated fairly. We want to make sure that all of our citizens \nhave some confidence in this justice system. Well, this piece of \nlegislation takes us a long ways back, a long ways back.\n  For those who want to talk about the constitutionality of the DMC \nprovision, it is just a scare tactic. It is just a figleaf. I read the \nlanguage of the amendment which makes it crystal clear that we are not \ntalking about numerical standards or quotas. I would like to read from \na letter and ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is from 23 law professors endorsing the \nconstitutionality of the disproportionate minority confinement \namendment. I just read:\n\n       There can be no serious constitutional objection to the DMC \n     requirement in existing law. First, it does not single out \n     members of racial minorities for any sort of distinctive \n     treatment, nor does it impose any burdens on anyone else. The \n     Supreme Court's decisions made it clear that constitutional \n     questions arise, not merely from the use of racial terms in a \n     law--for otherwise compiling census information about race \n     would be unconstitutional--but only if there is some burden \n     or benefit allocated on the basis of race. . . . The DMC \n     requirements do nothing that crosses this minimum threshold.\n\n  This letter goes on and makes really a very strong case, signed by 23 \nlaw professors in our country.\n  I want to just make it real clear that the disproportionate minority \nconfinement amendment that I bring to the floor with Senator Kennedy is \nabout race. Can I say this one more time to colleagues? Because when \nyou vote on this, please understand this amendment is about race. \nPlease understand that this amendment has the support of probably every \nsingle civil rights organization in our country. Please understand that \nthis amendment has the support of just about every single children's \norganization you can think of, starting with the Children's Defense \nFund.\n  Please understand that this amendment and your vote is all about \nrace, because please understand that we are doing better, but to have a \nreally better America we have to do even better when it comes to \nquestions of race and discrimination.\n  Please understand that many citizens in our country do not have \ncomplete confidence in the system. When the minority community sees \nthat close to 70 percent of their kids are locked up, when their kids \nmake up not even 35, 33 percent of the population, and when they see \nthat kids of color wind up incarcerated, when white kids do not, having \ncommitted the same offense, or given longer sentences, and when they \nsee all the ways in which there is discrimination--and we have not come \nto terms with what is really going on with so many kids in these \ncommunities--it makes members of minority communities in our country \nvery suspicious of a piece of legislation which focuses on juvenile \njustice but takes out the language we had in our legislation dealing \nwith kids that assures that States will collect the data and will look \nat this question and try and do better.\n  I am telling you, this is a huge vote. This is all about race. It is \nabout the disproportionate share of minority youth in our Nation's \njuvenile justice system. It is about helping States come up with plans \nto enhance prevention, to work with communities. It is not about \nreleasing individuals from confinement because of their racial makeup \nor about instituting some kind of quota system. It is about fairness. \nIt is about ending discrimination. It is about justice. It is about \ndoing better as a nation. It is about doing better for all of our \nchildren, including children of color, and that is why this amendment \nhas such intense, broad support. And it is why 400 Members in the House \nof Representatives voted for this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield to the Senator or yield the floor, if you \nlike.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Minnesota to simply yield for a \nquestion.\n  Let me say at the outset that I am honored to support this amendment. \nI am glad that Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, and many others have \njoined in this effort.\n  For those who question whether Senator Wellstone's testimony before \nthe Senate is accurate, I share with them some statistical information \nwhich came as a shock to me. General McCaffrey, who is our Nation's \ndrug czar, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. I \nasked General McCaffrey if the statistics I had read were accurate.\n  The statistics I had read were as follows: 12 percent of the American \npopulation is African American; 13 percent of those committing drug \ncrimes are African American; 33 percent of those arrested are African \nAmerican; 50 percent of those convicted are African American; and 67 \npercent of those in prison for drug crimes are African American.\n  This is clearly completely disproportionate. This segment of the \npopulation has been focused on and what Senator Wellstone is seeking to \ndo with this amendment is to make certain that we do not close our eyes \nto the reality. The statue of justice can keep a blindfold over her \neyes with the scales before her; we cannot put a blindfold over our \neyes. We have to be open to the reality that if we are discriminating \nagainst any group of Americans, regardless of their background or \ncolor, ethnic origin or race or religion, we have to be sensitized to \nit.\n  I do not know why this bill takes a step backwards. Thank goodness \nfor the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone and others which puts us \nback on the right track to be honest and fair in the administration of \njustice in America.\n  I proudly stand in support of your amendment. I thank the Senator for \nhis leadership.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Durbin. He would like to be added as \nan original cosponsor. I would be very proud for him to do that. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have visited some of these facilities and they are pretty \ntroubling. When you visit--I think, again, of the visit to Tallulah, \nLA--there and there is just a sea of, in this particular case, African \nAmerican faces, young kids--many of them, by the way, locked up for as \nlong as 7 weeks in solitary confinement, 23 hours a day; that is part \nof what they do there--it is troubling.\n  I think in the State of Louisiana--I do not know what the overall \npercentage of the population is, but I think about 80 to 85 percent of \nthe kids that are confined there are African American. Here is what \nmakes this so troubling.\n  It would be easy--I want every Senator listening to this--to simply \nattribute this large discrepancy to the fact that young people of \ndifferent racial groups commit different types of crimes.\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\n  In 1992, though, there were significantly higher rates of admission \nof African American juveniles for every offense group. Please listen to \nthat, because I do not want some colleague to come out on the floor and \nsay: Well, there is a reason for this. These kids commit the crimes in \nexactly this percentage or this proportion.\n  Crimes against persons: Black males and females were six times more \nlikely to be admitted to State juvenile facilities than their white \ncounterparts-- same crimes, six times more likely.\n\n  Property crimes: Black males were almost four times more likely to be \nadmitted to State juvenile facilities than white males, and black \nfemales were almost three times more likely to be committed than white \nfemales.\n  Drug offenses: Black males were confined at a rate 30 times that of \nwhite males. In fact, among all offense categories, black youth were \nmore likely to be detained than white youth during every year between \n1985 and 1994. Minority youth were also more likely to be removed from \ntheir families than white youth. Black youth are also much more likely \nto end up in prisons with adult offenders.\n  In 1995, nearly 10,000 juvenile cases were transferred to adult \ncriminal court by judicial waiver. Of those proceedings, cases \ninvolving black youth were 50 percent more likely to be waived than \nthose cases involving white youth. Overall, again, black youth were 52 \npercent of all the children and adolescents waived to adult court, and \nin most States minority juveniles were overrepresented on average in \nthese adult jails at a rate more than 2\\1/2\\ times their proportion of \nthe total youth population. These are damning statistics.\n  When he was director of the Massachusetts Department of Services, \nCommissioner-Member Jerome Miller wrote of the cumulative effect of \ndecisions made throughout the juvenile justice process:\n\n       I learned very early on that when we got an African \n     American youth, virtually everything from arrest summaries to \n     family history to rap sheets to psychiatric exams to waiver \n     hearings, as to whether he would be tried as an adult to \n     final sentencing, was skewed. If a middle-class white youth \n     was sent to us as dangerous, he was much more likely to be \n     dangerous than the African American teenager with the same \n     label. Usually the white kid had been afforded competent \n     legal counsel, appropriate psychiatric and psychological \n     testing, been tried in a variety of privately funded options \n     and, all in all, had been dealt with more sensitively and \n     more individually at every level of the juvenile justice \n     process. For him to be labeled dangerous, he usually had done \n     something that was very serious indeed. By contrast, the \n     African American teenager was dealt with as a stereotype from \n     the moment the handcuffs were first put on, to be easily and \n     quickly moved along to the more dangerous end of the violent/\n     nonviolent spectrum, albeit accompanied by an official record \n     meant to validate the biased series of decisions.\n\n  I say to my colleague, Mr. Durbin, I really appreciate his being \nhere. Sometimes when we are in this Chamber, this is our reality. I \nwant every Senator, including Republican Senators, to know, this is an \namendment that deals with a very sensitive issue. This is an amendment \nthat deals with race in America. This is an amendment that deals with \nall of the biases that go with that. This is an amendment that says we \nshould not be passing a piece of legislation which essentially turns \nthe clock backward, which takes the language that we had in our past \njuvenile justice legislation which calls on States to study this \nproblem, calls on States to address the problem, and calls on States to \ndo better, as many are doing right now, and essentially remove all that \nlanguage. It is a charade.\n  I will go on record right now--I cannot see any way that I can \nsupport this piece of legislation if this amendment does not pass. I \ncannot see any way as a Senator I can support this. I will put Senators \non notice--I think a good many Senators, many Senators should not be \nable to support this piece of legislation if this amendment, which is \nthe same language passed by 400 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives--that has to include some Republicans; am I correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does not pass in the Senate.\n  What in the world is going on on the floor of the Senate that we are \nunwilling to pass an amendment that just calls upon States to continue \nto try to come to terms with this really huge, stark problem in \nAmerica? Why in the world am I even out here having to debate this?\n  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do I have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Minnesota has 31 \nminutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from Minnesota, again, in \nsupport of this amendment--and I am happy to be a cosponsor of it--the \nimportant aspect in the administration of justice that is often \noverlooked is respect for the law. We teach our children to respect the \nlaw. We try to make certain that they teach their children. It is that \nlegacy which allows the administration of justice to succeed.\n  When people lose respect for the law, it doesn't take too many of \nthem to turn on a system and break it down. This amendment being \noffered by Senator Wellstone is an effort to make certain that we have \nrespect for the law here, respect for the equal administration of \njustice.\n  We cannot be impervious or blind to the obvious. The obvious is \ndemonstrated by the statistics I have mentioned on the floor and those \nread by Senator Wellstone. I cannot believe in 1999, at this stage in \nthe history of this great Nation, we are prepared in this piece of \nlegislation to take a step back in time when it comes to progress \ntoward racial harmony in America. If we are so foolish to do that, we \nrisk respect for the administration of justice and respect for the law.\n  People who observe this system can't ignore the fact that \ndisproportionate numbers of minorities are being incarcerated and \ntreated unfairly. I stand, as I am sure the Senator from Minnesota \ndoes, in saying that I want those who break the law to answer for it. I \nwant to live in a safe neighborhood. I want to live in a safe town. If \nthe perpetrator of a crime is black, white, or brown, male or female, \nit is irrelevant. They should be treated under our system of justice \nfairly and the same.\n  But when we look at the end result of this system of justice and see \nthis disproportionate confinement of minorities, are we to turn our \nbacks on that? Are we to walk away from that? What do we do to this \nNation and our system of laws if we do? We risk, I am afraid, a \ndisintegration of a sense of community in America, a disintegration of \nrespect for law. Then we all suffer, not just African Americans, but \nalso Hispanic Americans, those of every color and hue and ethnic \nbackground.\n  So I support this amendment, an amendment that passed overwhelmingly \nin the House of Representatives. I hope it will be enacted as part of \nthis legislation. I say, as the Senator from Minnesota has said, every \nSenator should take this amendment very, very seriously.\n  I yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't want to take too much more of \nmy time right now, because I really want this to be a debate. I will \ntell you, this amendment does not say you release kids. It has nothing \nto do with that. And, by the way, most of the kids in these facilities \nhave committed nonviolent crime. That needs to be said as well. I have \nmet kids breaking and entering, theft of mopeds; you name it, they are \nthere.\n  What is going on right now in the country has a dramatic impact not \njust on these kids and not just their parents, but it has a devastating \nimpact on minority communities. Let us finally please understand that \nas well. The disproportionate minority confinement, the \ndisproportionate number of kids who are locked up, has a devastating \nimpact on minority communities, a devastating impact on family \nrelationships, a growing sense of anger and isolation and alienation \nand--my colleague from Illinois is right--distrust of the institutions \nin our country.\n  This is the final point, before I hear from my colleagues on the \nother side. All too often these ``corrections institutions''--this \nneeds to be said--do not correct. They are a gateway to adult prison, \nbecause a lot of kids get out, and when they get out, they have it on\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\nrecord that they have served time. They do not get the adequate \ntraining. They do not get the adequate support. And as opposed to any \nreal correction that takes place, you have a lot of kids who get out of \nthese institutions who are really, in many ways, kids who have become \nmuch hardened and with much less chance of doing well.\n  So there is also a connection to this problem, I argue, in the fact \nthat, roughly speaking, in 1999 one-third of all African American men \nbetween the ages of 18 and 26, or 20 and 28, are either in prison or \nwaiting to be sentenced, or have been paroled. Five times as many \nAfrican American men of this young age are in prison as are in college, \nin higher education, in the State of California. We have to ask \nourselves what is going on.\n  Again, we were making progress up to this legislation. We were making \nprogress. We did something that made sense to our States. We called \nupon our States to really look at this problem and try to address this \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Paul D. Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, and Wellstone: As the \n     Senate is considering S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile \n     Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999, it \n     has come to our attention that the sponsors of S. 254 have \n     altered the language of the Disproportionate Minority \n     Confinement (DMC) mandate in current federal law by removing \n     any reference to the word minority, claiming that the law as \n     currently written is unconstitutional. We believe this \n     argument is without merit.\n       There can be no serious constitutional objection to the DMC \n     requirement in existing law. First, it does not single out \n     members of racial minorities for any sort of distinctive \n     treatment, nor does it impose any burdens on anyone else. The \n     Supreme Court's decisions make it clear that constitutional \n     questions arise, not merely from the use of racial terms in a \n     law--for otherwise compiling census information about race \n     would be unconstitutional--but only if there is some burden \n     or benefit allocated on the basis of race. Cf. Anderson v. \n     Martin, 375 U.S. 399 (1964). The DMC requirements do nothing \n     that crosses this minimum threshold.\n       Second, the DMC mandate is designed to identify whether \n     unconstitutional racial discrimination is occurring in the \n     juvenile justice system. The Supreme Court has held that \n     practices that result in disproportionate burdens on racial \n     minorities are unconstitutional if they have been adopted \n     intentionally to have that effect. Washington v. Davis, 426 \n     U.S. 229 (1976). The DMC requirements are directed at \n     precisely that concern: They ask the states to determine \n     whether DMC is occurring, and if it is, what its causes are. \n     It cannot possibly be unconstitutional for Congress to direct \n     that such an inquiry be undertaken. Cf. Hunter v. Underwood, \n     421 U.S. 222 (1985).\n       We hope that this information is useful as you continue \n     your debate on this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n       Mark Tushnet, Carmack Waterhouse Professor of \n     Constitutional Law, Georgetown University Law Center; Milner \n     Ball, Professor of Law, University of Georgia School of \n     Law; Taunya Lovell Banks, Professor of Law, University of \n     Maryland School of Law; Kelley H.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. As usual, I have to commend the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis heart and for his desire to try to resolve problems that are \ndifficult in our society. I have to say that I am concerned about the \ndisproportionate confinement of minority youth, especially young \nAfrican Americans and Hispanics, in our society--especially African \nAmericans because it is disproportionate. If you really stop and think \nabout it, the issue is who is committing the crimes.\n  I also agree it would be wonderful if we had a perfect system of \nrehabilitation for these young people. The juvenile justice bill \nprovides an additional $547 million in addition to the $4.4 billion we \nspend annually for helping young people to get rehabilitated or to help \nprevent crime to begin with. I think that is the right direction.\n  This is probably the first bill in history that has 45 percent of the \nmoney in the bill for law enforcement and accountability purposes and \n55 percent of the money for prevention purposes. But, you know, you \nstill can't ignore the fact that these kids are committing crimes. Just \nbecause you would like the statistics to be relatively proportionate, \nif that isn't the case, because more young people commit crimes from \none minority classification than another, it doesn't solve the problem \nby saying states should find a way of letting these kids out.\n  Now, if there is another problem, if there is literally a civil \nrights violation or a discrimination against minority youth, then that \nis a problem I think would need fixing. But I don't think that is a \ncase that has been made so far.\n  The Democrats' amendment requires States to address efforts to reduce \nthe proportion of juveniles who have contact with the juvenile justice \nsystem who are members of minority groups, if such proportion exceeds \nthe proportion such groups represent in the general population. It \nfails to take into consideration who is committing these crimes. If a \nhigher proportion of young African Americans are committing the crimes, \ndo we just ignore that because we don't like the fact that it is \ndisproportionate compared to Hispanic Americans or Anglo Americans? I \ndon't see how you get around the fact that the ones who are committing \nthe crimes are the ones who are arrested or incarcerated.\n  This amendment is not only ill-advised as a matter of policy and \nprinciple, but it is also unconstitutional. The amendment makes an \novert racial classification. Juveniles must be classified according to \nrace in order for this amendment to be followed.\n  This amendment is unconstitutional. As the Supreme Court announced in \nthe 1979 decision of Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. \nFeeney:\n\n       A racial classification, regardless of its purported \n     motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only \n     upon an extraordinary justification.\n\n  Now, such a classification could be upheld if there is an \nextraordinary justification, but that is not evident here. I just hear \nthat there are more young African American kids who go to jail than \nwhite kids; therefore, there must be something wrong with the system.\n  I don't agree with that. If there are more young African American \nkids\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\ncommitting crimes, and especially vicious crimes and violent crimes, \nyou don't help the problem by saying they should not be punished and \nthey should not be incarcerated somehow or other be sent to--unless \nthere is a justification for that.\n  Now, according to Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, \na 1979 decision:\n\n       A racial classification, regardless of its purported \n     motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only \n     upon an extraordinary justification.\n\n  That is the law, and I think it is a correct law.\n  More recently, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, the Supreme \nCourt held that the Constitution requires the strictest judicial \nscrutiny ``of all race-based action'' by Government. What does that \nmean? It means that this amendment is subject to strict scrutiny and \ncan be constitutional only if it is, under Adarand, ``narrowly tailored \nto achieve a compelling governmental interest.''\n  This amendment does not pass strict scrutiny. The only ``compelling \ninterest'' the Supreme Court has recognized in this context is the \nremediation of past discrimination. Moreover, the Court requires a \nparticularized showing of past discrimination. I don't think anybody \nwould disagree with that.\n  Here there is no such proof of discrimination, and the current law, \nwhich this amendment replicates--and, I might add, expands--is not \nnarrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination. In fact, the Justice \nDepartment regulations under current law require States to intervene \nregardless of the cause of disproportionate confinement. Instead of \nremedying past discrimination, much of the current law is aimed at \nprevention programs. This amendment, and the current law it replicates, \ncannot pass strict scrutiny.\n  I wish I could support this amendment, but its constitutional flaws \nprevent that. And, frankly, I believe that this amendment is bad social \npolicy, because basically this amendment just says that these young \npeople who have been engaged in criminal activity, somehow or other, \nshould be proportionately given a break because there are more--in this \ncase--young African Americans than young whites who are convicted. Now, \nthat is unconstitutional in the light of Adarand and the Feeney case, \nand, frankly, under any principle of race neutrality in the justice \nsystem.\n  The proponents of this amendment are motivated, in my opinion, by the \nbest of intentions. I share their concern. That is one reason I want \nthis juvenile justice bill to pass, so we can get serious about violent \njuvenile crime and so we can use the tools of this bill to help to \nprevent that in the future. And we have significant prevention moneys \nin this bill to help get these kids away from ever committing crime \nagain.\n  Like I say, the proponents are sincere. They want to help minority \nchildren avoid detention. However, I believe the best way to prevent \nthe detention of juveniles is to prevent juveniles--of all races--from \ncommitting crime. I am proud that S. 254 provides $547.5 million in new \nfunds for prevention programs. I have had to fight to get that. That is \non top of and in addition to the $4.4 billion that we already have on \nthe books every year for prevention programs.\n  It is unhealthy for the Government to focus only on reducing the \ndetention of minority juveniles. We should focus on preventing crime \ncommitted by juveniles of all races and recognize that detention of \njuvenile offenders is sometimes necessary. As this current debate \nillustrates, it is inherently divisive when the Government makes racial \nclassifications.\n  Look, if there is discrimination against minority kids, then you can \ncount on me. I will fight alongside of my Democrat colleagues to end \nthat discrimination. But to just say it is disproportionate without \nconsideration to what crimes were committed, it seems to me, is not \nonly unconstitutional, it is wrong.\n  S. 254 has a better provision. It requires that prevention resources \nbe directed to ``segments of the juvenile population'' that are \ndisproportionately detained. Such ``segments of the population'' could \ninclude, for example, certain socioeconomic groups that are more likely \nto be at risk. S. 254 directs prevention resources to such groups who \nneed these resources the most.\n  Finally, not only is this amendment unconstitutional, it sets a \nterrible precedent. The premise of this amendment--requiring States to \nprovide racial groups special attention if members of those groups are \ndisproportionately likely to be detained--could be used to justify \nracial profiles. In my opinion, racial profiling is also \nunconstitutional, and I believe a significant number of constitutional \nauthorities would agree with my analysis on that.\n  The Government simply cannot use race as a classification or a factor \nin the criminal justice system, because our system of justice should be \ncolor blind. If it is not, then I will work to correct that. But I \ndon't have any evidence that it is not at this particular point, other \nthan the visceral feeling of some that because more young African \nAmericans than whites are convicted and sentenced to detention, there \nmust be something wrong with the system.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to oppose this amendment.\n  I also understand that in our society a lot of young African American \nkids, a lot of young Hispanic kids, a lot of young Native Americans--\nand you can just go down almost every minority; there are literally \ndozens of minorities in this country--a lot of them don't have the best \nchance in this life. They are born in poverty. They are born into \nsituations where there is no father, or they have a father who takes \noff on them, or they have a father who won't accept responsibility. \nThey start off with a couple of strikes against them. I acknowledge \nthat. We have to do something about that. But that doesn't mean we have \nto start racial profiling or that we have to start racial \nclassifications to get there, unless we can show that there is \nprejudice, unless we can show that there is a reason to have this \namendment.\n  If I might add a final note. I have bent over backwards to craft \nlanguage which addresses the concerns raised by my colleagues. I think \nmy language is constitutional and it has bipartisan support. Senator \nBiden supports the underlying amendment, and with good reason, because \nit is constitutional.\n  Having said all of that, again I will reiterate that I respect my \ncolleagues. I respect their desire to right wrongs in our society. They \nknow that I work on that too. I respect their desire to make sure that \neverybody is treated equally and in a decent manner. I respect their \napproach to try to end discrimination in our society. I join with them \nin those matters. But this particular amendment, it seems to me, is \nunconstitutional, and I certainly hope our colleagues will vote against \nit when I move to table it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to first of all, thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Wellstone, for offering this amendment and say that I welcome \nthe opportunity to join with him and urge the Senate to accept this \namendment, and to say that I think it is very basic and fundamental to \nthe underlying purpose of the legislation, which is to try to deal with \nthe challenge of juvenile violence in our country today.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that we should not have to be taking the \ntime of the Senate on this amendment, because I am sure, as Senator \nWellstone has pointed out, that this language which we are attempting \nto place into the juvenile justice bill is effectively the language \nthat has been there since 1992. It was placed there as a result of \nextensive hearings that were held by Congress and the Senate--during \nthat period of time--that showed the disparity of treatment between \nblacks and whites in the juvenile justice system. There is a range of \ndifferent aspects of this particular provision.\n  I say at the outset that we will include in the Record a very \ncomprehensive review on the constitutionality of this issue. It \nis interesting to hear that argument raised at this particular time, \nbecause the language has been in effect since 1992 and not challenged \non a constitutional basis. It has just been mentioned during the course \nof this evening.\n\n  But, Mr. President, we should not look at this particular undertaking \nreally in the abstraction of just juvenile justice. What we have to \nunderstand is that we as a country inscribed\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\nslavery in the Constitution of the United States, and we have been \ntrying to free ourselves from that admonition for some 200 years. We \nfought a civil war over it.\n  Over the very recent times, with the leadership of Dr. King and many \nothers in the late 1950s and 1960s, we began to make some very \nimportant progress in knocking down the walls of discrimination. But \nstill those elements of bigotry exist. Why else would we have the \ngreatest number of hate crimes against blacks in our society? That \nhappens to be a fact. We don't like it. We don't want it. We all \ndeplore it. We are going to try to address that with hate crimes \nlegislation. It is not going to solve all of the problems, but we are \ngoing to at least try to recognize that this is an issue.\n  Why is it that even after all the legislation we have passed to try \nto have fair and equitable employment on the basis of an individual's \nvalue and what they can do in terms of their skills in doing a job, why \nis it that we still find those barriers out there to knock out blacks \nand Hispanics and individuals whose skin is not white? That happens to \nbe the case. We don't have to make that case tonight on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Why, in 1988, did we have to revisit the Housing Act that we passed \nin 1968? Because of the continuation of racism in housing.\n  To listen to the Senator from Utah, you would think, maybe we do have \nproblems there, but we don't have any problems in juvenile justice. \nWhere are the studies? What studies have they looked at? That is just \nabsolutely preposterous. That is absolutely preposterous. It exists in \neach of these areas I have mentioned. It exists in the criminal justice \nsystem. It exists between individuals who are white and black, out \nthere tonight on the interstate highways, where you have racial \nprofiling and where the number of people who are pulled over because \ntheir skin is black is sometimes four, five, six, seven times what it \nis if someone else's skin is white--and done over a long period of \ntime. They can't demonstrate any higher percentage of incidents of \nviolations of the law, not in terms of the growth percentage, but just \nin the incidental percentages. You can make that case. That is \nhappening everywhere.\n  We had provisions in the juvenile justice that say to communities \nthat we hope you will be encouraged to try to see in the areas of \njuvenile justice what we might be able to do--to try to see if we can't \nstem some of this problem among the young people in our society.\n  Why should we always have to wait until this problem exists? Why \ncan't we try to see what can be done in the early days of young people \nto see what progress might be made?\n  This has not been used as a way or device to terminate funding for \nany of the States. You can't say that. You can't demonstrate that. If \nwe had a fair time to talk about this and to debate it, you would find \nthat States are making important progress in many different areas to \ntry to deal with fundamental and underlying causes in their various \ncommunities. That is what we want to encourage--quiet, competent, \neffective work that is being done that can have an impact in terms of \ntrying to make our juvenile justice system fair and equitable for all \nof the young people in our society.\n  Mr. President, this issue is of such importance, to be brought back \nin the time of the evening with the limitations I think really does a \ndisservice to the importance of it. But we are where we are.\n  Let me mention the particular quote from the director of our \nMassachusetts Department of Youth Services, Mr. Miller, a very \nthoughtful, distinguished leader in terms of understanding the problems \nof juvenile justice. This is what Mr. Jerome Miller wrote about the \ncumulative effect of decisions made throughout the juvenile justice \nprocess:\n\n       I learned very early on that when we got an African \n     American youth, virtually everything, from arrest summaries \n     to family history to rap sheets to psychiatric exams to \n     waiver hearings as to whether he would be tried as an adult, \n     the final sentence was skewed. The middle-class white youth \n     sent to us was more likely to be dangerous than the African \n     American teenager with the same label. Usually the white kid \n     had been afforded competent legal counsel, appropriate \n     psychiatric and psychological testing, been tried in a \n     variety of privately funded options, and all in all had \n     been dealt with more sensitively and individually at every \n     level of the juvenile justice process. For him to be \n     labeled dangerous, he usually had to have done something \n     very serious, indeed. By contrast, the African American \n     teenager was dealt with by stereotype from the moment the \n     handcuffs were first put on, to be easily and quickly \n     moved along to the most dangerous end of the violent/\n     nonviolent spectrum, albeit accompanied by an official \n     record meant to validate the series of decisions.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  That is the state of the juvenile justice system in too many \nconstituencies across this country. All this language does is remind us \nwhen we are talking about using the word ``justice,'' we are talking \nabout equal justice, equal justice for blacks and browns in our system, \nequal justice for young people, equal justice for all.\n  Fundamentally, when we understand the problems we have in our \nsociety, to represent here on the floor of the Senate that somehow the \njuvenile justice system is an exception to all the kinds of challenges \nthat we have in this Nation, fails, I think, the basic reason and \nrationality about what is going on in this country. It is not the \naccepted.\n  That is the effect of this, to try and not prescribe quotas, not get \ninto the numbers game. That has never been part of the accusation on \nthis provision, but just to hope that communities and States will, \nhopefully, develop a process and system that will be somehow more \nsensitive to the challenges we are facing as a country, as a community \nand in our States in juvenile justice.\n  This amendment cannot solve the problem and it won't even probably \nsolve the majority of the problem, but perhaps because of it, there \nwill be communities and there will be States that will have a truer \nsystem of justice for all the young people of this country. That is \nreally what we ought to be undertaking and what we should be about.\n  The statistics on the treatment of minorities in the criminal justice \nsystem require an immediate response--especially the treatment of \njuveniles. I strongly support this amendment and I commend Senator \nWellstone for his leadership. It deals with one of the most serious \nproblems in current law--the disproportionate confinement of minority \nyouths in state juvenile justice systems. In fact, the underlying bill \nwill only make the problem worse, because it eliminates all references \nto ``minority'' or ``race'' and instead refers only to ``segments of \nthe juvenile population.''\n  In 1988, after extensive testimony concerning the significant over \nrepresentation of minority youth in state juvenile justice systems, \nCongress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to \nrequire states to address this issue. In the 1992 amendments to the \nAct, disproportionate confinement became a core requirement, by linking \nfuture funding to a State's compliance with addressing this basic \nissue.\n  Under current law, states are required to do three things: (1) \nidentify the extent to which disproportionate minority confinement \nexists in their states; (2) assess the reason that it exists; and (3) \ndevelop intervention strategies to address the causes. The law does not \nrequire and has never resulted in the release of juveniles. It does not \nrequire numerical quotas for arrest or release of any youth from \ncustody based on race. In fact, no state's funding has ever been \nreduced as a result of non-compliance with this provision.\n  This issue has festered in the juvenile justice system for years. To \npretend otherwise is to ignore the facts. Over the past 10 years, \ndocumented evidence shows that disproportionately occurs at all stages \nof the system:\n  African-American youth age 10-17 constitute only 15% of the U.S. \npopulation. But they account for 26% of juvenile arrests, 32% of the \ndelinquency referrals to juvenile court, 41% of juveniles detained in \ndelinquency cases, 46% of juveniles in secure corrections facilities, \nand 52% of juveniles transferred to adult criminal court after judicial \nhearings.\n  As these statistics indicate, the over representation of minority \nyouth increases as juveniles become more and more involved in the \ncriminal justice system. The result is that African-American youths are \ntwice as likely to\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nbe arrested and seven times as likely to be placed in a detention \nfacility as white youths.\n  Black males are 6 times more likely to be admitted to state juvenile \nfacilities for crimes against persons than white youths--4 times more \nlikely for property crimes--and 30 times more likely for drug offenses.\n  Black youths are also much more likely to end up in prison with adult \noffenders. In 1995, nearly 10,000 juvenile cases were transferred to \nadult criminal court, and black youths were 50% more likely to be \ntransferred than white youths.\n  A study of the juvenile justice system in California found that \nminority youth consistently receive more severe punishment than white \nyouth, and are more likely to be incarcerated in state institutions \nthan white youth for the same offenses.\n  A 1998 University of Washington study confirms the justice within the \njuvenile system Narrative reports prepared by probation officers prior \nto sentencing portrayed black juveniles differently from white \njuveniles.\n  Black youth offenders were perceived as having character defects--\ncondoning criminal behavior.\n  White youth offenders were perceived as victims of bad circumstances.\n  For example, two 17-year-old boys, one black and one white, are \ncharged with first degree robbery. Neither had a criminal history; both \nused firearms and were accompanied by two friends. Listen to the \nprobation officers' evaluation of the two boys--keeping in mind that \n99% of the time, judges follow the recommendation of probation \nofficers:\n  For the African-American youth, the probation officer wrote:\n\n       This appears to be a pre-meditated and willful act by Ed. . \n     . . . There is an adult quality to this referral. In talking \n     with Ed, what was evident was the relaxed and open way he \n     discusses his lifestyle. There didn't seem to be any desire \n     to change. There was no expression of remorse from the young \n     man. There was no moral content to his comment.\n\n  For the white youth, the probation officer wrote:\n\n       Lou is the victim of a broken home. He is trying to be his \n     own man, but . . . is seemingly easily misled and follows \n     other delinquents against his better judgment. Lou is a tall \n     emaciated little boy who is terrified by his present \n     predicament. It appears that he is in need of drug/alcohol \n     evaluation and treatment.\n\n  In 1993, Allen Iverson--who is the NBA's leading scorer and so far \nhas led his team to the second round of the playoffs--was a senior in \nhigh school in Virginia. At the time, he was the top rated high school \npoint guard and quarterback in the nation. One night, he and a group of \nother friends, all of whom were black, went to a local bowling alley \nand a racially-motivated fight broke out after a white kid directed a \nracial epithet toward Iverson. Although punches and chairs were thrown \nby both blacks and whites during the fight, no white kids were arrested \nor charged with a crime. Iverson, however, was convicted of ``maiming \nby mob'' and was sentenced to 15 years in prison with 10 years \nsuspended. He was denied bail pending the appeal, even though felons \nconvicted of more heinous crimes were routinely granted bail.\n  It was not until then-Governor Wilder granted Iverson partial \nclemency, that he was released from jail. He then went on to play \nbasketball for John Thompson at Georgetown. He then left for the NBA \nwhere he became the first-round draft pick of the Philadelphia 76'ers. \nThe only reason why Allen Iverson's case has a happy ending is because \nhe is a star athlete. Otherwise, he would still be in jail like the \nthousands of other young black men who find themselves behind bars in \nmuch larger numbers than their white peers.\n  It is wrong to deny minority youth the right to fair treatment by the \ncriminal justice system. Yet this legislation says to the African-\nAmerican community, the Hispanic community and other minorities that \nCongress will continue to look the other way while minority youths are \nconfined at disproportionately high rates by the current system.\n  What this bill says to minorities is that although we recognize that \nyour children are more likely to be arrested than their white \ncounterparts, we don't care, that although your children are being \nreferred to juvenile court and adult court, at significantly higher \nrates than white youths, we're turning our backs on you.\n  It is essential for this legislation to retain fair requirements to \ndeal effectively with this crisis. Current law does not require the \nrelease of juveniles. It does not require incarceration quotas. It does \nnot require any other specific change of policy or practice. It does \nnot take prevention money away from white youths and give it to \nminorities.\n  Disproportionate minority confinement is a serious problem requiring \nan ongoing and continuous effort to achieve a juvenile justice system \nwhich treats every youth fairly, regardless of race or background.\n  Examples of what the states are doing to address this challenge are \nnumerous. In Pennsylvania, the State Commission on Crime and \nDelinquency provided funds to initiate prevention and intervention \nprograms, including:\n  A drop-out prevention program; a program to help young minority \nfemales learn work and life skills; a program to decrease the \ndelinquency rate and increase the level of school retention and success \namong targeted youth through life skills workshops, tutoring and \nhomework assistance, physical fitness and sports, community service \nprojects, and monthly parent group meetings.\n  By contrast, the underlying legislation encourages states to \nprosecute even more juveniles as adults. It allows records of juvenile \narrests--not necessarily convictions--to be made available to schools, \ncolleges and vocational schools. It requires school districts to \nmandate policies to mandate expulsion from school for regular \npossession of drugs, alcohol, or even tobacco.\n  The consequences of disproportionate minority confinement are harsh \nand unacceptable:\n  The Sentencing Project reported that \\1/3\\ of all African-American \nmales age 20-29 in the United States are under the jurisdiction of the \ncriminal justice system--either in jail, in prison, on probation, or on \nparole.\n  The juvenile justice system often acts as a feeder system for \nminority youth into the adult criminal justice system.\n  In most states, the result of an adult felony conviction is the loss \nof voting rights. 1 in 7 of the 10 million black males of voting age \nare now either currently or permanently disenfranchised from voting-\ndiluting the political power of the African-American community.\n  A significant impact of arrest or incarceration is often the \nreduction of future wage earning and employability. One study showed a \n25% reduction in the number of hours worked over the next 8 years.\n  The truly tragic consequences of disproportionate minority \nconfinement are removal of large numbers of potential wage earners, a \ndisruption of family relationships and a growing sense of isolation and \nalienation from the larger society. These statistics only give us a \nsmall glimpse of the harsh consequences. They don't begin to tell the \nstory of young black youth being targeted, harassed, intimidated, and \ntreated differently because of their race.\n  The United Methodist Church has said that ignoring discrimination in \njuvenile sentencing * * * is `careless, callous, and discriminatory \nenforcement of law.' ''\n  Ed Blackmon, Jr., Mississippi State House of Representatives, has \nsaid the ``So many of these young people have great potential for \novercoming their troubles, and becoming successful young men and women \nin their communities. However, with the absence of good legal \nrepresentation, and families that are not `well-connected', they find \nthemselves locked up, with very little hope.''\n  Kweisi Mfume, President and CEO of the NAACP, has said, ``The fact \nthat S. 254 eases the requirement that states address the \ndisproprotionatly high numbers of children of color in juvenile \ndetention facilities is, in itself, a crime.''\n  Marian Wright Edelman, Founder of the Children's defense fun, has \nsaid ``With troubling reports of police brutality and racial profiling, \nCongress must continue to work with the states to ensure that the \njuvenile justice system affords our youth equitable and fair treatment, \nand not repeal the previous decade's worth of progress.''\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\n  This past weekend, in her address to the National Conference on \nPublic Trust and Confidence in the Justice System, Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor emphasized the need for racial equality and \nbetter legal representation, and called for improvements in family and \njuvenile courts. She also cited a 1999 survey entitled ``How the Public \nViews the State Courts''. According to that survey, 70% of African-\nAmerican respondents said that African-Americans as a group, receive \n``Somewhat Worse'' or ``Far Worse'' treatment from the courts than \nwhites. A substantial number of whites agreed with this assessment.\n  As Justice O'Connor so aptly stated, ``Concrete action must be \ntaken'' to erase racial bias.\n  At the very least, we cannot offered to retreat from the requirements \nof current law that the states must recognize and address this \nfestering problem. To do less is unacceptable. I urge the Senate to \naccept our amendment and do the right thing on this critical issue of \nracial justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will speak on our time in opposition \nto another subject for 10 minutes.\n  I rise today to address the issue of media and teen violence. I am \nsure I cannot do better than Senators who have spent so much time this \nmonth on this issue. I congratulate Senators McCain, Hatch, Brownback, \nBond, and Lieberman for their efforts.\n  However, because last year I had a personal, although long-distance \nencounter, with one of the more notorious characters in the media \nworld, I thought I might share that event. First, I will start with a \nfew observations of a more general nature.\n  First, just four short observations:\n  One, clearly a large body of research proves that the media target \nviolence to teenagers. The movie and television rating system is too \noften unenforced. I urge my colleagues to read Sissela Bok's book, \n``Mayhem,'' for a systematic look at the selling of carnage and rage to \nour youth by the media pushers.\n  Second, this issue is not new. Indeed, back in 1993 Senate bill 943, \nthe Children's Television Violence Protection Act, was introduced in \nthis body. Before that, we had a wide-ranging debate about television \nand movie violence in the 1980s.\n  So far, the entertainment industry, using the best public relations \nthat money can buy, and by hiding their refusal to accept any \nrestriction on their poison behind the first amendment of the \nConstitution, have been able to increase the violence and mayhem of \ntheir products without any accountability.\n  In 1954, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, chaired by then Senator \nEstes Kefauver, asked whether violence in media was destructive. The \nmedia kings said more research was needed. In 1969, the National \nCommission on Violence concluded that years of exposure to violence \nwill cause the vulnerable among us to engage in violence much more \nreadily and more rapidly.\n  I should add that CBS executives censored the script of CBS reporter, \nDaniel Schorr, when he tried to report this finding on television news.\n  In 1972, a massive report by Surgeon General Jesse Steinfeld \nconcluded that a definite and causal relationship existed between \nviolence viewing and acts of aggression. Then, in 1981, data further \nsupporting Surgeon General Steinfeld's report was issued. This report \nwas published by the American Psychological Association, a group of \nBoston pediatricians. They summarized 30 years of research on the \nsubject: Watching violence causes aggressive behavior. That is their \nconclusion. To use the technical finding, there is a causal link \nbetween exposure of children to violent images and subsequent violent \nbehavior.\n  As Senator Brownback pointed out earlier, there is more and more \nevidence every single year that violence on television, in music, in \nmovies, damages our children and leads some of them to act out of some \nof their violence in their daily lives.\n  Look at the trend lines. As violence has proliferated in the movies \nand on TV, juvenile violence has come right along with it and \nproliferated just as the violence in movies and on television.\n  Recently, at an event at which he raised $2 million from Hollywood, \neven President Clinton said, ``As studies show, hundreds (of vulnerable \nchildren) are more liable to commit violence themselves as a result of \nwatching violence on television or in the movies.''\n  Both the American Medical Association and the American Association of \nPediatrics have warned against exposing our children to violent \nentertainment. These doctors have to help rebuild the lives of children \nemotionally, sometimes physically maimed by elements of the \nentertainment industry.\n\n  Number 4, finally it is clear to me that the relevant committees of \nthe U.S. Congress must continue to focus on this subject because the \nCongress sometimes has a short attention span, and the mind polluters \nknow this. We have not had a comprehensive, intensive series of \ninvestigations.\n  But Congress should do this: We have subpoena power, which the \nrelevant committees have, and should be used to compel those who hide \nto come forth and reveal the memos, the research, and the marketing \ntools they use to sell death and dismemberment to our children.\n  Mr. President, I hope that Senators will investigate the selling of \nmovies that have the PG-13 ratings to those that are 7, 8 and 9 years \nof age as happened with Jurrasic Park. As Senator Lieberman said \nrecently, ``The evidence strongly suggests that Joe Camel has sadly not \ngone away, but has been adopted by the entertainment industry \ninstead.''\n  In addition, we hope that committees will work on innovative \nlegislation along the lines suggested by Senator Bond that will simply \ndo one thing, the one thing the industry cares about: Making it less \nprofitable to make and sell death and hate. Only by doing that will we \nforce change. We have tried moral suasion and it is not working, \nalthough it is by far the best solution.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, with a personal interaction with one \nof the more outspoken opponents of change, Mr. Edgar Bronfman, chief \nexecutive officer of Seagrams Limited, which owns, among other things, \nUniversal Studios and Universal Music Group, the world's largest record \nlabel.\n  On October 5, 1998, I wrote a letter to him. In that letter, I \nendorsed the plea of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, that \nUniversal Studios, owned by Mr. Bronfman, add a statement to the \nstudio's remake of the film ``Psycho.''\n  As most of my colleagues know, the subject of mental illness and \nefforts to help those afflicted, the work to remove the stigma of \nmental illness has been one of the issues I have worked on for much of \nmy career.\n  So when I made my appeal I suggested that the industry merely note \nthat in the years since 1960, when Alfred Hitchcock first made his \nmovie, we have seen major advances in the treatment of major mental \nillnesses. We asked the statement also note that millions of Americans \naffected by those brain disorders are leading fulfilled lives because \nof medical research. We wanted to end the stigma attached to people who \nare mentally ill, and thus ask for a special favor.\n  I ask unanimous consent my letter of October 5 to Edgar Bronfman be \nprinted in the Record, as well as the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill bulletin about the movie.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  October 5, 1998.\n     Mr. Edgar Bronfman,\n     President and CEO, The Seagram Company Ltd., New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Bronfman: As you may know, I have a strong \n     interest in improving the awareness and treatment of mental \n     illness. Improving perceptions and policies toward the \n     mentally ill has become an important goal for both my wife, \n     Nancy, and me.\n       I am aware that your company, as the owner of Universal \n     Studios, is sponsoring the remake of the film, ``Psycho''. \n     The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), has \n     suggested that a message, such as the one below, should be \n     displayed at the beginning of the film. This message would be \n     an important preface to a film that depicts mentally ill \n     characters in extremely negative terms. I support this \n     initiative to recognize the availability of treatment and \n     improve awareness.\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\n     Times have changed since 1960 and I believe it is important \n     to recognize that the mentally ill have a right to medical \n     attention without undue stigma from society.\n       The statement might read:\n       ``Since 1960 when the original film Psycho was made, \n     knowledge of the major mental illnesses has grown enormously. \n     People who suffer from these brain disorders can be medically \n     treated and are no more violent than the general population \n     when they are under treatment.\n       ``Please view this remake of Psycho keeping in mind that \n     millions of people are affected by these brain disorders. \n     They can now lead fulfilled lives and contribute to society \n     because of medical research and treatment that has occurred \n     over that past three decades.\n       ``It is vitally important that we erase the stigma that \n     surrounds mental illness.''\n       I appreciate your consideration of this matter and \n     appreciate a positive response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Stand Against Universal Studio's Remake of the Film ``Psycho''\n\n       Universal Studios is starting this week to remake the 1960 \n     film ``Psycho,'' called a classic because of its master film \n     maker Alfred Hitchcock.\n       However, NAMI members and friends know--and need to share \n     with the film makers of 1998--that the myths and \n     misconceptions of this film, and the title itself, simply \n     refuel the damaging and pervasive stigma that already \n     envelopes the lives of people with mental illness.\n       NAMI is out to Bust Stigma wherever it exists. Each of us \n     must help by letting the owner of Universal Studios know that \n     stereotyping persons with mental illness in ``Psycho'' is as \n     unacceptable and offensive as stereotyping race, religion, \n     ethnicity or any other physical illness.\n       Research shows that persons with mental illness do not \n     commit violent acts when they are under treatment and taking \n     their prescribed medications.\n       Send your letters to: Mr. Edgar Bronfman, Jr., President & \n     CEO, The Seagram Company Ltd., 375 Park Avenue, New York, NY \n     10152.\n       Flood Mr. Bronfman's office with your letters! Write yours \n     today and get your friends at home to do the same!!!\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Board Statement: Remaking of the Film ``Psycho'', July 1998\n\n       Whereas, NAMI, the Nation's Voice on Mental Illness, works \n     to provide education, advocacy, and support for all those \n     affected by serious brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, \n     bipolar disorder (manic depression), major depression, \n     obsessive compulsive disorder, or panic disorder;\n       And whereas, the 1990's, known as the ``Decade of the \n     Brain,'' has shown through advances in scientific research \n     and varied treatment options that mental illnesses are no-\n     fault brain disorders that can be effectively diagnosed and \n     treated;\n       And whereas, it has been documented that individuals with \n     brain disorders who are in treatment and responsibly managing \n     their illness are no more prone to violence than those in the \n     general population;\n       And whereas, NAMI, ever working to combat the pervasive \n     stigma surrounding mental illness, finds images in the mass \n     media that negatively influence the public's perception of \n     serious mental illness, such as those portrayed in the 1960 \n     Alfred Hitchcock film ``Psycho'', to be unfounded, hurtful, \n     and demeaning to NAMI's 185,000 members; be it\n       Resolved, That, although NAMI recognizes Alfred Hitchcock \n     as one of the film industry's most respected, innovative, and \n     influential craftsmen, preeminent for his work in the \n     ``thriller'' genre and for often focusing on the \n     psychological motivations and underpinnings of his \n     characters;\n       NAMI believes that Alfred Hitchcock's acknowledged classic \n     ``Psycho'' was based on outdated, stigmatizing notions of \n     family culpability and inherent violent tendencies in those \n     with mental illness;\n       And therefore NAMI registers its strongest objection to a \n     remake of the film ``Psycho'' as planned by Universal Studios \n     wherein individuals with serious mental illnesses are \n     portrayed inaccurately and alluded to disparagingly.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. About 3 weeks after I sent my letter, on October 29 I \nreceived a response, not from Mr. Bronfman, but from one of his \nlawyers. I ask unanimous consent this letter of October 29, 1998, be \nprinted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                    Universal,\n\n                             Universal City, CA, October 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Edgar Bronfman, Jr. forwarded to me \n     your October 5, 1998 letter regarding the film ``Psycho.'' He \n     asked that we carefully consider the issues that you raised.\n       As you know, ``Psycho'' is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's \n     1960 film--a work that is widely regarded as a ``classic.'' \n     the cultural, historic and aesthetic significance of the film \n     was recognized by the Librarian of Congress when he selected \n     it for inclusion in the National Film Registry.\n       The film that Universal Pictures will be releasing later \n     this year is as true to the original as any ``remake'' in the \n     history of our industry. While it is updated for today's \n     audience in that it is filmed in color and uses modern \n     special effects, it follows the original dialogue and images \n     almost scene-by-scene.\n       Universal's Motion Picture Group has given the issues that \n     you raised a good deal of thought. We believe it is \n     significant that the film does not trivialize the issues that \n     you raised or in any way ridicule or belittle those who \n     suffer from mental illnesses. Importantly, the marketing \n     campaign for the film tracks the storyline and does not \n     attempt to undermine the important progress that society has \n     made toward better understanding mental illness.\n       The art of storytelling, by its very nature, can involve \n     subject matter that some may find disturbing or \n     uncomfortable. We believe that preambles such as the one you \n     suggest cannot, as a practical matter, be used to address the \n     concerns that may present themselves to some members of the \n     audience.\n       My colleagues and I at the studio would be glad to meet \n     with representatives from the mental health community. We \n     believe that such a meeting would help us better understand \n     the issues that you raise and heighten our awareness of the \n     progress that has occurred in the field. Because we might \n     find ourselves working on films that address mental health \n     issues in the future, we would welcome the opportunity to \n     enhance our sensitivity to and understanding of the subject \n     matter. We have found similar meetings with other outside \n     groups to be worthwhile and productive in the past.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                    Karen Randall,\n                          Senior Vice President & General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To put it in polite terms, the lawyer suggested that \nmaybe those of us concerned about mental illness could meet with \nUniversal Studio lawyers to talk things through, sort of a therapy \nsession for those too sensitive to the world. But the lawyer was clear, \nUniversal Studios was not going to add any language that the Alliance \nfor the Mentally Ill had asked of them and suggested. After all, the \nmovie is a classic, they said, and critics have said so. In short, the \nmessage was, you are being a little sensitive, but do not disturb the \ncreative genius that is at work here.\n  Then I read in recent weeks more accounts of the distinguished Edgar \nBronfman. It seems he was one of the entertainment kings who refused to \nattend the White House Conference on Teen Violence and the Media. He \nalso refused to participate in hearings into teen violence and \nmarketing of violence to teens that Senator Brownback held on May 4 of \nthis year. But this time the gentleman found time to pontificate about \nthose who tried to show leadership and the relationship between the \nmusic and television shows and movies he produces and the violence \naffecting our teenagers. He said:\n\n       It is unfortunate that the American people get finger \n     pointing and chest pounding from government officials.\n\n  And having delivered himself of such nonsense, Mr. Bronfman departed \nto Florida to dedicate a theme park.\n  I decided to learn more about him. It turns out he inherited a \nbusiness from his family--nothing wrong with that. He decided to branch \ninto the media. He now heads Universal Studios, which recently gave us \nthe classic, ``The Mummy.'' He should be proud. It turns out that one \nof his musicians is Marilyn Manson, winner of the MTV award for the new \nbest artist of the year. Manson is the author of such classics as \n``Irresponsible Hate Anthem,'' which contains the line, ``Let's just \nkill everyone and let your God sort them out.'' And then using the \n``f'' word.\n  This was just one song on the Bronfman-produced album, ``Anti-Christ \nSuperstar.'' I think he should be proud of what he produces.\n  I say that obviously not meaning it.\n  Even when thoughtful members of the entertainment industry, like Rob \nReiner and Joel Schumacher call for real, honest review of the guts, \ngore, and godlessness Hollywood turns out, the distinguished Bronfman \ndisagrees. He says that attacking Hollywood for its culture of \ndegradation is opportunism. He seems to have a very similar view to \nthat expressed by another Hollywood executive who said the first \namendment ``keeps the Government out of our industry and lets us be \nwhat we want.''\n  This is more than facile cynicism. It is more than merely mercenary \nspirit. This is the cry of those who have thrown aside all notions of \ngood and evil and who merely want the rest of us to let them be. They \nwant to sell whatever they can to whoever they can entice and want the \nrest of us to let them\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nbe. After all, who are we? Parents? Grandparents? Public officials? \nAmerican citizens? Who are we to criticize them?\n  These people should look at their deeds and be proud--really proud.\n  Let me conclude by asking simply this question: What in the world \nwould our Founding Fathers make of an interpretation of this great \ndocument called the Constitution that claims that the glorification of \nrape, dismemberment, violent death is unequivocally and absolutely \nprotected by freedom of speech?\n  The result is we are seeing kids imitating art, taking their guns to \nschool, joining gangs, and committing acts of violence. I suspect the \nFounding Fathers would simply have said: Is this the pathetic pass you \npeople have come to? Shame on you. And we would not have made them \nproud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment? The Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hatch and the \nmanagers of this bill, I would like to make a few remarks at this time \non the time of Senator Hatch.\n  Senator Domenici, I thank you very much for your willingness to \nbecome engaged in this issue, to confront some of these problems. I, \nlike you, do not believe the airways and all this country are \nnecessarily free for every use piped into our homes, for our children, \nwhen people are not ready to deal with it.\n  I wonder if you remember the time when the Pope came to Hollywood, 10 \nor 12 years ago, and met with movie moguls--at least a decade ago I \nsuppose. I have a vivid recollection of members coming out of that \nmeeting. He had all the Hollywood titans and moguls there. He talked to \nthem about the need for them to improve the entertainment they were \nputting out. He urged them to do better.\n  The Hollywood titans came out and they were interviewed on the \ntelevision. They said: He made some very good points. We have to \nconsider that. We have to do better.\n  I remember Charlton Heston came out at the very end and they said: \nMr. Heston, do you think anything is going to change?\n  He looked right in the camera and said: They wouldn't change if the \nLord himself spoke to them. They are after ratings and the almighty \ndollar.\n  If we do not have power under the first amendment to constrain some \nof this, I think it is quite appropriate that they be taken to task and \nthey be urged, in the name of decency and humanity, to clean up their \nact. If you have to make money, do you have to make it at this low a \nlevel?\n  I wonder if the Senator has a comment on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do. I talked to the Senate a little bit lately about \ncharacter education. I am putting a statement in the record regarding \nCharacter Counts, an education program which utilizes six pillars of \ncharacter. One of them is responsibility and another is \ntrustworthiness. We are all excited about this program and hoping our \nchildren will learn responsibility and trustworthiness--meaning don't \ntell lies, be responsible for the agreements you make, to the covenants \nyou have, to the institutions you support.\n  Isn't it interesting, everybody says we ought to be promoting this \nbecause our children need it. Actually, I do not know how to stop what \nI have described about Hollywood tonight. I do not know how we can do \nit in law. But sometime or another, somebody has to be responsible. \nSomebody has to step up to the bar in the movie industry and say we \nought to challenge those who work in the industry, who produce these \nproducts that are going out to our children and to our people, and see \nif we can't turn it in another direction. Do we have to pick the \neasiest prey, our children, and produce the easiest film that will make \nmoney? You know they all make money if you load them with this kind of \nviolence and degradation. Can't the movie industry work on something \nbetter? I think that is the challenge.\n  I do not have an answer, but maybe a group will be formed and among \nthem they will grow up. Maybe some board of directors of some \ncorporation with a mother or a grandmother on the board may for once \nask: What are we putting on television? Can we look at the programs \nthat we are spending our corporate dollars on and see?\n  Wouldn't that be something, if every chief executive, instead of \nlistening only to his advertising man, had a board that wanted to see \nwhat they were buying. Not only by way of advertisements, but also \nprograms they bought? That might be a nice idea, if people started \ndoing that, you might hear some mothers and some grandmothers and some \nparents speaking out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator is correct. We do have authority as \nSenators to speak out.\n  The President spoke out in a radio address just a few days ago, \naccording to the Washington Post. He broadcast a radio address bluntly \nchallenging the purveyors of violent movies and video games to accept a \nshare of the responsibilities for the tragedies, such as the Columbine \nHigh School massacre, based on the evidence that some people become \ndesensitized and are more prone to emulate what they see on the screen.\n  However, reading this very same article, when he went out, within \nhours of that radio address, and met personally with the titans of \nHollywood, he delivered that message ``with all the force of a down \npillow.''\n  The Washington Times said he assured the filmmakers that they were \nnot bad people, as they showered him with $2 million. He assured them \nthey had no personal responsibility for the Columbine High School \nmassacre in Littleton, CO. Instead of blaming Hollywood for making \nviolent films, he said the real blame lies with theaters and video \nstores that show them and sell them to minors.\n  The President told the audience of stars and studio moguls that they \nshould not blame the gun manufacturers either, but he blamed the \nRepublican Members of Congress who will not enact his gun control laws. \nThe President gingerly suggested at the Saturday night fundraiser in \nBeverly Hills that sustained exposure to ``indiscriminate environments \ncan push children into destructive behavior,'' but he added quickly, \nthe producers, directors, and actors who ponied up $2,500 per couple \nare not at fault. ``That doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or \nany video game or television program a bad person or personally \nresponsible with one show with a disastrous outcome. There is no call \nfor finger pointing here.'' He later went on to note we were going to \nwork it out as family.\n  We need to send a clearer message than that. Perhaps his radio \nmessage was a better message. It is unfortunate that when he met with \nthem face to face, he toned it down an awful lot, apparently. I \nsuggest, if the Senator will comment, which one does he think those \nmedia moguls are going to believe was his real view, the one he said on \nthe radio or the one he said to them personally?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me first respond by saying what I forgot to say \nwhen the Senator from Alabama first stood up. I should have \ncongratulated him for the excellent job he has done on this bill. He \nhas been on the floor when I have handled lengthy budget bills and a \nlot of amendments. He was there to encourage me. I think we worked \nnicely together. He learned some things during the budget resolution.\n  What a marvelous job the Senator has done under very tough \ncircumstances. I commend him for that.\n  Frankly, it seems to me we need every bit of leadership we can get to \nassess this issue and be realistic about it. From the President on \ndown, leaders have to tell the truth. Those people who are involved in \nthe business of producing movies and films which our young people view, \nwhich we know are more apt to cause them to use guns, are more apt to \ncause them to do violent things, they need to acknowledge the truth.\n  For those in the entertainment industry to say there is no proof that \nmovies cause violence, what kind of proof do you need? There are \nmultiple studies that say there is a relationship.\n  Does the Senator remember when he was growing up that people would \nsay, ``Well, if you read a good book, it is going to be good for you''? \nDoesn't it follow that if you read something that is not good, you are \napt to learn that also? Whoever defines good or bad, that is up to \nthem. But it is just obvious\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nthat one cannot see all of this violence and not be adversely affected \nby it.\n  Just starting with that and saying let's all acknowledge that, what \ndo we do about it? There may be a lot of different things. Certainly I \ndo not have the prescription, and I did not say I did. But I think we \nought to begin by saying that we should not get this into the minds and \nhearts and senses of our young people. We ought to find a way to avoid \nit. We ought to find a way to give them better things to view, better \nthings to hear.\n  It seems to me the country would be so relieved if some of those \nleaders in that industry were to step forth and say: We just formed a \ngroup that is going to try to do that. We don't know how successful it \nwill be.\n  They might be shocked. It might be very successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will briefly make some comments \nconcerning the Wellstone-Kennedy amendment and share some thoughts on \nthis situation with which we are wrestling.\n  Right across the street on the marble of the U.S. Supreme Court are \nthe words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' That is a cornerstone of \nAmerican thought. It is a cornerstone of our belief of who we are as a \npeople. It is critical that we maintain that in our juvenile and adult \ncourt systems, and that in all aspects of our American court system we \nrecognize that people who come before the court must be treated \nequally, regardless of their station, regardless of their race, \nregardless of their sex, and regardless of their religion. That is so \nbasic to who we are as a people.\n  We have not always been perfect in that. In fact, we have made a \nnumber of errors over the years. Less than an hour ago, I met in my \noffice with Dr. Glenda Curry, who is the president of Troy State \nUniversity in Montgomery. She is completing work on the Rosa Parks \nMuseum. Rosa Parks was a victim of an unfair system, and when asked to \nmove to the back of the bus in Montgomery, AL, in the 1950s, she said \nno. She refused to move, and she challenged an unjust law and was able \nto overturn that.\n  To say we have never had problems or we do not have problems in the \nfairness of law is not accurate. This Nation has made tremendous \nprogress. We are moving well to eliminating those kinds of things. They \nare just not showing that.\n  I will tell our concerns which are so troubling. Under the previous \nlegislation, that Senators Wellstone and Kennedy proposed to use again \nin this bill, the law required, before a State can receive money, they \nhave to submit a plan and their plan shall ``address efforts to \nreduce''--reduce--``the proportion of juveniles detained or confined in \nsecure detention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails, and \nlockups who are members of minority groups if such proportion exceeds \nthe proportion such groups represent in the general population.'' It \nsays the numbers have to be reduced based on race.\n  We need to strive to make sure that nobody is incarcerated who is not \nguilty of a crime, but we ought not be passing a law requiring the \nreduction of the proportion of juveniles confined if it simply does not \nmeet a perfect numerical percentage.\n  I believe, as a result of my study of the Supreme Court decision in \nAdarand as well as other cases, that this is unconstitutional, and it \nis certainly bad policy.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Hatch, who is a scholar on these \nissues and who has held hearings on what to do about quotas and \naffirmative action, the Judiciary Committee developed and passed this \nlegislation with this language, and we changed it slightly. This plan, \nwhich the States have to submit to be eligible for funding shall, ``to \nthe extent that segments of the juvenile population are shown to be \ndetained or confined in secure detention facilities, secure \ncorrectional facilities, jails and lockups, to a greater extent than \nthe proportion of these groups in the general juvenile population, \naddress prevention efforts designed to reduce such disproportionate \nconfinement, without requiring the release or the failure to detain any \nsuch individual.''\n  In other words, this focuses on the problem more directly. It says \nthat when you have $1 billion of prevention money in this juvenile \njustice bill, that prevention money needs to be directed to try to \nprevent crime. But it also suggests that that prevention effort ought \nto be directed to those kids if they are in a minority population that \nexceeds the number in the general population in the juvenile court \nsystem.\n  So I think this is a reasonable and constitutional provision. I think \nit is a right step. I simply and reluctantly must say I have to oppose \nthis amendment. I just do not believe it can be justified under what I \nunderstand to be a legitimate constitutional law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of our time if \nthe other side is. But let me just put an article in the Record. It is \nby the Center for Equal Opportunity entitled ``Unconstitutionality of \n42 U.S.C Sec. 5633(a)(23).'' It is written by Roger Clegg. I think it \nmakes an awful lot of sense. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Center for Equal Opportunity, May 5, 1999]\n\n           Unconstitutionality of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5633(a)(23)\n\n                             (Roger Clegg*)\n\n       42 U.S.C. sec 5633(a)(23) requires states that wish to \n     participate in the Formula Grants Program of the Juvenile \n     Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act to submit a plan that \n     shall, inter alia, ``address efforts to reduce the proportion \n     of juveniles detained or confined * * * who are members of \n     minority groups if such proportion exceeds the proportion \n     such groups represent in the general population.''\n       In our view, this provision is not only misguided as a \n     matter of policy but also unconstitutional.\n       The Supreme Court has made clear that any use of a racial \n     classification by any government is presumed to be \n     unconstitutional. It declared in Personnel Administrator of \n     Massachusetts v. Fenney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979): ``A racial \n     classification, regardless of its purported motivation, is \n     presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon an \n     extraordinary justification.'' More recently, the Court held \n     that the Constitution ``requires strict scrutiny of all race-\n     based action.'' Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. \n     200, 222 (1995); see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson \n     Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989).\n       It cannot be seriously argued that subsection (23) does not \n     use racial classifications and does not encourage funding \n     recipients to do so. Juveniles must be classified according \n     to race in order for subsection (23 to be followed, and \n     different government actions are contemplated depending on \n     those classifications. Further, one set of consequences \n     obtains if minority groups are ``overrpresented'' and another \n     set of consequences if nonminorities are \n     ``overrepresented.''\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The racial classification would remain, however, even if \n     recipients were required to reduce the ``overrepresentation'' \n     of nonminority groups, too.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In determining whether a racial classification exists, it \n     is always useful to put the shoe on the other foot. Suppose a \n     state announced that it would intervene to bring down the \n     number of white people who were detained or confined whenever \n     that number was greater than ten percent of the minority \n     detention and confinement rate. There would be no serious \n     argument that the state was not using a racial \n     classification.\n       Accordingly, the only remaining legal issue is whether \n     subsection (23)'s racial classification passed ``strict \n     scrutiny.'' This requires that it be justified by a \n     ``compelling'' interest and that it be ``narrowly tailored'' \n     to that interest.\n       Strick scrutiny cannot be passed. The only compelling \n     interest the Supreme Court has recognized in recent years is \n     the remediation of past discrimination, and it is difficult \n     to conceive of any other compelling interest here.\\2\\ But \n     remedial justification is clearly implausible for subsection \n     (23).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ The remedial justification is apparently the basis for \n     subsection (23). See U.S. Dep't of Justice Office of Juvenile \n     Justice & Delinquency Prevention, Juvenvile Justice Bulletin \n     (Sept. 1998), at 1. See also 28 C.F.R. sec. 31.303(j) (1998).\n     Justice Powell thought that ``diversity'' in higher education \n     presented a compelling interest, but no other justice joined \n     his opinion in Regents of the University of California v. \n     Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), and in any event Justice Powell's \n     explanation of the importance of diversity was peculiar to \n     the university context and has no application to prisons. An \n     argument that, to ensure public confidence in our criminal \n     justice system, the inmate population must ``look like \n     America,'' is similar to the argument that Justice Powell \n     rejected immediately in Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307 (subpart IV-\n     A). Furthermore, the inmate population has never reflected \n     society generally insofar as it is younger, more male, and \n     poorer.\n     While preventing crime may be a compelling interest, \n     preventing crime by members of particular races is not, and \n     so the use of racial classifications serves no compelling \n     anticrime interest--or, alternatively, the use of race is not \n     narrowly tailored to that interest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In the first place, the subjects of the racial \n     classification here are juveniles, which\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\n     means that they were born in 1982 or later. Thus, they were \n     not alive during the days of slavery or Jim Crow, let alone \n     sufferers during them. Moreover, there is no evidence that \n     all prospective funding recipients have a current or even \n     recent history of racial discrimination, and there is no \n     requirement under subsection (23) that only recipients with \n     such a history are required to use racial classifications. \n     The Supreme Court has made clear that a particularized \n     showing of past discrimination in the specific context being \n     remedied is necessary. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-506 \n     (subpart III-B); see also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307-10 (subpart \n     IV-B) (opinion of Powell, J.). We note that one study of \n     recent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that, \n     for cases filed in state courts in the seventy-five largest \n     counties in May 1992, blacks were actually more likely than \n     whites to be acquitted in jury trials for most felony crimes. \n     Robert Lerner, ``Acquittal Rates by Race for State \n     Felonies,'' in Race and the Criminal Justice System (Center \n     for Equal Opportunity 1996).\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ A recipient may also be tempted to avoid subsection (23), \n     or show that it is making progress under it, by treating \n     minority and nonminority offenders differently--either \n     releasing more minority offenders than would normally be the \n     case, or detained and confining more nonminorities. Thus, \n     subsection (23) may actually encourage discrimination in the \n     criminal justice system in situations where it was not \n     occurring.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       It is also noteworthy that the federal government is not \n     administering subsection (23) in a way that requires that the \n     racial classification being used be aimed at ending \n     discrimination in the criminal justice system. To the \n     contrary--if the September 1998 Juvenile Justice Bulletin \n     (``Disproportionate Minority Confinement: 1997 Update''), \n     published by the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which administers \n     subsection (23), is any indication--most subsection (23) \n     programs are not aimed at the criminal justice system at all, \n     but are instead aimed at preventing antisocial behavior in \n     juveniles from ever occurring in the first place. See also 28 \n     C.F.R. sec. 31.303(j)(3) (1998) (Justice Department \n     regulations require intervention irrespective of cause of \n     disproportion).\n       This preemptive approach makes a great deal of sense--and \n     it underscores why the race-based approach of subsection (23) \n     itself does not. The criminal justice system is not to blame \n     for the disproportionate number of offenders from some \n     minority groups, and the problem of juvenile crime is not \n     limited to any one racial or ethnic group, even if some \n     groups may be disproportionately represented among juvenile \n     offenders. Urging that funding recipients view the problem of \n     juvenile crime through a racial lens is exactly the wrong \n     thing to do. Programs for at-risk youth should not be limited \n     to minorities, as if only blacks and Hispanics commit crimes \n     and as if it is not equally tragic when a white youth becomes \n     a criminal.\n       Indeed, it sets a very dangerous precedent to argue that \n     the government may target racial and ethnic groups for \n     special attention if members of those groups are \n     disproportionately likely to run afoul of the law. Such \n     precedent could be used to justify, for instance, the use of \n     racial profiling by the police. We are, therefore, surprised \n     that the NACCP is urging its members to support subsection \n     (23). See NACCP, Urgent Action Alert ``Re: Juvenile Crime \n     Bills'' (Mar. 31, 1999).\n       *Roger Clegg is vice president and general counsel of the \n     Center for Equal Opportunity, a Washington, D.C.-based \n     research and educational organization.

If not, we will reserve the remainder of \nour time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There have been statements made on the floor of the \nSenate on this question that I want everybody in the country to know \nabout. I want to have a chance to address these questions. We certainly \nwill use the rest of our time.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank you and especially thank the \nSenator from Minnesota for yielding me the time, but especially for his \ntremendous leadership on this issue, as well as Senator Kennedy.\n  This amendment merely preserves the status quo with respect to the \ndisproportionate minority confinement core requirement of the juvenile \njustice deliquency prevention formula grants.\n  Disproportionate minority confinement is a serious problem in many of \nour States, and has been for quite some time. Just as an example, in \nPennsylvania, studies in the late 1980s showed that while minorities \nconstituted only 12 percent of the juvenile population, they \nrepresented 27 percent of juveniles arrested and 48 percent of \njuveniles charged in court. In 1995, in Ohio, minorities comprised 14 \npercent of the state's juvenile population, but 30 percent of those \narrested and 43 percent of those placed in secure correctional \ninstitutions.\n  And currently, nationwide, although African Americans constitute only \n15 percent of the U.S. population of juveniles, they account for 26 \npercent of juvenile arrests, 46 percent of juveniles in secure \ncorrections facilities, and 52 percent of juveniles transferred to \nadult criminal court after judicial hearings.\n  A study in California showed that minority youths consistently \nreceive more severe sentences than white youths and are more likely \nthan white youths to be committed to State institutions for the same \noffenses. And here is another disturbing statistic: nationwide, African \nAmerican males are 30 times--30 times--more likely to be detained in \nState juvenile facilities for drug offenses than white males. In \nBaltimore, African American males are roughly 100 times more likely to \nbe arrested for drug offenses than white males.\n\n  These statistics are repeated across the country. I sincerely hope \nthat this is a problem that everyone in this body is concerned about. \nAnd it is not just unfairness or discrimination in the juvenile system \nthat should concern us. Because juvenile confinement often is the first \nstep toward a lifetime of going through a revolving door between prison \nand freedom. Confinement has devastating effects on families as well, \nand provides tragic role models for even younger children.\n  We ought to be doing what we can to address these disparities. The \nDMC core requirement is not a panacea, but it has been working well in \ndirecting attention and resources at this problem. It does not and I \nrepeat, it does not--require quotas in detention facilities or direct \nthe release of any juvenile from custody. It simply requires States to \ndevelop plans to address the problem.\n  Since 1992, our States have been required to address DMC in their \nState plans. Some 40 states have completed the assessment phase and are \nimplementing plans to try to address whatever problems they have \nidentified. They are working on creative approaches, programs of \neducation and vocational training, tutoring, dropout prevention, \ntruancy intervention, and other efforts to keep at risk children in \nschool. And States have been developing alternatives to incarceration \nfor nonserious, nonviolent offenses. All of these things, developed at \nthe state and local level, are positive efforts to address a serious \nsocial problem. We should be encouraging them, not undermining them by \neliminating this core requirement, as the bill would do.\n  Mr. President, this is well worth the effort on this floor. Again, I \nstrongly commend Senators Wellstone and Kennedy for offering this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just before we go forward with this \ntime, I understand the Senator from California is going to make a \nrequest. For just a moment, before I get started responding, could I \nask unanimous consent that this time not be counted against any of ours \nbecause there may be an interruption here for another amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Object. Reserving the right to object, we have been \nusing time. On what subject?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, we would not count this time. I \nam trying to be accommodating to Senators over here who may want to \nbriefly do an amendment, and then let us use our last 10 minutes. I \njust want to see----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Go ahead.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. I guess that did not work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, colleagues, 15 percent, ages 10 to 17, \nof the kids in this country are black; 26 percent of all juvenile \narrests are black; 32 percent of delinquency referrals to juvenile \ncourt are black; 46 percent of juveniles in public long-term \ninstitutions are black; cases judicially waived to\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\ncriminal court, for 52 percent they are black.\n  This is a civil rights issue. I cannot believe what I have heard on \nthe floor of the Senate tonight. We have been told there are more black \nkids who are incarcerated because they commit more crimes. We have been \ntold that these statistics, whether it be for African American or \nLatino or Native American or Southeast Asian, they are a reflection of \nthe number of kids who commit the crimes and who get the justice they \ndeserve.\n  We have already recited study after study after study that shows for \nthe same crime many of these kids get stiffer sentences or many of \nthese kids wind up incarcerated as opposed to other kids. This is all \nabout race. I cannot believe that I have heard on the floor of the \nSenate an argument that race is not the critical consideration.\n  When the police are out there in the streets, and we get to which \nkids are searched on the streets and which kids are not, you don't \nthink that has anything to do with race? When we get to the question of \nwhich kids are arrested and which kids are not, you don't think that \nhas anything to do with race today in America?\n  When we get to the question of the evaluation of youth by probation \nofficers, you don't think that has anything to do with race? When we \nget to the question of the decision whether to release or detain by a \njudge, based upon who has the money and who does not have the money to \nput up a bond, you don't think that has anything to do with race, \nSenators?\n  When we get to the question of sentencing, you don't think that has \nanything to do with race? You are sleepwalking through history. You are \nsleepwalking through history.\n  This is all about race. This is a civil rights issue and this is a \ncivil rights vote. Let me just say, when I hear my colleague argue that \nthis amendment is unconstitutional because it makes a racial \nclassification, that claim is outrageous. This amendment does not treat \nanybody differently on the basis of race, and you know it. It does not \ntreat anybody differently. The Supreme Court cases cited have nothing \nto do with this question. Adarand was about who gets construction \ncontracts.\n  You know what this amendment is about? This amendment is about \npreventing the majority party--I hope not too many in the majority \nparty--from repealing the existing protections that we now have in law \nthat have never been challenged as being unconstitutional that make \nsure there is some core requirement that calls upon States, to do what? \nTo collect the data and to study the problem, and to try and do \nsomething about it.\n  You are going to vote against this amendment? You go ahead. You go \nahead and vote against this amendment, if that is what you want to do.\n  I think it would be tragic if we didn't have strong support for this \namendment. This is all about race. This is a civil rights vote. This is \nwhy there is such strong sentiment on behalf of this amendment. This is \nwhy every civil rights organization has been involved in this \namendment. This is why so many of the children's organizations, like \nCDF, are involved. We have had the core requirement in our legislation. \nIt has been there since 1992 or 1993. It calls upon States to study the \nquestion and to try to do better.\n  And they are doing better. We are making progress. And now you want \nto discard this? You want to toss this overboard?\n  This is all about race. I cannot believe that any Senator in this \nChamber believes that these statistics are a reflection of who commits \nthe crimes and who deserves to be incarcerated. My God, I cannot \nbelieve it. I cannot believe it.\n  If you want to turn the clock back on some progress we have made, \nsome racial progress we have made that is so important to kids, so \nimportant to communities of color, and so important to the Nation, you \nwill be making a tragic mistake. That is why there were 400 votes for \nlegislation that embodies the very language that we have in our \namendment in the House of Representatives.\n  I hope we have bipartisan support for this amendment tonight. I \nreserve the remainder of my time, because I want to respond to whatever \nelse might be said on the floor of the Senate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 19 minutes 25 \nseconds. The Senator from Minnesota has 4 minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say a few words.\n  I think everybody in this body wants to do whatever they can to end \ndiscrimination wherever it is. I haven't heard one shred of information \nthat proves there is discrimination here. When you prove that, I will \nbe right there side by side with you. Nor have I heard much of a reason \nhow you get around the fact that crimes are committed, and it is the \ntype of crime and the quantities of crime and who is doing it that \nmakes a difference in our society and why people are locked up.\n  I think you have to look at the crime. You can't just get out here \nand say, well, there is disproportion; therefore, there has to be \nsomething wrong. You have to show what is wrong.\n  Frankly, I do not think the other side has shown what is wrong here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator recall when General McCaffrey testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee last year and I asked the \ngeneral, who was in charge of trying to reduce drug crime in America, \nif it were true that of those committing drug crimes in America, 13 \npercent are African American, and of those incarcerated for committing \ndrug crimes in America, 67 percent are African American? He said: Yes, \nit is true. I don't have an answer.\n  Now, I say to the chairman of that committee, I don't know if you \nwere there during that questioning, but if you are looking for an \nindication of why Senator Wellstone's amendment is important, that \nstatistic alone should give the Senator from Utah some pause. I hope he \nwill consider that we are not going to release anyone who has been \ncharged with a crime but merely step back and try to make sure the \nadministration of justice is color-blind in this country and that it is \nfair and try to eradicate the statistic which was quoted and verified \nby General McCaffrey.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say this again, what are the crimes? What is the \nextent of the crimes? How serious are they?\n\n  The fact that 13 percent of the offenders are African American and 67 \npercent of those incarcerated are--I don't see any information here \nsaying that higher percentage was unjustifiably put in jail. These \npercentages don't tell us what the crimes were in the individual cases. \nIf these individuals committed a crime, then they go to jail. Does that \nmean there are a lot of white people getting off? I don't see any \nevidence of that, either.\n  Do you have evidence that minority juveniles are more likely to be \ndetained for the same crime as white juveniles? I don't think you do. \nFor example, is there evidence that African Americans who are charged \nwith possession of crack cocaine are given more severe sentences than \nwhites for crack cocaine? Is there evidence? I don't know of any.\n  My point is, I don't think my colleagues on the other side are \narguing that if people commit heinous crimes and they are convicted and \nsentenced to jail that they shouldn't be. Now, if there is some \nevidence that law enforcement is ignoring white people who commit these \nsame heinous crimes, then I am with you. I don't know of any evidence \nof that.\n  Statistics are statistics are statistics, but when people go to jail, \nit is generally because they have committed crimes.\n  What is your solution? To let them out of jail? Crack cocaine \ndistributors? Is your argument that white crack dealers get away with \nit because they are smarter or they are protected somehow or other? I \ndon't think you are making that argument. I can't imagine you would \nmake that argument. So I don't know why there is a higher percentage, \nbut I do know that almost without exception--there certainly are some \ninstances where the law is not applied justly, I am aware of that--but \nalmost without exception, people who commit these heinous crimes go to \njail for them.\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\n  I don't think you are arguing to let them out of jail. But then, \nagain, how can you argue, then, that if they are committing the crimes \nand are going to jail, that for some reason or other there is some \nreason why they are going to jail where others aren't? I don't see the \nargument myself. Plus, you are adding racial classifications, mandated \nracial classifications in this amendment. To me it is not even a \nquestion of constitutionality. There is no question it is \nunconstitutional.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Let me retain it for a second and say one other thing. One would \nthink, listening to my friend from Minnesota, that our bill does \nabsolutely nothing to deal with this problem. You hear this very \nemotional set of arguments as though the Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill does \nabsolutely nothing about these problems. S. 254, in my opinion, has a \nmuch better provision to solve these problems than the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The bill as written, as before the Senate, requires that prevention \nresources be directed to ``segments of the juvenile population'' who \nare disproportionately detained. Now, such ``segments of the \npopulation'' could include, for example, certain socioeconomic groups \nwho are more likely to be at risk. S. 254 directs prevention resources \nto such groups who need those resources the most. So we try to do \nsomething about it rather than just cite statistics.\n  I don't see how you get around the fact that these people are \nsentenced and sent to jail because they have committed crimes. Just \nbecause there are statistics that indicate that more than a \nproportionate share of the general population is going to jail, I don't \nknow how in the world you get around the fact that these crimes are \nbeing committed by individuals--individuals who just happen to be of \none race or another. But we do try to address it by directing \nprevention resources to such groups who need those resources the most. \nI think that is the way to do it.\n  I will work with my friends on the other side to see that we do \nthings that make sure those moneys work.\n  A National Research Council study, published by the National Academy \nof Sciences no less, found that:\n\n       Few criminologists would argue that the current gap between \n     African American and white levels of imprisonment is mainly \n     due to discrimination of sentencing or in any other \n     decisionmaking process in the criminal justice system.\n\n  If the National Academy of Sciences is wrong, show me the evidence. \nJust because this disparity exists, liberals throw their hands in the \nair and say there must be something wrong, but they can't prove it, \nother than to show statistics. I hope they will be with me in saying \nthat people who are justly sentenced for heinous crimes shouldn't be \nlet off just because there is a disproportionate sentencing because \nmore crimes are committed by one group than another. I don't see how \nanybody can argue with that point. You know, it must be nice to always \nact like you are caring for the little guy, when, in fact, you are not \nwilling to do what has to be done in order to help resolve these \nproblems.\n\n  Now, 55 percent of this bill is for prevention--55 percent of it. I \ndon't remember any crime bill in my time here--there may have been one, \nbut I can't remember it--where we put more money into prevention than \nlaw enforcement and accountability. But we have done it here, and one \nreason is to try to solve these problems. If there is a segment of our \npopulation that seems to have certain socioeconomic problems that \nliterally have caused them to be disproportionately convicted--I don't \neven think the word ``disproportionate'' is right--but more convicted \nthan their racial group's percentage in population group might suggest, \nwe want to spend more money on prevention for those people. And that is \nwhat this bill does. It doesn't take a lot of sense to recognize that \nis a pretty good proposition, and we have it in the bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in all due respect to my colleague from \nUtah, I don't think anybody in the civil rights community all across \nthis land will be reassured. I will work with you on the language. With \nall due respect, some of these arguments about surely you are not for \nletting blacks out of jail --of course not. The Senator knows what the \namendment says. The Senator knows it is not about quotas; it is not \nabout letting anybody out of jail. The Senator knows this is all about \ncalling on States to study the problem. The Senator knows that. We have \nhad this core protection since 1993. Why do you think it is the case? \nThere has been a history for this. It started in 1988. Then we passed \nthis amendment in 1993. It is based upon all kinds of studies, all \nkinds of work, which has provided the empirical evidence, which should \nbe of no surprise to any Senator here, that we have a problem in our \ncountry of disproportionate minority confinement.\n  We want to try to understand why minority kids who represent about 33 \npercent of the population represent about 66 percent of the kids who \nare locked up. We want to come to terms with that. Could it have \nanything to do with their race, in terms of who gets swept up in the \nstreets? Could it have anything to do with who actually ends up getting \na good evaluation or not by a probation officer? Could it have anything \nto do with who is released or detained by a judge? Could it have \nanything to do with who is sentenced and for how long a period of time?\n  My colleague doesn't think race has anything to do with this. If you \ndon't think race has anything to do with this, that we don't have any \nproblem with discrimination in our country, or that States right now \nare collecting data and trying to come to terms with this problem, \nwhich is exactly what our amendment says--continue with this good \nwork--then you should not vote for this amendment. But if you think \nthis is an issue that deals with race in America, that this is a civil \nrights question, and you think it was a good thing that we had this \ncore protection, this core requirement in our juvenile justice \nlegislation and it would be a tragic mistake for us to take this \nprotection out that just calls for States to study the problem and try \nto redress the problem, then you should vote for this amendment.\n\n  This is the language of the amendment:\n\n       Address juvenile delinquency prevention efforts and system \n     improvement efforts designed to reduce, without establishing \n     or requiring numerical standards or quotas, the \n     disproportionate number of juvenile members of minority \n     groups who come into contact with the juvenile justice \n     system.\n\n  Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, that is what you are \nvoting on. This is a civil rights vote. The more I hear my colleagues \nspeak on the floor of the Senate--I think what has been said is \nheartfelt, but it is historic. Some Senators don't think there is an \nissue with discrimination. There are some Senators who don't think \nthere is a problem of disproportional sentencing. There are some \nSenators who think we should remove this protection. There are some \nSenators who want to turn the clock back. But I am telling you, this is \na central issue for the civil rights community in this country and for \nchild advocacy groups.\n  I certainly hope we will be able to pass this amendment. If we don't \npass this amendment, this juvenile justice legislation will have taken \na step backward when it comes to justice. I don't think it will be a \npiece of legislation that will be worth supporting. I don't think \nSenators should support legislation that turns the clock back on the \nprogress we have made dealing with racial justice. I don't think \nSenators should support that, and I think Senators should support this \namendment. This is the civil rights question, the civil rights issue, \nand the civil rights vote on this bill. My good friend from Utah \ndoesn't want to say that. He doesn't want to face up to that reality, \nbut that is what this vote is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is not a civil rights vote. This is a \nvote that is an emotional vote. That is, they cannot show any reasons \nwhy people who commit heinous crimes should not go to jail. They are \nsaying because there is a disproportionate number of African \nAmericans--to select one group because that is the one they are talking \nabout--going to jail for crimes they\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\nwere convicted for, that somehow there is something wrong with that. \nEverybody in America knows that people are sentenced to jail because \nthey have committed crimes. I admit that occasionally there are \ninjustices in our courts, but they are very rare. When they do occur, I \nwill decry them as much as my friend from Minnesota.\n  This is what you call a bleeding heart amendment. They can't show the \nfacts; they don't have any facts on their side. They are using \nstatistics. They are ignoring the fact that people are convicted of \nthese crimes and need to serve time for them, regardless of skin color; \nand they are ignoring the fact that we take care of this problem by \nproviding a disproportionate amount of the prevention funds to help \nsegments of the population having difficulties because of socioeconomic \ndifficulties. That is the way to face it and solve the problem. Don't \njust complain about the problem. What is the solution? Is it that these \npeople should not serve their time? Should they not be convicted when \nthey sell drugs to our kids? Everybody knows that it happens.\n  It is nice to talk about civil rights. The fact of the matter is that \nnobody is more concerned about civil rights than I am. If anyone can \nshow me where there is prejudice, if they can show me where these \npeople are not justly convicted, that is another matter. I will be \nright there marching with them. But they can't and they know it.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, and then I will yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nleadership. He raises a good question about statistics and how they can \nbe misleading. I had, of course, served as attorney general of Alabama, \nand I have a brief here that was submitted on statistics involving \nwhites and blacks on death row in Alabama. Now, 52 percent of those on \ndeath row in Alabama are white; 46 percent are black. But that \npercentage of the black population is substantially higher on death row \nthan in the State. But the study goes on to show that the percentage of \nhomicides committed in Alabama by blacks was 71 percent; yet, they \nrepresented only 46 percent of the people on death row.\n  So I don't know what any of those numbers mean. I am not sure they \nare very beneficial to anybody. But if you look at it one way, it looks \nlike it is unfair. If you look at it another way, it looks like it is \nnot unfair. So the Senator is correct that we need to have proof of \nindividual wrongs instead of passing a law that is going to require the \nreduction of people in prison based on a statistical study.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much does the other side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Zero.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the remainder of my time, and we can yield to \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 365\n\n (Purpose: To discourage the promotion of violence in motion pictures \n                      and television productions)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 365.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . PROHIBITION ON PROMOTING VIOLENCE ON FEDERAL \n                   PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--A Federal department or agency that--\n       (1) considers a request from an individual or entity for \n     the use of any property, facility, equipment, or personnel of \n     the department or agency, or for any other cooperation from \n     the department or agency, to film a motion picture or \n     television production for commercial purposes; and\n       (2) makes a determination as to whether granting a request \n     described in paragraph (1) is consistent with--\n       (A) United States policy;\n       (B) the mission or interest of the department or agency; or\n       (C) the public interest;\n     shall not grant such a request without considering whether \n     such motion picture or television production glorifies or \n     endorses wanton and gratuitous violence.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to--\n       (1) any bona fide newsreel or news television production; \n     or\n       (2) any public service announcement.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my understanding is I have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the Chair to notify me when I have 3 minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that is now pending would require that \nwhen granting permits necessary for filming a movie or a TV show on \nFederal property, or with Federal equipment, the relevant agency's \napproval criteria now would include a consideration of whether the film \nglorifies or endorses wanton and gratuitous violence. The message is \nsimple: The Federal Government will not allow Hollywood to promote \nexcessive and wanton violence in our house.\n  America's children are exposed to incessant and endless hours of \nviolent movies and television productions each year. Exposure to this \nviolence desensitizes our children to brutality and killing and gives \nthem ``glamorous'' murderous acts to emulate. This exposure is like \npouring gasoline on fire.\n  Yes, the children who commit terrible acts of violence must have a \nnumber of deep and troubling problems. However, the glorified wanton \nviolence depicted in movies and on TV is fuel that Hollywood is dousing \non those children and their smoldering internal problems. This is not a \nrevelation. Indeed, a 1996 American Medical Association Study concluded \nthat, ``The link between media violence and real life violence has been \nproven by science time and time again.''\n  Most people know, intuitively, that there is a strong link between \nmedia violence and real life. Why is it that no one in Hollywood seems \nto care? Are they the only ones who are oblivious to this phenomenon? \nWhy is there no shame about the violent junk they are making and \nMARKETING to our kids? Why do we hear Hollywood give speech after \nspeech after speech on every fad-driven cause under the sun, and yet \nrarely ever do we hear them mention reforming themselves and refraining \nfrom marketing violence to our children.\n  Let's take a look at some of the media violence that our children are \nexposed to.\n  First, let's go to the movies.\n  Now, I'm told that Leonardo DiCaprio and Keanu Reeves are two of the \nbiggest teen idols out there today. These photographs are both from \nrecent hit movies--``The Basketball Diaries'' and ``The Matrix''.\n  Thanks to the occupant of the Chair, Senator Brownback, the \nRepublican Senators had an opportunity to see some of the scenes from \n``Basketball Diaries'' recently. That is one of the scenes from it here \non my left.\n  The ``Matrix,'' featuring Keanu Reeves, is here on my right.\n  You can see from these photographs that Hollywood is taking the \nbiggest teen idols and creating these glamorous, powerful, violent \nimages to send out to our young people. These are role models for \nchildren.\n  As you can see here, in ``Basketball Diaries,'' teen idol DiCaprio is \nwearing a long, black trenchcoat and packing a shotgun. In this movie, \nDiCaprio's character has a fantasy of walking into his high school \nclassroom and opening fire on his schoolmates and his teacher.\n  Thanks to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, we had an \nopportunity to see this scene from that film. I think we would all \nagree--those of us who saw it--it literally turns your stomach.\n  These violent images became reality in the community of Paducah, \nKentucky, barely 17 months ago. In a Paducah high school, the DiCaprio \nDream was played out in real life. I'd like to read for my colleagues \nan excerpt from a Newsweek article about ``Basketball Diaries'' and the \nsenseless tragedy in Paducah.\n\n       ``The Basketball Diaries'' may not have been 14-year-old \n     Michael Carneal's favorite\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\n     movie. But one scene in particular stayed with the awkward \n     Paducah, Ky., freshman: a young character's narcotic-tinged \n     dream of striding into his school, pulling a shotgun from a \n     black leather coat and opening fire. The real-life scene in \n     the bloodied halls of Heath High School last Monday was a \n     long way from Hollywood. Unlike handsome actor Leonardo \n     DiCaprio's dramatic entrance in 1995's ``Diaries,'' skinny, \n     bespectacled Michael bummed a ride to school that day from \n     his 17-year-old sister, Kelly. Instead of cinematically \n     kicking down a classroom door, Michael quietly followed Kelly \n     into the school through the band room, where he told a \n     curious teacher that the four guns bound together with duct \n     tape and wrapped in an old blanket were ``a poster for my \n     science project.'' Loitering in the hall, Michael waited for \n     a prayer group of 35 students to lift their bowed heads and \n     say ``Amen.'' He then took a fifth gun, a semiautomatic .22, \n     from his backpack and fired off 12 shots, killing three \n     students and wounding five. Before the police arrived, \n     Carneal would tell a teacher, `it was like I was in a dream.'\n\n  Looking back at Paducah, and now Littleton--and looking at these \nHollywood images of teen idols--can leave no doubts. Hollywood violence \nDOES influence our children, in the worst way.\n  Let me tell you about this other hit movie--``The Matrix.'' The image \nof this character is strikingly similar to that over here of Mr. \nDiCaprio. Let me read to you how an article in the Washington Post \ndescribed watching the Matrix.\n\n       The sold-out theatre was filled with younger teens, despite \n     the R rating, and at times I felt as if I were watching a \n     dramatization of the killings that had just occurred in \n     Littleton, Colorado.\n       In one scene, protagonists played by Keanu Reaves and \n     Carrie-Anne Moss arrive at an office building where their \n     adversaries are holed up. Dressed in black leather coats, the \n     pair sprays the lobby with automatic weapons fire. The scene \n     is a gorgeously choreographed ballet of mass killing, a \n     triumph of Hollywood's ability to represent graphic violence. \n     As bullets riddle a dozen twitching bodies, spent shell \n     casings cascade downward in slow motion. The victims of this \n     orgy of killing are police officers.\n  I have heard some in Hollywood say that these violent movies are for \nadults--not for our impressionable children. Those comments simply are \nnot credible. The reality is that Hollywood markets many such movies to \nteenagers. For proof, one need only to look as far as the hit Teen \nMovie--``Scream.'' In this movie young, beautiful high school students \nslay, stab and butcher each other and their teachers for two non-stop \nhours. ``The movie builds to a finale in which one of the killers \nannounces that he and his accomplice started off by murdering strangers \nbut then realized it was a lot more fun to kill their friends.'' Where \nis the Shame, Hollywood?\n  Mr. President, if the sights and sounds of Hollywood were not enough \nfor you, let me take you to the next level: the gutter of the new \nmillennium--violent videogames. This is a dimension where our children \nare not limited to be mere watchers. Rather, in videogames they are \nparticipants--active participants. America's children can descend as \nlow as a twisted, demented videogame will take them.\n  I think these games have been best-described by Retired Lieutenant \nColonel David Grossman, a former professor of psychology at West Point \nwho now teaches a course to green berets on the psychology of killing. \nHe calls them ``Murder Simulators.'' These are the ``games\" our \nchildren are playing.\n  In the videogame ``Postal'' the goal is straightforward: kill as many \ntownfolk as possible without being killed yourself. The maker of this \ngame boasts, ``Chilling realism as victims actually beg for mercy, \nscream for their lives and bodies pile up on the street.'' That game \nmaker certainly has no shame.\n  I want to share with you some fascinating excerpts from a recent ``60 \nMinutes'' episode with Retired Lieutenant Colonel David Grossman, the \nformer West Point professor I mentioned earlier. They discussed the \n``skills'' these games are teaching our children.\n\n       Colonel Grossman. The same basic mechanisms that we use, \n     step by step, to make killing a conditioned response in our \n     soldiers, are being done in the games that the kids go and \n     play.\n\n  Mr. President, let me tell you what Colonel Grossman had to say about \nPaducah, Kentucky and Michael Carneal.\n\n       Colonel Grossman. Michael Carneal, a 14-year-old boy, has \n     never fired a pistol before in his life. His total experience \n     was countless, thousands and thousands of rounds in the video \n     games. When Michael Carneal opened fire; he fired eight \n     shots. . . . [H]e got eight hits on eight different kids. \n     Five of them were head shots. The other three were upper \n     torso. Now, the F.B.I. says in the average engagement, the \n     average officer hits with less than one bullet in five.\n\n  Grossman concluded:\n\n       Grossman. Here's what's fascinating about this crime. . . . \n     He held that gun and he fired one shot at every target. Now, \n     that is not natural. [A]nybody that's ever been in combat \n     will tell you that the natural thing is to fire at a target \n     until it drops. But the video games train you--if you're \n     very, very, very good, what you'll do is you'll fire one \n     shot--don't even wait for the target to drop--you don't have \n     time--go to the next, and the next. And the video games give \n     bonus effects for head shots.\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Motion Picture Association has \nbeen lobbying heavily against this amendment. I want to make sure \neverybody understands what this amendment really does. It is quite \nmild.\n\n  The problems evidenced by these video games and movies are \ncomplicated and complex. We are not going to solve them overnight. I do \nbelieve it is time that Hollywood take more responsibility. We need to \nsend the message to Hollywood: Don't bombard our children with \nglamorous portrayals of gratuitous and wanton violence.\n  Under the first amendment, we cannot and we should not seek to deny \nthe right of free speech to anyone. However, as the Senate, we can \nencourage Hollywood to take responsible steps to protect our children. \nWe can make sure the Federal Government does not costar with Hollywood \nin any movies that glorify or endorse wanton and gratuitous violence.\n  The Federal Government already currently grants permits to Hollywood, \nallowing them to film on Federal property or allowing them to borrow \nFederal equipment such as jeeps or weapons to use in these films. Many \ngovernment agencies and departments currently decide whether or not to \ncooperate with a film or TV production based on the nature and message \nof the proposed production.\n  For example, DOD decides whether to grant Federal filming privileges \nbased on whether a production ``appear[s] to condone or endorse \nactivities . . . [that] are contrary to U.S. Government policy.''\n  In other words, ``Top Gun'' is OK, but ``GI Jane'' is not. The \nmilitary rolled out the red carpet for ``Top Gun'' while ``GI Jane'' \nhad the door shut in her face.\n  When deciding whether to cooperate with a movie, NASA determines \nwhether the ``story is reasonably plausible, does not advocate or \nglorify unlawful acts, . . . or present as factual history things which \ndid not take place.''\n  The Coast Guard looks at whether, among other things, the Coast \nGuard's cooperation ``is in the public interest.'' Let me quote to you \nfrom 14 United States Code Section 659, where Congress has mandated in \nfederal statute that the Coast Guard cannot provide facilities or \nassistance to film producers unless it determines ``that it is \nappropriate, and that it will not interfere with Coast Guard \nmissions.''\n  The point is the Federal Government is already engaged in a clearance \nprocess when a motion picture seeks to be made on Federal property. We \nare not adding requirements that are not already there, with one \nexception. In this amendment where Federal agencies are already engaged \nin a subjective clearance process, either through statute or through \npolicy, we add to it this standard: Promoting and endorsing or \nglorifying violence.\n  Clearly, this is not infringing on the movie industry's first \namendment rights. They can simply go out and make their movies \nsomewhere else. What we are saying here, if we are going to use our \nproperty, Federal property, and the agency already has a subjective \nclearance process, gratuitous, wanton and gratuitous violence needs to \nbe added as a factor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as necessary out \nof the time we have available.\n  I listened to my good friend from Kentucky, and he is my good friend. \nWe have been together on more issues than we have been apart.\n  I note one thing: As I recall, in reading the reviews of the movie \n``Matrix''\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nit was filmed in Australia, so this amendment, I assume, \nnotwithstanding the graphic picture with Keanu Reeves, would not be \ncovered?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont that particular movie \nwas not made on Federal property. I am sure my friend from Vermont \nwould not be arguing that it ought to have been made on Federal \nproperty.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am not one who is particularly interested in violent \nmovies. I have been to too many crime scenes, too many murder and \nshooting scenes in a prior public life to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I feel very strongly that this amendment \nshould not pass.\n  I wanted to add to what Senator Leahy has said. As far as I know, \nnone of the movies or programs he talks about, and certainly none of \nthe games--because games are made from computers--were ever made on \nFederal property as far as I could tell. I think that is an important \npoint.\n  It is interesting that just today, just today, one of the committees \nhere in the Senate voted out some new rules that would govern the \nfilming on Federal property. It was voted out of the committee. I think \nit is unfortunate we are bringing this up just while we are trying to \nresolve all of these questions.\n  I think it is important to read the amendment. I have it in front of \nme, and it uses words that are very subjective, words like ``wanton \nviolence.'' I looked that up in the dictionary because under this \namendment we are giving Federal bureaucrats who are not trained as \ncritics of film or critics of television programming the job of \ndeciding whether there is wanton violence.\n  One of the meanings of ``wanton'' is excessively luxurious. So, \nsomebody deciding this could decide to go with that definition. Another \nmeaning of ``wanton'' is without adequate motive or provocation. These \nwords carry different meanings for different people. The Senator from \nKentucky has his definition of gratuitous violence, of wanton violence. \nThe dictionary has another. Who knows what the bureaucrat at the FAA \nwill decide violence is, when it is up to him to decide whether his \nproperty could be used, or a bureaucrat at the Department of the \nInterior?\n  I got a call from a Republican friend who said: Senator, I hope you \nfight this. We couldn't make a western, we couldn't make a war movie. \nWhat about a movie that talks about a family in which there are violent \nrelationships and these all get resolved in the movie? Some of the \nscenes are rough and difficult, but there is a purpose.\n  I am sure my friend would say that is not gratuitous, but that is his \nopinion. It might not be the opinion of the bureaucrat sitting in the \nagency or department that he is now charging with becoming a film \ncritic.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't have that much time. I ask the Senator if she \nthinks the standards that currently apply and are used by DOD and \nmandated by statute for the Coast Guard, which are very subjective, \nshould be repealed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am addressing the Senator's amendment and the Senator's \namendment says any department. It uses the words ``wanton, \ngratuitous.'' I think these words are very, very subjective. It is the \nreason I didn't vote for Senator Hollings' amendment when he came to \nthe floor--it was the same idea.\n  My constituents are concerned this amendment would potentially \nprevent war movies, westerns, or stories about abusive relationships \nwhich find peace and harmony in the end from being filmed on Federal \nproperty. It gives bureaucrats in many Federal agencies the authority \nto decide what violence is.\n  I didn't run here for this job to be an art critic. That is why when \nwe criticize the art world, I think we have to be very careful, because \nwe are not art critics. Most Members are pretty good at what we do, but \nwe are not art critics; neither is a bureaucrat over at Interior or FAA \nor any of the other departments that will now deal with this.\n  I say, as a parent and a grandparent, I do not want to give this kind \nof power, this kind of job to an elected, let alone an unelected, \nperson sitting at some Federal agency. I think it is pretty incredible. \nI do not know where we go from here, I say to the good Senator.\n  Why not, if you want to take this to the ultimate extreme, then say \nprivate property cannot be used, private property cannot be used for \nthis purpose, and tell the people of America how they should use their \nprivate property? Where do you stop? This is a slippery slope.\n  We all know that every one of us has to look inside ourselves and do \nsomething about this problem of violence. Whether you are a parent or a \ngrandparent or a Senator, whether you are in the movie business, in the \nTV business, whether you are in the video game business, we all have an \nobligation--or whether you are a firearms manufacturer. The bottom line \nis we all have to do more.\n  But to then say that bureaucrats in the Federal Government are going \nto make these subjective decisions? I want the people at FAA to fly the \nplanes. I want the people at the Department of the Interior to take \ncare of the parks. I want the people at the Department of \nTransportation to regulate transportation. I do not want to give them \nthis job of deciding for the people of America what the definition of \n``wanton'' is; or ``gratuitous,'' for that matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 additional minute, and then I will conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was involved in this debate once over at the Committee \non Commerce. I will never forget this experience, I say to my friend. \nWord came over from a Congressman--because he wanted the Government to \ndo a rating system, he wanted to give the job to the Government--one \nCongressman thought ``Schindler's List'' was obscene. Others thought \n``Schindler's List'' was one of the best movies ever made and it would \nbe important for our children to learn about the Holocaust.\n  Why do I say this? Because it shows how subjective it is. I do not \nwant Federal Government employees who are not trained as critics to \nbecome movie critics and TV critics.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me this additional time. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Wait a minute, Mr. President. I yielded the Senator a \ntotal of 6 minutes, the Senator from California, out of 15 minutes. How \ndo I have 6 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 2 minutes before yielding to \nthe distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see. Fast clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment prohibits any Federal \nagency, such as the Marines, Army, Navy, or Air Force, from granting \npermission to use Federal property or resources or cooperating if the \nmotion picture or TV show to be produced ``glorifies or endorses wanton \nand gratuitous violence.'' If any portion of the movie uses any Federal \nproperty, the entire movie is subject to Federal scrutiny\n  Federal agencies, other than the military, would be given these new \ncensorship powers, too. The Department of Agriculture could determine \nif it is on forest lands or rights of way of the Interior Department \nand otherwise. Could they have kept ``North By Northwest'' with Cary \nGrant off because the visitors center scene at Mount Rushmore was in \nit? What about ``Fargo''? What about the Presidio military base in San \nFrancisco that was used as a setting for the Sean Connery movie, ``The \nPresidio''? This amendment is flawed. What glorifies violence is in the \neye of the beholder.\n  Even movies, like legislation, have last-minute changes. Would you \nhave to have a Department of Agriculture bureaucrat sitting there all \nthe way through? Many scenes in the movie ``Top Gun'' would have had to \nbe carefully monitored during production to\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nensure they did not glorify violence. The naval base that was used was \nMiramar in California.\n  The fight in ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' also might be considered \nexcessive by some. What about the gratuitous punch by Jimmy Stewart in \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''? ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' \nuses the vast national forest lands in its filming, even though most of \nit was filmed in Mexico. Could part of it be knocked out?\n  There are only exceptions for news and public service announcements, \nbut any movie that is a historical depiction of a war would be subject \nto agency bureaucrats deciding whether violence was gratuitous or \nglorifies violence. Sponsors may say: Let them go somewhere else and do \ntheir filming, let them go to private property or parklands or military \nbases. I think that is a shortsighted response. Some may want to use \nthat property to be authentic.\n  I am concerned how this is going to work. Do we turn over our \nscripts? If you are a movie producer or maker, do you turn over the \nscript to the Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, \nDepartment of Defense first and decide whether it is safe? We may not \nlike all that we see from Hollywood. But I have no confidence in the \ndecisions the agency censors make. I am perfectly capable of censoring \nwhat I see. I was perfectly capable, when my children were young, to \ncensor what they saw. But I do not want an official, however well \nintentioned, in the Department of Agriculture or the Department of \nDefense or the Department of the Interior, to determine what I see.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky for his \namendment. I just want to be clear on one matter, however. It is my \nunderstanding that lands under the BLM, Park Service, and Forest \nService are in no way covered or affected by the amendment because they \ndo not consider subjective criteria when determining whether to \ncooperate or grant permits to a film or TV production. Is that correct?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 56 seconds in \nopposition to the amendment and 1 minute 47 seconds on the proponents.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to make that 3 minutes on the side \nof Senator McConnell and an equivalent amount of extra time on the side \nof the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I didn't hear the request.\n  Mr. HATCH. I made a unanimous consent request to give Senator \nMcConnell 3 minutes, which would give him another minute and a half, \nand give you an equal amount of time on your side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. You are asking for an extra minute and a half----\n  Mr. HATCH. For Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And an extra minute and a half for this side?\n  Mr. HATCH. For you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to respond that the \nobservations made by the other side have nothing to do with the \namendment, nothing whatsoever to do with the amendment.\n  Any movie company is free to go make a movie anywhere it wants to in \nthe country and say anything it wants to and be as depraved as it wants \nto be without interference from Government. This amendment is only \nrelated to the use of Federal property.\n  In many federal agencies and departments there are subjective \nstandards being used now to approve or deny cooperation with film \nproduction companies. The thing the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from California are complaining about is already occurring. The \nDepartment of Defense has very subjective standards it applies to \nmovies now. For example, it did not allow ``GI Jane'' to be made on \nFederal property or with DOD assistance. It did not keep the movie from \nbeing made, but the Defense Department did not like it; it had a very \nsubjective standard. They said go make your movie somewhere else. They \nliked ``Top Gun.'' They allowed it to be made. There is a very \nsubjective standard that applies now.\n  DOD considers whether a production ``appears to condone or endorse \nactivities that are contrary to U.S. Government policy.'' That is \nclearly very subjective. Factors in NASA's policy include whether the \nstory is reasonably plausible, does not advocate or glorify unlawful \nacts or present as factual history things which did not take place--\nthat is fairly subjective.\n  At the Coast Guard, under statute, the Coast Guard does not provide \nfacilities or assistance to film producers unless the Guard determines \nit is ``appropriate''--very subjective--and that it will not interfere \nwith Coast Guard missions.\n  Mr. President, a movie company now does not have the inalienable \nright or constitutional right to come onto Federal property and do \nanything it wants to. All we are saying, to Federal agencies that have \neither a policy or a statute giving them the authority to clear these \nmovies for content--and we've seen that some have them now--that they \nsimply add to the list of subjective evaluations they already make a \nconsideration of wanton and gratuitous violence. Surely our colleagues \nwho have spoken on the other side of this are not arguing we ought to \nrepeal the current standards because they are very subjective. Maybe \nthey do not want any standard at all to apply with respect to the use \nof Federal property.\n  With regard to the parks system, they do not currently have \nsubjective criteria and standard, so this would not apply to them. They \nare clearly outside of this.\n  This is a very narrowly crafted message to Hollywood not to produce \nthis kind of gratuitous and wanton violence on Federal property with \nfederal cooperation. It certainly does not take away anybody's \nconstitutional right to go out and act in as awful a manner as they \nwant to and put it on film. They just wouldn't be able to do it on \nFederal property.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are well aware of what the military \ndoes. The military will permit use--in fact, some suggest even will \nhelp underwrite, indirectly, the costs of a film if it makes the \nmilitary look good.\n  The military has been known in the past to withdraw support, even \nclassic films, if they suggest the military may have made a mistake \nanywhere--Vietnam or anywhere else. We have seen that kind of \ncensorship.\n  I understand they are using military areas. I do not necessarily \nagree with it. I think they have been very sensitive with that, but \nthen the military is used to censorship. They do it with the news. They \ndid it during the gulf war. They did it during Vietnam. I suspect they \nare doing it now.\n  What I am concerned about, though, is when you talk about the vast \nforest land and somebody one day in the Department of Agriculture, who \nworks on, I don't know, dairy price supports, and the next day is going \nto be the person to censor what goes in that movie, whether that forest \ncan be the background or, if it is out west where the Department of the \nInterior controls so much land--I can think of movies, shoot 'em ups, \nwith Ronald Reagan galloping by the sites in areas controlled by the \nDepartment of the Interior. It might have been declined because \nsomebody did not like him. Maybe somebody who normally does fishing \npermits in the Department of the Interior will determine what movies \nwill be made or what they like or do not like.\n  We open ourselves to a strange area. Those who are opposed to wanton \nviolence should do as I do--don't go to those movies. Nothing votes \nbetter than your checkbook. If you do not want your children to go to \nthem, do not let your children go to them. Stop the checkbook. That is \nthe way to do it.\n  Do not put our Department of Agriculture and Department of the \nInterior and others into censorship. Do not let them make some of the \nmistakes the Department of Defense has made in the past in refusing \npermission for something because they are afraid it will show a general \nor a colonel or admiral\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nmaking a mistake, because we all know they never do. I can see them \ndeciding it might be gratuitous violence to show--oh, I don't know--\nmaybe when their bombs go astray and hit the Chinese Embassy. We know \nthey never make a mistake like that, but they may say this is \ngratuitous violence, so they are not going to allow any help in making \nsuch a movie.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-four seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is interesting, in Hollywood \nlobbying efforts, they always scream censorship. This amendment has \nnothing to do with censorship. It has to do with the use of Federal \nproperty and federal assistance, which is a privilege, not a right.\n  The Federal Government, through various departments and agencies, \nalready has very subjective standards. We are simply adding to those \nkinds of standards one more factor--wanton and gratuitous violence. No \nmovie company in America has a right to use any and all Federal \nproperty and to get federal assistance anyway. We are just adding one \nmore criterion.\n  This is a very reasonable amendment. I hope it will be approved by my \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 17 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I can think of some ads I see on local TV \nat night that are not violent but I find of a personal nature \noffensive, some of which are filled with backgrounds of Government \nland. Should we start taking those out?\n  The fact is, we have a lot of Government sites. Do we stop a movie, \nfor example, that is filmed with somebody driving down Pennsylvania \nAvenue because the Department of the Interior, the Justice Department, \nand other Government buildings are seen in the background? Do we make \nsure there is never any depiction of the Capitol? One of the most \nviolent things was ``Independence Day'' when a model of the Capitol was \nblown up. There may have been exterior shots actually made of the \nCapitol prior to that time. Does that go out?\n  I suggest these because we are getting into a terribly subjective \narea, and we are asking people who are trained to do very good things \nfor our Government, whether it is fishing permits, lands permits, or \nagricultural subsidies--they are not trained, nor should they be, in \nthis Nation especially to be censors.\n  I know the time of the Senator from Kentucky has expired. I yield \nback all my remaining time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 319\n\n (Purpose: To reduce both juvenile crime and the risk that youth will \nbecome victims of crime and to improve academic and social outcomes for \n students by providing productive activities during after school hours)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 319. It is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 319.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n          TITLE   . AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND ANTI-CRIME ACT.\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``After School Education and \n     Anti-Crime Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to improve academic and social \n     outcomes for students and reduce both juvenile crime and the \n     risk that youth will become victims of crime by providing \n     productive activities during after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \n     their parents and grandparents.\n       (2) Students spend more of their waking hours alone, \n     without supervision, companionship, or activity, than the \n     students spend in school.\n       (3) Law enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages \n     12 through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n       (4) The consequences of academic failure are more dire in \n     1999 than ever before.\n       (5) After school programs have been shown in many States to \n     help address social problems facing our Nation's youth, such \n     as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang involvement.\n       (6) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n     number of after school programs through a Federal/State \n     partnership.\n       (7) Over 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with presidents of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of \n     Police Associations, which together represent 360,000 police \n     officers, have called upon public officials to provide after \n     school programs that offer recreation, academic support, and \n     community service experience, for school-age children and \n     teens in the United States.\n       (8) One of the most important investments that we can make \n     in our children is to ensure that they have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n       The goals of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To increase the academic success of students.\n       (2) To promote safe and productive environments for \n     students in the after school hours.\n       (3) To provide alternatives to drug, alcohol, tobacco, and \n     gang activity.\n       (4) To reduce juvenile crime and the risk that youth will \n     become victims of crime during after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 5.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, take effect \n     on October 1, 1999.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment calls for an expansion of afterschool \nprograms. The purpose of the juvenile justice bill is to cut down on \ncrime, and the debate has been, how do we do that?\n  There are many ways of cutting down on juvenile crime. Certainly one \nis the gun control amendments which we have been debating and which \nhave received a lot of attention. Another is tough enforcement, tougher \npenalties. We have been doing that. And another is prevention. I \nbelieve this bill is short on prevention. There is not anything in this \nbill that specifically talks about afterschool programs.\n  I share with my colleagues a chart, which is basically from the FBI, \nwhich shows when juvenile crime is committed. One does not need a \ndegree in chart reading to see what is happening. At 3 o'clock the \ncrime rate goes up, and it does not go down until the parents start \ncoming home from work. We know it is very important in that period of \ntime to look at ways to keep our kids out of trouble. One proven way is \nafterschool programs.\n  Right now, we do have afterschool programs funded by the Federal \nGovernment, but we are falling short. Out of the 2,000 school districts \nthat applied for afterschool Federal assistance, only 287 applications \nwere awarded grants because of the lack of funds.\n  President Clinton understood this. In his budget, he asked us to \nauthorize $600 million. That is what my amendment does. It authorizes \n$600 million. It allows us to accommodate 1.1 million children, many of \nwhom are waiting on line to get into afterschool programs. These are \nmentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, drug-\nalcohol prevention programs, et cetera.\n  The American people understand the importance of afterschool \nprograms. I want my colleagues to see this. Senator Lautenberg said 89 \npercent of the people supported closing the gun show loophole. Mr. \nPresident, 92 percent of the people favor afterschool programs. We have \na chance to do what the American people want us to do.\n  Law enforcement supports our afterschool program, as do over 450 \npolice chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors. It is important to look at \nthis list because they are from all over the country.\n  Let's see what the Police Activities League says about afterschool \nprograms. In a letter of endorsement, they write:\n\n       Afterschool youth development programs, like those proposed \n     in your amendment, have been shown to cut juvenile crime \n     immediately, sometimes by 40 to 75 percent.\n\n  I need to say this again. Law enforcement is telling us that \nafterschool programs cut violent crime by children down by 40 to 75 \npercent. Name one other thing we have in this bill that can have such a \ndramatic impact immediately on our children.\n  I saw an interesting letter to the editor in today's Los Angeles \nTimes. It is from the Republican mayor of that city, Richard Riordan. \nHe says:\n\n       Studies have shown that LA's best--\n\n  Which is their afterschool program--\n\n     students enjoy school more, show improvement in their grades \n     and feel safe. The kids do better at school. They do better \n     in all the various schools across this Nation, because \n     they have afterschool.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-four seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say a few words.\n  I must object to the amendment of the Senator from California. I \nappreciate the necessity of afterschool programs. I am aware that the \n21st Century Learning Centers program supports several efforts in my \nhome State of Utah.\n  The Senator's amendment, however, increases the program's \nauthorization from $20 million annually to $600 million annually. That \nadds up to $3 billion over 5 years. The entire underlying bill, which \nwe have been working on for 2 years, only authorizes a little over $1 \nbillion in spending a year--our whole bill.\n  Again, I express my concerns with attempting to solve a problem by \nsimply throwing more money at it. This amendment attempts to throw $3 \nbillion at a problem our underlying bill will solve because it is \neffectively written and we know what to do with the money. Our \nunderlying bill will solve many of the problems this amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from California addresses, without spending such \nan inordinate amount or settled amount on a single program.\n  Finally, the Labor Committee is undertaking reauthorization of the \nESEA this year. Let that committee do its job in a thoughtful and \nreasonable way. That would be the place for the distinguished Senator \nto make her case when that comes up, both in the Labor Committee and on \nthe floor.\n  I yield such time as he may need to the distinguished chairman of the \nLabor Committee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nI agree very strongly with Senator Boxer's goal of increasing the \navailability of positive, engaging activities for school-aged children \nand youth during the nonschool hours. This is a very important issue \nthat cannot, and should not, be decided within the context of a floor \namendment on the juvenile justice legislation.\n  Even without this year's Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization, I would have reservations about this amendment. But we \ndo have the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization in \nprogress, and that is the time when this amendment, or something \nsimilar to it, ought to be considered.\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\n  As the author of the original 21st Century Community Learning Centers \nAct, I have an enormous interest in any changes to this legislation, \nmuch less changes as dramatic as those proposed in this amendment.\n  When Congressman Steve Gunderson and I drafted the 21st Century \nLearning Centers legislation, our purpose was to promote the broader \nuse of school facilities, equipment, and resources. Our largest \ninvestment in education is for buildings and equipment, and in most \ncommunities these resources are closed more than they are open.\n  By encouraging schools to share their facilities, equipment, and \nother resources to meet the broader needs of the community, these \ncenters can expand educational and social service opportunities for \neveryone in the community.\n  Until 2 years ago, the Clinton administration failed to support the \n21st Century Community Learning Centers, even to the point of \nrepeatedly requesting that funds for the program appropriated by \nCongress be rescinded.\n  Then, last year, the administration, through the competitive grants \nprocess, substantially changed the focus and indeed, the very nature, \nof the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. Overnight, this \ninitiative to expand the use of existing facilities became an \nafterschool program, almost to the exclusion of the multi-purpose \ncommunity centers which were envisioned when I wrote the legislation.\n  This dramatic change in direction for the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers program raises questions which must be answered before \nwe can consider such a huge expansion of the program. We will be doing \nthat during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, which is now being considered in the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions. We need to address questions \nsuch as: Can the legislation still serve the purposes for which it was \noriginally intended, with the current, overwhelming focus on providing \nafterschool programs? If it is to be an afterschool program, are there \nchanges needed in the legislation to make it more effective?\n  If this program is to serve primarily as an afterschool program, \nwhere do community organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, \nYMCAs, fit in? Public schools currently provide less than one-third of \nthe afterschool care, with other community groups providing most of the \ncare.\n  The current grant program clearly demonstrates that schools are, by \nand large, failing to coordinate their afterschool services with those \nof other care providers in the community. And the Boxer amendment does \nnothing but perpetuate that situation. The amendment by Senator Boxer \nproposes changes that will eviscerate the act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time in opposition to the amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the 1992 Carnegie Corporation report, ``A \nMatter of Time,'' called for a major national investment in after-\nschool programs for youth. It said, ``Risk can be transformed into \nopportunity for our youth by turning their non-school hours into the \ntime of their lives.''\n  But, we have not done enough to give children the kind of \nopportunities they need after school. Just ask children if this is \ntrue.\n  Amy, age 14, said ``Sometimes there are so many things you can't do. \nI can't have company or leave the house. If I talk on the phone, I \ncan't let anyone know I'm here alone. But I really think they've \nfigured it out, you know.''\n  Cindy, age 16, said, ``We need someone to listen to us--really take \nit in. I don't have anybody to talk to, so when I have a problem \ninside, I just have to deal with it myself. I wish there would be more \nadults that ask questions because that shows that they care and want to \nknow more.''\n  Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are \nleft home alone after school. Children unsupervised are more likely to \nbe involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of \nbehavior.\n  We also know that juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours \nbetween 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. A recent study of gang crimes by juvenviles \nin Orange County, California, shows that 60 percent of all juvenile \ngang crimes occur on school days and peak immediately after school \ndismissal.\n  We need to do all we can to encourage communities to develop \nactivities that will engage children and keep them off the streets, \naway from drugs, and out of trouble.\n  Crime survivors, law enforcement representatives, and prosecutors \nhave joined together in calling for a substantial federal investment in \nafter-school activities. Over 450 of the nation's leading police \nchiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, and leaders of local fraternal orders of \npolice, which represent over 360,000 police officers, have called upon \npublic officials to provide more after-school programs for school-age \nchildren.\n  Clearly, financial assistance is needed for such activities in states \nacross the country. Too often, parents cannot afford the thousands of \ndollars a year required to pay for after-school care, if it exists at \nall. In Massachusetts, 4,000 eligible children are on waiting lists for \nafter-school care, and tens of thousands more have parents who have \ngiven up on getting help. Nationwide, half a million eligible children \nare on waiting lists for federal child care subsidies. The need for \nincreased opportunities is obvious and this amendment helps to meet it.\n  Senator Boxer's plan will triple the funds for the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Center initative so that more than 1 million \nchildren each year will have access to safe and constructive after-\nschool activities. It also strengthens the current program by including \nmentoring, academic assistance, and anti-drug, anti-alcohol, and anti-\ngang activities as allowable uses of the funds.\n  Additional federal support is essential for communities across the \ncountry. This year, the initiative was funded at $200 million. Over \n2,000 applicants from across the country submitted proposals to the \nU.S. Department of Education for that assistance--but only 184 new \ngrants could be funded. We must do more to meet the high demand for \nafter-school programs across the country.\n  Communities are working hard to provide these after-school activities \nfor children--but they can't do it alone. They want Uncle Sam to be a \nstrong partner in the effort.\n  Boston's 2:00-to-6:00 After-School Initiative was created in 1998 to \nexpand and enhance quality after-school programs across the city. It \nhas already succeeded in increasing the number of school-based after-\nschool programs by nearly 50 percent. A total of 43 programs now serve \nover 2,000 students. This year, Mayor Menino has pledged to open 20 \nmore school-based programs. Boston and communities like it throughout \nthe country deserve more assistance in meeting these needs.\n  Federal support under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \nprogram is helping to meet these needs. Last year, Boston received \n$305,000 to help the Lewis Middle School and the Tobin Community Middle \nSchool in Roxbury, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in \nDorchester to create after-school programs for children.\n  Springfield received $315,000 to expand their ``Time Out for \nCommunities'' initiative that is helping the Springfield Public Schools \nto provide after-school programs to 15,000 students, in conjunction \nwith the Springfield Libraries and Museums, the YMCA, Springfield \nCollege, and other organizations in the community.\n  Worcester received $3.6 million over 3 years to support ten community \ncenters that will serve 4,000 students and 5,000 community members. The \nWorcester after-school program, called the ``Community Learning Centers \nfor Worcester's Children of Promise,'' will provide a wide range of \nservices, including academic support to help students meet state \nacademic standards; drug and violence prevention programs; information \non family health; day care for school-age children; tutoring and \nmentoring; access to technology for students and their families; summer \nactivities; and adult education.\n  But much more needs to be done in Massachusetts and across the \ncountry, if we are going to keep children safe and help them succeed in \nschool.\n  We know that after-school programs work. In Waco, Texas, students \nparticipating in the Lighted Schools program\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\nhave demonstrated improvement in school attendance and decreases in \njuvenile delinquent behavior over the course of the school year. \nJuvenile crimes have dropped citywide by approximately 10 percent since \nthe program began.\n  The Baltimore City Police Department saw a 44 percent drop in the \nrisk of children becoming victims of crime after opening an after-\nschool program in a high-crime area. A study of the Goodnow Police \nAthletic League center in Northeast Baltimore found that juvenile \narrests dropped by 10 percent, the number of armed robberies dropped \nfrom 14 to 7, assaults with handguns were eliminated, and other \nassaults decreased from 32 to 20 from 1995 to 1998.\n  In addition to improved youth behavior and safety, quality after-\nschool programs also lead to better academic achievement by students. \nAt the Beech Street School in Manchester, New Hampshire, the after-\nschool program has improved reading and math scores of students. In \nreading, the percentage of students scoring at or above the basic level \nincreased from 4 percent in 1994 to one-third in 1997. In math, the \npercentage of students scoring at the basic level increased from 29 \npercent to 60 percent. In addition, Manchester saved an estimated \n$73,000 over three years because students participating in the after-\nschool program avoided being retained in grade or being placed in \nspecial education.\n\n  One student in the Manchester program said, ``I used to hate math. It \nwas stupid. But when we started using geometry and trigonometry to \nmeasure the trees and collect our data, I got pretty excited. Now I'm \ntrying harder in school.''\n  In Georgia, over 70 percent of students, parents, and teachers agreed \nthat children received helpful tutoring through The 3:00 Project, a \nstatewide network of after-school programs. Over 60 percent of \nstudents, parents, and teachers agreed that children completed more of \ntheir homework and the homework was better prepared because of their \nparticipation in the program.\n  One 7th-grade student from Georgia said, ``I just used to hang out \nafter-school before coming to The 3:00 Project. Now I have something to \ndo and my school work has improved!''\n  In 1996, over half of the students who attended Chicago's summer \nprogram raised their test scores enough to proceed in high school.\n  As Mayor Daley of Chicago said, ``Instead of locking youth up, we \nneed to unlock their potential. We need to bring them back to their \ncommunity and provide the guidance and support they need.''\n  We should do all we can to improve and expand after-school \nopportunities--the nation's children deserve no less.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an \nadditional minute to the 44 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends.\n  Frankly, I am kind of surprised to see my friends on the Republican \nside disagree so strongly with law enforcement in this country. There \nis a reason we put this on the juvenile justice bill. It is because we \nknow that kids get into trouble after school. You do not need a degree \nin criminology, psychology, or any other ``ology'' to understand that \nis what is happening.\n  When I held crime meetings, town meetings, all throughout the State \nof California, the one thing I can tell you the law enforcement people \ntold me--and that is why the National Sheriffs Association supports our \namendment--Senator, when we get them, it is too late. When we get them, \nit is too late. Prevent the crime first.\n  It goes to the next chart.\n  Three o'clock, that is when it happens, folks. They get out of \nschool; they have no place to go; they get in trouble. I am stunned to \nsee the Senator from Vermont once again opposing this. This isn't a new \nprogram; it is an expansion of the program that was started by \nPresident Clinton. And guess what, I say to my friend. They can only \nfund a minuscule proportion of the applications from the school \ndistricts coming from all over the country.\n  What we would do in this amendment is allow those applications to be \nfunded. This is nothing new. This is nothing extraordinary. It is \nexpanding this program--the same program --to meet the incredible need.\n  I agree with law enforcement on this one: Keep our kids busy and \nhappy after school. We will see that crime rate go down.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let's vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 364\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, am I correct, the first vote is the \nWellstone amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the first amendment that will be voted \non.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays, and I request at the same time that the following \ntwo votes be 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can I ask one question: Do we have a minute each, or \nare we not doing that?\n  Mr. HATCH. We have been debating all night. We will be glad to have 2 \nminutes before each amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I just wanted to know. I prefer to have 1 minute to \nsummarize.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me defer my motion to table and go for 2 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This amendment simply maintains the current core \nprotections in current law. It requires States to study and assess the \nproblem of disproportionate minority confinement. It does not require \nquotas. It is not unconstitutional. It does not require States and \nlocalities to release those in confinement.\n  This amendment is about fairness. It is about equal justice under the \nlaw. This is a civil rights vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we have more than adequately answered the \narguments made by the distinguished presenter of this amendment. We \nyield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first vote be 15 \nminutes and that the succeeding two votes be 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 364.

On the McConnell amendment, \nthere is 1 minute on each side.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment we are about to vote on \nis very narrowly drafted to add one additional factor to those Federal \nagencies that have subjective standards they apply prior to allowing \nthe shooting of a movie on Federal property.\n  The subject of the amendment is the making of movies on Federal \nproperty and with federal assistance. There are at least three federal \nentities--the Defense Department, NASA, and the Coast Guard--that \ncurrently have quite subjective standards which they apply to the movie \nindustry when asked for permission to make a movie on Federal property \nor with their cooperation and assistance.\n  All this amendment does is add one more factor--one, wanton and \ngratuitous violence--to those standards. Bear in mind this amendment \nhas no first amendment implications at all. Any movie company that \nwants to make a movie and do anything and say anything and depict \nanything they want to can continue to do that. They just won't do it on \nFederal property.\n  This is a mild amendment that sends a message to Hollywood.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the problem with this, of course, is that \nnobody, when they start out on a movie, knows exactly what form their \nmovie is going to be in in the end. Basically what you are saying is \nsomebody in the Department of Agriculture--for example, if you want to \ndo something on the eastern forest or have eastern forest in the \nbackground--some bureaucrat in the Department of Agriculture has to \ndetermine, before you even start filming the movie, what the final \nedited copy of the movie will look like at the end before the decision \ncan be made. That person at the Department of Agriculture might do \ndairy price supports one day and Block Buster Steven Spielberg movies \nthe next day.\n  I understand what my friend from Kentucky wants to do. But the best \nway to censor violence in movies is don't go to violent movies. But \ndon't ask somebody at the Department of the Interior who does fishing \npermits, for example, to determine whether a national forest can be \nused as a background somewhere in a movie that has not yet been made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. This will be a 10-minute vote. On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 131 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cleland\n     Daschle\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n  The amendment (No. 365) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The next amendment is the Boxer amendment. \nThere are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, all we do in this amendment is authorize \nthe amount of money we need to fill the need of all those local school \ndistricts which have applied for afterschool programs. We know that at \n3 o'clock--this is from the FBI--the crime rate goes up and it does not \ngo down until the parents come home from work. We know that afterschool \nprograms will prevent crime.\n  We also know the reason all these various law enforcement agencies \nsupport this is that this is the way to stop crime from happening in \nthe first place.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we hope to cut down juvenile crime. What \nbetter way to do it than to listen to law enforcement, including the \nPolice Athletic Leagues and the National Sheriffs Association, and so \nmany police chiefs who tell us: Senators, prevention is the name of the \ngame. Once the kids get into the system, we cannot turn them around.\n  If we will vote for this, we will authorize the appropriate amount of \nmoney the local school districts are telling us meets the needs of 1.2 \nmillion children. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This adds $3 billion to programs we already covered in our \nprevention programs and does it in a way that has more Federal \nintrusion.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I would \nlike to propound. First, obviously, we have had the last vote for the \nnight. I thank the managers of the bill for their diligent efforts. I \nthank Senator Reid for his efforts, and Senator Ashcroft, and Senator \nFrist, and Senator Harkin, and Senator Lautenberg, who\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nhave all been willing to at least make concessions so that we can make \nprogress. Senator Daschle and I appreciate that. The consent we will \nask would provide for two amendments to be brought up in the morning, \nand it would be the Gordon Smith/Jeffords amendment, followed by the \nLautenberg amendment, with a vote on both of those at 10:30. The \npending business is still the Harkin amendment, but we would intend at \nthat time to go to the supplemental bill. We are going to try to get a \n2-hour time agreement on that. When that is over, we will be back where \nwe stood with the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. That summarizes the \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the \nGordon Smith/Jeffords amendment there be 60 minutes for debate, equally \ndivided in the usual form on the Gordon Smith amendment and amendment \nNo. 362, the Lautenberg amendment, to run concurrently beginning at \n9:30 a.m. Thursday, and all other provisions of the consent agreement \nof May 14 remain in place and the amendment be laid down tonight prior \nto the close of Senate business.\n  I further ask consent that the vote occur on the Gordon Smith-\nJeffords amendment just prior to the vote on amendment 362, under the \nsame time restraints and provisions as provided above.\n  I further ask that the Senate resume amendment No. 355 immediately \nfollowing the disposition of amendment No. 362.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object. That is with the understanding that the Senator from Iowa \nis represented under the same circumstances as when we broke off, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. He still would have priority recognition under the \nagreement and under the procedures anyway, but also under the agreement \nthat was included. Both sides of this issue don't want to lose their \npositions. But this will allow us to do these two amendments and to do \nthe supplemental, and then that will be the pending issue. We know we \nhave to find a way to get to a conclusion.\n  I want to emphasize now that we will do the supplemental after those \nfirst 2 votes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. Mr. Leader, would it be \npossible for the unanimous consent request to be amended to reflect \nthat 15 minutes of the time on the Smith amendment be controlled by \nSenator Schumer, that he take 5 minutes of the 15 minutes, and then the \nremaining 10 minutes go to Senator Lautenberg?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think I got lost. Is it just a division of how the time \nwould go on your side?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. One of our Members wanted to control 15 minutes. He is \ngoing to use 5 minutes of it and give the rest to Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I amend that UC request to that effect, \nbased on the assurance of the intent given by the distinguished \nDemocratic whip. If it turns out that it is somehow or another not \nfair, we will revisit that tomorrow. I change the UC to include that \nrequest.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to \nobject, I want to indicate that this is about the fourth time we have \ndisplaced this amendment, which I have been working on in conjunction \nwith Senator Frist. This amendment has been the pending business since \nlast Friday. This is not a novel amendment.\n  I just want to indicate that I intend to get a vote on this \namendment. Votes have been taken on amendments on both sides. The right \nway to resolve any dispute on this amendment is to vote on it. I have \nbeen ready to vote on this amendment for quite some time. I think \neveryone on both sides of the aisle knows what the amendment is about.\n  I would just indicate that when this amendment comes back up I will \npersist in expecting the same courtesy that this body has accorded all \nother amendments to be accorded to this amendment, and I will work hard \nto make sure we have an opportunity to vote on it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I again express my appreciation to Senator \nAshcroft for his willingness to agree to this unanimous consent \ntonight. He is right. He, Senator Frist, and Senator Harkin have agreed \nto be put it aside. I think it will be the fourth time we wouldn't have \nbeen able to get this agreement without their cooperation. I understand \ntheir determination on both sides of the issue. I appreciate the fact \nthey were willing to agree to this.\n  Did we get an agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n                  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 366\n\n       (Purpose: To reverse provisions relating to pawn and other \n     gun transactions)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenators Smith of Oregon and Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), for Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon, and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 366.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Con. \nRes. 19, a resolution condemning growing Russian anti-Semitism.\n  Russian anti-Semitism, is nothing new in the world. Throughout \nRussian history, Jews have faced attacks in the form of pogroms, forced \nmilitary duty for terms of up to 25 years, and a general pattern of \npersecution and discrimination. With the end of the Soviet Union and \nthe rise of democracy in Russia, we thought these kinds of acts were a \npart of the past. Unfortunately, they are not.\n  On Saturday, May 1, there were two bomb blasts at two Moscow \nsynagogues, one at Moscow's main Choral Synagogue. There was light \ndamage at both sites, yet the bombings on the Sabbath and on May 1, \n``May Day'' was a scary development.\n  These violent acts, combined with the various statements issued by \nCommunist members of the Russian Duma can only serve to stir up \nincreased violence. This is extremely unfortunate.\n  There is no place for violence and hatred in our society. We in \nCongress and the rest of the world must actively condemn this violence \nand hatred before it gets out of hand, as has been the case all too \nmany times in this century. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5584-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5584-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:58 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n1141) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5584-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5584-S5586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-3062.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to waive the 24-\nmonth waiting period for medicare coverage of individuals with \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and to provide medicare coverage \nof drugs and biologicals used for the treatment of ALS or for the \nalleviation of symptoms relating to ALS; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) TREATMENT AND ASSISTANCE ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will improve the lives of 30,000 Americans, 850 of whom live in my \nState of New Jersey, who are stricken with Amyotrophic Lateral \nSclerosis (ALS).\n  Many of us know Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as the disease \nthat struck down the famed Yankees 1st baseman, Lou Gehrig, yet, few of \nus are aware of the tragic effects ALS has on its victims. Fewer still \nare aware of the inherent flaws in the Medicare program which further \ncompound the suffering of those with ALS.\n  Despite the short life expectancy of three to five years, ALS patents \nmust endure a two year waiting period in order to receive Medicare \nservices. Forcing ALS patients to wait until the final months of their \nillness defies common sense and human decency. In fact, as a result of \nthe Medicare waiting period, approximately 17,000 ALS patients remain \nineligible for Medicare services right now, regardless of the severity \nof their condition.\n  My bill, the ALS Treatment, and Assistance Act waives the 24-month \nMedicare waiting period for ALS patients. A similar waiver is granted \nfor victims of end-stage renal disease due to the rapid onset of \nsymptoms. The immediacy of symptoms in ALS patients and extremely short \nlife expectancy illustrate the need to extend the waiver for ALS. In \naddition, many ALS victims have had productive lives and will have paid \ninto the Social Security system well before the onset of ALS.\n  The legislation also requires Medicare to provide coverage for all \nFDA-approved drugs that treat ALS. While Medicare typically does not \nprovide coverage for prescription drug therapies, over the past few \nyears, exceptions have been granted to provide drug coverage to treat \nosteoporosis and certain types of cancer. Due to the rapid onset of \nsymptoms and the short life expectancy of ALS patients, the need for \nanother exception is clear. In addition, expanding Medicare coverage \nfor ALS therapies will stimulate further research.\n  ALS is a disease that strikes at every community, with the potential \nfor striking every American. No one is immune, and everyone is \nvulnerable. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Wellstone \nin introducing legislation that represents a first real step toward \nimproving the quality of life for people with ALS while bringing us \nmuch closer to finding a cause and a cure.\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Treatment and \n     Assistance Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as \n     Lou Gehrig's Disease, is a progressive neuromuscular disease \n     characterized by a degeneration of the nerve cells of the \n     brain and spinal cord leading to the wasting of muscles, \n     paralysis, and eventual death.\n       (2) Approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States \n     are afflicted with ALS at any time, with approximately 5,000 \n     new cases appearing each year.\n       (3) ALS usually strikes individuals who are 50 years of age \n     or older.\n       (4) The life expectancy of an individual with ALS is 3 to 5 \n     years from the time of diagnosis.\n       (5) There is no known cure or cause for ALS.\n       (6) Aggressive treatment of the symptoms of ALS can extend \n     the lives of those with the disease. Recent advances in ALS \n     research have produced promising leads, many related to \n     shared disease processes that appear to operate in many \n     neurodegenerative diseases.\n       (c) Purposes.--It is the purposes of this Act--\n       (1) to assist individuals suffering from ALS by waiving the \n     24-month waiting period for medicare eligibility on the basis \n     of disability for ALS patients; and\n       (2) to provide medicare coverage of drugs and biologicals \n     used for the treatment of ALS or for the alleviation of \n     symptoms relating to ALS.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide a \ncost-of-living adjustment in rates of compensation paid to veterans \nwith service-connected disabilities, to enhance programs providing \nhealth care, education, and other benefits for veterans, to authorize \nmajor medical facility projects, to reform eligibility for burial in \nArlington National Cemetery, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                     veterans benefits act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I have introduced a major piece of \nveterans legislation, the proposed Veterans Benefits Act of 1999. This \nbill is a so-called omnibus measure which will serve as the basis, and \nthe platform, for much of the legislative work to be accomplished this \nyear by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  In the past, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has considered bills \non a more piecemeal basis than is reflected in the larger bill that I \nhave introduced today.\n  In times past, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has come to the \nSenate floor with numerous, separate bills to address the various \nmatters that the committee typically faces: annual cost-of-living \nadjustments, reauthorizations of ``sunsetting'' programs and\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nauthorities, medical care reforms, non-medical benefits programs \nimprovements, and the like. With the bill I have introduced today, I \npropose that such matters be folded into a single bill. That bill, \nthen, will be the central focus of a major hearing.\n  At that hearing, the committee will have the opportunity to hear the \nviews of the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and the Army; other senior \nVA officials, including the VA Under Secretaries who are responsible \nfor VA's major operating entities; the major veterans service \norganizations (The American Legion, the VFW, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS); unions \nrepresenting the rank and file of VA employees; and, finally, \nassociations representing VA's professional cadre of physicians, \ndentists, and nurses.\n  By bringing all of the major issues to the fore at one time, and by \nbringing all of the interested parties together into one room at one \ntime, I believe that the committee will be better positioned to advance \nthis year's legislative agenda in an organized and systematic manner. \nSuch an approach will not necessarily ease the work of the committee, \nor this body. It will, however, facilitate the placing of issues and \ninitiatives into some order of priority.\n  The need to recognize priorities has characterized the committee's \napproach to its work this year. During the first half of this year, the \ncommittee has devoted its attention almost entirely on the proposed \nfiscal year 2000 budget. As this body recognized when it ordered an \nincrease in spending caps on veterans account spending in the fiscal \nyear 2000 budget resolution, the Administration's proposal to keep the \nVA's health care budget flat for the fourth straight year was clearly \nunacceptable. Congress ordered an increase of approximately 10 percent \nin that budget--an action that I, and the committee's ranking minority \nmember, Senator Jay Rockefeller, were urging as early as last fall. We \nnow must proceed through the appropriations process--a process that the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and the veterans service organizations, \nwill watch very closely.\n  Having heretofore focused principally on the budget, the committee \nwill now turn to its authorizing business. The bill I introduced today \nopens, at title I, with the committee's first priority: the granting of \ncost-of-living adjustments to the cash benefits paid monthly by VA in \nthe form of compensation to the 2.3 million veterans who have suffered \nservice-connected disabilities, and benefits for 320,000 surviving \nspouses and children of veterans who have died in military service or \ndue to service-related injuries and illnesses. Those who are disabled \ndue to service rely on these benefits. They surely merit cost-of-living \nadjustments.\n\n  My bill, secondly, proposes to increase by 13.6% the most valuable \n``readjustment'' benefit that is enjoyed--and earned--by the Nation's \nyoung veterans: their Montgomery GI bill educational assistance \nbenefits. The ``blue ribbon'' Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans \nTransition Assistance made a number of recommendations on this point. \nMost notably, it cited the fact that, unlike times past, veterans' \neducational assistance benefits no longer come close to affording the \nveteran an opportunity to return to school on a full time basis after \nservice. The Commission has recommended that, for new enlistees, VA pay \nfull tuition benefits and, in addition, pay an allowance for books and \nfees and, finally, a monthly living stipend. The committee will \nconsider this proposal further. In the meantime, however, it is \nappropriate for the committee to address what it might do to make \nhigher education and other training opportunities available to persons \nwho are in the service today. My bill would increase their benefits in \nrecognition of the increased costs of education.\n  In addition, this bill would make needed changes in statutory \nauthorities under which VA health care is provided. At the outset, I \nnote that the single largest unmet medical need faced by the World War \nII/Korea generation of veterans is quality long-term care. In addition \nto providing hospital care and, increasingly, outpatient-based clinical \ncare, VA provides some nursing home care and other types of long term \ncare. But VA hardly scratches the surface of demand for such care. The \nsolution, of course, is funding--funding that has been surely \ndeficient.\n  VA funding problems must be addressed by the Appropriate Committee, a \ncommittee on which I am proud to serve. However, the authorizing \ncommittee, which I am proud to chair, has its role to play too. The \nauthorizing committee can free VA from unnecessary legal strictures \nwhich impede its efficient delivery of care. Many such impediments were \neliminated by recent ``eligibility reform'' legislation. Some, however, \nremain.\n  For example, VA is now authorized to provide adult day health care \nservices, services which help the veteran--and the taxpayer--by keeping \npotential patients out of hospitals and nursing homes. It can do so, \nhowever, only if the veteran in question was, first, a hospital or \nnursing home patient. Thus, VA caregivers have an incentive to \nhospitalize people so that they will be authorized to provide the type \nof care that will allow the patient to avoid hospitalization. To my way \nof thinking, this makes no sense.\n  Similarly, VA is authorized to provide ``respite care,'' that is, \nshort term care which frees the day-to-day care giver, typically an \naging spouse, to attend to his or her needs. But VA can do so only \nwithin the four walls of a VA medical facility. Often, it is more \neffieient--and surely it is more convenient from the patient's and \nspouse's standpoint--for a respite care provider to go to the home of \nthe patient, as opposed to requiring the patient to be brought into the \nhospital or long term care center. But VA is precluded by statute from \nproviding respite care in the veteran's home, even when it is clearly \nin VA's and the patient's interests for it to do so. This, too, makes \nno sense to me. The bill I have introduced today would clear away these \ntwo impediments to the efficient delivery of VA care. Further, it would \nreauthorize current programs which have proved their worth.\n  In the veterans benefits arena, one sensitive matter is now ripe for \naction. It is time, I think, for clear standards to be established for \neligibility for burial in Arlington National Cemetery. And they should \nbe set by Congress.\n  Remarkably, standards governing eligibility for burial in Arlington \nhave never been put into place by statute. Rather, they are purely a \nproduct of administrative fiat. Indeed, in one of the most highly \nsensitive areas--the granting of ``waivers'' to allow the burial of \ndistinguished persons who are not otherwise eligible for burial in \nArlington--there has never even been a formal rulemaking to guide \ncemetery officials. Rather, the granting of waivers has evolved on a \npurely customary, and ad hoc, basis.\n  Dealing with waiver requests on an ad hoc basis gives rise, at best, \nto suspicion of improper influence. At worst, if fans fears of outright \nabuse of power. Now, I will not rehash a recent case where it was \nalleged--I think inaccurately--that Arlington burial rights were \n``sold'' to a political contributor. Suffice it to say, however, that \nwhen it comes to the most sacred of grounds, Arlington National \nCemetery, there can be no suggestion whatsoever of improper influence. \nSurely, there are some honors that no amount of money or level of \ninfluence can buy. Perpetual rest in Arlington is clearly one of those \nhonors.\n  Mr. President, I could go on at considerable length, but many \nprovisions of this bill speak for themselves. As I have noted, the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs has not yet had hearings on these \nspecific legislative proposals. Accordingly, they are still works in \nprogress. But they are works in progress that I intend to advance \nsooner rather than later, by this summer at the latest. The Nation's \nveterans deserve that kind of attention, and they are getting it from \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to dedicate the new Amtrak station in New York, New \nYork, to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to name \nthe new train station at the James A. Farley Post Office Building, \nwhich sits across the street from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, \nafter my esteemed colleague and tireless champion of this project, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  It is an especially fitting tribute to offer this bill today as \nPresident Bill Clinton, Governor George Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, \nTransportation Secretary Rodney Slater, Postmaster General William \nHenderson and Senator Moynihan all gathered this morning at the Farley \nBuilding to officially unveil the magnificent new station plan, \ndesigned by the celebrated architect David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & \nMerrill. I am deeply sorry that I could not attend that event, which I \nunderstand was a success in every way, but other matters called me here \nto the floor.\n  First, let me praise the vision and determination of my dear friend, \nthe senior Senator from New York. In 1963, long before he was a Senator \nand, in fact, when I was 12 years old Pat Moynihan was one of a group \nof prescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our City's \nspectacular Pennsylvania Station--a glorious public building designed \nby the nation's premier architectural firm of the time, McKim, Mead & \nWhite.\n  It was Pat Moynihan who recognized years ago that across the street \nfrom what is now a sad basement terminal that functions--barely--as New \nYork City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office \nBuilding, built by the same architects in much the same grand design as \nthe old Penn Station. Pat Moynihan recognized that since the very same \nrailroad tracks that run under the current Penn Station also run \nbeneath the Farley Building, we could use the Farley Building to once \nagain create a train station worthy of our great city. He then \ntirelessly did the impossible--persuaded New York City, New York State, \nthe U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. Department of Transportation, Amtrak, \nCongressional Appropriators, and the President himself, to commit to \nmaking this project succeed. No mean feat, I assure you. In a day, \nparticularly in our city, when grand public works often get bugged down \nin fighting and court suits, it is a tribute to Senator Moynihan that \nnot only did he have the vision to see the station, but he also had the \nmuscle and legislative skill to see it through.\n  This past Sunday, Herbert Muschamp, the noted New York Times \narchitecture critic praised Childs' design, which brilliantly fuses the \nclassical elements of the Farley Building with a dramatic, light-filled \nconcourse and a spectacular new ticketing area. Muschamp adds: ``In an \nera better known for the decrepitude of its infrastructure than for \ninspiring new visions of the city's future, the plan comes as proof \nthat New York can still undertake major public works. This is the most \nimportant transportation project undertaken in New York City in several \ngenerations.'' We have Pat Moynihan to thank.\n  That Senator Moynihan would be responsible for the success of this \nproject is no surprise. His passion for and dedication to public \narchitecture is well known and dates back to his days as a young aide \nto President Kennedy, who, right before his death, tasked Moynihan with \nrestoring Pennsylvania Avenue here in Washington.\n  Moynihan succeeded brilliantly in his task, with the final piece of \nPennsylvania Avenue--the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade \nCenter--unveiled one year ago and instantly hailed as one of the best \nnew buildings to grace the Capital. Moynihan has another renowned \nFederal building to his credit--the Thurgood Marshall Judiciary \nBuilding, which provides such a beautiful companion to Union Station \nand the Old Post Office.\n  In New York City, Moynihan has been an equally tireless architectural \nchampion, responsible for the restoration of the spectacular Beaux-Arts \nCustom House at Bowling Green and for the construction of a grand new \nFederal Courthouse at Foley Square. Moynihan is beloved in Buffalo for \nreawakening that city's appreciation for its architectural heritage, \nwhich includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and the Prudential Building, \none of the best-known early American skyscrapers by the architect Louis \nSullivan--a building which Moynihan helped restore and then chose as \nhis Buffalo office. When he first came to Buffalo he told me that \nnowhere else in America had the three greatest American architects of \nthe 20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright, Henry Richardson and Louis \nSullivan, had buildings standing near one another.\n\n  He has also spurred a popular movement in Buffalo to build a new \nsignature Peace Bridge.\n  So my colleagues, it is altogether fitting and appropriate that this \nnew Penn Station be named in honor of our distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York, someone who is my friend and who I wish was staying in \nthe Senate for a longer period of time--someone I will dearly miss. It \nis an honor to stand here and offer this tribute to such an uncommon \nman, because Senator Moynihan himself is indeed a national treasure.\n  Truly, the epitaph given to Sir Christopher Wren, designer of St. \nPaul's Cathedral in London, is fitting for Senator Moynihan. If my \ncolleagues will pardon my pronunciation, for my Latin isn't that good: \n``Si Monumentum Requiris Circumspice,'' ``If you would see the man's \nmonument, look around.\n  I join my fellow New Yorkers in anxiously awaiting the day when we \narrive at the glorious Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN STATION.\n\n       The Amtrak station to be constructed in the James A. Farley \n     Post Office Building in New York, New York, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Amtrak station \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nNew York. I did not hear a word I disagreed with. I only wish to hear \nit amplified throughout the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield briefly that I might \ncompliment him?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am delighted to yield to my distinguished senior \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would he mind if I asked to be a cosponsor of this \nresolution?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be honored and delighted, as I know Senator \nMoynihan will be.\n  Mr. BYRD. Because Senator Moynihan is truly a man of eloquence and \nwit and vision and grace. We are going to miss him. He has been a \npowerful influence in this Senate. He has served in the executive \nbranch, served with brilliance and with honor. And, like Christopher \nWren--``if you would see his monument, look about you''--Senator \nMoynihan leaves many monuments. Perhaps the greatest monument of all is \nthat mark he has left upon the hearts of his colleagues who will miss\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nhim and his powerful influence, his wisdom, his vision, when he has \nleft this Senate.\n  I congratulate the Senator on offering this resolution. I will be \nvery grateful if he will allow me to be a cosponsor. It is one of the \nleast things I can do to honor my colleague, one whom I love, one whom \nI revere, one whom I respect, and one who has shown himself to be a \nleader in this Senate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I be recognized to join in this \ntribute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to say to our fairly new \ncolleague from New York that he could not have picked an issue upon \nwhich he could get more solid agreement. One does not have to be a \nDemocrat or an easterner or have any special connection to respect and \nto so greatly appreciate the contributions made by Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan.\n  He had this capacity--I know, since we served together on the \nEnvironment Committee--not unlike, in many ways, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and that was to bring their respective knowledge to \na discussion or debate or to a hearing, that--I speak for myself--would \nmake me sit up and take notice. I felt transported from this white-\nhaired, wizened old face to a college student again and remembered how \nmuch I enjoyed some of the classes I attended where we had a professor, \nan instructor who conveyed the message in an interesting form, not just \nthe statistics or the parameters of the particular discussion.\n  So it is with Pat Moynihan. Any of us who have spent any time with \nPat have always been amazed at the abundance of knowledge he has, \nwhether we were talking about the New York State canal system or \nwhether we were talking about the highway system or the developments in \nthe Indian Ocean or you name the subject. No matter how impromptu or \nhow unexpected the discussion, Pat Moynihan always has the capacity to \ndiscuss the subject intelligently and deeply.\n  Any tribute that we give to this man is not fair compensation for \nthat which he has given this country and has given this body. His \nabundance of gifts to us are so profound that many years from now they \nwill still be talking about those of greatness who graced this Chamber \nand Pat Moynihan will be one of those without a doubt.\n  I am pleased to call him my friend. I hope since we live in such \nclose proximity, our representation of New York and New Jersey, that \nthere will be tributes and testimonies to his contribution. He is a \nself-effacing fellow. He does not like to hear a bunch of compliments, \nbut we are not going to let him get away with that now.\n  I commend my colleague, the junior Senator from New York, for his \nwisdom and his thought in bringing this to us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1079. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the deductibility of business meal expenses for individuals \nsubject to Federal hours of service; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, two years ago in the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax \npolicy of the Clinton Administration concerning business meal \ndeductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the \npercentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 \npercent down to 50 percent. The Administration marketed this as an \nattack on the ``three martini lunch,'' but the tax increase was in fact \na big blow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans \nwhose jobs require them to be stranded far from home.\n  Workers who are covered by federal ``hours of service'' regulations--\nlong-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance \nbus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no \nchoice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a \nnecessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton \nAdministration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. \nFor the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, \nthis tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot \nof money to these hard-working taxpayers.\n  Congress addressed this inequity in 1997, passing a provision that \nwould gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent \nfor these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Grassley, and I are introducing a bill that would \nimmediately restore the 80 percent deduction for truckers, flight \ncrews, and other workers limited by the federal ``hours of service'' \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASED DEDUCTIBILITY OF BUSINESS MEAL EXPENSES \n                   FOR INDIVIDUALS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LIMITATIONS \n                   ON HOURS OF SERVICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) of section 274(n) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to only 50 percent of \n     meal and entertainment expenses allowed as deduction) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) Special rule for individuals subject to federal hours \n     of service.--In the case of any expenses for food or \n     beverages consumed while away from home (within the meaning \n     of section 162(a)(2)) by an individual during, or incident \n     to, the period of duty subject to the hours of service \n     limitations of the Department of Transportation, paragraph \n     (1) shall be applied by substituting `80 percent' for `50 \n     percent'.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1080. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ngunrunning and provide mandatory minimum penalties for crimes related \nto gunrunning; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        gun kingpin penalty act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues \nfrom New York and Illinois, Senator Schumer and Senator Durbin, to \nintroduce the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1999. In introducing this \nbill, we hope that our colleagues will soon join us in sending a clear \nand strong signal to gunrunners--your actions will no longer be \ntolerated.\n  Mr. President, recent numbers gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms clearly demonstrate what many of us already knew \nall too well--several of our nation's highways have become pipelines \nfor merchants of death who deal in illegal firearms.\n  My own State of New Jersey is proud to have some of the toughest gun \ncontrol laws in the nation. But for far too long, the courageous \nefforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been \nweakened by out of state gunrunners who treat our State like their own \npersonal retail outlet.\n  We learned from the ATF data that in 1996, New Jersey exported fewer \nguns used in crimes, per capita, than any other state--less than one \ngun per 100,000 residents, or 75 total guns. Meanwhile, an incredible \nnumber of guns used to commit crimes in New Jersey last year came from \nout of state--944 guns were imported and used to commit crimes compared \nto only 75 exported--a net import of 869 illegal guns used to commit \ncrimes against the people of New Jersey.\n  This represents a one way street--guns come from states with lax gun \nlaws straight to states (like New Jersey) with strong laws. It is clear \nthat New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals little choice \nbut to import their guns from states with weak laws. We must act on a \nfederal level to send a clear message that this cannot continue and \nwill not be tolerated.\n  The Gun Kingpin Penalty Act would create a new federal gunrunning \noffense for any person who, within a twelve-month period, transports \nmore than 5 guns to another state with the intent of transferring all \nof the weapons to another person. The Act would establish mandatory \nminimum penalties for gunrunning as follows:\n  A mandatory 3 year minimum sentence for a first offense involving 5-\n50 guns; a mandatory 5 year minimum sentence for second offense \ninvolving 5-50 guns; and a mandatory 15 year minimum sentence for any \noffense involving more than 50 guns.\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\n  Additionally, the bill contains two ``blood on the hands'' \nprovisions, which will significantly increase penalties for a gunrunner \nwho transfers a gun subsequently used to seriously injure or kill \nanother person. A mandatory 10 year minimum sentence is required if one \nof the smuggled guns is used within 3 years to kill or seriously injure \nanother person. And a mandatory 25 year minimum sentence must be \nimposed if one of the smuggled guns is used within 3 years to kill or \nseriously injure another person and more than 50 guns were smuggled.\n  Finally, our bill adds numerous gunrunning crimes as RICO predicates, \nand authorizes 200 additional Treasury personnel to enforce the Act--\nCongress must provide law enforcement with the resources to enforce the \nlaws we pass.\n  The fight against gun violence is a long-term, many-staged process. \nWe succeeded in enacting the Brady bill and the ban on devastating \nassault weapons. And these laws have been effective: more than a \nquarter of a million prohibited individuals have already been denied a \nhandgun due to Brady background check--70% of these people were either \nfelons or domestic violence offenders.

A bill to amend section 842 of title 18, United States Code, \nrelating to explosive materials, to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   explosives protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on the morning of April 19, 1995, in \none horrible moment, an explosion devastated the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and took the lives of 168 \nAmericans.\n  Every year, thousands of people are killed or maimed because of the \nuse or misuse of illegal explosive devices, and millions of dollars in \nproperty is lost. Between 1991 and 1995, there were more than 14,000 \nactual and attempted criminal bombings. 326 people were killed and \nanother 2,970 injured in these incidents and more than $6 million in \nproperty damage resulted.\n  In recent years, the criminal use of explosives has moved in a new \ndirection, as is evidenced by the bombings of the World Trade Center in \nNew York and the Oklahoma City bombing. These two incidents took the \nlives of many innocent men, women, and children, left others \npermanently scarred, and caused great suffering for the families of the \nvictims--as well as all of America. These crimes were intended to tear \nthe very fabric of our society; instead, their tragic consequences \nserved to strengthen our resolve to stand firm against the insanity of \nterrorism and the criminal use of explosives.\n  In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, I was stunned--as were \nmany--to learn how few restrictions on the use and sale of explosives \nreally exist. I soon after introduced this legislation, the \n``Explosives Protection Act'' to take a first step towards protecting \nthe American people from those who would use explosives to do them \nharm. I am introducing it again today in the hope that this bill will, \nin some small way, prevent future bombings--whether by terrorists of \nsymbolic targets, malcontents of random ones, or even spouses involved \nin marital disputes.\n  While we have increasingly restricted the number of people who can \nobtain and use a firearm, we have been lax in extending these \nprohibitions to explosives. For instance, while we prohibit illegal \naliens from obtaining a gun, we allow them to obtain explosives without \nrestriction. And someone who has been dishonorably discharged from the \narmed forces can no longer buy a gun, but can purchase a truckload full \nof explosives. The same is true for people who have renounced U.S. \ncitizenship, people who have acted in such a way as to have restraining \norders issued against them, and those with domestic violence \nconvictions.\n  Each of these categories of persons are prohibited from obtaining \nfirearms, but face no such prohibition on obtaining explosive material. \nMany of these differences in the law are simply oversights--Congress \nhas often acted to limit the use and sale of firearms, and has \nneglected to bring explosives law into line. And in so doing, we have \nmade it all too easy for many of the most dangerous or least \naccountable members of society to obtain materials which can result in \nan equal or even greater loss of life.\n  Congress has already made the determination that certain members of \nsociety should not have access to firearms, and the same logic clearly \napplies to dangerous and destructive explosive materials. It is time to \nbring explosives laws into line with gun laws. My bill would simply \nexpand the list of people prohibited from purchasing explosives so that \nit mirrors the list of people already prohibited from purchasing \nfirearms.\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\n  This is a simple bill meant only to correct longstanding gaps and \nloopholes in current law. I hope we can quickly move to get this passed \nand protect Americans from future acts of explosive destruction. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the legislation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part Q of title I of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide assistance for \nunincorporated neighborhood watch programs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               neighborhood watch partnership act of 1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise today to introduce the \n``Neighborhood Watch Partnership Act of 1999.'' This bill will broaden \nthe eligibility of groups that may apply for essential funding for \nneighborhood watch activities.\n  Communities across the country are finding sensible ways to solve \nlocal problems. Through partnerships with local police, neighborhood \nwatch groups are having a decisive impact on crime. There are almost \n20,000 such groups creating innovative programs that promote community \ninvolvement in crime prevention techniques. They empower community \nmembers and organize them against rape, burglary, and all forms of fear \non the street. They forge bonds between law enforcement and the \ncommunities they serve.\n  Unfortunately, many communities find it difficult to afford the often \nexpensive equipment such as cellphones and CBs needed to start a \nneighborhood watch organization. While the COPS program within the \nDepartment of Justice provides funding for some neighborhood watch \ngroups, an organization must incorporate to benefit from the current \nprogram. A mere 2000 of the nearly 20,000 groups incorporate, however, \nmeaning that the vast majority of watch groups cannot apply for funding \nassistance. This makes very little sense.\n  The time has come to make a clear commitment to these groups. That is \nwhy I am introducing a bill to extend COPS funding to unincorporated \nneighborhood watch organizations. The bill would provide grants of up \nto $1,950 to these groups. Under current law, either the local police \nchief or sheriff must\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\napprove grant requests by unincorporated watch groups. We would impose \nthe same requirement on unincorporated groups, thus providing \naccountability for the disbursement of funds.\n  Mr. President, neighborhood watch organizations provide an invaluable \nservice. By extending the partnership between community policing and \nwatch group organizations, we will boldly encourage small and large \ncommunities to preserve and create crime prevention tools. We should \nact now. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expedite State review of criminal records of \napplicants for bail enforcement officer employment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    BOUNTY HUNTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Bounty \nHunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act of 1999.'' This bill \nwill begin the process of reforming the revered but antiquated system \nof bail enforcement in this country.\n  Throughout our nation's proud history, bounty hunters have proved a \nvaluable addition to our law enforcement and recovery efforts. About 40 \npercent of all criminal defendants are released on bail each year, and \nin 1996 alone more than 33,000 skipped town. Police departments, no \nmatter how efficient or determined, cannot be expected to deal with so \nmany bail jumpers in addition to their other duties. Thus, while public \nlaw enforcement officers recover only about 10 percent of defendants \nwho skip town, bounty hunters catch an incredible 88 percent of bail \njumpers.\n  Because of the special, contractual nature of the relationship \nbetween bail bondsmen and those who use them to get out of jail, bounty \nhunters have traditionally enjoyed special rights--a nineteenth century \nSupreme Court case affirmed that while bounty hunters may exercise many \nof the powers granted to police, they are not subject to many of the \nconstitutional checks we place on those law enforcement officials. As a \nresult, bounty hunters need not worry about Miranda rights, extradition \nproceedings, or search warrants.\n  The ability to more efficiently track and recover criminal defendants \nserves a valuable purpose in our society. But the lack of \nconstitutional checks on bounty hunters also opens the system up to the \nrisk of abuse. Each of us has read or heard about cases in which \nlegitimate bounty hunters or those simply posing as recovery agents \nhave wrongfully entered a dwelling or captured the wrong person.\n  In one recent Arizona case, several men claiming to be bounty hunters \nbroke into a house, terrorized a family and ended up killing a young \ncouple who tried to defend against the attack. It now appears that \nthese men were simply ``posing'' as bounty hunters, but there are other \nreported incidents in which ``legitimate'' bounty hunters have broken \ndown the wrong door, kidnaped the wrong person, or physically abused \nthe targets of their searches. And there is little recourse for the \ninnocent victims of wrongful acts.\n  This legislaiton would begin the process of making bounty hunters \nmore accountable to the public they serve, and would help to restore \nconfidence in the bail enforcement system. The bill would not unduly \nimpose the will of the federal government on states, which have \ntraditionally regulated bounty hunters.\n  The ``Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act'' \ndirects the Attorney General of the United States to establish model \nguidelines for states to follow when creating their own bail \nenforcement regulations. In the course of her work, the Attorney \nGeneral will be specifcially directed to look into three areas \nidentified by the bill--whether bounty hunters should be required to \n``knock and announce'' before entering a dwelling, whether they should \nbe required to carry liability insurance (most already do), and whether \nconvicted felons should be allowed to obtain employment as bounty \nhunters.\n  Mr. President, it is time to start the process of making rouge bounty \nhunters more accountable, while at the same time restoring America's \nconfidence in the long tradition of bail enforcement that dates from \nthe earliest days of this nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ntaking this first step toward this process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                                S. 1083\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bounty Hunter Accountability \n     and Quality Assistance Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) bail enforcement officers, also known as bounty hunters \n     or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers with \n     valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from justice;\n       (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n     and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n     discerning the difference between law enforcement officers \n     and bail enforcement officers;\n       (3) the American public demands the employment of \n     qualified, well-trained bail enforcement officers as an \n     adjunct, but not a replacement for, law enforcement officers; \n     and\n       (4) in the course of their duties, bail enforcement \n     officers often move in and affect interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to protect \nconsumers from the unauthorized switching of their long-distance \nservice; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n   telecommunications competition and consumer protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \ncosponsored by Senators Bryan and Snowe, designed to stop the \nwidespread anticonsumer telemarketing abuse known as ``slamming.'' \nSince virtually every consumer has either been ``slammed'' or knows \nsomeone who has, it's probably unnecessary to add that ``slamming'' is \nthe practice whereby a consumer's chosen long-distance telephone \ncompany is changed without the consumer's knowledge or consent. Given \nthe pervasiveness of this unscrupulous practice, it comes as no \nsurprise that slamming has been the number one consumer complaint for \nthe last several years.\n  This marks the third time I have introduced antislamming legislation. \nLast year a similar antislamming bill failed to become law when the \nlegislative clock ran out before the House of Representatives acted, \ndespite the fact that the bill incorporated a number of provisions that \nthe House had insisted upon, and which the Senate believed weren't \ntough enough on slammers.\n  The reason I return today with a slamming bill is that, in the \nabsence of legislation, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a \nset of antislamming rules that a reviewing court has now stayed. As a \nresult, consumers are once again without the immediate prospect of any \neffective antislamming laws. This legislation is intended to provide \nsome.\n  But there is also another reason for reintroducing antislamming \nlegislation. The main reason the court stayed the FCC's antislamming \nrules is that the long-distance companies--the very companies who are \nresponsible for slamming in the first place--asked the court to do so \nbecause of an alternative antislamming scheme these companies dreamed \nup and now want the FCC to implement. Pursuant to the long-distance \ncompanies' plan, the long-distance companies--they're the slammers, \nremember--would hire a supposedly independent ``third-party \nadministrator'' who would handle enforcement of the antislamming rules \ninstead of the FCC. Given the fact that virtually everyone other than \nthe long-distance companies, including state enforcement authorities, \nare foursquare against this proposal, the long-distance companies' \ncourt strategy ups the ante on the FCC to cave in and adopt this \nobviously self-serving plan.\n  Not since the fox volunteered to watch the henhouse have we seen such \na demonstration of solicitude for the well-being of the vulnerable.\n  There are many instances in which industry comes up with creative \nways for government to deal with industry problems. This isn't one of \nthem.\n  Let's call it what it is. This scheme is the latest manifestation of \nan ongoing effort by the long-distance companies to avoid having to \nface up to real penalties if they can't make their telemarketers stop \nslamming people. Their rhetoric deplores slamming, but their \nmachinations before Congress and the FCC show otherwise. And if the \nFCC--the supposedly pro-consumer FCC--were to even flirt with the \nnotion of embracing the long-distance industry's scheme, it would show, \nwhen push comes to shove, whose interests would really matter to this \nagency.\n  In a published court opinion, Judge Lawrence Silberman of the D.C. \nCourt of Appeals referred to something else the FCC once did as being \n``not just stupid--criminally stupid.'' Mr. President, it would be \neither criminal stupidity, or duplicity of the highest order, for the \nFCC to ignore the views of everyone except the big long-distance \ncompanies and adopt their blatantly anticonsumer plan.\n  As I said when I introduced the similar legislation last October, \nthis bill isn't perfect--it contains provisions generated by the House \nof Representatives, that I consider much too slammer-friendly. But it's \nstill a lot better than the industry-promoted alternative. And so I \noffer to better protect consumers and to send the FCC the message that \nit's their duty to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications \n     Competition and Consumer Protection Act of 1999''.\n\n                           TITLE I--SLAMMING\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe treatment of bonds issued to acquire renewable resources on land \nsubject to conservation easement; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        THE COMMUNITY FORESTRY AND AGRICULTURE CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Community Forestry and Agriculture Conservation Act of 1999.''\n  Mr. President, all across America we are losing hundreds of thousands \nof acres of productive forest and agricultural land to urban uses. And \nwith the loss of these lands, we also lose some of our ability to \nprotect watersheds, fish and wildlife, and the rural character and \neconomies of many communities.\n  Local governments and non-profit organizations, including growing \nnumbers of land trusts, are responding to these issues, and to citizen \ndemand that private land provide more public benefit. They have made \nsignificant progress by purchasing land outright or protecting it \nthrough conservation easements.\n  Unfortunately, communities and non-profits simply do not have the \nresources to meet public demand for open space protection. And the most \ntraditional means of protection--outright purchase of land or \nconservation easements--are inadequate to protect larger tracts of \nforest and agricultural land.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would give communities \na flexible and dynamic tool to protect forest and agricultural land. In \nfact, some communities, including at least one in the State of \nWashington, are already mobilizing to take advantage of the legislation \nI am introducing today.\n  The concept behind this bill is straightforward.\n  Under my bill, a group of community members and leaders who are \ninterested in protecting a tract of forest or farm land would work with \none or more landowners to reach a voluntary sale agreement at fair \nmarket value.\n  The community group would then form a non-profit 501(c)(3) \ncorporation with a diverse board of directors. The board of directors \ncould include landowners, conservationists, financial and business \nleaders, forestry and agricultural professionals, and others interested \nin managing the land.\n  The non-profit corporation would develop an agreement on what land \nwould be acquired and at what price.\n  In addition, the corporation would develop a binding management plan. \nThe management plan would provide for continued harvest of trees and \ncrops, but in a manner that exceeds federal and state conservation \nstandards.\n  A local government would then issue tax exempt revenue bonds on \nbehalf of the non-profit corporation to fund the acquisition of the \nland. The bonds would be held and serviced by the non-profit with \nrevenue raised by the continued harvest of trees or crops in accordance \nwith the management plan. The non-profit corporation would also hold \nthe title to the land.\n  In forming the non-profit corporation, community leaders would be \nrequired to meet strict standards before bonds were issued. These \nstandards will ensure that public benefits are achieved and abuse is \nprevented.\n  First, the non-profit corporation must draft a land management plan \nthat exceeds state and federal law.\n  Second, the corporation must enter the land into a permanent \nconservation easement.\n  Third, the corporation must secure the commitment of a third party \n501(c)3 organization or governmental entity to hold the conservation \neasement. It must also provide the third party with the financial \nresources needed to monitor compliance with the easement.\n  Last, the corporation must establish a diverse board of directors. No \nmore than 20 percent of the board members can represent a for-profit \nentity that does business with the non-profit.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why my bill is necessary to make this \nnew approach possible. Current law allows for the issuance of tax-\nexempt debt on behalf of non-profit corporations, such as hospitals and \nhigher education facilities that require large amounts of capital. This \nbill ensures forest and agricultural based non-profits can enjoy the \nsame benefits.\n  Once the interested parties complete the management plan, issue the \nbonds, acquire the land and place it in trust, landowners, local \ngovernments, the environment, and the public all benefit.\n  Mr. President, foresters and agricultural producers are often land-\nrich and cash-poor. My bill would allow landowners to capitalize some \nor all of their assets. It would also allow landowners to continue \nharvesting timber from the land but at a lower harvest level. While the \nnon-profit could manage harvest activities on the land, it is more \nlikely it will contract out for these services. This will allow the \noriginal landowner or other interested natural resource businesses to \nmanage and receive economic benefits from the land. In addition, this \ntool will allow the landowner to escape the management problems that \narise when urban growth begins to encroach on forestry or agricultural \noperations.\n  Local governments benefit by continuing to receive tax dollars that \nresult from economic activities on the land.\n  And the land receives better stewardship because broad-based \nconservation efforts can be undertaken at a lower cost than under more \ntraditional land acquisition methods. Through these conservation \neasements, non-profits will have the financial flexibility to apply \nlighter resource management practices on the land.\n  This is an important point. The lower cost of capital and non-profit \nland management would allow communities to increase conservation \nbenefits. I know many landowners and companies would prefer to increase \nconservation practices. However, they also have to meet the demands of \nthe bottom-line and stockholders. By reducing these financial \npressures, we can provide a higher level of resource protection on \nthese lands.\n  And the higher levels of resource protection can respond to the \ngreatest environmental needs in that region. For example, in my home \nstate of Washington, the non-profit corporation could increase buffer \nareas along streams to protect salmon runs and engage in habitat \nrestoration. These steps would help my state respond to salmon listings \nunder the Endangered Species Act.\n  Finally, the American people benefit the most. They will have more \nenvironmental protection and recreational opportunities without \nsacrificing an important part of their community's economic and tax \nbase. This tool will also allow communities to promote local ownership \nof their land and to better control their destiny.\n  Mr. President, in the last three years, Congress and the Clinton \nAdministration have been discussing more and more the issues of \n``sprawl'' and ``livability.'' We are finally starting to see at the \nnational level a recognition that the federal government's actions play \nan important role in how communities grow. These are not new ideas--\nthey have been discussed at the local and state levels for decades. I \nam\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\npleased to see Congress and the Administration joining this discussion.\n  We have heard and seen many good ideas and proposals for improving \nthe quality of life in our communities, from greater open space \nprotection to improved transportation infrastructure. I support many of \nthese efforts.\n  However, my bill addresses one aspect of this discussion that is not \ndrawing as much attention in the press. And that is the destruction of \nfarm and forest economies in many regions that are rapidly urbanizing. \nIn the Puget Sound region, growth has choked the economic viability of \nforest and agricultural operations in many areas. Concerned citizens \nand governments are forced to try to save forest and farm land on a \nsmaller, more piecemeal basis. As successful and rewarding as many of \nthese efforts have been, we need to give communities the option to save \nlarger tracts of land that cannot be acquired outright. By doing so, we \ncan maintain viable farm and forest operations near growing urban \nareas, and help strengthen the connection between rural producers and \nurban consumers.\n  Today, Representatives Dunn and Tanner are introducing this \nlegislation in the House. I am pleased to join their effort on this \nimportant issue by sponsoring companion legislation.\n  In closing, I want to emphasize that this is an approach that every \nSenator can support. It is bipartisan. It is voluntary. It maintains \nprivate land ownership and embraces private landowners. It limits \ngovernment involvement but establishes proper enforcement to prevent \nabuse. It protects the environment. It provides local control.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me to pass the Community \nForestry and Agriculture Conservation Act. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1085\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Violence Prevention \n     Training for Early Childhood Educators Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide grants to \n     institutions that carry out early childhood education \n     training programs to enable the institutions to include \n     violence prevention training as part of the preparation of \n     individuals pursuing careers in early childhood development \n     and education.\n\n     SEC. __03. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single \n     best predictor of aggression in later life.\n       (2) Aggressive and defiant behavior predictive of later \n     delinquency is increasing among our Nation's youngest \n     children. Without prevention efforts, higher percentages of \n     juveniles are likely to become violent juvenile offenders.\n       (3) Research has demonstrated that aggression is primarily \n     a learned behavior that develops through observation, \n     imitation, and direct experience. Therefore, children who \n     experience violence as victims or as witnesses are at \n     increased risk of becoming violent themselves.\n       (4) In a study at a Boston city hospital, 1 out of every 10 \n     children seen in the primary care clinic had witnessed a \n     shooting or a stabbing before the age of 6, with 50 percent \n     of the children witnessing in the home and 50 percent of the \n     children witnessing in the streets.\n       (5) A study in New York found that children who had been \n     victims of violence within their families were 24 percent \n     more likely to report violent behavior as adolescents, and \n     adolescents who had grown up in families where partner \n     violence occurred were 21 percent more likely to report \n     violent delinquency than individuals not exposed to violence.\n       (6) Aggression can become well-learned and difficult to \n     change by the time a child reaches adolescence. Early \n     childhood offers a critical period for overcoming risk for \n     violent behavior and providing support for prosocial \n     behavior.\n       (7) Violence prevention programs for very young children \n     yield economic benefits. By providing health and stability to \n     the individual child and the child's family, the programs may \n     reduce expenditures for medical care, special education, and \n     involvement with the judicial system.\n       (8) Primary prevention can be effective. When preschool \n     teachers teach young children interpersonal problem-solving \n     skills and other forms of conflict resolution, children are \n     less likely to demonstrate problem behaviors.\n       (9) There is evidence that family support programs in \n     families with children from birth through 5 years of age are \n     effective in preventing delinquency.\n\n     SEC. __04. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) At-risk child.--The term ``at-risk child'' means a \n     child who has been affected by violence through direct \n     exposure to child abuse, other domestic violence, or violence \n     in the community.\n       (2) Early childhood education training program.--The term \n     ``early childhood education training program'' means a \n     program that--\n       (A)(i) trains individuals to work with young children in \n     early child development programs or elementary schools; or\n       (ii) provides professional development to individuals \n     working in early child development programs or elementary \n     schools;\n       (B) provides training to become an early childhood \n     education teacher, an elementary school teacher, a school \n     counselor, or a child care provider; and\n       (C) leads to a bachelor's degree or an associate's degree, \n     a certificate for working with young children (such as a \n     Child Development Associate's degree or an equivalent \n     credential), or, in the case of an individual with such a \n     degree, certificate, or credential, provides professional \n     development.\n       (3) Elementary school.--The term ``elementary school'' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n       (4) Violence prevention.--The term ``violence prevention'' \n     means--\n       (A) preventing violent behavior in children;\n       (B) identifying and preventing violent behavior in at-risk \n     children; or\n       (C) identifying and ameliorating violent behavior in \n     children who act out violently.\n\n     SEC. __05.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n     children begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\n     changes the physical structure of the brain itself and that \n     without a stimulating environment, a baby's brain will \n     suffer. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100,000,000,000 \n     neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in \n     the Milky Way, but the wiring pattern between these neurons \n     develops over time. Children who play very little or are \n     rarely touched develop brains that are 20 to 30 percent \n     smaller than normal for their age.\n       (3) This scientific research also conclusively demonstrates \n     that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits \n     for children, families, and the Nation.\n       (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n     under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, society must \n     change to provide new supports so young children receive the \n     attention and care that they need.\n       (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n     United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n       (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n     United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n     proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller \n     proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n       (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n     between--\n       (A) lack of early intervention for children; and\n       (B) increased violence and crime among youth.\n       (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n     over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n     delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n     crisis situations that frequently could have been avoided or \n     made much less severe through good early intervention for \n     children.\n       (9) Many local communities across the country have \n     developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n     additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities \n     for young children.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal funding for early childhood development \n     collaboratives should be a priority in the Federal budget for \n     fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n                   Subtitle __--Safe School Security\n\n     SEC. __1.

Upon completion of the \n     assessment, the Council may consider grant applications from \n     the State to provide statewide programs, from local \n     communities including schools, and from non-profit service \n     providers including faith based organizations.\n       (c) Grants may be made for--\n       (1) Parenting support to promote early brain development \n     and childhood development and education including--\n       (A) assistance to schools to offer classroom instruction on \n     brain stimulation, child development, and early childhood \n     education;\n       (B) distribution of materials developed by the Commission \n     or another entity that reflect best parenting practices;\n       (C) development and distribution of referral information on \n     programs and services available to children and families at \n     the local level, including eligibility criteria;\n       (D) voluntary hospital visits for postpartum women and in \n     home visits for families with infants, toddlers, or newly \n     adopted children to provide hands on training and one on one \n     instruction on brain stimulation, child development, and \n     early childhood education;\n       (E) parenting education programs including training with \n     respect to the best parenting practices identified in \n     subsection (c);\n       (2) Parenting Support for Adolescents and Youth including--\n       (A) funds for services and support for parents and other \n     caregivers of young people being served by a range of \n     education, social service, mental health, health, runaway and \n     homeless youth programs. Programs may include the Boys and \n     Girls Club, YMCA and YWCA, after school programs, 4-H \n     programs, or other community based organizations. Eligible \n     activities may include parent-caregiver support groups, peer \n     support groups, parent education classes, seminars or \n     discussion groups on problems facing adolescents, advocates \n     and mentors to help parents understand and work with schools, \n     the courts, and various treatment programs.\n       (3) Parenting Support and Education Resource Centers \n     including--\n       (A) development of parenting resource centers which may \n     serve as a single point of contact for the provision of \n     comprehensive services available to children and their \n     families including federal, state, and local governmental and \n     non-profit services available to children.

GRANTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE RELATED \n                   STRESS TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that a child's brain is \n     wired between the ages of 0-\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\n     3. A child's ability to learn, develop healthy family and \n     social relationships, resist peer pressure, and control \n     violent impulses depends on the quality and quantity of brain \n     stimulation he receives. Research shows that children exposed \n     to negative brain stimulation in the form of physical and \n     sexual abuse and violence in the family or community causes \n     the brain to be miswired making it difficult for the child to \n     be successful in life. Intervention early in a child's life \n     to correct the miswiring is much more successful than adult \n     rehabilitation efforts.\n       (b) In General.--The Secretary shall award grants, enter \n     into contracts or cooperative agreements to public and non-\n     profit private entities, as well as to Indian tribes, Native \n     Hawaiians, and Alaska Native non-profit corporations to \n     establish national and regional centers of excellence on \n     psychological trauma response and to identify the best \n     practices for treating psychiatric and behavioral disorders \n     resulting from children witnessing or experiencing such \n     stress.\n       (c) Priorities.--In awarding grants, contracts or \n     cooperative agreements under subsection (a) related to the \n     identifying best practices for treating disorders associated \n     with psychological trauma, the Secretary shall give priority \n     to programs that work with children, adolescents, adults, and \n     families who are survivors and witnesses of child abuse, \n     domestic, school, and community violence, and disasters.\n       (d) Geographical Distribution.--The Secretary shall ensure \n     that grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under \n     subsection (a) with respect to centers of excellence are \n     distributed equitably among the regions of the country and \n     among urban and rural areas.\n       (e) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall require that each \n     applicant for a grant, contract or cooperative agreement \n     under subsection (a) submit a plan as part of his application \n     for the rigorous evaluation of the activities funded under \n     the grant, contract or agreement, including both process and \n     outcomes evaluation, and the submission of an evaluation at \n     the end of the project period.\n       (f) Duration of Awards.--With respect to a grant, contract \n     or cooperative agreement under this section, the period \n     during which payments under such an award will be made to the \n     recipient may not be less than 3 years. Such grants, contract \n     or agreement may be renewed.\n       (g) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the General Accounting Office \n     shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives a \n     report concerning whether individuals are covered for post-\n     traumatic stress disorders under public and private health \n     plans, and the course of treatment, if any, that is covered.\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                WELLSTONE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 364\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nFeingold, and Mr. Durbin) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 254, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       On page 129, strike lines 6 through 14, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(24) address juvenile delinquency prevention efforts and \n     system improvement efforts designed to reduce, without \n     establishing or requiring numerical standards or quotas, the \n     disproportionate number of juvenile members of racial \n     minority groups who come into contact with the juvenile \n     justice system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      McCONNELL AMENDMENT NO. 365\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL proposed an amendment to the bill S. 254, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise to commend Mr. Allan ``Bud'' \nSelig for his tireless efforts to make the recent baseball series \nbetween the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles a reality. \nNot only did this series bring together teams from two nations with a \ngreat love of baseball, but it bridged a gap between two peoples who \nshare a great deal in common.\n\n[[Page S5629]]\n\n  Baseball is often called the ``American Pastime,'' and with good \nreason. Few events are greater harbingers of the coming of summer than \nthe first pitches in ball parks around the country. Millions of parents \nacross this nation carve time out of their days to teach their child \nhow to throw a baseball or to coach a little league team. And millions \nof American children count their first baseball glove among their most \ntreasured possessions.\n  Baseball, however, is not only an American tradition. Rather, it is \ntreasured with equal fervor and excitement by Cubans less than 100 \nmiles from our shore. There, too, baseball is the national pastime. \nCountless Cuban and American children play little league baseball with \nvisions of a future in the major leagues. Just as Americans eagerly \ncount down to opening day, Cubans anticipate the first pitch of a new \nseason with a mix of anticipation and excitement.\n  Not only do Cubans and Americans share their deep love of baseball, \nthey also both play the game with great skill. Indeed, some of \nAmerica's finest players hail from Cuba.\n  In spite of this close connection, however, politics has kept \nAmerican and Cuban teams from visiting each other's stadiums for nearly \nfour decades. This artificial separation remained intact until this \nspring when the Cuban National Team hosted the Baltimore Orioles in \nHavana. That game marked the opening day, not just of a two game home-\nand-home series, but hopefully of a new season in the relationship \nbetween two of the world's greatest lovers of baseball.\n  The series, which continued in Baltimore this month, would never have \ncome about if it were not for the courage and dedication of Bud Selig. \nHis efforts succeeded where those of hundreds of diplomats and \npoliticians have failed: he managed to bring the Cuban and American \npeople together to celebrate the game they love so dearly.\n  I recognize that the process of arranging these two games was rarely \neasy. At times, it seemed that the opening pitch would remain forever \nout of reach. Yet, Mr. Selig persisted and brought the two teams \nclosest to our capitals--and their fans--together for two historic \ngames. Our nation should be proud of and grateful to Mr. Selig for his \nefforts and look forward to additional contact between the Cuban and \nAmerican peoples, both on and off the baseball diamond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5629-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           I LOVE AMERICA DAY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nFulton, Missouri's ``I Love America Day.'' Several years ago, the \nfaculty of McIntire Elementary school became concerned that many of the \nstudents did not have a true sense of patriotism and national pride. \nWhat started out at one elementary school has spread to a communitywide \ncelebration. Each year they highlight all levels of government and \nplace special emphasis on pride in the flag. This year's celebration \nwill include a presentation of the colors by the VFW flag team, a \ntwenty-one gun salute, taps to honor those lost in service, \npresentations by the VFW, Mayor Craghead, and others, and a special \ndemonstration by the Army's Golden Knights parachute team. As you can \nsee, Mr. President, this event has grown into a wonderful day of \nactivities that will enrich the sense of patriotism not only in our \nyouth, but also in the entire community. I commend the organizers of \n``I Love America Day'' for the wonderful example they set for Missouri \nand the entire country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5629-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING FEDERAL RESERVE CHALLENGE WINNERS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate five \noutstanding High School students from University School at Milwaukee. \nWorking as a team, these five students were recently named national \nchampions of the 1999 Federal Reserve Challenge.\n  Mary Broydrick, Michelle Hill, Day Manoli, Nick Nielsen, all seniors, \nand Gus Fuldner, a junior, each received a $10,000 scholarship for \ntheir presentation on monetary policy. The team was coached by John \nStephens, a teacher at University School for 41 years. In addition, the \nschool received a $40,000 grant to develop an economics lab.\n  Their winning presentation included countless hours researching \neconomic and monetary policy. Making recommendations based on their \nfindings, the team was asked a series of grueling questions by Federal \nReserve officials.\n  We are all extremely proud of our students from University School. \nThey must be applauded for a job well done.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Ila Marie Goodey\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would just like to take a moment \nto pay tribute to Ila Marie Goodey of Logan, Utah. I have just learned \nthat Ila passed away on Saturday.\n  Ila was a tireless and effective advocate for individuals with \ndisabilities and served as an early and active member of my Utah \nAdvisory Committee on Disability Policy. I have always appreciated her \ncounsel on these issues.\n  In particular, she believed in independence and self-sufficiency, and \nshe directed as much of her energy to assisting others to reach this \ngoal as she did to helping herself. She served as the first chairperson \nof the Utah Assistive Technology Program Management and Implementation \nBoard. This consumer-responsive, interagency program has been hailed \nnationwide as a model for other programs of its kind.\n  I know that her friends and colleagues at Utah State University and \namong the disability community in my state will mourn her loss. But, I \nalso know that they, as I do, appreciate all that she has contributed. \nThere can be no doubt that Ila has made a real difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5629-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5629-S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT ANDREW RAMIREZ\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Staff \nSergeant Andrew Ramirez who has served his country with bravery and \nvalor. For Sergeant Ramirez, a resident of East Los Angeles, public \nservice runs in the family--his brother is a detective with the Los \nAngeles Police Department.\n  On March 31, 1999, Sergeant Ramirez was taken as a prison of war by \nthe Yugoslavia Army while he was serving as part of a U.S. Army \ndetachment assigned to a U.N. monitoring force patrolling Yugoslavia's \nsouthern border. Sergeant Ramirez was part of the 4th Cavalry Regiment \nof the 1st Infantry Division based in Wurzburg, Germany. He had arrived \nin Macedonia in early March to relieve another contingent.\n  I cannot begin to imagine the terror experienced by Sergeant Ramirez \nand his fellow soldiers, Christopher J. Stone and Steven M. Gonzales, \nwhen they were surrounded, and under heavy fire, taken as prisoners of \nwar.\n  Just a few days later, the soldiers were shown on Serbian television, \nbattered and bruised. It is a picture that every mother hopes she will \nnever see. It is a picture that every American hoped was not true. But, \nit was true, and these three men paid a dear price of over a month in \ncaptivity. They did not know what fate would befall them and if they \nwere ever going to see their families again.\n  During the past weeks, Kosovo has witnessed carnage and bloodshed \nunseen in Europe for almost fifty years. These events are the \nculmination of a decade-long campaign of terror and bloodshed in the \nBalkans--and it has created a refugee crisis unparalleled in recent \nyears.\n  Sergeant Ramirez was in Yugoslavia because his country asked him to \ngo. He was there to protect our promise that the civilized world will \nnever again do nothing in the face of genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass \nrape and rampant violence to thousands of innocent people. If the most \npowerful alliance in the world fails to stop ethnic cleansing, it will \nsend a green light to every tyrant and dictator with similar intentions \nthat they can do the same, and that the world community will be unable \nor unwilling to muster the resolve to stop it.\n  None of these words would mean anything without individuals like \nSergeant Anthony Ramirez. He is the truest of patriots--the bravest of \nthe brave. Our country is forever indebted to him, and there are not \nwords nor deeds that could every repay his dedicated service--or that \nof his family. He is a testament to the human spirit that keeps the \nlight of peace and human freedoms alive.\n  Sergeant Ramirez, we thank you, we honor you, and we are so very, \nvery glad that you are home.\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5629-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5629-S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT ANDREW RAMIREZ\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

He had arrived \nin Macedonia in early March to relieve another contingent.\n  I cannot begin to imagine the terror experienced by Sergeant Ramirez \nand his fellow soldiers, Christopher J. Stone and Steven M. Gonzales, \nwhen they were surrounded, and under heavy fire, taken as prisoners of \nwar.\n  Just a few days later, the soldiers were shown on Serbian television, \nbattered and bruised. It is a picture that every mother hopes she will \nnever see. It is a picture that every American hoped was not true. But, \nit was true, and these three men paid a dear price of over a month in \ncaptivity. They did not know what fate would befall them and if they \nwere ever going to see their families again.\n  During the past weeks, Kosovo has witnessed carnage and bloodshed \nunseen in Europe for almost fifty years. These events are the \nculmination of a decade-long campaign of terror and bloodshed in the \nBalkans--and it has created a refugee crisis unparalleled in recent \nyears.\n  Sergeant Ramirez was in Yugoslavia because his country asked him to \ngo. He was there to protect our promise that the civilized world will \nnever again do nothing in the face of genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass \nrape and rampant violence to thousands of innocent people. If the most \npowerful alliance in the world fails to stop ethnic cleansing, it will \nsend a green light to every tyrant and dictator with similar intentions \nthat they can do the same, and that the world community will be unable \nor unwilling to muster the resolve to stop it.\n  None of these words would mean anything without individuals like \nSergeant Anthony Ramirez. He is the truest of patriots--the bravest of \nthe brave. Our country is forever indebted to him, and there are not \nwords nor deeds that could every repay his dedicated service--or that \nof his family. He is a testament to the human spirit that keeps the \nlight of peace and human freedoms alive.\n  Sergeant Ramirez, we thank you, we honor you, and we are so very, \nvery glad that you are home.\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5630-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           MONTANA RAIL LINK\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today an award ceremony for one of \nthe nation's best and brightest short line railroads, was held to honor \nMontana Rail Link's safety record. Montana Rail Link, commonly referred \nto as MRL, offers essential and competitive freight service to a large \nnumber of customers along Montana's Southern rail line from Billings to \nSandpoint, Idaho.\n  MRL was honored today by being awarded the E.H. Hariman Memorial \naward. This award is specifically designated to recognize railroad \nsafety improvement. Working on the railroad is not like having a desk \njob. It's not a job for the timid--it's a job where hard work and \nplenty of sweat are part of everyday tasks.\n  Each year, it is tragically inevitable that railroad employees are \ninvolved in accidents which can result in serious injury or even death. \nWith the reception of this award, it is very apparent that MRL places a \nsignificant value on the safety of their employees. As a Montanan, I am \nrelieved to see that a Montana railroad is the recipient of this award. \nMontana railroads have a long and colorful history in the establishment \nof our state. And I have friends that work on the railroad.\n  Montanans are very dependent on this rail transportation. We are \ndependent on this competitive alternative. As many are aware, I have \nintroduced legislation that will help to assure the nation's shippers \nof competitive rail access. It is my intent to not only create free-\nmarket competition in the rail industry, I would also like to improve \nservice of the nation's Class 1 railroads.\n  I've heard from many Montanans about the importance of rail car \navailability and affordability. The nation's rail system is dominated \nby four large behemoths of railroads. In Montana, those railroads are \nthe target of much criticism based on their pricing and contractual \npractices.\n  It is the short lines that help to balance out the public's \nperception of railroads. In Montana, MRL has been hailed as a very \nreliable transportation alternative. MRL has also been hailed with this \naward today.\n  You've all heard me make a reference to Montana's vast distances--\nfrom corner to corner, the distance from Alzaka to Yaak, Montana is \nequivalent to the distance from Washington, D.C. to Chicago, Illinois. \nI'm sure my colleagues will agree with me, especially when you consider \nthe variance in terrain we are faced with in our state. Pulling a train \nover multiple mountain passes in the dead of winter can be a daunting \ntask.\n  In Montana, we value good, honest, quality service. MRL is very much \nan example of what is best about Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5630-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO RUSSELL BERRIE and DR. ROBERT A. SCOTT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRussell Berrie and Dr. Robert A. Scott, two of New Jersey's leaders in \nbusiness and education, on the occasion of their third annual ``Making \nA Difference Awards'' program.\n  Mr. President, Russ and Robert have made tremendous philanthropic and \nhumanitarian contributions to my state of New Jersey. In 1997, they \njoined together through the Russell Berrie Foundation to create the \n``Making A Difference Awards,'' which honor unsung heroes of New Jersey \nfor acts of unusual heroism, extraordinary community service or \nlifetime achievement.\n  Much like the award recipients, Russ Berrie has devoted a lifetime to \nhelping others. Thirty-six years ago, he founded RUSS Berrie and \nCompany, Incorporated, which develops and distributes more than 6,000 \ngift products to retailers worldwide. Its diverse range of products \ninclude stuffed animals, baby gifts, picture frames, candles, \nfigurines, and home decor gifts. Russ' company, headquartered in \nOakland, NJ, grosses annual sales of $270 million and has been listed \non the New York Stock Exchange since 1984.\n  Recently, Fortune Magazine named Russ one of its ``Forty Most \nGenerous Americans,'' and Russ has been recognized by many \norganizations for his strong commitment to education, health care and \ninterreligious affairs. Russ' Foundation promotes his values, passions, \nand ideas through investment in innovative ideas and by supporting \nindividuals who make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.\n  Robert also has made a positive impact on the world around him. He \ncurrently is the president of Ramapo College, New Jersey's leading \nliberal arts school, serving over 5,000 undergraduate and graduate \nstudents from over 20 states and 50 nations. Thanks to Robert, the \ncollege has named its soon-to-open center for performing and visual \narts after Russ and his wife, Angelica. What an honor!\n  Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor my good friends Russ and \nRobert for their work in honoring the unsung heroes of New Jersey. We \nare indebted to them for their service. I am happy to join them in \nhonoring this year's three winners of the ``Making A Difference \nAward''--Beverly Turner, of Irvington, who lives with muscular \ndystrophy, for devoting her time caring to children with special needs. \nJames C. Joiner, founder of the Rescuing Inner Sity Kids (RISK), for \ndedicating his time, skill, and spirit to working with inner-city \nchildren to instill in them the desire to better themselves and the \npeople around them. Finally, Frederick ``Freddie'' Hoffman, of River \nEdge, for dedicating the last ten years of his life to raising money \nfor the Leukemia Foundation. I also would like to recognize the 14 \nfinalists: Douglas A. Berrian, Mr. and Mrs. William Clutter, Sister \nJune Favata, Kathleen Garcia, Adam and Blair Hornstine, Sylvia Jackson, \nJeff Macaulay, Jim McCloskey, Eddie Mulrow, Thomas O'Leary, Barry Lee \nPetty, Michael Ricciardone, Richard J. Ward, and Dr. and Mrs. Robert \nZufall.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate all of the honorees for unselfishly \ngiving of themselves. They have proven to their family, to their \nfriends, and to their communities that this honor is well-\ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5630-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ADMIRAL BUD NANCE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAdmiral Bud Nance, chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nwho passed away last week after many years of devoted service to the \ncountry he loved.\n  As a former member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and someone \nwho had the privilege of knowing and working with Bud, I can honestly \nsay I have not met a finer person. A man deeply devoted to the ideals \nfor which this country stands, he conducted himself with honor and \nintegrity in all that he did. And he had an uncommon humility and \nkindness that will be remembered by all those fortunate to have met \nhim.\n  With 41 years in the Navy, service under both the Nixon and Reagan \nAdministrations, and a direct role in SALT II talks, Bud had already \nachieved a lifetime of accomplishments even before he was urged by his \nlongtime friend, Senator Helms, to assume the role of chief of staff at \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. As with everything else he did, Bud \nflourished in that position, bringing his invaluable years of \nexperience and knowledge to the Senate. He was a sure and steady hand \nat the helm of the Committee, and his remarkable spirit has left an \nindelible mark on all of us.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said that ``the credit belongs to the man who \nis actually in the arena--whose face is marred by dust and sweat and \nblood . . . a leader who knows the great enthusiams, the great \ndevotions and spends himself in a worthy cause . . .'' Admiral Bud \nNance was just such a man, and today our thoughts are with his wife, \nMary, and Bud's entire family as they mourn the passing of their \nbeloved husband, father, and grandfather. We are also thinking of \nSenator Helms at this saddest of times, as he grieves for the loss of \none of his oldest and dearest friends.\n  Again, I want express my profound sadness on the loss of this great \nAmerican, who was a patriot in life and whose legacy will never be \nforgotten by a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5630-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5630-S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE JEWISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL OF METROPOLITAN DETROIT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nJewish\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nCommunity Council of Metropolitan Detroit, which is celebrating its \n60th anniversary on May 23, 1999.\n  The Jewish Community Council brings together more than 200 Jewish \ncommunity organizations under one umbrella, enabling the community to \nact in a unified way on issues of shared interest and concern. The \nCouncil's activities include building partnerships between people of \ndifferent faiths and ethnic backgrounds, working to strengthen \nMetropolitan Detroit's Jewish community, and providing information to \nstate and federal legislators about important issues.\n  The people of Metropolitan Detroit have always been able to count on \nthe Jewish Community Council for assistance. The Council administers an \nannual food drive conducted by a broad-based coalition of community \norganizations, provides volunteers to an interfaith effort to \nrevitalize economically distressed areas of the City of Detroit, and \nhas fought to restore food stamps for legal immigrants.\n  One of the Council's most impressive achievements is its continuing \neffort to build bridges between people of different backgrounds. Some \nof the programs sponsored by the Council include the Detroit/Israel \nStudent Exchange and Seeds of Peace program. The Detroit/Israel Student \nExchange sends Detroit Public School students to Israel, and the \nstudents subsequently host Israeli teens at their homes in Detroit. \nSeeds of Peace is an innovative program which works to achieve lasting \npeace in the Middle East by bringing together Arab and Israeli \nteenagers at a summer camp in Maine with daily conflict-resolution \nsessions led by professional American, Arab and Israeli facilitators. \nThe Council also works with other ethnic communities to welcome new \nimmigrants to Michigan and to provide swearing-in ceremonies for new \nAmerican citizens.\n  As I travel across America and too often see people disconnected from \neach other, I am more and more certain that the strong sense of \ncommunity in the Jewish community is a pillar of our strength and an \nessential path to our well-being. The Jewish community comes together \nto educate our young, house our seniors, take care of immigrants, and \nprovide culture and recreation. I watched this sense of community with \nwonder when I was a boy and I see it with great pride as a man. This \ndeeply felt sense of community--of being part of something larger than \nour individual selves-- is a vital part of who we are.\n  The Jewish Community Council serves as the ``public face'' of this \nextraordinary community and I know my colleagues will join me in \noffering congratulations on its 60th anniversary, and in wishing the \nCouncil continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5631-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO ANDY MARTEL OF MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \npay tribute to Andy Martel for leading the fight to save Catholic \nMedical Center in Manchester. His efforts have been inspirational and \nsteadfast.\n  Andy was highly active in the preservation of Catholic Medical \nCenter. There were plans to eliminate this important landmark in \nManchester. The Center was having a difficult time preserving itself. \nAndy took it upon himself to save this acute-care hospital. He has \ntirelessly sought quality health care for the people of New Hampshire.\n  His efforts included organizing concerned citizens, raising funds, \nand heightening awareness about the plans to close the hospital. He \nbecame overwhelmingly cheerful and dedicated to the battle. The largest \nreason for the hospital's preservation was Andy's efforts.\n  Andy has been a valued member of the Manchester community for many \nyears. He has volunteered in many political campaigns, been active in \nhis church, and served in public office himself. He served as a State \nRepresentative in Ward 9 of Manchester. He has been committed to \ngrassroots style representation and has been an asset to the \nlegislation of New Hampshire.\n  As a fellow Catholic, I thank him for his dedication to our church. \nAs a citizen of New Hampshire, I thank him for his public service and \nvolunteerism. As a Senator, I thank him for all he has done to make New \nHampshire a better State.\n  Once again, I commend Andy for his work on the Catholic Medical \nCenter and for all his efforts. I wish him the best of luck in the \nfuture. It is an honor to represent him in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5631-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MEG GREENFIELD\n\n   Mr. FEINGOLD.

When Meg \nGreenfield passed away last week, the Nation lost a thoughtful and \nhonest voice that cut through the tangle of Washington rhetoric, \ntelling us what mattered, what didn't, and what was sometimes downright \nridiculous about politics in the nation's capitol.\n  From her position as a masterful editor of the Post's editorial and \nopinion pages to her role as an unfailingly insightful columnist for \nNewsweek, Meg Greenfield offered us her keen mind, her sharp wit, and \nher knack for giving readers the straight story.\n  That kind of talent is rare, and more than that it is essential in a \nworld where facts too often exist only to bolster a partisan argument, \nand where truth is a question of spin. Meg Greenfield helped us see \npast the spin to the story, and for that we are deeply grateful.

Mr. President, for twenty years, the Westport Volunteer \nEmergency Medical Service has been a lifeline for thousands of people \nin need of emergency medical assistance in the state of Connecticut. \nSince 1979, the WVEMS has provided the residents of Westport and the \nsurrounding communities with caring and professional medical services, \nand it gives me great pleasure to congratulate them on their 20th \nanniversary.\n  A division of the Westport Police Department, the WVEMS was created \nto respond to the increasing number of calls for emergency assistance \nin the area. This group of 140 dedicated volunteers serve as EMT's, \ncrew chiefs, and support personnel who, in the last year alone, \ncontributed over 23,000 hours of patient care. Their expertise and \nexperience have helped thousands of people by providing medical \ntraining, safety coverage at town and athletic events, and offering \npublic courses in areas such as first aid, CPR, blood pressure clinics, \nand safe driving classes.\n  It is remarkable to note that while providing efficient, quality care \nto the residents of Westport, the WVEMS relies solely on private \ndonations and fundraising to purchase its equipment, supplies, \nemergency vehicles, uniforms, and protective clothing. Volunteers have \ntaken on this additional responsibility and the extra hours to ensure \nthat their services remain available to anyone in need. They have made \nreliable emergency medical response a standard in many communities and \nhave proven that emergency care is a vital component of the safety of \nour cities and towns.\n  The ongoing success of the Westport Volunteer Emergency Medical \nService is most evident in the nearly two dozen new students that \nreceive training by the group's own personnel each year. Working in \nconjunction with area hospitals and local physicians, the WVEMS and its \nvolunteers have earned the highest marks in state examinations while \nalso having members serving on state and regional EMS councils. \nMoreover, volunteers have found their work so fulfilling that many have \ngone on to further their medical training and education as a full-time \ncareer.\n  What truly sets the Westport Volunteer Emergency Medical Service \napart is the level of commitment and concern its members have shown for \npeople in need. In situations that can often be emotional, chaotic, and \ndangerous, these men and women put the welfare of others first in order \nto calm fears and provide lifesaving care. Members are on standby \ntwenty-four hours a day and, in many cases, are the first ones on the \nscene of an accident. It is\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\ntheir quick thinking and skills that ultimately save lives.\n  The city of Westport and the state of Connecticut owe these selfless \npublic servants many thanks for the lives that they save and the \noutstanding care that they provide. I hope that others across the \ncountry will take the time to acknowledge the tireless efforts of the \nmen and women within their own communities who are available day and \nnight to respond to their emergency medical needs.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I would like to recognize those members \nof the Westport Volunteer Emergency Medical Service who have \nvolunteered countless hours for the past twenty years to provide \noutstanding emergency assistance and who continue to pass on their \nmedical knowledge to future generations of caregivers: Edwin Audley, \nElizabeth Audley, Patricia Audley, Sharon Barnett, Russell Blair, Susan \nDeWitt, Michael Feigin, Richard Frazier, Neil Harding, Thomas Keenan, \nLynne Minsky, Kathleen Todd, Alan Yoder, Isabel Blair, Alan Stolz, \nPasquale Salvo, William Carrick, Peter Ziehl, Jay Paretzky, Nancy Gale, \nGerald Randy Monroe, Barbara Potter, and April Anne Yoder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/19/senate-section/article/S5632-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
