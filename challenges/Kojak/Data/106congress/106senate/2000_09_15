Under the previous order, the Senate will now\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nresume consideration of H.R. 4444, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4444) to authorize extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the People's Republic of China, and to \n     establish a framework of relations between the United States \n     and the People's Republic of China.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on \nthe legislation pending before the Senate on the permanent normal trade \nrelations status for China. As announced, we will be having the final \nvote on this legislation on Tuesday. We had an extended debate on this \nissue. I think it has been a healthy debate and a good debate for the \nAmerican people. As I announced earlier, we have disposed of all \namendments. We have had amendments on almost every conceivable subject, \neverything from the environment to labor issues in China, to abortion \nissues. Of course, none of those amendments, I think, has received more \nthan 33, 34 votes. It is clear this legislation is going to pass and is \ngoing to pass overwhelmingly.\n  Historically, every time there was a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, when I served in the House, and on the occasions in \nwhich there were sense of the Senates, I have voted against granting \nannual most-favored-nation status to China, that which we now call \nnormal trade relations. I want to explain my thinking on this issue.\n  On May 24, 2000, as the House of Representatives approved permanent \nnormal trade relations status for China, Pastor Wang Li Gong celebrated \nhis 34th birthday by sewing footballs in a forced labor camp in \nTianjing. His hands are injured, and they bleed every day because of \nthe work. When Pastor Wang is not trying to fulfill high production \nquotas, he is allowed only a few hours of sleep and many more hours of \ntorture. He has been under administrative detention since last November \nfor the crime of organizing a Christian gathering in his home.\n  But Pastor Wang is not the only target of persecution. In its annual \nreport on human rights, our State Department documents just about every \nviolation of international norms in China. Religious persecution to \ncrackdowns on political dissent, to torture, to forced labor, to \ntrafficking of women and children--it is all happening in China. It is \nnot getting better. At least, if you view it in terms of the last few \nyears, if you go back to the Cultural Revolution, you can find there \nhave been fits and starts of improvement, but as you look at the State \nDepartment's reports over the last few years, the situation is not \nimproving.\n  In the area of religious persecution, the State Department, in its \nAnnual Report on International Religious Freedom, notes:\n\n       The Government's respect for religious freedom deteriorated \n     markedly, especially for the Falun Gong and Tibetan \n     Buddhists, and the Government's repression and abuses \n     continue during the first 6 months of 2000.\n\n  That is, of course, as far as the report extends, is the first 6 \nmonths of this year. Its conclusion is:\n\n       Respect for religious freedom deteriorated markedly.\n\n  At the very time the House of Representatives was voting for PNTR, \nand during the process by which that debate has gone on in the Senate, \nthe conclusion of our own Government is that ``religious freedom has \ndeteriorated markedly.''\n  The report goes on to note that:\n\n       The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress \n     adopted a decision to ban ``cults,'' including the Falun Gong \n     and other religious groups.\n\n  At the time the Chinese People's Congress adopted that law banning \nreligious cults, I expressed concern to my colleagues in the Senate \nthat this new law would be very broadly applied. It is bad enough to \ngive a government the power to define what is a cult and what is not, \nwhat is acceptable religious belief and what is not acceptable \nreligious belief, but this crackdown was unprecedented. There had been \nserious crackdowns in the past. At that time, I introduced a resolution \nin this Senate expressing my concern and the concern of the Congress \nthat this crackdown, this harsh crackdown on the Falun Gong, would only \nbe a beginning. I predicted the so-called cult law would be widely \napplied.\n  My worst fears have come true. The law has been applied extremely \nbroadly to other groups, including Christians. On August 23, 2000, \nChinese police arrested 130 Christians in Henan Province. These \nChristians are from the Fangcheng church, a popular house church \nmovement. The Chinese Government considers them a cult, not because of \nwhat they believe, not because of their teachings, but because they are \nnot registered with the State; they are not under the control of the \nChinese Government. Their leaders, arrested a year ago, are suffering \nfor their faith in labor camps, a penalty under the so-called anti-cult \nlaw.\n  The proponents of PNTR have argued that, No. 1, increased trade will \nresult not only in an increased export of American products to China \nbut also in the export of American values, including human rights and \nindividual freedom.\n  No. 2, they have asserted that the failure to grant PNTR would result \nin isolating China and driving the Chinese regime to even more \nrepressive tactics.\n  No. 3, they have insisted that entry into the WTO will ensure that \nChinese misbehavior can be addressed and that Chinese violations would \nbe dealt with under the World Trade Organization.\n  No. 4, they have further asserted that the creation of a human rights \nmonitoring commission in this legislation will guarantee the ongoing \nmonitoring of human rights conditions in China.\n  In my opinion, these arguments have merit. Also, the advocates of \nPNTR are, in my opinion, sincere. I would never question their \nmotivations. I would never question that, in fact, they believe in all \nsincerity that this is a better route or a real route to improving \nhuman rights conditions in China.\n  I very much want to vote for permanent normal trade relations for \nChina. It will have great economic benefits in the United States; \npotentially it does. It certainly has great economic benefits to the \nState of Arkansas. Arkansas is the No. 1 rice-producing State in the \nNation. We are looking for markets. We want to sell that rice, whether \nit is in China, whether it is in Cuba, or wherever it is in the world.\n  Some have analyzed the cotton industry will be the biggest \nbeneficiary under PNTR. Arkansas is in the top tier of States in the \nproduction of cotton.\n  Arkansas is the leading State in poultry production. When I visited \nChina and went to the two Wal-Marts that are in China today--a Sam's \nstore and a Wal-Mart--I was surprised to see the No. 1 product being \nsold is chicken feet. It is a delicacy, a speciality in China. We in \nArkansas grow poultry. We want to make every use of it, and China is a \ngood market for it. We have major retailers in Arkansas, and the \nprospects of new markets emerging in China are very appealing to \nretailers.\n  I very much wanted to vote for this bill. It is in many ways in the \neconomic interest of Arkansas to see this go forward and, in fact, it \nis going to pass.\n  In addition, the human rights community, while generally opposing \nPNTR, is not of one voice. It is not of a monolithic opinion. Not \neverybody in the human rights community believes that PNTR should go \ndown. Some, in fact, accept these arguments as being meritorious, that \nincreased trade will bring about liberalization in China, greater \ndemocratization, and eventually improvement in human rights. Good \npeople can and do disagree. That is the case when it comes to whether \nor not China should receive from us permanent normal trade relations.\n  I hope and pray the arguments that have been made by the PNTR \nproponents are all realized, that they are right on every point. I hope \nwhen they express their conviction that the best way to improve human \nrights in China is to see increased contact with the outside world, to \nsee increased trade, to be exposed to new ideas, to see an expansion of \nthe Internet, that all of those arguments are realized and realized \nsoon, not in the long term but in the short term.\n  We may eventually see political liberalization in China. I think we \nwill in the long term. But we should not assume PNTR or the WTO will be \nthe main driver of this change. While we hope for change in the long \nrun, I do not believe we can remain silent about Chinese abuses in the \nshortrun. We must not ignore the lessons of history.\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\n  I listened with great interest to much of the debate on the floor \nover the last 2 weeks, particularly the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, in whom I have the greatest admiration and respect for his \nscholarship and his mind, as he went through some of the historic \nlessons of China and talked of improvements in China's human rights \nrecord. In one sense, that is certainly true. It is better now than it \nwas during the Cultural Revolution, but let's not be selective in our \nrecounting of recent Chinese history.\n  During the winter months of 1978 and 1979, thousands of people in \nBeijing posted their written complaints and protests about the ills of \nChina on a stretch of blank wall on Chang'an Avenue. This voice of \nprotest, which became known as the democracy wall movement, was muzzled \nas the Chinese Government imprisoned its leaders such as Wei Jingsheng.\n  That same year of the crackdown on the democracy wall movement, the \nU.S. established diplomatic relations with China and signed a bilateral \ntrade agreement. Deng Xiaoping introduced a series of economic and \nlegal reforms, and international protests against repression in China \nwere drowned out by the promise of free-market initiatives. Twenty-one \nyears since the United States signed a bilateral trade agreement with \nChina, we have only seen increasing political repression and religious \npersecution.\n  Harvard professor Dani Rodrik expressed this sentiment when he said:\n\n       I would not assume, as many advocates of normalized trade \n     relations with China have done, that expanded trade will \n     necessarily produce greater democracy. . . . If the Chinese \n     leadership is truly interested in democratization, they do \n     not need the World Trade Organization to help them achieve \n     it. . . . There are no human rights prerequisites for WTO \n     membership. Even if the Chinese Government were to become \n     more repressive, existing WTO rules would not allow the U.S. \n     and other countries to withdraw trade privileges. The \n     pressure would have to be applied outside the WTO context.\n\n  What he is saying is if we cede the main tool we have for applying \nthis pressure, which has been the annual MFN debate, by passing the \nPNTR package, we are left with a toothless Levin-Bereuter commission. \nThis commission proposal, which is included in the PNTR package we will \nbe voting on, has been sold as a Helsinki Commission for China. As a \nHelsinki Commissioner, I know this proposed commission lacks a \ncornerstone, the Helsinki Final Act, which commits OSCE member nations \nto certain human rights standards. Without that foundation, we will \nsimply be duplicating the efforts of the U.S. State Department's Bureau \nof Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and we will find out from this \ncommission what we already know: Human rights in China are and at least \nfor the foreseeable future will remain deplorable.\n  It would be wrong for me not to recognize the economic arguments for \ngranting PNTR to China, and I have tried to acknowledge that. I believe \nbusiness and agriculture can determine their best interests, but here, \ntoo, we should recognize that inflated expectations could quickly be \npunctured by an unruly China. For all the anticipation and excitement \nin the business community over PNTR, we will face a recalcitrant \ntrading partner in China at the WTO. We will see the dispute settlement \nsystem and the very functioning of the WTO put to a great test.\n  In the final analysis, though I know PNTR is going to pass and though \nI realize there are going to be some very significant economic benefits \nto our country, and while I hope the best face and the great \nexpectations that have been propounded for this legislation will be \nrealized, I have concluded that I must vote no on this because the \nwords in the most recent State Department report on China keep echoing \nin my ears: ``The Government's respect for religious freedom \ndeteriorated markedly.'' It is the most recent report--and I cannot \nescape the judgment that it has not gotten better--that the conditions \nin China have deteriorated markedly.\n  In ancient Rome, the Roman Government did not really care what Roman \ncitizens believed. They did not care what their religious faith was or \nnecessarily if they even had a religious faith. What they did care \nabout was the supremacy of the Roman Government over its people and \nover all religions. Effectively, they said to their citizens: You can \nbelieve anything you want so long as you will affirm that Caesar is \nlord. It was not the beliefs of Christians that got them in trouble in \nthe Roman persecutions; it was the fact they would not make that \naffirmation that the Roman Government was supreme and that Caesar was \nlord.\n  It seems to me that is a clear analogy to the conditions in China \ntoday. There is religious freedom in China only insofar as every \nreligious group in China will affirm that the Chinese Government is \nultimately supreme. To the extent that any religious group defies that \nultimate standard, they then face intense persecution.\n  So for those reasons I will cast a ``no'' vote. I suspect that there \nwill be 20 to 25 Members who will cast that same vote. I hope for the \nbest outcome for PNTR, but for my own conscience I will cast a ``no'' \nvote next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8613-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8613-S8619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of \ngranting permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of \nChina. I support this move not only because of the tremendous economic \nbenefits that will flow to the U.S. economy--and to my home state of \nIllinois--as a result of Chinese WTO membership; I also support PNTR \nbecause I believe that a China that is engaged with the international \ncommunity--and which is reforming and privatizing its economy at home--\nwill be a more stable and a more democratic China, with improved human \nrights at home and a better relationship with its neighbor, Taiwan. \nPNTR will be an unqualified gain for both the United States and China; \nwe must not allow this bill to fail.\n  I first remind my fellow Senators of the many and impressive market \nopenings that the Chinese agreed to as a condition for their entry into \nthe World Trade Organization. The concessions won by U.S. negotiators \nare simply breathtaking:\n  Average tariffs for U.S. agricultural products will drop from 22% to \n17.5% by 2004. For beef, grapes, wine, poultry, and pork, average \ntariffs will fall from 31.5% to 14.5%. One in every three American \nacres that is planted is growing food for overseas markets. U.S. farm \nexports to China last year totaled $1 billion, making China the eighth \nlargest market for American farmers. And China will account for nearly \n40% of all future growth of U.S. farm exports.\n  Also under the bilateral agreement, average tariffs for U.S. \nmanufactured goods exported to China will fall from 24.6% to 9.4% by \n2005.\n  But even more important than the change in formal trade barriers are \nthe many fundamental market-opening changes that China has agreed to. \nUnder our 1979 agreement with the Chinese--the current foundation for \nU.S. trade with the China--many nontariff barriers block entry of U.S. \ngoods into China. These barriers consist of import licensing \nrequirements, registration and certification requirements, and \narbitrary technical and sanitary standards. Further, U.S. manufacturers \nthat operate in China often are required to transfer technology to \nChinese companies, use local materials, and to export a portion of \ntheir products abroad. Finally, many of these requirements are \nunpublished and are imposed arbitrarily. It is difficult for U.S. \ncompanies to know what restrictions will apply to their activities.\n  Under our Bilateral Agreement with the Chinese, China will publish \nits rules and make them available to U.S. companies. It will eliminate \ntechnology-transfer, local-content, and export requirements. And it \nwill impose only safety and sanitary standards that are scientifically \nbased.\n  China has also agreed to impressive changes in many areas of business \nwhere U.S. companies currently are effectively excluded. For example, \nin the area of:\n  Distribution rights: U.S. firms currently cannot run their own \ndistribution networks in China. Under the bilateral agreement, U.S. \ncompanies for the first time will be allowed to deliver their goods \ndirectly to retailers in China.\n  Retailing: Under the bilateral agreement, U.S. companies will be able \nto\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nopen their own stores in anywhere in China without restriction. U.S. \ncompanies will be able to maintain majority ownership of stores, and \nwill be able to sell U.S. products. The U.S. retailing industry is \nwithout peer--one-fifth of the U.S. workers work in retailing, and \nAmericans have perfected the trade. But if we don't enact PNTR and \nenter the Chinese retailing market, foreign firms--such as the French \nconglomerate Carrefour--will take our place.\n  Telecommunications and high technology: Foreign companies are \ncurrently prohibited from supplying telecommunications service in \nChina. But as a WTO member, China will join the Information Technology \nAgreement, and will eliminate all tariffs on computers, \ntelecommunications equipment, and semiconductors. China will also \nbecome a party to the Basic Telecommunications Agreement, adopting \ncost-based pricing, interconnection rights, and creating an independent \nregulatory authority. Foreign companies will be allowed to provide e-\nmail, voice-mail, on-line information and data-base retrieval, \nelectronic data interchange, and paging services. Foreign companies \nwill be allowed to hold a 30% share in Chinese service suppliers, \neventually going up to 50%. For cell-phone services, foreign companies' \nstake will be allowed to go from 25% to 49%.\n  Finally, it bears emphasis that the significance of all these changes \nis magnified by the sheer size of the Chinese market. America is the \nworld's largest exporter, and China will soon be the world's largest \npurchaser of consumer goods and services. In less than five years, \nChina will have more than 230 million middle-income consumers, with \nretail sales exceeding $900 billion annually. Gaining access to this \nenormous market is critical to American business and the future health \nof the U.S. economy. PNTR will provide that access. The Institute for \nInternational Economics estimates that the increase in world export of \ngoods to China that will result from China's entry to WTO will total \n$21.3 billion--and the immediate increase in U.S. exports to China will \nbe $3.1 billion. Goldman Sachs has estimated that by 2005, passage of \nPNTR will increase U.S. exports to China by $13 billion. This is, quite \nsimply, an opportunity that the United States must not pass up.\n\n  I also wish to emphasize today the benefits of PNTR to my home State \nof Illinois. Exports to China from Illinois totaled $901 million in \n1998, up 24% from 1993. China was the tenth largest export market for \nIllinois in 1998. And Illinois' exports to China are broadly \ndiversified, covering almost every major product category. A few areas \nstand out:\n  PNTR represents a tremendous opportunity for Illinois farmers. In \n1997, Illinois exported $3.7 billion in agricultural goods, ranking \nthird among all States.\n  Soybeans: Illinois is one of America's principal producers of \nsoybeans. Under the bilateral agreement, tariffs will be set at 3% for \nsoybeans and 5% for soybean meal, with no quota limits. For soybean \noil, quotas will be eliminated by 2006; the in-quota tariff (the only \ntariff that will remain after 2006) will be reduced to 9%. Soybean oil \nexports to China could double within five yeas after the United States \nenacts PNTR.\n  Corn: Illinois is also one of this Nation's main corn-producing \nStates. In 1998, China imported less than 250,000 metric tons of corn \nfrom all countries. But under the bilateral agreement, the quota on \ncorn imported to China will immediately rise to 4.5 million metric \ntons, climbing to 7.2 million tons by 2004. Corn within the quota will \nbe subject to only a 1% tariff. Corn exports to China could increase a \nhundred-fold by 2004.\n  Beef and pork: Illinois is the fourth largest State in pork \nproduction. Frozen pork cuts and pork offal tariffs will fall from 20% \nto 12%. China's tariff on frozen beef cuts will drop from 45% to 12%, \nand chilled beef tariffs will go from 45% to 25% by 2004. There will be \nno quota, and China has agreed to accept all pork and beef from the \nUnited States that is certified as wholesome by the USDA.\n  Fertilizers: All quotas on importation of fertilizer into China will \nbe eliminated by 2002, and tariffs will decline from 6% to 4%.\n  The insurance industry is not often discussed in the debate over \nPNTR, but it is important to my home State of Illinois. 140,000 jobs \ndepend on the insurance industry in Illinois. And for all the talk we \nhear from opponents of PNTR about trade deficits and jobs lost as a \nresult of trade, it is worth emphasizing that the U.S. actually has a \ntrade surplus in global trade in services such as insurance. The \nbilateral agreement will help us widen that surplus. China's market \ncurrently is almost completely closed to foreign insurers; most \nconsumers may choose only among a few state-run monopolies. The \nbilateral agreement will throw open the Chinese market for \ninsurance and reinsurance. With 1.2 billion people, China represents \nthe largest insurance market in the world--a market that is \nsignificantly underinsured at present. From 1993-98, however, growth in \nthe Chinese insurance market averaged almost 30% a year. Under the WTO \nagreement, foreign insurers will be allowed to offer group, health, and \npension lines of insurance, which represent about 85% of total \npremiums. China will also set clear licensing standards--with no \neconomic-needs tests or quantitative limits on the number of licenses \nissued--and will allow foreign insurers to sell their products \nthroughout the country, directly to Chinese consumers. The bilateral \nagreement will also serve as an excellent model for future WTO \nnegotiations on insurance trade. Although only two U.S. insurance \ncompanies currently are allowed to sell any insurance in China, over 20 \nhave recently set up offices there, and are poised to move quickly into \nthe Chinese market. PNTR will be a boon to the U.S. insurance industry \nand will generate high-paying jobs here in America.\n\n  Under the bilateral agreement, average tariffs on construction \nequipment will fall from 13.6% to 6.4%. China is an enormous potential \ngrowth market. According to the World Bank, China will need to spend an \nestimated $750 billion in new infrastructure over the next decade--\nincreasing demand for earth-moving equipment. Illinois firms are well-\nplaced to compete for this booming market.\n  But all of these benefits will not comes to the United States \nautomatically. We must grant PNTR to China. Some opponents of PNTR have \nclaimed that we need not give up annual review of China's NTR status, \nthat China would join the WTO anyway. They are half right. China's \naccession to the WTO only requires a two-thirds vote of all members--\neven a U.S. vote against China would not block their entry at this \npoint. However, once China does enter the WTO, the United States will \nbe required to comply with all WTO rules with regard to China in order \nto enjoy the benefits of Chinese membership in that organization. And \nthe main WTO rule is that all members must extend equal and \nunconditional trading rights to each other. This means that we must \nextend Normal Trading Relations to China unconditionally. If we do not \ngrant China PNTR before it enters the WTO, China would be able to \nchallenge the U.S. refusal--and the United States would be required to \ninvoke article XIII of the WTO agreement, suspending the application of \nWTO rules between itself and China. This would mean that every one of \nthe WTO's other 135 members--who account for 90% of world trade--would \nbe eligible for the benefit of Chinese WTO membership, but the United \nStates would not. And this includes the benefits that stem from the \nU.S.-Chinese bilateral accession agreement. The concessions that China \nmade to the United States, to secure our support for Chinese accession, \nwould be available to all other WTO members, but not to the United \nStates. We cannot let this happen--we cannot allow our trade \ncompetitors to eat our lunch in China.\n  It bears emphasis that by granting PNTR, the United States gives up \nno trade protections. China already enjoys normal trade relations with \nthe United States--our markets are already open to Chinese imports. The \nconcessions that were made as a condition to Chinese entry to WTO were \nall made by the Chinese--the U.S. gave up nothing, and PNTR will not \naffect a single American tariff or other trade barrier.\n  The only thing that the United States does give up by granting PNTR \nis the right to review China's NTR status annually. With this, we give \nup very little, for NTR review has not been an effective tool for \ninfluencing\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\nevents in China. Congress has renewed China's NTR status every year \nsince 1980. The Chinese no longer take the threat of review seriously--\nparticularly after NTR was again extended after the Tiananmen Square \nmassacre in 1989. The NTR procedure was originally enacted as the \nJackson-Vanik amendment to Trade Act of 1974. The official condition \nfor extending NTR is that the country being reviewed allow free \nemigration from its territory. The process was originally set up to \npressure the Soviet Union with regard to free emigration of Soviet \nJews. In other words, annual NTR review is a procedure that was set up \nto deal with an issue that does not concern us with regard to China, \nand to control the behavior of a country that no longer exists. Having \nlost its credibility over the last twenty years, it is time for annual \nNTR review to be retired.\n\n  But you need not take my word about the lack of leverage provided by \nannual review. Take the word of Fu Shenqui, a Chinese dissident who has \nbeen active in the human-rights movement in China since the 1979 \nDemocracy Wall movement, and who has been imprisoned for his activism \nthree separate times. Mr. Fu had this to say about the effectiveness of \nannual trade review:\n\n       [T]he annual argument over NTR renewal exerts no genuine \n     pressure on the Chinese Communists and performs absolutely no \n     role in compelling them to improve the human rights \n     situation. . . . [T]he improvement of the human rights \n     situation and the advancement of democracy in China must \n     mainly depend on the great mass of the Chinese people, in the \n     process of economic modernization, gradually creating the \n     popular citizen consciousness and democratic consciousness \n     and struggling for them. It will not be achieved through the \n     action of the U.S. Congress in debating Normal Trade \n     Relations . . .\n\n  Also consider the words of Bao Tong, a prominent Chinese dissident. \nIn an interview with the Washington Post, May 11, 2000, Mr. Bao said \nsimply: ``I appreciate the efforts of friends and colleagues to help \nour human rights situation, but it doesn't make sense to use trade as a \nlever. It just doesn't work.''\n  While annual review doesn't work, engagement does. Despite the \nfailure of the annual NTR process, the United States does still have a \nmeans of adding liberalization and democratization in China. The United \nStates can contribute to the reforms that have been building for the \nlast twenty years by supporting the reform faction in the Beijing \nregime; by providing an example of democracy and rule of law to \nindividual Chinese citizens; by getting the Chinese government involved \nin the international organizations and frameworks; and by aiding the \nprocess of private capital formation in China. And all of these things \ncan be accomplished by enacting PNTR and supporting Chinese membership \nin the WTO.\n  Zhu Rongji, the current Premier, is widely regarded as the most \nproreform leader in China. His group is friendly to the U.S., and they \nhave bet their future on WTO and PNTR. After two decades of rapid \ngrowth, China's economy appears to be faltering--growth is down \nsubstantially in the last few years, and deflation has plagued the \neconomy for over two years. The current leadership views WTO--and the \nreforms and market opening that it will entail--as a tool for reviving \na flagging economy. WTO has been the mostly hotly debated topic in \nChina since 1989. The reformers have agreed to adopt sweeping economic \nreforms in exchange for accession to the World Trade Organization. For \nthe U.S. to reject this offer of increased openness and reform would \ndeal a serious blow to the liberals in the Chinese government--and \ngreatly strengthen the hand of the Communist hardliners. The W.T.O. \naccession agreement also offers the Chinese reformers political cover--\nit would merge their domestic market reform agenda with international \ncommitments and Chinese membership in a prestigious international body. \nChina's opening would become not just one political faction's program, \nbut the new role of China as a participant in the international system. \nThe United States must seize this historic opportunity to establish \nfriendly relations with China, and to consolidate the current \natmosphere of openness and reform within that country. The Chinese \nliberals have done their part by negotiating the most ambitious market-\nliberalization agreement that nation has ever seen; now it is our turn \nto do our part.\n  Again, it is worth hearing the views of these matters of those for \nwhom China's future course is not just a theoretical concern. Martin \nLee is the Chairman of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong. He emphasizes \nthat ``the participation of China in the WTO would not only have \neconomic and political benefits, but would also serve to bolster those \nin China who understand that the country must embrace the rule of \nlaw.''\n  Dai Quing is a Chinese investigative journalist and environmentalist \nand the winner of the 1992 Golden Pen for Freedom award given by the \nInternational Federation of Newspaper Publishers. Ms. Dai was recently \nimprisoned in China for 10 months on account of her writings. She \nnevertheless favors granting China PNTR She says:\n\n       I have heard on the news that two of the groups I admire \n     most in the U.S.--the AFL-CIO and the Sierra Club--are \n     against granting permanent normal trade relations with China. \n     . . . As a Chinese environmentalist and human-rights \n     activist, I disagree with their position. . . . I believe \n     that permanent normal trade status, with its implication of \n     openness and fairness, is among the most powerful means of \n     promoting freedom in China. Starting in 1978, the open-door \n     policy completely changed the way China responded to the \n     world. Today, PNTR is a powerful means to keep China's doors \n     as open as possible.\n\n  WTO membership and PNTR will not only keep China open to the West, \nbut will improve conditions within that country. The market reforms \nthat will come to China as a result of PNTR--both a requirements of \nWTO, and as necessary changes in the face of increased competition--\nwill help to directly liberalize Chinese society. These changes will \ninclude a much freer flow of information to China; as the economy \nadvances, more information technology will fall into private hands, and \nthe overall volume of communication will increase, making it much more \ndifficult for the government to monitor and control its people.\n  Also, market reforms will assist the growth of civil society and the \ndemocratization of China by reducing the dependence of individual \nChinese on the state sector. Although private business's share of the \nChinese economy is ever increasing, a majority of Chinese workers still \nwork for some form of a collectively owned enterprise. These state \nworkers are paid very little in actual wages; instead, they receive \nmuch of their compensation in the form of subsidized housing, health \ncare, child care, food, clothing, and education. State workers' \nreliance on these government-provided benefits greatly increases the \ngovernment's power over these individuals. Those who depend on the \ngovernment for their necessities are generally loath to criticize it--\nor to do anything that may incur its wrath and jeopardize their ability \nto simply get by. Increased private ownership and employment in China \nwill break this cycle of dependence, and will do much to loosen the \ngovernment's grip on its citizens.\n  But again, you need not take my word for it. We have heard much talk \nabout human rights from those opposed to PNTR with China. Let us also \nlisten to those on the front lines in the fight for democracy and \ngreater freedom in China:\n  The China Democracy Party was founded two years ago in Zhejiang, \nChina. Many of its members are currently imprisoned or under house \narrest in China. The party has issued the following statement, which \ndeserves the attention of all those concerned about political reform in \nChina:\n\n       The China Communist government is planted in state \n     ownership. The very base for government power is in each and \n     every state-owned company and farm. Bringing China into the \n     international community will speed China's economic \n     privatization and its development, thus [converting] state \n     ownership into private ownership. This change will \n     tremendously weaken the state ownership that the Communist \n     government power basically relies on.\n\n  The same point is made by prodemocracy leader Ren Wanding, who simply \nstates:\n\n       A free and private economy forms the base for a democratic \n     . . . [WTO membership] will make China's government organs \n     and legal system evolve toward democracy.\n\n  Greater openness and trade for China will also increase China's \ncommunication with the outside world. This will not only introduce more \nChinese to liberal ideas and principles, but will also\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\nincrease international awareness of conditions within China. Again, as \nthe China Democracy Party declares in its official statement: ``the \ncloser the economic relationship between the United States and China, \nthe more chances for the United States to politically influence China, \nthe more chances to monitor human rights conditions in China, and [the] \nmore effective the United States [will be] to push China to launch \npolitical reforms.''\n  And finally, the emergence of alternative power centers--especially \nprivate business--will fuel the growth of a civil society--of \ninstitutions and practices that are independent of political power. \nCivil society offers a check on government, and forms the bedrock of \npolitical democracy. As independent power centers become more important \nin China, the state will be forced to concede some power to them. This \nis the pattern that has led to democracy across East Asia--in South \nKorea, in Taiwan, and in the Philippines. Just as in these countries, \nmarket reforms and private sector growth can also be expected to lead \nto political liberalization in China.\n  In this regard, it is worth considering the concerns of those who do \nnot favor great openness and democracy in China. A story in the \nWashington Post, on March 13, 2000, notes that:\n\n       China's security services, including the People's \n     Liberation Army, are concerned, analysts say, that joining \n     the WTO will mark another step toward privatizing China's \n     economy and importing even more Western ideas about \n     management and civil society--a headache for those whose job \n     it is to ensure the longevity of the one-party Communist \n     state.\n\n  By voting for PNTR, we give the hardliners in China even more to \nworry about. We must pass this important legislation--not just for our \nown economic benefit, but to encourage and accelerate the reforms and \nopenings that are currently taking place in China. We must not let this \nhistoric opportunity slip away.\n  Some have also suggested that the grant of PNTR must be tempered by \nour concern for China's neighbor Taiwan. But the bill that we are \nvoting on today--the House version of PNTR--already includes a \nprovision asking that the WTO approve the accession of both China and \nTaiwan at the same WTO session. The United States must remain committed \nto that policy--of immediate Taiwanese membership in the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  It bears mention that Chen Shui-Ban, the recently elected President \nof Taiwan, also supports China's entry into the WTO club. In a March 22 \ninterview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Chen stated:\n\n       We would welcome the normalization of U.S.-China relations, \n     just like we hope that cross-strait relations [will improve]. \n     . . . We look forward to both the People's Republic of \n     China's and Taiwan's accession to WTO.\n\n  Few have more at stake in China's future course--and in its attitude \ntoward its neighbors--than the Taiwanese. Their leaders support China \nPNTR.\n  Finally, enacting PNTR will build on the edifice of free trade that \nthe United States has been constructing for the last 50 years. This \ndecade, in particular, has seen some impressive strides toward free \ntrade, with the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in \n1993 and the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994. When \nthose agreements were set in place, we heard dire warnings from the \nnaysayers of trade, who predicted a giant sucking sound of good jobs \nand capital investment leaving this country. But we need no longer \nevaluate those predictions in the abstract. Since that time, the rest \nof the 1990s have elapsed, and we can see the product of the modern \nfree-trade regime. Since the enactment of NAFTA and GATT, we have seen:\n  More jobs: In the 1990s, total civilian employment in the United \nStates has surged by 16 million jobs.\n  Better jobs: Over 80% of the new jobs created since 1993 have been in \nindustry/occupation categories that pay above-median wages. 65% are in \nthe highest-paying third of job categories.\n  Families are better off: Between 1993 and 1998, real average \nhousehold income has grown between 9.9% and 11.7% for every quintile of \nthe income distribution. For African-Americans, it has grown by 15%. \nFor families in the lowest quintile, income rose at a 2.7% annual rate.\n  Trade brings more and better jobs: Last year, international trade \nsupported over 12 million American jobs. Exports to China alone \nsupported over 200,000 American jobs directly, and tens of thousands \nmore jobs indirectly. And these export-related jobs are better jobs, \npaying on average 17% more than non-export related jobs.\n  The trade naysayers also warned that free trade would lead to capital \nflight from the United States--that as soon as we let down our trade \nbarriers, all of our factories would relocate abroad and that new \ninvestments would follow them. It hasn't happened. Instead, our \nmanufacturing base is thriving:\n  Manufacturing output has gone up, not down: Since 1992, manufacturing \noutput in the United States has risen by 42%. Domestic output of motor \nvehicles has shot up 51%, and domestic automobile employment has \nincreased by 177,000 to almost 1 million. America remains the world's \ntop exporter of manufactured goods. Among America's leading exports in \n1998 were aircraft, computer equipment, telecommunications equipment, \nvalves and transistors, passenger cars, and car parts.\n  Direct investment in the United States is soaring: In the 1990s, the \nUnited States has been the world's largest recipient of foreign \ninvestment. In 1999, fixed nonresidential private investment in the \nUnited States exceeded $1 trillion.\n  Low-wage countries are not siphoning away investment: From 1994-98, \nU.S. manufacturing investment in Mexico averaged $1.7 billion annually. \nBut in 1997, U.S. investment in U.S. manufacturing totaled $192 \nbillion. In 1998, 80% of U.S. investment in foreign manufacturing was \nin other high-wage countries. (The top five destinations were Great \nBritain, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Singapore.) Rather than \nlow wages, investors seek countries with economic stability, well-\ndeveloped infrastructure, lucrative market potential, and skilled \nworkers. We have nothing to fear from lower barriers to U.S. investment \nin underdeveloped countries such as China.\n  Finally, it bears mention the trade also benefits American consumers. \nFree trade has reduced the prices that American consumers pay for \neveryday goods--saving the average American family of four as much as \n$3,000 a year.\n  In the early 1990s, we might have doubted. But we rejected the \ncounsel of the trade scaremongers, those who thought that the United \nStates would not be able to compete in a free-trade world. And today we \nare better off for it--with more and better jobs, a stronger \nmanufacturing base, and a better standard of living. It is time to \nbuild upon success, and enact the next item in the free trade agenda, \nby putting into law China PNTR.\n  I have previously spoken on the floor of the Senate about the \nimportance of this agreement to the U.S. economy, how it will help \nincrease jobs in manufacturing and business activities here as we can \nmore readily export goods to China. By joining the World Trade \nOrganization and having the U.S. Government grant permanent normal \ntrade relations to China, China will be forced to lower its tariffs on \ngoods that it is importing from the United States. That will enable us \nto export more products to the world's largest market.\n  This agreement is of particular importance to the State of Illinois, \nand that is because Illinois is a major exporting State. If Illinois \nwere a freestanding nation, it would be one of the largest exporting \nnations in the entire world. Not only do we have a large agricultural \neconomy--we are the third largest agricultural producer in the United \nStates--but in addition, we have a diverse manufacturing base. It is \nhoped that after this agreement is implemented, we will be able to \nexport more corn, more soybeans, more cattle, more beef production, as \nwell as more pork production, to China. China, with 1.3 billion mouths \nto feed, is a potentially vast market for U.S. agricultural products.\n  In addition, we have large manufacturing concerns in Illinois, such \nas Caterpillar based in Peoria, with factories all over the State of \nIllinois; John Deere based in the quad cities part of our State; and \nMotorola, one of the largest manufacturers of cell phones and other \nhigh-tech products. This agreement will benefit businesses such as \nthose and thousands of other smaller businesses in Illinois that make\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nproducts which they will be more easily able to export to China \nfollowing this agreement.\n  During this debate on PNTR, the economic reasons for voting in favor \nof this agreement have been thoroughly addressed. Opponents have argued \nthat somehow this agreement will cause the United States to lose jobs. \nThey made those same dire warnings in the early 1990s when we were \nconsidering the free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that became \nknown as NAFTA, as well as when we were going into the World Trade \nOrganization. There were dire predictions of a giant sucking sound of \njobs going across the border.\n  Those predictions have not been borne out. In the intervening years, \nwe have seen our economy grow dramatically. We have added 16 million \njobs in the intervening years, and we continue to create jobs, high-\npaying jobs, at a very dramatic rate.\n  Not only that, the most recent statistics show that more capital is \nbeing invested in the United States than anywhere else in the world \nright now.\n  Of the capital that our manufacturers are investing in foreign \ncountries, they are not, as predicted, investing it all in low-cost \npoorer underdeveloped countries, but, in fact, the largest recipients \nof U.S. capital, in recent years, have been advanced nations such as \nGreat Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n  It turns out that our manufacturers, when they have wanted to invest \nabroad, have not only looked for low-cost--that certainly would be a \nplus--but they have looked for stable economies, with good \ninfrastructures, and strong, skilled labor forces, as well as good \nmarket potential. So I think the opponents of the expansion of free \ntrade have been mistaken when they predicted that it would hurt our \njobs for us in this country and harm our economy.\n  But there is one other side to this, in which the opponents say, even \nif they can see the economic argument in favor of free trade, they \nargue that we should vote against free trade with China for moral \nreasons. I wanted to take the floor to address those arguments because \nI disagree strongly with what they have said.\n  Many opponents of permanent normal trade relations with China have \nsuggested that by giving up the annual review of our trade status with \nChina, we will lose any leverage we have to affect human rights \nconditions in that nation. But here, too, I believe the opponents of \nthe agreement are wrong.\n  First, the Chinese Communists no longer take the annual trade review \nprocess seriously. Congress has renewed that status every year since it \nwas first granted in 1979. Whatever credibility the annual process of \ngranting normal trade relations to China has had, that all evaporated \nwhen China was granted that status in 1989 following the Tiananmen \nSquare massacre.\n  While annual review does not work, engagement does. The most \nimmediate effect of granting permanent normal trade relations to China \nwill be to shore up the position of the reformers in the Chinese \nGovernment. Zhu Rongji, the current Premier, is widely regarded as the \nmost pro-reform leader in China. Mr. Rongji has staked his career on \nthe passage of this agreement and the future of permanent normal trade \nrelations.\n  China's impending WTO membership has been the most hotly debated \ntopic in China since 1989. The current leadership has agreed to adopt \nsweeping economic reforms in exchange for Chinese accession to the WTO. \nShould we accept China into that body, these reforms will be cemented \ninto place. They will become an international commitment, enforceable \nthrough the WTO's multilateral enforcement mechanism. But should the \nUnited States reject China's offer of increased openness, we would deal \na serious blow to China's reformers and greatly strengthen the hand of \nCommunist hard-liners.\n  PNTR will also contribute to the development of a freer and more \ndemocratic society in China at the grassroots. The reforms accompanying \nChina's WTO admission would accelerate the growth of the private sector \nin China and will make it possible for more Chinese to work for foreign \ncompanies. These changes are important for the progression of freedom \nin China.\n  What most people do not think about in this debate is that at the \ncurrent time most Chinese workers are employed by their Government. I \nthink the figure is close to 70 percent. These workers are paid minimal \nwages, very low wages. Most of their compensation is in the form of \nhousing, health care, and education. They have to work in order to get \nthose benefits.\n  But state workers' reliance on these benefits greatly increases the \nChinese Government's control over them. Individuals who depend on the \nstate for basic necessities are generally loath to criticize the \nGovernment or otherwise to incur its wrath.\n  Increased private ownership, which will result from China's accession \ninto the World Trade Organization, and increased employment by private \ncompanies--American, European, and companies from around the world--\ndoing business in China, employing Chinese workers in the private \nsector, will help break the Chinese people's cycle of dependence on the \nGovernment and will do much to loosen the Government's grip over its \ncitizens.\n  Moreover, the emergence of alternative power centers in China, \nthrough private enterprise and the accumulation of private property, \nwill spur the growth of civil society in China, fostering institutions \nand practices that are beyond political control.\n  Civil society offers a check on government and forms the bedrock of \npolitical democracy. As independent institutions become more important \nin China, the state will inevitably cede some power to them. This is \nthe path that has led to democracy across Asia, in South Korea, in \nTaiwan, and in the Philippines.\n  Members of the Senate need not take my word for this. As Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently noted:\n\n       History has demonstrated that implicit in any removal of \n     power from central planners and broadening of market \n     mechanisms . . . is a more general spread of rights to \n     individuals. Such a development will be a far stronger \n     vehicle to foster other individual rights than any other \n     alternative of which I am aware.\n\n  Thus, I am making the argument that has not really been made too \noften in this whole debate: That not only is this agreement good for \nour economy, for our job creation, and for our business sector, but \nadoption of this agreement in the legislation we will vote on on \nTuesday will be good for the Chinese people because it will ultimately \nbreed more freedom within that country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this has been a very worthwhile \ndiscussion of an issue that has bedeviled the Congress on an annual \nbasis for too many years. We now are considering a bill that has the \neffect of answering a question that doesn't have to be considered each \nyear in the future.\n  Although the amendments that have been offered ran the gamut of \nChinese transgressions and shortcomings, both real and imagined, and \nmany are very troubling, I am supporting this bill as reported by the \nFinance Committee.\n  Two months ago I read an editorial in the Wall Street Journal which \nreflected my thoughts on the relationship between our concerns about \nChinese proliferation of technology and missiles on the one hand and \nour trade interests on the other. The editorial appeared in the July \n19, 2000 edition of the paper and I saved it to put in the Record \nduring this debate because in my view it answers in a thoughtful and \npersuasive way why this bill should be passed by the Senate and sent \ndirectly to the President for his signature.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       China, Trade and Missiles\n\n       The test of an Iranian medium-range ballistic missile \n     Saturday raised further U.S. concerns that China is exporting \n     technology that could destabilize other areas of the world. \n     U.S. intelligence officials believe that Beijing continues to \n     sell components and know-how to aid the Iranian and Pakistani \n     missile programs, despite U.S. objections. They fear as well \n     that Iran is developing longer-range missiles capable of \n     reaching well outside the Middle East.\n       These suspicions have spurred the U.S. Senate to hold up \n     the passage of Permanent Normal Trading Relations (PNTR) for \n     China. A bill is now pending to require tougher sanctions if \n     Beijing continues to support the spread of such weapons.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\n       The Senate's annoyance seems justified, even if the various \n     proposals for retaliation might not be. A few years ago the \n     Clinton Administration extracted promises from Beijing to \n     curtail exports of technology for weapons of mass \n     destruction, as well as whole missiles. But it has made no \n     progress on stopping ``dual-use'' technology exports to Iran \n     and Pakistan--technology that might have either military or \n     commercial applications.\n       Given that developing nations seldom test missiles with \n     peaceful purposes in mind, the Senators are prodding American \n     and Chinese officials to come to some agreement about \n     controlling the spread of such technology. Several U.S. \n     officials, including Defense Secretary William Cohen, have \n     been to Beijing in recent weeks to hash out the issue. But \n     there seems only to have been an ``exchange of views.''\n       Pressure from Congress is certainly useful here, but there \n     should be a clear line drawn when it comes to PNTR. Both \n     sides in the debate tend to over-emphasize the link between \n     trade and China's behavior on human rights, weapons \n     proliferation and other concerns. This is a mistake. Normal \n     trade relations should be weighed on its own merits.\n       Passage of PNTR would not belittle the seriousness of \n     China's peddling of missiles, components and weapons \n     technology to anti-American Iran. But that problem needs to \n     be addressed in other ways that would not undermine America's \n     interest in advancing free trade and encouraging movement by \n     China toward a free market economy.\n       Pursuing missile defense for the U.S. and its allies is one \n     quite appropriate response. China complains frequently about \n     American moves to develop a national missile defense. The \n     obvious counter is that it is made necessary partly by the \n     PRC's contributions to weapons proliferation.\n       Sorting out a U.S. policy toward China is possible only by \n     looking at the big picture. Global political stability will \n     be enhanced if China continues to advance economically and \n     learns to observe international rules dealing with trade and \n     investment. World Trade Organization membership for China \n     affords no guarantee against a future conflict, but there is \n     a sound argument to be made that development of a prospering \n     middle class in China will push the regime toward greater \n     moderation in both domestic and foreign policy, partly \n     because China will have more to lose from failed adventures.\n       In an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal's \n     editorial staff, Admiral Dennis Blair, Commander in Chief of \n     U.S. Pacific Command, emphasized the strategic importance of \n     nurturing a working relationship with China so that a habit \n     of trust and cooperation can over time replace a tradition of \n     confrontation. Military exchanges, regional peacekeeping and \n     humanitarian exercises, and normalized trade all further the \n     goals of Americans security and Asian stability in the \n     future. The U.S. and China may not share the same vision for \n     the region, but they can find common interests.\n       Simply comparing the PRC's mild treatment of this year's \n     Taiwanese elections with their more ominous military \n     maneuvers during the 1996 election reveals how China does \n     respond when the U.S. stands firm. The missile tests four \n     years ago alienated the Taiwanese public and forced the U.S. \n     to make its commitment to Taiwan more explicit by sending \n     aircraft carriers to the area. Beijing has evidently drawn \n     some conclusions from this and changed its behavior. The U.S. \n     now must make China perceive the seriousness of the missile \n     proliferation issue.\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says that PNTR will pass \n     after some appropriations legislation is cleared. But it \n     certainly doesn't help the case for normalized trade in an \n     American election year if China is perceived to be thumbing \n     its nose at the U.S. on an issue important to the security of \n     the U.S. and its allies. Indeed, its intransigence merely \n     encourages lawmakers in their efforts to dilute PNTR with \n     anti-proliferation trade sanctions.\n       If there is an assumption in Beijing that it can be less \n     observant of U.S. concerns now that its WTO membership seems \n     assured, the Chinese leadership is making a serious mistake. \n     They too have a stake in there being a constructive working \n     relationship between the two countries. A wise leadership \n     would not risk that relationship for the paltry earnings from \n     sales of a few missiles or missile parts.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate voted on several \namendments to the bill establishing permanent normal trade relations \nstatus for the People's Republic of China. While I was unfortunately \nunable to cast my votes regarding these amendments, I was able to \ncomment on a few of them. Today I wish to comment on the remaining \namendments.\n  Two of the amendments argued were introduced by our colleague from \nNorth Carolina. I supported the first amendment offered by Senator \nHelms, regarding family planning, abortion, and sterilization practices \nin China. Although the amendment failed by ten votes, I am pleased the \nSenate made a strong statement regarding these abhorrent practices.\n  While I agreed with Senator Helms on his first amendment, I did not \nagree with him on his second measure. American industries have set the \nstandard for appropriate business practice, and even though I agree \nwith Senator Helms that they ought to utilize these practices in China, \nI do not believe another layer of bureaucracy is necessary to \naccomplish this mission.\n  I would also have voted against Senator Feingold's amendment \nregarding the Congressional-Executive Commission established in H.R. \n4444. I believe the parameters with which the Commission was \nestablished in the House of Representatives are adequate, and that \nadditional requests or requirements from its members are not \nimperative.\n  Finally, the Senate considered an amendment offered by Senator \nWellstone. Without question, the issues surrounding political prisoners \nand detainees who have attempted to organize should be addressed by the \nPeople's Republic of China. However, I believe the administration \nalready has the tools necessary to address these very concerns. I would \nnot have voted for Senator Wellstone's amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4444, \nthe U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. This bill is the most significant \nforeign policy-related legislation that we have debated during the \n106th Congress.\n  H.R. 4444 presents tremendous new export opportunities for our \nmanufacturers, farmers, and service providers. While China has had \nexcellent access to the U.S. market for 20 years, U.S. access to \nChina's enormous market has been limited. With the enactment of this \nlegislation, and China's accession to the WTO, that situation is about \nto change.\n  The United States is finally going to enjoy virtually unfettered \naccess to China's vast market. The impact on my State of Kansas will be \nsubstantial. China agreed to end corn export subsidies, increase import \nquotas for wheat and corn, and reduce soybean tariffs. China agreed to \nlower its tariff on beef from 45 to 12 percent and on pork from 20 to \n12 percent. China agreed to accept USDA safety certification for meat \nand pork exports.\n  And agriculture is not the only sector in my State that will benefit \nfrom China's accession to the WTO. Black & Veatch will see lower \ntariffs on imported equipment, which will reduce the contract cost of \nprojects won in China. Boeing will have a more stable economic \nenvironment in which to sell airplanes to China's airlines.\n  Granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China will \nincrease our exports to the world's most populous country. But, more \nimportantly, bringing China into the WTO will put the PRC on a \ncollision course with economic and political liberalization.\n  Mr. President, China has been ruled by the Communist Party with an \niron grip for more than 50 years. But WTO accession comes with a price. \nWTO accession will usher the forces of globalization into China in a \nvery permanent way. Globalization will be good for China's economy \nbecause it will integrate China's economy into the world's economy. \nGlobalization will also force the systemic reform of China's \ninefficient state-owned enterprises and banking system.\n  But globalization will also have a much more profound effect on \nChina. Globalization will force upon China the infrastructure necessary \nfor greater political liberalization. Globalization will require China \nto have a stronger adherence to the rule of law and property rights. \nGlobalization will create a stronger middle class in China that will \ndemand greater freedom with which to enjoy their new position. \nGlobalization will bring the internet into tens of millions of Chinese \nhomes, exposing the Chinese people to Western standards of political \nand religious freedom, and human rights.\n  I ardently believe that PNTR and human rights must go hand in hand. \nIt is important to note that my positive position on PNTR gives me a \ndoor to walk through to raise a number of human rights issues with the \nChinese Government, including religious liberty and the development of \nthe rule of law.\n\n  Somehow, an intellectual myth has been adopted, dictating only two \nways to deal with China. Either grant PNTR status but never raise these \nissues, which gives an unfortunate, unbridled affirmation regarding \nknown abuses. Or the second method which mandates\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\na complete isolation from any relationship other than that of \nrepeatedly dunning this government with ill will and no positive \nincentives. Such vitriol does not work with people and it does not work \nwith governments, and ultimately, nothing changes for those who suffer.\n  I propose a third way which calls for a relationship where we \ngenuinely raise these issues in a serious, sustained dialogue. I do, in \nfact, raise these issues continuously. This way, will in the end, get \nreligious prisoners free, and create an independent judiciary not ruled \nby Communist dogma, and give China pause the next time another \nTiananmen Square breaks out. Ultimately, this way engenders freedom and \nhuman rights better than either of those other two methods. After all, \nisn't that what this is all about?\n  One final note: I hope that the Chinese Government does not think \nthat the tabling of the Thompson amendment is the end of the \nproliferation debate in the Senate. China must stop engaging in the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Clinton \nadministration has failed miserably to curb such proliferation. That is \nwhy there has been support to legislate antiproliferation policy in the \nabsence of an executive proliferation policy.\n  Mr. President, China must stop making weapons of mass destruction \navailable to rogue nations around the world. We need to open up trade \nwith China to increase our exports and to increase the exposure of the \nChinese people to economic and political liberalization. But trade must \nnot come at the expense of national security. Ignoring China's \nproliferation activities while we increase our trade ties with China \nwould be a grave mistake. We must be vigilant and enforce current U.S. \nlaw as it pertains to proliferation. The Clinton administration's \nfailure to do so has jeopardized national security. Congress must not \npermit future administrations to make the same mistake.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, there have been numerous efforts over the \npast several months to find a way to come to agreement on how to \nproceed to the so-called H-1B bill, which is a bill to provide for \nadditional high-tech workers to come into this country. Since we have \nalready reached the limit, I believe, for this year, there is a need \nfor additional workers in this area. We have negotiated back and forth. \nAt one point we were talking about 10 amendments on each side. Then we \ngot down to seven, six, and yet Senator Daschle and I were working to \nsee if we could clear five amendments.\n  Then you get into all kinds of discussions. Are these just relevant \namendments or can it be five agreed-to amendments? How do we deal with \nSenators who would want to add clearly unrelated amendments that could \ntake down the whole issue?\n  Without questioning the motives of anybody, I think Senator Daschle \nand I have been serious in trying to work something out. We have tried \nrepeatedly, but there have been objections for one reason or another on \nboth sides. I do not think we can pursue that any further, although one \nof the major problems, I had a Senator tell me yesterday maybe he would \nfeel he would not object by Tuesday. But if we wait until Tuesday, then \nwe have lost more days. So if we should be able to come to agreement \nthat would be good. We could vitiate cloture and go to it. If we \ncannot, we need to go ahead and get to this issue.\n  Hopefully we can get cloture, and when we do, relevant amendments \nwould still be in order, and we still would have to go through a \nconference. Obviously, there would be input from both sides of the \naisle, both sides of the Capitol, and from the administration on the \nfinal contours on this bill. But we are down to the point now where \nthere are a number of important bills remaining on the calendar, and if \nwe don't find a way to address them one of two things will happen: They \neither won't be considered in a conference at the end of the session, \nor they will be considered in such a way that they will be added to \nsome other bill, unrelated, some appropriations conference report, or \nsomething else.\n  At times that is the best way to proceed, and we should keep that \noption open. But I would prefer to have the Senate act its will on a \nbill of this type and relevant amendments be offered and debated and \nvoted on. So that is what I want to try to set up here.\n  I have notified the Democratic leader--he has a representative here--\nthat this is what we are going to do now, that we would move to a \ncloture motion and then we will get to vote on it next week.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to proceed to S. 2045, the H-1B \nlegislation, and send the cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the motion to proceed to calendar No. 490, S. \n2045, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect \nto H-1B Non-Immigrant Aliens:\n         Trent Lott, Chuck Hagel, Spencer Abraham, Phil Gramm, Jim \n           Bunning, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Sam Brownback, Rod \n           Grams, Jesse Helms, John Ashcroft, Gordon Smith of \n           Oregon, Pat Roberts, Slade Gorton, Connie Mack, John \n           Warner and Robert Bennett.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this cloture vote will occur, unless there \nis some intervening agreement, on Tuesday. I ask unanimous consent the \ncloture vote occur immediately following the passage of H.R. 4444, and \nthe mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nwant to make a comment to the majority leader.\n  This H-1B visa bill is important to all of us. It is important to \nthose on the Democratic side of the aisle as well. We recognize that \nour economy is experiencing substantial and sustained growth, \nunparalleled growth, and to keep that on track we have to ensure our \nhigh-tech industry has the employees it needs.\n  I was at a company in California some while ago and the president of \nthe company said we have 2,000 open positions for engineers right now \nthat we can't fill. There is not any way for us to fill them--2,000 \njobs, engineers we need and we can't get. So we understand this issue. \nWe want it to be resolved.\n  I must say, the Democratic leader is not here today. On his behalf, I \nwould mention to you that with regard to the\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\ndiscussions that you and he have had about the potential for five \namendments on a side--he was fairly optimistic about being able to \nclear that. We think that can be resolved. We hope it can be resolved \non next Tuesday. It is our understanding the Republican leader was \namenable in those discussions to an agreement that would allow five \namendments on each side related to H-1B or to technology-related job \ntraining, education, and access.\n  It is also our understanding the Republican leader was amenable to \nour Democratic leader, or his designee, offering a Latino fairness \namendment and a Liberian adjustment amendment.\n  I want to make a comment on his behalf that support of relief for \nimmigrants who have fled wars in Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, and \nGuatemala, and to other longtime residents who have been in the United \nStates since before 1986 is important to ensure fairness in the \nimmigration system. If we do this, we will immediately increase the \nsize of the legal workforce and also alleviate the shortage of low-\nskilled workers, and we will keep families together.\n  We believe our offer is reasonable. We hope we can work out an \nagreement. I think the discussions we have had about the five \namendments on each side is something that should give us some hope that \nwe will be able to resolve this soon and certainly before this Congress \nadjourns.\n  It is a very important issue. You want to address it. We want to \naddress it. We believe we should find a way to connect here and reach \nagreement to do so.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield on another point? He and I have \ndiscussed the fact that we need to make sure that, wherever possible, \nsome of these high-tech jobs be available in areas now that are \nunderserved--rural areas, including my own State and the State of North \nDakota and several other States. I think Nebraska would be in that \ngroup. You know, you can't direct where those jobs go, but we could \nencourage some of those programs, some of these people to be taken into \nareas where there are not now opportunities, that training be available \nfor them. That certainly would be very attractive so we do not have the \nhigh-tech industry only concentrated on the west coast and Northern \nVirginia or in some other areas, but to try to spread it as much as \npossible. That is an issue I would like us to consider.\n  With regard to the immigrant problems, I think, as he knows, we have \nin the past supported some movement in that area. I believe there is \nsome application now to Nicaraguans that are here. Of course that \ncauses some of the problems. Some of their neighbors don't have that \nsame consideration. We should look at this issue. We should do it \nthoughtfully. But that is one of the problems.\n  H-1B has been pending a long time. We need to get it done. The \nargument can be made that these are different issues. For instance, I \nunderstand the other issues mentioned would not be relevant postcloture \nto the bill, but I do think it is going to be an issue that is going to \nbe discussed as we get to the end of this session to see if there is \nsome way some of those can be addressed. The Senator is talking, in \nsome instances, about a relatively small number of people. One he \nmentioned was Liberian immigrants, focused primarily on one State. \nMaybe something can be done on that.\n  I want us to find a way to get this bill done. It has been dragging \nfor 6 months. We are down to the last 2 weeks of the fiscal year. I am \ntrying to set up a process that guarantees we get to a conclusion while \nwe continue to work with those on both sides who may have objections.\n  The problem we have is, if you include these three, four, or five, \nyou will have other people who will say: What about this issue, that \nwould cause a filibuster to begin and we would wind up having to pull \ndown the bill. I would rather that not be the end result.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield further \nunder my reservation, as he knows, it is even difficult to agree to \nfive amendments. We are willing to do that. The Democratic leader wants \nthis bill done. I want it done. My colleagues want it done. We risk \nending this session not doing something that we know should be done. We \nneed to do this H-1B bill, and we need to increase the number of these \nvisas.\n  Let me also respond to the point the Senator from Mississippi made a \nmoment ago. The Senator from Mississippi pointed out that if we bring \nadditional people in to fill jobs here, which makes sense--I much \nprefer they come in and fill jobs in this country rather than have the \ncompany move their operations to India or some other country--it makes \nsense also not to move all of those jobs into the same part of the \ncountry. Because information technology now allows us to do this work \nanyplace in the country, what about targeting some areas of the country \nwhere we have had outmigration, where we have lost population? That is \nwhat the Senator from Mississippi said. I think it makes eminent good \nsense. I hope we can work on at least a piece of that.\n  I will not object. Again I say it is our intention to get this \nlegislation passed. We think the proposal offered in the last couple of \ndays makes sense. We think we can probably clear that in the manner \npreviously discussed between Senator Daschle and Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now withdraw the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The motion is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has up to 20 \nminutes. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8620-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8620-S8623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BUDGET SURPLUSES AND DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \ndiscuss the fiscal policy questions that are ricocheting around this \nChamber, and the House as well, about what the future will hold with \nrespect to tax cuts, budget surpluses and/or deficits, investments in \neducation, the possibility of reducing Federal indebtedness, and other \nspending. I want to talk about that because we now have a discussion in \nthis town about the potential for big recurring budget surpluses every \nsingle year.\n  It was not too many years ago in Washington, DC, that we had the \nleading economists in the country saying the 1990s would be a decade of \nanemic economic growth. We had very large budget deficits, the country \nwas not doing well, and the economists said for the next decade this \neconomy is going to grow very slowly.\n  The economists did not know what they were talking about then. That \nis not unusual. I always thought there should be some sort of standard \nby which we measure economists and evaluate whether what they say has \nany validity in terms of what we experience. Of course, we have no such \nyardsticks, so these economists keep on talking and people keep on \nlistening. That is why I am here today: What do we expect in the \nfuture, and what should we do in this country as a reasonable response \nto those expectations.\n  I want to for a moment talk about the early 1990s and recall where we \nwere. The unified budget deficit in 1992 was $290 billion and rising--\n$290 billion just for that year and rising. Now we have a surplus in \nthe year 2000. Economists said we would have continual, larger and \nlarger deficits. That was wrong. We now have a surplus.\n  Economic growth: Then it averaged 2.8 percent. We were apparently at \nthe end of, or beginning to see the end of, a recession. Economic \ngrowth averaged 2.8 percent annually for the previous 12 years, and it \nlooked as if we were finally ending a recession. Since 1993, economic \ngrowth has averaged 3.9 percent a year.\n  Jobs: From 1988 to 1992, we had a difficult period, one of the worst \nin history in terms of the creation of new\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\njobs. The economy did not produce many new jobs. From 1993 to date, \nover 22 million new jobs have been created in this country.\n  Unemployment: It averaged 7.1 percent in the 12 years prior to 1993. \nToday it is at 4.1 percent on average, the lowest level in 30 years.\n  Home ownership fell from 1981 to 1992. Now it is the highest in \nhistory.\n  Median family income fell by about $1,800 from 1988 to 1992, adjusted \nfor inflation. It has increased by over $5,000 since 1993.\n  Real wages fell 4.3 percent in 12 years; real wages are up 6.5 \npercent since 1993.\n  Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1981 to 1992; since then it \nhas decreased by 53 percent.\n  The Dow Jones was 3,000 in 1992. It is 11,000 now.\n  The point is that this has been a very interesting time. Economists \npredicted this would not happen, but it did. Our economy is growing in \na very robust fashion, and a lot of people are claiming credit for it. \nProbably everybody deserves a bit of the credit.\n  The 1993 Economic Reform Act that was passed by Congress, which \nreduced the deficit and which made tough choices, was a signal moment \nin this country's fiscal policy history. It dramatically changed what \nhappened in this country. We had the courage to do what was right. It \nwas politically difficult to do. In fact, my party paid a price for it \nin the next election. Guess what. It put this country back on track, \naway from the growing deficits toward economic growth and toward \nopportunity.\n  It is the year 2000, and we have had a remarkable 7 years. Now we are \ntold by the same economists who predicted anemic growth for that decade \nthat in the next decade we will have nothing but ever larger increasing \nbudget surpluses.\n  Should we believe them? Is that the basis on which we should develop \nour future fiscal policy for this country? I do not think so. Because \nwe are inebriated by the sound of 10 years of surpluses, we have \npoliticians walking all around the political landscape saying: What we \nshould do now is pass bills that call for massive tax cuts; lock it in, \nthey say; put it in law; let's provide $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion in \ntax cuts.\n  It is very unwise, in my judgment, to do that. We do not know that we \nwill have sustained economic growth. We do not know whether there will \nor will not be a recession 2, 3, or 5 years from now. We don't know \nwhat the future holds. We would be very wise to be cautious in how we \nhandle this issue of future surpluses.\n\n  We face some really critical choices. Those choices can provide both \nrisk and opportunity: The risk of slipping back into big deficits, \nwhich no one in this country wants, and the opportunity to move forward \nand build on our recent economic successes. Those are the risks: Are we \ngoing to move backwards or forwards?\n  I am not here on the floor of the Senate to say one side is all wrong \nand the other side is all right on this issue, but I will say this. \nThose who say the only agenda in fiscal policy is to begin cutting \ntaxes right now, and cut taxes deeply, and cut taxes for those who have \nthe most income in this country, risk slipping us right back into big \ndeficits, putting us right back into the same old deficit ditch. That \nis the last place this country ought to want to be.\n  How much budget surplus is there really? Even if all the things the \neconomists say might happen, how much real budget surplus do we have? \nThere have been some interesting pieces written in the last few weeks \nabout this. There was a wonderful piece written by David Broder, a very \nrespected columnist, in the Washington Post. There was an op-ed piece \nwritten by Paul Krugman, an economist, in the New York Times. There was \na good piece in the U.S. News & World Report. They raised these \nquestions, which we should raise here in Congress.\n  How much surplus do we really have to use, if we are honest about \nwhere we are headed and what we are doing? Let's look at it. CBO says, \n$4.6 trillion in surplus over the next 10 years. I come from a town of \n300 people and a high school class of 9. It is really hard for me to \ngrasp what a trillion dollars might be. In fact, it is hard for me to \ngrasp a billion or a million dollars--but trillions of dollars, $4.6 \ntrillion. So people hear that word, and it is as if they have taken a \nbig bottle of Jack Daniels and started slugging it down. All of a \nsudden they are talking about all kinds of wild, irresponsible plans \nthey have because we have $4.6 trillion in surplus.\n  But, of course, we do not have $4.6 trillion in surplus. What we \nhave, in fact, if you take the Social Security trust funds away, is \n$2.2 trillion in surplus. But we really do not have $2.2 trillion in \nsurplus. If you take the Medicare trust fund away--and everybody says \nthey want to have a lockbox; and I assume you would want to lock a box \nwith something in it--so you take that away, then you have $1.8 \ntrillion available.\n  And then you must adjust that figure for realistic spending, that is, \nhow much money we are going to spend. The budget caps suggest that we \nwill actually reduce Federal spending in domestic discretionary \naccounts in this country. However, we will have a population that is \nincreasing and some inflation. And we are not going to say, with \nrespect to law enforcement and education, and all the other essential \nfunctions of Government, that we are going to actually spend less next \nyear than we are spending this year. That is not realistic. So \nadjusting for some realistic investment that makes this a good country \nto live in--building roads and teaching kids, providing for our common \ndefense, all the things that make us a good country--then you have $1.2 \ntrillion left.\n  Then using some of the money for extending the solvency of Social \nSecurity and Medicare, which all of us know we must do because people \nare growing older and living better lives, you have $700 billion left. \nThat is the surplus.\n  This analysis, incidentally, comes from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities. They say, the real budget surplus is not $4.6 \ntrillion or $2.2 trillion. The real budget surplus is probably about \n$700 billion.\n  So then how do you reconcile people coming to the floor of the Senate \ntelling us they want to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion or more? The only \nway you reconcile that puts us right back in the same deficit ditch \nthat we have been in before.\n\n  Here is another analysis that comes from the Brookings Institution. \nThis one says--using the exact same analysis but different elements of \nit--we do not have a $700 billion surplus, we have only about a $350 \nbillion surplus--about $35 billion a year. That is the real surplus. \nThey made some different calculations. I will not go through them all.\n  But the point is this: Under either of these analyses--confirmed and \nalso discussed in the Paul Krugman piece, the David Broder piece, and \nothers--under either of these analyses, we do not have trillions of \ndollars in surplus. I wish we did, but we do not. It would be terribly \nunwise for this country to decide to lock into law very large tax \ncuts--the biggest benefits of those cuts going to the wealthiest \ncitizens in this country--at a time when it will result in large \ndeficits in the future. We would be very smart to be very cautious as \nwe approach this.\n  This is from Paul Krugman, who I believe is a really interesting \nthinker. He wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times:\n\n       The most likely prospect is that those big surpluses won't \n     materialize. And when the chickens that didn't hatch come \n     home to roost, we will rue the days when, misled by sloppy \n     accounting and rosy scenarios, we gave away the national nest \n     egg.\n\n  His point is a very important one. I am going to talk about it in a \nmoment. But what are our priorities if we are realistic about what we \nare going to do and what we think will happen? Our priorities ought to \nbe to pay down the Federal debt first and foremost. If in bad economic \ntimes you increase the Federal debt, in good economic times you ought \nto reduce the Federal debt. That is the import of what Paul Krugman was \nsaying, among other things.\n  Here is another piece from U.S. News & World Report:\n\n       Still, the same lack of understanding about the budget is \n     evident today as we head into the crucial weeks of the \n     campaign with big budget numbers and big political promises. \n     If we get it wrong again, we could head back to those awful \n     years--decades of apparently insuperable deficits, slow \n     growth, and recurrent recessions.\n       All of us could relate to the numbers better if we could \n     knock off a few zeros from the trillions being discussed. \n     Most American families with a lot of debt would know what\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\n     to do with a windfall. They'd instinctively feel better if \n     they used the money to redeem loans, freeing themselves from \n     long-term obligations and insecurity, and I suggest the same \n     principle should apply to the country, which is in exactly \n     the same position.\n\n  The point is this. With all the opportunities we have ahead of us if, \nin fact, we have budget surpluses, those will be lower than generally \nexpected. And of all the opportunities ahead of us, the first choice \nand first claim, in my judgment, ought to be to reduce the Federal \ndebt.\n  We have a lot of proposals out there. There is one by Governor Bush \nwhere he talks about very substantial tax cuts. Frankly, I do not \nsupport them. It is not that I do not support providing some targeted \ntax cuts. Working families deserve some help in this area. But we \ncannot come around here with $1 trillion or $1.4 trillion in tax cuts, \ngiven what we expect the real surplus to be. It would put us right back \nin the same deficit ditch, right back in the same ditch.\n  What we need to do in this political debate is to see if we can't, as \nRepublicans and Democrats, understand that when we respond to this \nquestion of the fiscal policy of this country, and what the future \nmight hold, that we be reasonably conservative and cautious, and \nprotect ourselves from retreating back to the same policies we had \npreviously.\n  We are all responsible for those policies. There is not a set of \nfingerprints that lays the responsibility at one door with respect to \nwhat happened in this country. But we all ought to be responsible, as \nwell, to say we are not going to let it happen again. In my judgment, \nwe can do that now by saying to those who are campaigning for office--\nboth for this Chamber and the other body, and also for the Presidency--\nlet's have a real discussion about what the real surplus might be, and \nthen evaluate what our priorities are with respect to that.\n  Now, the tax cuts, I am not going to talk about them so much. The tax \ncuts that are being proposed around here are terrible. In almost every \ncase they provide the biggest benefits to those who need them least. I \nknow people will say: Well, that is all the same old class warfare. It \nis not class warfare. The bottom 60 percent of the population, earning \nincomes up to $40,000, get $227 a year; and the top 1 percent get \n$46,000 each. That is not tax class warfare, that is just a tax cut \nthat should not happen.\n  The question is, What should we do now? In my judgment, what we \nshould do is establish a set of priorities, both in this Presidential \ncampaign and in the campaigns for the Congress--the Senate and the \nHouse--and say, the priorities for using the actual budget surplus, \nwhich is much lower than the trillions of dollars being kicked around \nby some, is to, No. 1, pay down the Federal debt; No. 2, ensure the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare--we have a \nresponsibility to do that--No. 3, address this country's urgent needs, \nand that means making some investments that we need in education, and \nother areas; and, no. 4, provide targeted tax relief for working \nfamilies. All of these represent the priorities in the order that I see \nthem. Others may see them differently.\n  I think it is important, before we start down this road, to address \nthis question of whether the trillions of dollars people are kicking \naround as expected future surpluses are going to be real. The answer \nis, with almost all thoughtful economists responding to it, to say, no, \nthese are not real; the surplus is going to be much, much smaller than \nthat. That ought to temper our desire and demand and appetite for these \nhuge tax cuts being proposed that will result in very large future \ndeficits.\n  The single best thing we could do for this country and its children \nand our future is to begin paying down the Federal debt with the actual \nsurpluses that will come in future years. It is the single most \nimportant way of strengthening this country's economy.\n  I seldom ever quote Alan Greenspan because we have such disagreements \non monetary policy, but I will break that rule today. He came to \nCongress, the Senate Select Committee on Aging, and said:\n\n       . . . there are limited fiscal resources in this country \n     and that until we have strong evidence that there is a major \n     structural increase in the surplus, that trying to commit it \n     to various different program[s] or even tax cuts, I think, is \n     unwise.\n\n  His point is, we ought to use the surplus to reduce indebtedness. We \nhave a nearly $5.7 trillion Federal debt. If during bad times, during \ntough times, this country had to run up its debt in order to make ends \nmeet, then during good times the greatest gift we could offer to \nAmerica's children is to say we will reduce that indebtedness. It is \nnot just a gift to children, it also happens to be the best way to \nassure long-term economic growth.\n  I will make one additional point as we begin discussing fiscal policy \nand tax issues. My presentation here will not dim the appetite of those \nwho come to the floor and say: I don't care about numbers. I don't care \nabout philosophy. I was elected to Congress for one thing, and I am \ngoing to propose tax cuts until my last breath. I am going to propose \ntax cuts because those are the only two words I know. I don't care \nabout how it all adds up or subtracts or how it all works out. Good for \nthem. But they are the kind of people who steer this country into the \ndeficit ditch, and I, for one, am not going to be a part of it.\n  I would say to them this: To the extent that we have some ability--\nand I think there is some ability, even though we are going to have \nsmaller surpluses--to provide tax cuts, I would like tax cuts to go not \njust to the people who have benefited most from this economy. We have, \nafter all, one-half of the world's billionaires in the United States; \ngood for us--but when we talk about tax cuts, I would much sooner see \nscarce resources go to working families. They are the ones who need \nthem most.\n  It is interesting. Every time someone talks about a tax cut around \nhere, they only talk about income taxes. Here are the taxes we collect \nin this country. This big red piece of the pie is payroll taxes. Those \nat the lowest end of the economic ladder pay a payroll tax that is the \nsame tax as those at the highest end. Nobody wants to talk about these \npayroll taxes. These are the ones that have increased very \nsubstantially in recent years. So when we talk about tax cuts, maybe we \ncould talk about trying to help those who are paying payroll taxes as \nwell, rather than just those who are paying income taxes.\n  Nearly 100 percent of the bottom fifth of our population are paying \nmore in payroll taxes than income taxes. In fact, even the middle \nfifth, those making between $43,000 and $65,000 a year, 80 percent of \nthem are paying more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. Yet every \ntime you hear somebody saying let's cut taxes, all they want to talk \nabout is income taxes because that means their tax cut proposal is \ngoing to benefit those with the most income. What about a tax cut \nproposal that says we are going to offset some of the burden of those \nfolks who are going to work every day for the minimum wage and are \npaying a heavy payroll tax. How about giving them a little relief.\n\n  So when the next time comes that we in Congress are talking about tax \ncuts, I am going to bring some of these charts out and ask: Does this \nnot count, the pie chart that shows payroll taxes? Does it not count \nthat the income earners at the lowest end of the scale are paying these \nthings and it doesn't matter somehow? They don't deserve any help? That \nis just a tax that we won't talk about. That is not fair. It is not the \nway to do business.\n  I think the warnings--perhaps the small craft warnings at this point, \nbut major warnings later--by some good economists are saying: Watch out \nwhat you are doing here, talking about $4 trillion of tax cuts or $4 \ntrillion of surplus or a $2.2 trillion surplus or a $1.5 trillion tax \ncut; watch what you are doing here and be careful, because this is not \ngoing to materialize, and if you do what you are talking about doing, \nit will pose significant dangers to the American economy.\n  The best way to assure economic growth and opportunity in this \ncountry's future is to decide that if we have surpluses--and I hope we \ndo--we will commit first and foremost those budget surpluses to \nreducing our country's indebtedness. Again, if in tough times you run \nup the debt, in good times this country ought to be able to pay it \ndown. That is the greatest gift to America's children, and that is also \nthe surest way to long-term economic health, growth, and opportunities.\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8623-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8623-S8624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HURRICANE FLOYD\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, few North Carolinians will forget \nSeptember 16, 1999. Almost 1 year ago tomorrow, Hurricane Floyd dumped \n20 inches on the State of North Carolina, eastern North Carolina, \ndevastating and forever changing our State. Fifty-two North Carolinians \nwere killed as a result of Hurricane Floyd; 66 counties, which is more \nthan 70 percent of our State, were declared disaster areas. More than \n60,000 homes were destroyed or damaged, and hundreds of businesses were \nforced to close or relocate. Farmers were faced with sometimes the most \ndifficult circumstances they had ever faced in their lives, losing \neverything for which they had worked.\n  I have been to the floor many times over the course of the last year \nin an effort to secure relief for our Hurricane Floyd victims. I have \nworked closely with my colleagues, Senator Helms from North Carolina \nand Members of our House delegation, to get help for our folks who are \nhurting so badly. I have emphasized over and over that what we do or \nsometimes what we don't do affects real people's lives, the people who \noften are in very difficult places--for example, the people who were \ndevastated by Hurricane Floyd.\n  Last year, the Senate appropriated more than $2 billion for FEMA's \ndisaster relief account. Of that total, more than $215 million was set \naside for FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. To this day, more \nthan 2,000 homes in North Carolina have been purchased and families \nhave moved out of harm's way, out of the flood zone. In fact, just \nyesterday I spoke with Brenda Johnson to tell her that her buyout had \nbeen approved. Brenda had been living in a small apartment for almost a \nyear. Finally, she will now be able to move on. Along with the buyout \nmoney we appropriated last year, we also secured individual family \ngrants and other disaster relief programs to help people whose homes \nhad been wiped out, people such as Edna Simmons of Greenville, NC.\n  Greenville was actually one of the hardest hit areas struck by \nHurricane Floyd. Unfortunately, Edna's home was one of thousands that \nwere overwhelmed by the flood. For days, Edna's home sat under more \nthan 4\\1/2\\ feet of flood water. She lost everything, and she and her \nhusband and her 6-year-old daughter had to start over. At first, they \nwere able to move in with her mother. Then, with the help of her fellow \nchurch members, volunteers, using her own savings and a grant from \nFEMA, she was able to rebuild her home. Repairs are now in the final \nstages of her home. Now, more than a year after the rain drove them \naway, Edna and her family are finally on the verge of going back home.\n  This storm, however, did not just destroy homes; it also destroyed \nentire communities. The small town of Princeville is a great example. \nIt was completely wiped out. Princeville residents lost their townhall; \nthey lost their library, their police station, and their school. Of the \n2,000 homes in Princeville, more than 1,000 were heavily damaged or \ndestroyed. And Princeville residents are a very proud group. This is \nthe first town in America that was established by freed slaves. \nPrinceville's residents are working very hard to rebuild and preserve \ntheir historic town.\n  One year after the Princeville Montessori school was devastated by \nthe floods, volunteers, State employees, students, and parents have \nrebuilt the school with the help of FEMA grants.\n  For all the successes we have had over the last year, there are still \nshortcomings in responding to this disaster. We have heard over and \nover--I and my staff--from worried and confused constituents, folks who \nhad no idea where they were supposed to go.\n  Navigating the myriad programs that exist in the Federal Government \nto provide relief to hurricane victims is a time-consuming and \nsometimes very frustrating process. For example, there are Federal \ndisaster programs within the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Department of Education, Small Business Administration, \nDepartment of Labor, Department of Energy--just to name a few. So it is \nvery hard for folks whose lives and families have been devastated as a \nresult of a natural disaster to know where it is they need to go to get \nthe relief they need and deserve.\n  Sometimes, the assistance just doesn't come quickly enough. One \nexample is Bobby Carraway, who owned a restaurant in Kinston NC, near \nthe Neuse River. The river flooded, and his restaurant sat under more \nthan 3 feet of water for many days. He lost his entire business. But \nwith the help of his landlord, who let up on the rent, and his food \nsuppliers, who told him he could pay when he could, neighbors who \nhelped him clean up his business, and a large chunk of his own personal \nsavings, he was able to reopen his restaurant.\n  Today, one year after Hurricane Floyd threatened to take his \nlivelihood, Bobby is still waiting for the Small Business \nAdministration to approve his loan. He should not have to wait so long, \nand residents such as Edna should not have to navigate through these \nconfusing Federal and State programs, especially when they are dealing \nwith devastation to family and emotional trauma caused by natural \ndisasters such as Hurricane Floyd.\n  The biggest lesson we have learned from this storm is that the \nFederal, State, and local responses to disasters have to be better \ncoordinated and must be more efficient.\n  Senator Stevens from Alaska and I cochair the Natural Hazards \nDisaster Caucus. Seventeen Senators have joined us. Our goal is to \nprovide concrete steps that Federal, State, and local programs can work \ntogether to protect our residents, provide a more efficient response, \nand mitigate the cost and destruction of future disasters.\n  The Government can't make people whole again after a disaster, but we \ncan, and should, be prepared to do all we can to help people get back \non their feet.\n  We have made great strides in our recovery in North Carolina, but we \nstill have a long way to go. Most Federal officials agree it will be \nanother 2 years before eastern North Carolina has completely recovered. \nToday, hundreds of people will mark the anniversary of Hurricane Floyd \nin their FEMA trailers, where they live. We are facing a rental housing \nshortfall of about 4,000 units, and thousands of victims are facing \nmany years of debt as a result of this disaster.\n  I am grateful to the Senate for including $50 million for North \nCarolina for the USDA's Community Facilities Grant Program in the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. This money will make a real difference \nin a town such as Farmville, which needs help rebuilding its fire \nstation.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank FEMA Director James Lee \nWitt and his entire agency for their dedication to helping those who \nsimply could not help themselves.\n  Governor Jim Hunt has worked tirelessly to help the residents of our \nState. Most importantly, I want to take this opportunity to thank the \npeople of North Carolina--the thousands of volunteers who, over the \ncourse of the last year, have responded heroically to the damage done \nand the devastation done to their neighbors and friends.\n  It has been a long year, and we still have a lot of work left to do. \nHurricane Floyd's victims were innocent people, regular working people \nwho have done nothing wrong but had everything taken from them as a \nresult of this natural disaster. They deserve our continued support and \ndedication as they attempt to rebuild their homes and their lives.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to take time before leaving for \nthe weekend to be here to express my strong disappointment with \nPresident Clinton and his Democratic allies in the Congress who have \nonce again denied millions of American couples marriage penalty relief.\n  On August 5, President Clinton vetoed the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief \nReconciliation Act. This week, due to strong opposition from some of \nour Democrat colleagues, the House fell 16 votes short of the number \nneeded to override the President's veto, thus letting down 22 million \nAmerican couples, including 550,000 couples from my state of Minnesota.\n  These hard-working Americans are penalized, on average, $1,500 per \nyear simply because they are married. This $32 billion annual tax \nburden is extremely unfair to these working men and women.\n  Washington is taking this money from American couples at a time when \nit doesn't need the money as much as these families do. This money \ncould be used for savings for their children's education, for daycare, \nfor tutors, for braces, for a new washer/dryer, for a family vacation, \nor for a down payment on a car.\n  For President Clinton and his Democrat allies in the Congress to deny \nworking men and women this desperately needed tax relief is not only \nwrong, it is a disgrace.\n  It is shameful that their spending appetite is growing bigger each \nyear and faster than the incomes of American workers and all of the \npeople across this country who simply choose to get married, start a \nfamily, to begin their lives together, and at the altar they have the \nIRS standing with them.\n  Since 1969, our tax laws have punished married couples. There are \nmore than 60 provisions in the tax code that penalize working American \ncouples by pushing them into a higher tax bracket, punishing them \nbecause of their decision to be joined in holy matrimony.\n\n  This was not the intention of Congress when it separated tax \nschedules for married and unmarried people. It also runs contrary to \nour often-stated desire to strengthen the institution of the family in \nAmerica a desire that was reaffirmed with the enactment of my $500 per \nchild tax credit legislation.\n  The family has been, and will continue to be, the bedrock of our \nsociety. Strong families make strong communities; strong communities \nmake for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax \ntreats married couples unfairly.\n  President Clinton himself agrees that the marriage penalty is unfair. \nHe has said that. He believes the marriage penalty tax is unfair, but \nhe vetoed a bill that, by the way, was a compromise, calling into \nquestion his resolve to reverse this inequity that he called unfair. \nBut evidently the President believes it is more important for \nWashington to collect unfair taxes than it is to give tax breaks to \nworking Americans. He uses any and all excuses he can find to keep as \nmany dollars as possible coming into the Government's coffers. Even at \na time of huge surpluses, he refuses to let American couples keep a \nlittle bit more of their own money.\n  We are not even talking tax cuts; all we are talking about is tax \novercharges that should be returned. If you overpay a bill, you expect \nto get your change back. If you go to McDonald's and the meal is $5 and \nyou give them $10, you expect to get your change back--or for any kind \nof a transaction. In this transaction, you should be able to expect to \nget your money back. On a marriage penalty which is unfair, you should \nat least be able to get your refund. But despite the rhetoric of this \nadministration suggesting otherwise, the Clinton and Gore \nadministration and its Democratic allies in Congress are not serious \nabout correcting this unfair tax penalty.\n  Out of eight budgets the Clinton/Gore administration proposed, only \none included a tiny bit of relief for married couples. Their paltry \nmarriage penalty relief means millions of couples would not receive the \ntax relief they want and need. In fact, the President's plan was less \nthan 25 percent of the plan that was sent to him, which would mean that \nout of 100 couples, he would say 75 married couples don't deserve tax \nrelief even though they are unfairly taxed. A minor, paltry tax relief \nwas proposed by this administration.\n  Today, families pay more in taxes than they do for food, clothing, \nand shelter combined. Something is wrong when parents work more to \nprovide for the government than they do for their own families. It is \ntime for the government to contribute to the strengthening of the \nfamily, rather than aiding its breakdown.\n  There is no legitimate policy reason to continue punishing millions \nof American couples through this unfair marriage penalty.\n  By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton \nand his Democrat allies in the Congress have shown that they care less \nabout working couples who are struggling to raise families. They care \nmore about dumping money into Washington's coffers. By continuing this \nbad tax policy that discourages marriage, they will force millions of \nmarried couples to pay more taxes to support a big government rather \nthan being able to provide better for American families.\n  By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton \nand his Democrat allies in Congress have chosen to continue to \ndiscriminate against working women. Since more and more women work \ntoday, their added incomes drive their households into higher tax \nbrackets unfairly, reducing their take-home pay.\n  By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton \nand his Democrat allies in Congress have done harm to the minority, \nlow-income families whom they claim to help, because the marriage \npenalty hits lower-income working families hardest.\n  This is not a tax cut for the rich, as this administration always \nloves to say. Anytime there is any tax relief out there, it is always \nsomehow for the rich. But this hits hard-working, middle-class, middle-\nincome families.\n  In fact, President Clinton has denied relief for couples at the \nbottom end of the income scale who incur penalties. As a result of the \nmarriage penalty, they paid nearly $800 in additional taxes, which \nrepresents 8 percent of their income.\n  So what about that? This is not tax relief for the rich.\n  By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton \nand his Democrat allies in Congress have undermined the family the \ninstitution that is the foundation of our society by discouraging women \nfrom marriage, or even leading some married couples to get friendly \ndivorces.\n  This is just plain wrong.\n  To President Clinton and Vice President Gore, I would consider asking \nyou once again to put aside the election-year politics and reconsider \nyour veto on our marriage penalty tax relief that would help millions \nof couples live the American Dream. I would ask that. But I know it \nwould be a waste of time. And so do millions of Americans. I know and \nthey know we'll have to wait for a President that is more sympathetic \nto those who work everyday rather than big government.\n  To ask this President to reduce or sign this bill I guess would be a \nwaste of time, because I believe, as do millions of Americans, that we \nwill not see one dime of tax relief as long as he is in the White \nHouse. We need another President who is going to be more sympathetic to \nthose who pay the bills. I always call them the most used and abused \nand underappreciated people in the country. That is the people who pay \nthe bills--the taxpayers.\n  To the 44 million Americans, including 1.1 million Minnesotans, who \nsuffer from this unfair penalty, I want to pledge that we will repeal \nthis marriage tax bill next year and we will not rest until our Tax \nCode becomes truly family friendly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \nnumber of matters. First, the situation with Dr. Wen Ho Lee has drawn \nnational--really, international--attention, especially in light of \nPresident Clinton's statement yesterday that he was deeply troubled by \nthe actions of the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy.\n  The President put his finger on the critical question; that is, how \ncould it be that on one day Dr. Wen Ho Lee was a major threat to \nnational security, and on the next day the Government agreed to a plea \nbargain on one count, without jail time or without probation, allowing \nhim to walk out free?\n  The President was sharply critical, especially of the actions of the \nAttorney General, who had a rather extraordinary interview with the \nmedia yesterday. She was asked about the Wen Ho Lee case and she said \nthat, had Dr. Lee cooperated with the Government, a result could have \nbeen achieved a long time before on the disclosure of what had happened \nwith the tapes. But the problem with that answer is that the defense \nhad offered the Government precisely what the Government finally got; \nthat is, Dr. Lee's cooperation on what had happened to those downloaded \nmaterials. That offer had been made months ago, but the Government had \nnever replied to that offer. So it is hardly an excuse for Attorney \nGeneral Reno to say had Dr. Lee cooperated, the matter would have been \nresolved a long time ago.\n  Then she was asked a question relating to any mistakes or anything \nthat was done wrong in the handling of Dr. Wen Ho Lee's case. She said \nshe was going to have to review the record to answer that question--\nwhich is really extraordinary, since she is the Attorney General and \nthis matter was under her direct, personal supervision. That is a fact \nwe know because in August of 1997, FBI Director Louis Freeh sent one of \nhis top deputies, Assistant Director John Lewis, to Attorney General \nReno personally to ask for authorization to submit to the court an \napplication for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. At that time, the FBI had provided a statement of probable cause \nwhich was more than sufficient to have the warrant issued.\n  Attorney General Reno then referred that request to a man named \nDaniel Seikaly in the Department of Justice, a man who had no prior \nexperience with warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. The wrong standard was applied.\n  This has all been documented in a report submitted by the Judiciary \nsubcommittee, which I chair, on oversight of the Department of Justice. \nAnd ultimately notwithstanding the request from the Director of the FBI \nthrough a top deputy to the Attorney General personally, that request \nfor a FISA warrant was refused. Attorney General Reno doesn't have to \nstudy the matter further to acknowledge that mistake.\n  Then the FBI let the case languish until December of 1998 without any \nactive investigation. It was only when the Cox committee was about to \npublish its report, as rumored in late December, 1998, and as it came \nto pass in early January, sharply critical of the way the Wen Ho Lee \ncase was handled, that a polygraph was ordered by the Department of \nEnergy. The polygraph was not taken by the FBI, but taken by an outside \ncontractor, Wackenhut. That was done on December 23, 1997. And the \ninitial report was that Dr. Lee had passed the polygraph, had not been \ndeceptive--grounds for discontinuing the investigation.\n  It was only several weeks later when the FBI got the tapes and \nreviewed them and found that the Wackenhut conclusion was not accurate; \nthat there was not exoneration of Dr. Lee.\n  Then it appears that, finally, when the Department of Justice was \nthoroughly embarrassed, they really threw the book at Dr. Lee by \nholding him in detention in really extraordinary circumstances, in leg \nirons. I have seen prisoners held in leg irons. I witnessed that in \nPennsylvania's correctional institution when I was district attorney. \nDo you know the reason you hold somebody in leg irons? Because they are \nso violent they threaten risk of bodily injury or worse to the guards \nwho have to deal with them. What possible justification was there for \ntreating Dr. Lee in that manner? And the restrictions which the \nGovernment imposed on Dr. Lee? There has been comment, unattributed \nsources, to law enforcement officials, that what was really in mind \nhere was to coerce a guilty plea from Dr. Lee. The Government \napparently thought he was guilty and they were thoroughly embarrassed \nwith the way they had botched the case. What other explanation is there \nfor the way Dr. Lee was treated?\n  These are fundamental questions which our subcommittee will look \ninto, on oversight of this matter.\n  There are two aspects of this matter, really. One aspect is what, if \nanything, did Dr. Lee do to endanger national security? In the \napplication for a search warrant, the Government laid out a long list \nof reasons stating probable cause for the issuance of that search \nwarrant. Matters that had gone back as early as 1982 involving a great \nmany suspicious activities, so that when the warrant was not issued, \nnotwithstanding the request directly to Attorney General Reno, and when \nthe investigation was, in effect, dropped--really languishing, but in \neffect dropped for some 15 months--we do not know, on this state of the \nrecord, what the quality of the evidence was which led to the \nindictments.\n  It is not a sufficient answer, any of them which have been given, \nbecause the issue of national security is of the utmost importance.\n  The subcommittee has in final stages a report on Dr. Peter Lee, who \nconfessed to giving the People's Republic of China key information on \nnuclear secrets and also on detecting our submarines. That case was \nanother comedy of errors, except it wasn't so funny--``comedy of \nerrors'' I think is the wrong words--horrendous errors, where there was \nmiscommunication between the Justice Department in Washington and the \nassistant district attorney who was trying the case. Dr. Peter Lee \nfinally walked out with probation, notwithstanding the very serious \ncharges brought against him.\n  Beyond the issue of national security, there is the question as to \nthe treatment of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, his constitutional rights, and whether \nhe was fairly treated. There have been calls for Attorney General \nReno's resignation, and the resignation of Secretary of Energy \nRichardson. I was asked about that earlier today on television and I \ndeclined to call for those resignations. I think it is too often that \nMembers go to the klieg lights and make those demands.\n  I was then asked what would be effective, what could be done. And I \nwas asked whether the President ought to fire the Attorney General.\n  Based on what the President has said, and the very troubled record \nwhich Attorney General Reno has had with Waco and with her decisions on \nindependent counsels, that is something which would be meaningful, if \nthe President really is concerned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8625-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8625-S8626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FIRESTONE TIRES AND FORD VEHICLES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on another subject, I wish to comment \nbriefly on legislation which will be introduced today in response to \nthe tremendous problems posed by the Firestone tires and the Ford \nvehicles which turned over, and some 88 deaths. The Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation, on which I sit, had a hearing on this \nsubject on September 6, 2000. At that time, we heard comments, \nexplanations, excuses which strained credulity. I then introduced \nlegislation which would make it a criminal offense for someone to \nknowingly put on interstate commerce a deadly product which was likely \nto result in death. This is based on the experience I had as district \nattorney of Philadelphia, where reckless disregard for human life, \nwhich results in death, constitutes the requisite malice for a charge \nof murder in the second degree.\n  I have discussed this provision with the distinguished Senator from \nArizona who held a hearing on the matter this week, and the \nadministration has submitted legislation which I am told will be \nintroduced later today. I wanted to make a comment briefly at this time \nsince I know we will be going out early.\n  I compliment Senator McCain for this legislation which will require \nmotor vehicle manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to obtain \ninformation and obtain records about potential safety defects in their \nforeign\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nproducts that may affect the safety of vehicles and equipment in the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation will increase the civil penalties for notification of \nreporting violations; will establish greater cooperation with foreign \ntransportation safety agencies with the exchange of safety-related \ninformation and the recall of defective products; and requires \nadditional testing to determine that a vehicle or equipment meets \nsafety requirements.\n  I am advised that there is coordination with the House and an \nexcellent opportunity that this legislation will be completed before we \nfinish our term, which would be exemplary and which would really show \nthe American people that when we have a very dangerous situation \nbrought to our attention, we will take action.\n  I am very pleased to see this legislation will include the proposals \nI have for criminal penalties. In a floor statement made on September \n7, 2000, I documented 10 illustrative cases where deadly products had \nbeen put on the market knowing them to be deadly and knowing that they \ncontained the risk of death or serious bodily injury. That constitutes \nthe requisite malice for a prosecution. That will be an effective way \nof dealing with this issue.\n  The remedy of punitive damages has been illusory. Take the celebrated \nPinto case where a calculation was made by Ford that it was cheaper to \npay the damages resulting from injuries and deaths than it was to \nrelocate the gas tank. A jury came in with an award of $125 million, \nlater reduced it $3.5 million, which is the customary response where \nthese punitive damage awards have been entered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8626-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPLIMENTING PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

KELLY, JR.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Olympic Games, set to begin today in \nSydney, Australia, will feature rowing, which brings to mind the great \nrowing tradition which has been a part of Philadelphia for generations. \nIt also brings to mind John B. Kelly, Jr., a Philadelphia native who \nnot only made great strides in the sport of rowing, but who personified \nthe ideal of an Olympic athlete.\n  John B. Kelly, Jr., better known as ``Jack'' or ``Kel,'' came from a \ndistinguished family, on and off the water. His father won three gold \nmedals in sculling in the 1920 and 1924 Olympics. His sister Grace was \nthe late Princess of Monaco.\n  After graduating from the William Penn Charter School, Jack enlisted \nin the United States Navy. After a short term of service, he attended \nthe University of Pennsylvania where we were college friends in the \nlate 1940's and early 1950's. He was a member of the Kappa Sigma social \nfraternity and was honored with a membership in the Sphinx Senior \nSociety for his extracurricular accomplishments. Upon graduation, he \nwas commissioned as an ensign, combining duty on a destroyer with his \npreparation for the 1952 Olympic games in Helsinki.\n  By the time he hung up his oars, he had advanced the cause and the \ninternational name of American rowing and American sports. Jack was an \neight-time national single sculls champion, four-time Olympian and \nbronze medallist in single sculls in 1956, and winner of two gold \nmedals in the Pan American Games in 1955 and 1959. He was also the \nwinner of the Diamond Sculls in the Henley Regatta in 1947 and 1949, a \nrace from which the British had banned his father, purportedly because \nhe worked with his hands and was not considered to be a gentleman.\n  The winner of the 1947 James E. Sullivan award as the nation's \noutstanding amateur athlete, Jack was a leading advocate for amateur \nsports for more than 30 years. Following the 1960 Olympic games, Jack \nbecame active in the local swimming program in the Middle Atlantic \nAssociation of the Amateur Athletic Union. In 1970 he was elected \nPresident of the National Amateur Athletic Union, the youngest person \nto hold that office in more than 80 years. In 1985 he assumed the \npresidency of the United States Olympic Committee, and served in that \ncapacity for three weeks until his untimely death on March 2.\n  Philadelphia honored its native son by erecting a statue of Jack \nrowing, along the Schuylkill River, and also by renaming the drive \nalong the boathouses on the Schuylkill River in honor of the Kelly \nfamily. I believe it would be appropriate for the United States to \nhonor Jack through the creation of a commemorative postage stamp, which \nwould pay tribute to his accomplishments as a world class athlete and \nto his contributions to our nation and to international athletics and \ngoodwill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in calling upon the Postmaster \nGeneral to issue this stamp in a timely manner.\n  The Olympics started today. Jack Kelly, Jr., has a monument on East \nRiver Drive which was renamed ``Kelly Drive'' in honor of the Kelly \nfamily, a very distinguished Philadelphia family. Father John B. Kelly, \nSr., an Olympic gold medalist, was once denied entry into the Henley \nRegatta because he was someone who worked with his hands, a bricklayer; \ntherefore, not considered a gentleman and, therefore, not entitled to \nenter into the competition.\n  His son John B. Kelly, Jr., made up for all of it. I knew young Jack \nKelly as a student at the University of Pennsylvania where we attended \ntogether. The family achieved perhaps its greatest notoriety from \nPrincess Grace of Monaco being Jack Jr.'s sister.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to implore my \ncolleagues to work with me in moving the American Competitiveness in \nthe Twenty-first Century Act, S. 2045, toward enactment.\n  One of our greatest priorities is--and ought to be--keeping our \neconomy vibrant, and expanding educational opportunities for America's \nchildren and its workers.\n  That is my priority for this country and that is my priority for my \nhome State of Utah.\n  I am proud of the growth and development in my own home State--growth \nthat has made Utah one of the leaders of the world in our high tech \neconomy.\n  Utah's information technology vendor industry is among Utah's largest \nindustries, and among the top 10 regions of IT--or information \ntechnology--activity in the U.S.\n  Notably, Utah was listed among the top ten IT centers in the world by \nNewsweek magazine in November 1998.\n  The growth of information technology is nowhere more evident and \ndramatic than in my own home State of Utah.\n  According to the Utah Information Technologies Association, our IT \nvendor industry grew nearly 9 percent between 1997 and 1998, and \nconsists of 2,427 business enterprises.\n  While I am on the subject, let me just also note that just a couple \nof weeks ago, a major high-tech company in Utah announced the layoff of \nseveral hundred Utahns. We have several indications that alternative \njobs are available.\n  I continue to watch this closely. I certainly want these skilled and \ntalented people to remain in our State rather than being hired by other \ncompanies in other States.\n  In Utah and elsewhere, our continued economic growth, and our \ncompetitive edge in the world economy require an adequate supply of \nhighly skilled high tech workers. This remains one of our great \nchallenges in the 21st century, requiring both short- and long-term \nsolutions.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n  The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act, S. \n2045, contains both.\n  In the short-term, a tight labor market, increasing globalization, \nand a burgeoning economy have combined to increase demand for skilled \nworkers well beyond what was forecast when Congress last addressed the \nissue of temporary visas for highly skilled workers in 1998. Therefore, \nmy bill, once again, increases the annual cap for the next three years.\n  That, Mr. President, is nothing more than a short term solution to \nthe workforce needs in my State and across the country.\n  The longer term solution lies with our own children and our own \nworkers; and in ensuring that our education and training of our current \nand future workforce matches the demands in our high tech 21st century \nglobal economy.\n  Thus, working with my colleagues, I have included in this bill \nstrong, effective, and forward-looking provisions directing the more \nthan $100 million in fees generated by the visas toward the education \nand retraining of our children and our workforce.\n  Those provisions are included in the substitute which I am prepared \nto offer today.\n  We are here, today, however, as this session of Congress comes to a \nclose, with the fate of this critical legislation extremely uncertain.\n  Frankly, when this bill was reported by the Committee, I thought we \nwere on track to move this rapidly through the Senate.\n  I offered to sit down with other Members--including my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, my colleague from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman--to \nwork with them on provisions regarding education and training. We have \ndone that.\n  And, I as I have noted, I am pleased to report that the substitute \nwhich I intend to offer to this bill, reflects the majority of their \nideas and proposals.\n  Quite unexpectedly, however, the White House weighed in with what \nsounded to me like an ultimatum tying passage of this to other \nunrelated, costly and far reaching immigration amendments.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can get this done.\n  I know the majority leader filed cloture earlier today on a motion to \nproceed.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days to \ntry and avoid a confrontational process.\n  Again, I hope we can get this done for American workers and children \nand for our continued economic expansion.\n  I am grateful to be able to say these words today because I want to \nmove this bill forward. It is in the best interest of our country. It \nis in the best interest of of our high-tech community. We are talking \nabout nanotechnology technology, quantum computers, all kinds of \neducational projects in which, literally, this Nation needs to be the \nleader. The only way we are going to be the leader is if we continue to \naccentuate the positive by having the best high-tech minds working with \nus.\n  Many of these people for whom we want to allow visas are people who \nhave been educated in our country, given our education and given our \ninformation. Frankly, it is much to our advantage to have some of them \nhave the privilege of working here before they go back to their own \ncountries. This bill will help to resolve that. To have it enmeshed in \npolitics, as the White House has tried to do, is a tremendous, \nincredible mistake.\n  I hope the President and those who are advising him will back off. \nLet us pass this bill and keep the United States at the forefront of \nthe high-tech revolution.\n  That is my goal. As everyone knows, I have worked very hard in this \narea. I daresay there is probably no more important bill in this \nCongress, as far as the information technology industry and the high-\ntech community are concerned, than this particular bill. There are \nothers that rise to its equal, but nothing rises beyond it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed in morning business and to consume such time as I may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we are at or near the close of \nbusiness of today's session of the Senate. I thought it important that \nwe end up the week with a bit of an analysis of where we are and where \nwe have to get in the next several weeks to complete the business of \nGovernment, to fund the necessary agencies, and to be responsible to \nthe American people as it relates to the expenditure of their tax \ndollars.\n  As most all Americans understand, we are now, fortunately, living \nwith a balanced budget at our Federal Government level; that is, \ncurrent operating budgets. Many of us in Congress for decades fought to \nget this budget balanced. It became balanced during a period of \nunprecedented economic growth in our country. I believe that a balanced \nbudget contributed dramatically to that growth.\n  At the same time as we worked to continue to balance that budget, \nmany of us had wanted to now take some of the unprecedented surpluses \nof tax dollars that are coming into us and return them to the American \ntaxpayer. We tried to do that this year in two forms: In the reduction \nor the elimination of the marriage tax penalty, about $1,400 per \nmarried couple; and in the near elimination of the death tax; in other \nwords, the taxing of citizens of their wealth or their estates upon the \nincident of death. Those are two items extremely popular with the \nAmerican people.\n  Yet in trying to do that, we were told by this administration and by \nmany of my colleagues on the other side that it would wipe out this \nsurplus tax dollar amount--many statements such as that that couldn't \nbe any further from the truth. The reality is that for those two tax \npackages that were passed by Congress and now vetoed by the President, \nwe are talking of about a dime, one dime out of every surplus dollar, \nyour surplus tax dollar, to be projected to come in to our Government \nover the next decade.\n  Be that as it may, that is a problem we face. So here we are now \nworking to finalize the work of the Government in the next 3 weeks, and \nwe have an inordinate amount of work to get done. One of my \nfrustrations as a leader on this side in trying to move the process \nalong is that, for the last 6 months, we have heard the rumor, and we \nhave watched the actions of the minority leader and the folks on the \nother side, which would indicate there was a stalling tactic going on, \nthat somehow they didn't want to get the work done in a timely fashion, \nthat they constantly objected to unanimous consents, and they asked for \nvotes time after time on issues we had already voted on and had been \nthoroughly debated on the floor of the Senate, from which the political \nanswers had come flowing forth on the debate.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. I am one of those who always comes \nto the floor when there is a gun debate. Somehow, the other side is \nsaying we have to have more votes on gun issues. Well, I will say this: \nWe have already had 13 votes this session on the gun issue. I am not \nquite sure how many more we need, or will need, to express to the \nAmerican people the intent of Republicans versus Democrats versus \nindividual Senators as it comes to this issue.\n  We have had rollcall votes on amendments 403 times; Democrats have \nproposed 231 and Republicans have proposed 172. Many of these \namendments never would make it into policy and had been refused by the \nauthorizing committees but were here either for time taken or for \npolitical expressions being made--not for substantive policy reform \nbecause we knew it would not happen.\n  On the issue of ``Kennedy Care,'' or health care, we have already had \neight votes; and we still are being asked to take more votes on the \nprescription\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\ndrug issue, a Government-run proposal on the part of some. We have had \nseven votes on that. How many votes does it take to express to the \nAmerican people the intent of this Congress or this Senate when it \ncomes to a given issue? A once-a-week vote? A once-a-day vote? How \nabout one thorough debate and one vote up or down? That clearly \nexpresses the will and the intent of individual Senators.\n  This last week we have had a very significant debate on the \nnormalization of trade relations with China, known as PNTR, permanent \nnormal trade relations. It is a very important debate and it was \nhandled very well. Most of the amendments have been constructive. But \nwhile we have been trying to do this, recognizing our work schedule we \nhave been trying to do a couple of other things. For example, we have \nbeen trying to offer up additional amendments, or appropriations bills, \nor conference reports that will finalize the work of Congress. This is \nwhat has happened. It confirms what many expected was true and that was \nan attempt to slow-roll us or stall us so we could not get our work \ndone.\n  Here is a quote from the USA Today of Friday, September 8. It says:\n\n       Senator Minority Leader Tom Daschle has a simple strategy \n     for winning the final negotiations over spending bills. Of \n     course, those are the key items that we must finish to finish \n     the work of the Congress so we can adjourn. What is it?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Stall until the Republicans have to cave in because they \n     can't wait any longer to recess and get out on the campaign \n     trail.\n\n  Of course, the logic is simple if you are an insider and you know the \nworkings of the Senate and you know how many are up for reelection.\n\n       That is because 18 of the 29 Senators seeking reelection \n     are Republicans and 11 are Democrats. There are a lot of \n     vulnerable Republican Senators. I know they want to go home \n     badly.\n\n  So what is the tactic? Stall, object. One Senator can come to the \nfloor and all he or she has to do is say: Mr. President, I object. That \nsimple action in itself can either take hours or days of debate and \nbreak down the process. It can be called a filibuster, or gaining \ncloture on a vote; but ultimately, and without question, it is a \nstalling tactic--especially now in light of what the minority leader \nsays.\n  Finally, Tom Daschle has come clean. He has openly and publicly said \ntheir tactic is to stall. What does stalling really get us? To some who \nbelieve in big government, it could probably get them tens of billions \ndollars more in money to spend on Government programs and, in some \ninstances, more Government control, more Government mandates and, \nfrankly, more Government in your back pocket.\n  People of my thinking would suggest that is bad policy. But the \ndollars we are talking about, the surplus dollars that we tried to get \nback to the American people in the form of tax relief, which was vetoed \nthis year by the President, is the kind of money they now want to \nspend. Oh, these Republicans, if we just stall on them, they are so \nanxious to go home that they will buy their way out of it in the final \nhours of the 106th Congress.\n  Senator Daschle, Democrats, listen to me, please. We are not going to \nbuy our way out of it. I don't want to buy our way out of it. The \nAmerican taxpayers don't want us to buy our way out of it. They want \ngood, sound policy, recognizing important programs. But they also know \nwe are increasing Government spending at a near record rate now and, at \nthe same time, we truly do have a surplus that ought to go home to the \nAmerican taxpayer from whence it came. It is not our money; it is the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  That is why Senator Lott, the majority leader of the Senate, and \nCongressman Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House, in a meeting with \nPresident, said: Mr. President, let's take 90 percent of the surplus, \nif you are not going to let us give it back in taxes, and let's use it \nto pay down the debt; 90 percent of the surplus could go against the \ndebt. That leaves 10 percent of the surplus to spend on programs.\n  Well, they can't even agree with that on the other side, when the \nAmerican people are clearly saying: Give us tax relief. But if you \ncan't do that, pay down the debt.\n  For gosh sakes, don't spend that money. Get Americans debt free. Buy \ndown that nearly $6 trillion debt in a way that is manageable, \nresponsible to the economy--but, most importantly, in a way that is \nresponsible to our young people and to their futures. It is a debt they \nwill, obviously, have to assume.\n  Mr. Daschle's answer is to stall. How do you stall? This is how you \ndo it. When the leader comes to the floor and asks unanimous consent \nthat H.R. 3615, the Rural Local Broadcast Signal Act--simple but \nimportant, and it is called the rural satellite bill--is ready to go, \nsomebody from the other side stands up and says, ``I object.'' Senator \nLeahy did that for Senator Daschle.\n  Stalling tactic? You bet. I call that stall No. 1. Here is stall No. \n2: H.R. 1776, the national manufactured housing construction bill. It \nhas 32 cosponsors, including Democrats such as Senators Bryan, Cleland, \nand Hollings. The Leader requested, on September 8, to go to a \nconference to solve our problems. This is for safety requirements for \nmanufactured housing. Senator Leahy, for Senator Daschle, said, ``I \nobject.'' Stall No. 2.\n  Stall No. 3, H.R. 1259, Social Security and Medicare Safety Deposit \nAct, the lockbox: Democrats and the President are trying to take credit \nfor that right now. They fought us for a year on it. Senator Ashcroft \nof Missouri was the one who came up with the idea. News stories are \nreplete about Republicans talking about that idea for the last year and \na half. And now, of course, because some folks on the other side of the \naisle want credit when we proposed bringing that up to debate it, to \nhave it, and to truly protect Social Security revenues, oops, stall No. \n3.\n  This time Senator Daschle himself came out and objected to reaffirm \nwhat he said to USA Today on September 8. They won't even let that go.\n  Here is stall tactic No. 4, four district judges: We have been \ncriticized all year because we won't confirm the judges the President \nhas sent up. Majority Leader Trent Lott brings the judge bill to the \nfloor, judges the Democrats want, judges the Republicans want, but, \nmost importantly, judges that this President sent up. He brought the \njudges to the floor. Let's see. He brought a judge for Senator Durbin; \nhe brought a judge for Arizona, and everybody agreed on these judges; \nDaschle himself objected, stall tactic No. 4.\n  These are just functionary, important kinds of necessarily ``get done \nif you can'' kinds of things. We have time to do it. It doesn't require \nlots of debate. But it clearly appears to me that no action goes forth. \nAnd if we can stop that action, surely those Republicans in time will \ncave.\n  Here is stall tactic No. 5, intelligence authorization: A request to \ngo to the conference with Democrat amendments submitted to Daschle \nthrough a staff channel on September 7--no response from Daschle or \nothers--with an indication that Democrats are preparing additional \namendments, stall tactic No. 5.\n  My goodness, aren't we going to get these authorizations done? They \nare very important.\n  Here are four nominations to the U.S. Institute for Peace. I am not \ngoing to stand here and suggest the Democrats aren't for peace. We are \nall for peace. But at least they objected to moving nominations on the \nInstitute for Peace; stall No. 6.\n  A document that made stall No. 7 happen on the 13th of this month was \na major report coming out of our Federal Government saying that \nviolence in the media, violence in video games, violence on television, \nand violence in the movies is truly producing a culture of violence \nthat could and appears to be translating into violent youth of America \nwith young people witnessing over 100,000 acts of violence, actually \nwatching on television, although acted and cast--8,000 murders during \ntheir young lifetime. Somehow that is important. We have been talking \nabout it for years as being darned important.\n  Senator Joe Lieberman, now Vice-Presidential candidate, proposed what \nis known as the ``Media Violence Labeling and Advertising Act of \n2000.'' Senator John McCain supported him. It is bipartisan with \nDemocrats and Republicans, and now a national issue made true by \nstudies and analyses of our Federal Government as to the impact on \nyoung people. We brought it to the floor. That is S. 2497, bipartisan\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nlegislation, and there was objection to the unanimous consent to move \nit forward.\n  For the week, that is stall tactic No. 7.\n  What will next week hold? We are going to conclude PNTR on a vote on \nTuesday, I believe. We have numerous appropriations bills that ought to \nbe dealt with. Hopefully, we can and will deal with them and in doing \nso pick up the pace around here and get our work done so that we can \nadjourn--so that we can send a very clear message to the American \npeople of the intent of this Congress to balance the budget; to hold \nsacred the Social Security surplus; to make sure that we deal with \nhealth care in a responsible way for our citizens; hopefully that we \ncould give back a few of these surplus tax dollars, but if we can't do \nthat, at least dedicate a large portion of it to debt buy-down so that \nyoung people in their lifetime won't have to finance the debt structure \nof the generation before them.\n\n  Those are responsible and right things to do, and I hope we can do \nthem. But I will be back next week to talk probably about stall tactic \nNo. 8, No. 9, No. 10, and No. 11. At least I am going to until the \nminority leader comes to the floor and he recants and says that he \ndidn't say this or that this isn't a strategy because if it is a \nstrategy, it is bad politics, and it is darned bad government to simply \nsay, no, we are not going to work until we get the right to spend \nbillions and billions of dollars of more money. That is not bipartisan. \nMost importantly, that is bad policy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I started the first of what will \nbe five or more brief statements on issues related to the subject of \nthe Federal Government providing a prescription medication benefit to \nMedicare recipients.\n  Yesterday, I opened this series with a discussion of what I consider \nto be the most important reform required in the Medicare system; and \nthat is reforming a 35-year-old health care system which was \nestablished to provide acute care; that is, care after an illness had \nmatured into a major condition, or after an accident had caused a \nperson to require specific medical attention largely in a hospital \nsetting.\n  What was not included as part of the 1965 Medicare program was an \nemphasis on what seniors want today; and that is, they want a system \nthat will not just treat them after they are seriously ill but to have \ntreatment that will avoid or reduce the impact of those illnesses \nthrough effective preventive strategies.\n  Those preventive strategies have many components, including regular \nscreenings for those conditions that can be detected at an early time; \nand then the management, through a variety of sources, of those chronic \nconditions so that they do not mature into serious health concerns, in \nsome cases even death.\n  To me, the conversion of Medicare from a sickness program to a \nwellness program is the fundamental reform that this Congress must \nachieve.\n  If we are going to have this new orientation on wellness, \nprescription drugs will play a critical role. Prescription drugs are a \npart of almost every methodology of managing a medical condition which, \nif not appropriately managed, could mature into serious complications. \nPrescription drugs are a key to providing true quality preventive care \nfor our senior citizens.\n  My point is illustrated by an example.\n  Mrs. Jones is a Medicare beneficiary. She has, like an increasingly \nlarge number of Medicare beneficiaries, no drug coverage. \nUnfortunately, Mrs. Jones also has diabetes, hypertension, and high \ncholesterol. These are three conditions which in the past would have \nbeen debilitating, even fatal. Today, thanks to the miracle of modern \nmedicine, Mrs. Jones can treat these conditions and continue to live a \nhealthy life.\n  Mrs. Jones is likely to be treated with Glucopahge, Procardia XL, and \nLipitor.\n  The annual cost of Glucophage will be $708. The annual cost for \nProcardia XL will be approximately $500 to $900, depending on whether \n30 or 60 milligram tablets are prescribed. The annual cost of Lipitor \nis approximately $700. The total annual spending for these three drugs \nalone for Mrs. Jones will range between $1,900 and $2,300. These costs, \nfor most seniors--I would argue, for most Americans--are likely to \ncause significant economic hardship. But if Mrs. Jones does not take \nthese drugs, she will find her conditions raging out of control and \nwill surely be a candidate for expensive hospital stays and surgery.\n  Those last two comments underscore the fact that this is a medical \nissue in terms of will we make available and affordable to our older \ncitizens those drugs which are available to manage conditions and avoid \nthose conditions maturing into the need for expensive hospitalization, \nsurgery, or even conditions that are beyond the ability of those heroic \nmeasures to stop the unending pace towards death. It is also an \neconomic issue.\n  For most seniors, there are many years of preparation for retirement, \npreparation which is particularly oriented to assure that there will be \nan economic foundation under their retirement years. There are many \nchallenges and risks to that economic foundation. Today the most \nprominent of those risks, the one which is most feared by millions of \nolder Americans, is the fact that they will, in fact, be diagnosed as \nhaving some condition which, the good news is, is treatable and \ncontrollable. The bad news is, it will wreck their economic foundation \nto pay the cost of those drugs. We are dealing not only with an issue \nof medical humanity but also of economic security. We owe it to our \nNation's seniors that they have the chance to live a full, healthy, and \neconomically secure life in retirement. Prescription medications are a \nkey to allowing them to do so.\n  When Medicare was established in 1965, Mrs. Jones may have benefited \nmost by a system that provided effective hospital care, that did not \nhave a particular focus on preventive benefits, where outpatient \nprescription drug coverage was not a particularly significant factor. \nBut in the 35 years since that time, medical science and our set of \nvalues of what we want from our health care system have changed \ndramatically.\n  Today pharmaceuticals, not surgery, are the first line of defense \nagainst illnesses. The number of prescriptions for American seniors \ngrew from 648 million as recently as 1992 to more than 1 billion in the \nyear 2000. One example of this transition from surgery to \npharmaceuticals is the treatment of ulcers. It used to be that the \nstandard treatment was surgery. Today surgery for ulcers is a very rare \nevent. What has happened is the substitution of effective \npharmaceuticals to treat, remedy, and reverse ulcerous conditions.\n  A senior is better because he or she has avoided the necessity of \nintrusive surgery. Our taxpayers are better because they have avoided \nthe cost of that surgery, and the senior is able to resume a normal \nquality of life.\n  We should think of preventive medication today as the anesthesiology \nof the last century. I have suggested that if Medicare had been \ncreated, not in 1965 but at the end of the Civil War in 1865, there \nwould have been the same debate that we are having today over whether \nwe should include anesthesiology. As we know from our study of Civil \nWar history, it was not uncommon for very serious surgical procedures \nto be conducted without anesthesiology. Today we would think it to be\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\nludicrous to the extreme and inconceivably inhumane not to have \nanesthesiology as a core part of a health care system. I suggest that \nin a few years people will look back on this debate with the same shock \nand surprise that we thought there was any debate over the question of \nwhether pharmaceuticals should be part of an appropriate humane health \ncare system as we begin the 21st century.\n\n  Medicare beneficiaries should not have to choose between bankrupting \nthemselves and their families or succumbing to a preventable disease. \nThe key to modernizing Medicare is turning it from a sickness program \nto a wellness program. Prescription drug coverage is a crucial \ncomponent of that change.\n  Let me give another example. A senior with gastrointestinal problems \nis most likely to be prescribed a drug known as Prilosec. Based on 1998 \ndata from the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the \nElderly program, which is the largest outpatient prescription drug \nprogram in the country, Prilosec is the second highest selling drug \nprescribed for seniors. The annual cost is $1,455. For a senior who, \nfor instance, is at 200 percent of the poverty level, $16,700 per year, \nPrilosec will consume $1 out of every $11 of that senior's income. This \nprice is very high for that senior. But the price the senior would pay \nif he or she did not take Prilosec is even higher. They would sacrifice \nan active, pain free life for one riddled with chronic pain.\n  This body should recognize that prescription drugs are an integral \npart of a preventive care strategy for the Medicare program. As one of \nthe primary guardians and trustees of the Medicare program, the Senate \nhas the responsibility to reform and modernize Medicare so that it \nfocuses on health promotion and disease prevention for all of our \nMedicare beneficiaries. It can improve the quality of life for older \ncitizens through making this conversion from a sickness to a wellness \nprogram.\n  The Medicare program can also slow the cost to the taxpayers by \nmaking this transition. The cost of one senior, typically an older \nwoman who falls and, because of her shallow bone mass, injures her hip \nand requires hospitalization, often surgery, and always a long and \npainful recovery period, the cost of that to the taxpayers is much \ngreater than the cost of one of the preventive measures which is now \nbeing recommended but which is yet to be covered by Medicare; that is, \neffective hormone management techniques which will contribute to \nmaintaining strong bone conditions and reducing the vulnerability to \nthat kind of a serious mishap.\n  It has been proven time and time again that a combination of \npreventive services and appropriate medication can reduce the incidence \nof stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and other potentially fatal \nconditions.\n  Detailed programmatic changes--changes based upon the realization \nthat prescription drugs and preventive services go hand in hand--are \nnecessary to convert the current Medicare system into one that best \nserves our citizens by keeping them well as long as possible.\n  Mr. President, we are very fortunate to be living in an era of \nunprecedented prosperity. This period gives to us, the trustees of the \nMedicare system, an even greater responsibility and opportunity. We can \nuse this period of prosperity to reform the Medicare program, to assure \nthat our seniors will be able to live longer, healthier lives through \npreventive care and the treatments that are available to us today. To \ncapitalize upon this opportunity we must provide a prescription benefit \nwhich is affordable and comprehensive for our Medicare beneficiary \ncitizens.\n  I implore each of us to take advantage of this opportunity and use \nthe funds that are available to us now to implement change that will \nbenefit our seniors today, our children and grandchildren tomorrow.\n  We have discussed the need to reform the Medicare program to shift \nits focus from the treatment of illness to the maintenance of good \nhealth. We have discussed the critical role that prescription \nmedications play in ensuring a successful preventive care strategy for \nMedicare. If we agree on these issues--and I believe there is broad \nconsensus--the next question we must answer is: How should a \nprescription drug benefit be made available for our Medicare \nbeneficiaries?\n  Next week, I will discuss the critical question of whether a \nprescription drug benefit should be part of the big tent of Medicare \nprogram, or if it should be placed as a sideshow act outside of \nMedicare. I look forward to discussing this with my colleagues next \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8630-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8630-S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BUSH HITS GORE ON DRUGS AND TAXES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to close with a comment about an \narticle that appeared in today's Washington Post under the headline, \n``Bush Hits Gore on Drugs and Taxes.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, according to this article, there is a new \n30-second ad being run that is entitled ``Drugs and Taxes.'' According \nto the Washington Post article, the audio of this tape begins as \nfollows:\n\n       Al Gore's prescription plan forces seniors into a \n     government-run HMO. Governor Bush gives seniors a choice.\n\n  The Post, in its analysis of this statement, makes the following \ncomment:\n\n       In a classic contrast ad furthering the theme that Gore is \n     untrustworthy, Bush misrepresents the vice president's drug \n     plan. First, it isn't mandatory; seniors can opt for drug \n     coverage or not. Second, Medicare recipients could remain in \n     traditional choose-your-own-doctor plans. Drug payments would \n     be administered through private cost-control groups--such as \n     those now employed by the insurance industry--that are not \n     ``government-run'' or health maintenance organizations. In \n     fact, many analysts say Bush's plan, while providing choices, \n     would encourage more seniors to join cost-conscious HMOs.\n\n  I only add to that analysis of this ad that it is interesting to me \nthat the word ``HMO'' is inserted in the ad of Governor Bush as a \npejorative. This Senate has been trying for the better part of the last \n2 years to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights in order to lay out some \nbasic standards of protection as they relate to the beneficiaries of \nHMOs, the citizens who look to the HMO to finance their health care, \nthe providers--doctors and hospitals--who are the source of that health \ncare, and the HMO which has received the premium dollars from the \npatients and is now called upon to pay the providers for the cost of \nservices delivered to the beneficiaries.\n  It has been my position--and I believe today a majority of the \nSenate's, as well as a very strong majority in the House of \nRepresentatives--that it is a Federal responsibility to establish some \nbasic standards of that relationship so that there will be a comfort \nlevel that people know what will be expected. They will know how they \nwould be treated, whether it is in the emergency room, whether it is in \naccess to a specialist physician, whether it is a woman's right to use \nher gynecologist as her primary care physician; all of those very \nintimate issues will have a known, federally established standard.\n  Yet in spite of that majority support in both Houses of the Congress, \nwe have gone month after month after month unable to even have the \nconference committee report out a bill that we can debate and decide \nwhether it meets the appropriate standards of providing those standards \nof treatment for patients, providers, and the HMO itself.\n  It is surprising to me, therefore, in that context that now Governor \nBush apparently has concluded that the HMOs are sufficient pejorative \nthat he can use them as the target of his attack of what we don't want \nin our health care system. I hope this ad might serve the probably \nunintended purpose of galvanizing an even broader coalition within the \nCongress behind the necessity for HMO reform and for the establishment \nof a basic set of patients' rights.\n  If Presidential candidate Governor Bush has seen the HMO as such a \npejorative figure that he is now attacking it in his ads, that might \nsend a signal as to what the American people want us to do in terms of \nbeginning to rectify that negative image by providing some effective \nnationwide standards of Patients' Bill of Rights for HMOs.\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\n  So I will conclude with that side comment. I do hope that on this \nimportant issue of the provision of prescription drug benefits, we will \ndeescalate the misrepresentation of both parties' plans. I happen to \nhave my own strong preference as to which plan I think will best serve \nthe needs of the American people, and particularly our 39 million \nMedicare beneficiaries, but I think we ought to treat both plans with \nthe respect they deserve, have a full and serious debate on those \nplans, use the election of November 7 as a national referendum as to \nhow we wish to proceed, and then if, unfortunately, we have failed to \nact on prescription drugs during the remaining weeks of this session, \nwe would reconvene in January of 2001 with a President who has a \nmandate from the people for a clear direction, and we will respond to \nthat mandate by effective action.\n  If we achieve that goal, then to the extent of this very critical \nissue, the democratic process is alive, healthy, and performing one of \nits fundamental functions of converting public aspirations into policy \nthat will benefit their lives.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Bush Hits Gore on Drugs, Taxes\n\n                           (By Howard Kurtz)\n\n       Candidate: George W. Bush.\n       Markets: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and 14 other \n     states.\n       Producer: Maverick Media.\n       Time: 30 seconds.\n       Audio: ``Al Gore's prescription plan forces seniors into a \n     government-run HMO. Governor Bush gives seniors a choice. \n     Gore says he's for school accountability, but requires no \n     real testing. Governor Bush requires tests and holds schools \n     accountable for results. Gore's targeted tax cuts leave out \n     50 million people--half of all taxpayers. Under Bush, every \n     taxpayer gets a tax cut and no family pays more than a third \n     of their income to Washington. Governor Bush has real plans \n     that work for real people.''\n       Analysis: In a classic contrast ad furthering his theme \n     that Gore is untrustworthy, Bush misrepresents the vice \n     president's drug plan. First, it isn't mandatory; seniors can \n     opt for drug coverage or not. Second, Medicare recipients \n     could remain in traditional choose-your-own doctor plans. \n     Drug payments would be administered through private cost-\n     control groups--such as those now employed by the insurance \n     industry--that are not ``government-run'' or health \n     maintenance organizations. In fact, many analysts say Bush's \n     plan, while providing choices, would encourage more seniors \n     to join cost-conscious HMOs. Bush's education plan does place \n     more emphasis than Gore's on holding schools accountable, \n     though the Texas governor would spend less. Bush's $1.6 \n     trillion tax cut would reach far more Americans than Gore's \n     $500 billion cut, which would be tied to specific behavior, \n     and the Gore camp essentially concedes the point by saying \n     that 40 million taxpayers, not 50 million, would get no \n     benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8631-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8631-S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. \nAs a Nation we remember and honor all those who were prisoners of war \nand those who are still MIA. It is altogether fitting that they have \nthis special day where we express gratitude for their service, for \ntheir sacrifices, and for the sacrifices of their families. We also \ntake this day to assure the many families who still await the return of \na loved one that we have not forgotten.\n  As a former Navy officer, I feel strongly that the United States \nGovernment must fulfill its commitments to the men and women who serve \nin the armed forces. One of these commitments is using every available \nmeans to ensure the return of POWs and MIAs at the end of hostilities. \nWe must continue to support the vigorous pursuit of this commitment \nthrough on-site investigations being undertaken in Indochina and \nthrough a fuller examination of records in the United States, Russia \nand Asia. I would like us to renew our promise to the families and to \nthe Nation to tirelessly fight for the fullest possible disclosure of \ninformation about the many Americans missing or unaccounted for from \nWorld War I, World War II, the Korean War, in Southeast Asia, and from \nthe Cold War.\n  As we renew that promise, we can also count some accomplishments. In \nthe past year, the remains of 49 Americans were returned from the war \nin Southeast Asia; however, 2005 Americans remain unaccounted for from \nthat war--1,511 in Vietnam alone.\n  All year, veterans in Indiana and around the country have been \nholding commemorative events marking the 50th anniversary of the Korean \nWar. This year has also seen progress in negotiations with the North \nKorean Government. In June, we witnessed a historic summit between \nNorth and South Korea, which could lead to further breakthroughs. \nWithin the past three months, joint United States-North Korean remains \nrecovery operations have returned the remains of 28 Americans. Since \n1996, teams from the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in \nHawaii have conducted 15 such operations and recovered remains believed \nto be 68 soldiers. Though many of these MIA files were dormant for \nyears because we had no diplomatic ties with the North Koreans, \nadvances in DNA identification procedures create the hope that all of \nthese remains will be identified.\n  This is a team effort and requires the firm commitments of the \nCongress, the Administration, the Departments of Defense and State, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Agency. I am hopeful \nthat all of us, through continued humanitarian support and dedicated \ndiplomatic endeavors, will gain further information about the \nservicemen still missing to honor their sacrifice and provide peace of \nmind to their loved ones.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to remind my colleagues that today \nis National POW/MIA Recognition Day. On this occasion, we should \nremember and pay tribute to the 2,005 soldiers, sailors, marines, and \nairmen who are still missing and unaccounted for, and we stand in \nsolidarity with their loved ones and families. I am humbled by, and \ngrateful for their love of country and sense of duty and honor.\n  It is difficult not to feel uneasy amidst the mixture of somber \nthoughts and feelings of gratitude and pride that this day brings. \nUneasy, because, while we are a nation at peace and the wars in which \nthese men fought are long over, they have not all returned home.\n  These Americans swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, \nand with great personal sacrifice, carried through on that promise to \ntheir nation. Undoubtedly, many endured years in starved, tortured, \nisolated misery. Their integrity and heroism are examples of the core \nvalues on which this nation was founded.\n  Today, I want to pay special tribute to the dedication and service of \nthe soldiers from my home State of Minnesota who are or were POW/MIAs \nfrom the Vietnam war and the Korean war.\n  These great Americans and their families have the gratitude of this \nfree Nation. Yet, we must not rest until all American POW/MIAs are \nreturned and accounted for, and the many questions that have \noverwhelmed their families are answered. I urge the Senate, the \nadministration, the Departments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, and the National Security Agency to redouble their efforts to \nbring our soldiers home as quickly as possible.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are approaching \nthe end of our debate on PNTR. This legislation will authorize the \nPresident to grant permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China \nafter he certifies to Congress that the terms of China's accession to \nthe WTO are at least equivalent to those agreed in the U.S.-PRC \nbilateral agreement reached last November.\n  Before the President can make that certification, the ongoing \nmultilateral negotiations in Geneva must be completed, specifically, \nthe Protocol of Accession and the Working Party Report to the WTO \nGeneral Council.\n  China is a nation where a free market and the rule of law are in the \nearliest stage of development. Accession to the WTO, and our granting \nPNTR, are just the first steps in that process.\n  China's integration into the global trade community will not be \ncompleted overnight. It will take a lot of work by economic reformers \nin China. And it will take a lot of work by leaders in the United \nStates and in other WTO members to ensure that China stays on course.\n  Over the coming years, we will have to put a lot of effort into \nscrutinizing closely and constantly China's compliance with its \ncommitments. That is why earlier this year I introduced the China WTO \nCompliance Act. I was glad that some of the provisions in my proposal \nwere adopted by the House. Other issues raised in my bill will be dealt \nwith in a three-year investigation that we on the Finance Committee \nhave requested that the General Accounting Office carry out. And that \nis why I support the President's request for a significant increase in \nthe resources of the Executive Branch to monitor compliance with trade \nagreements.\n  Today, I would like to mention several issues in the ongoing \nnegotiations in Geneva. In addition to informing my colleagues about \nthese issues, I am also using this opportunity to remind our American \nnegotiators and the Chinese leadership about the importance of \nresolving these issues properly.\n  Section 401 of the bill states that it is the objective of the United \nStates to obtain, in China's protocol of accession, an annual review \nwithin the WTO of China's compliance with its terms of accession. China \nis a nation where a free market and the rule of law are in the earliest \nstage of development. The success of the WTO, by contrast, is premised \non its members having relatively free markets operating against a \nbackdrop of the rule-of-law. For China's transition to membership in \nthe world trading community to be smooth, China will have to undertake \nmajor reforms in many areas, from intellectual property law, to customs \nprocedure, to judicial process.\n  Some of this is underway. It poses a uniquely massive challenge to \nChina and to the world trading community. Some of the issues that come \nup may be handled through dispute settlement. But the WTO's dispute \nsettlement mechanism has limited resources, and a flood of China cases \ncould overwhelm the system. Rather than deal with all of China's \ntransition issues one dispute at a time, it is vital to deal with \ngroups of issues as a bloc, through regular annual reviews.\n  China has objected to having its implementation of trade obligations \nreviewed every other year, which is the current demand on the table in \nthe protocol negotiations. They want to be treated as a developing \ncountry, which means a review every four years. China has also proposed \nthat the focus of such reviews be shifted away from China and instead \nlook at ``abuse by any Member of any specific provisions imposed \nespecially on China in this Protocol.''\n  This is absolutely unacceptable. The issue is China's implementation. \nIf China believes that other members are abusing China-specific \nmeasures in the protocol of accession, it should challenge those \npractices in the dispute settlement mechanism. We cannot allow \nattention to be deflected from China's record.\n  In June, Canada offered an intriguing proposal, whereby each \n``subsidiary body'' of the WTO, that is, the councils and committees \nthat have responsibility for particular subject matters, would meet in \nspecial session at least once a year to review China's implementation \nof its trade obligations. We should support the Canadian proposal, \nwhich is a common-sense approach.\n  China has insisted for years that it should enjoy the rights and \nspecial treatment accorded to developing country members. We must \ncontinue to reject China's position on this point. China is unique. It \nis not simply another developing country, and it should not \nautomatically be allowed to avail itself of developing country \nprovisions in the WTO. China's size, the extent of state ownership, and \nthe transitional nature of its economy and legal institutions, all \nshould be taken into account in deciding the developing versus \ndeveloped issue in particular instances. It must be on a case-by-case \nbasis.\n  For example, if China automatically received developing country \nstatus for all purposes, it would receive special treatment under the \nsubsidies agreement. Then, export subsidies and subsidies in the form \nof operating loss coverage would not be treated as prohibited \nsubsidies. The burden of challenging those subsidies in the WTO would \nbe much greater than under ordinary rules. This would be particularly \ntroublesome, given the level of state ownership in China.\n  This bill contains a safeguard provision (sec. 103) that lets U.S. \nindustries, workers, and farmers obtain relief from surges of imports \nfrom China. The provision reflects the terms of the November, 1999, \nU.S.-China bilateral agreement. Among its provisions is a rule that \nwill govern the granting of relief when there is ``trade diversion''--\nthat is, when another country provides safeguard relief from surges of \nChinese goods, and the goods are then diverted to the United States.\n  China has proposed that ``trade diversion'' would only be considered \nto exist when there is clear evidence that imports are increasing \n``significantly and absolutely,'' and are ``a significant cause of \nmaterial injury'' to the domestic industry in the country to which the \ngoods have been diverted.\n  We must reject this proposal. It is counter to our bilateral \nagreement in November which included none of these limitations on our \ntaking action.\n  The safeguard provision, including insulation against trade \ndiversion, is a very important feature of this bill. It ensures that if \nshifts in trade patterns following China's entry into the world trading \nsystem cause or threaten dislocations to American workers, businesses, \nand farmers, they will be able to obtain relief quickly. We must reject \nany efforts by China to weaken those commitments.\n  Under our bilateral agreement, China agreed to protect all rights \nacquired by American insurance companies prior to China joining the \nWTO. Specifically, China committed to permit existing insurance branch \noperations to sub-branch in the future on a wholly owned basis. I \nunderstand USTR continues to work with China to correct this situation, \nboth bilaterally and multilaterally in Geneva. I have written to \nAmbassador Li to make certain he understands the importance I attach to \nthis matter. It is essential that China rectify this situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8633-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8633-S8634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ESTATE TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, recently, President Clinton vetoed \nlegislation that would have repealed the estate tax, legislation that I \nstrongly supported. I fundamentally oppose the estate tax. I call it \nthe ``death tax.'' This has been a concern of mine for some time now. \nIn fact, I have previously introduced legislation that would do away \nwith this unfair tax.\n  Congress has clearly demonstrated its support for easing this burden. \nThe\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gradually increases the exemption. Last \nyear, Congress decided that further action was needed and passed a bill \nthat would have eliminated the federal estate tax. Unfortunately, the \nPresident chose to veto that bill.\n  The United States has one of the highest estate taxes in the world. \nWhile income tax rates have declined in recent decades, estate taxes \nhave remained high. Today, the death tax is imposed on estates with \nassets of more than $675,000. The rates begin at 37% and very rapidly \nrise to 55%. Some estates even pay a marginal rate of 60%!\n  This issue really hits home for me. Family farms and small businesses \nare two of the groups most affected by the estate tax. I grew up on my \nfamily's farm in Colorado, and I owned a small business before I came \nto Washington. So, I truly understand the concerns of those who live in \nfear of the impact that this tax will have on their legacy to their \nchildren.\n  The estate tax has resulted in the loss of family farms and family \nbusinesses across the nation. Many people work their entire lives to \nbuild a business that they can pass on to their children. When these \nhard-working businessmen and farmers pass away, their families are \noften forced to sell off the business to pay the estate tax. I see this \nas an affront to those who try to pass on the fruits of their lives' \nwork to their children.\n  The people affected by this tax are not necessarily wealthy. Many \nsmall businesspeople are cash poor, but asset rich. For example, the \nowner of a small restaurant might have $800,000 of assets, but not much \ncash on hand. Her children will still have to pay an excessive tax on \nthe assets. The beer wholesaler, who has invested all of his revenue in \ntrucks and storage, might have more than $675,000 in assets. That does \nnot make him a cash-wealthy man. Yet, he is still subject to this so-\ncalled ``tax on the wealthy.''\n  The death tax also impacts employment and the economy. When a family-\nowned farm or a small business closes, the workers lose their jobs. \nConversely, leaving resources in the economy can create jobs. A recent \nGeorge Mason study found that if the estate tax were phased out over \nfive years, the economy would create 198,895 more jobs, and grow by an \nadditional $509 billion over a ten-year period.\n  Additionally, the estate tax is a disincentive for Americans to save \ntheir earnings. The government has created a number of tax breaks and \nother incentives for those who save their money: 401(k)s and IRA's--to \nname a few. Yet, the estate tax sends a contradictory message. \nBasically, it says, ``If you don't spend all your savings by the time \nyou die, the government will penalize you.'' This tax is no small \npenalty, either. We are talking about some very high tax rates.\n  The death tax also represents an unjust double taxation. The savings \nwere taxed initially when they were earned. Then, when the saver passes \naway, the government comes along and takes a second cut. There is no \ngood reason for the current system--other than the government's desire \nto make a profit at the already trying time of the death of a dear one.\n  The current death tax law has a greater effect on the lower end of \nthe scale than the higher. Wealthy people can afford lawyers and \nplanners to help them plan their estate. Those at the lower end of the \nestate tax scale are often unable to afford sophisticated estate \nplanning. So the current law also makes the tax somewhat regressive, \nwhich is not fair.\n  Planning and compliance with the estate tax can consume substantial \nresources. In 1995, the Gallup organization surveyed family firms. \nTwenty-three percent of owners of companies valued over $10 million \nsaid that they pay more than $50,000 per year in insurance premiums on \npolicies to help them pay the eventual bill. To plan for the estate \ntax, the firms also spent an average of $33,000 on lawyers, accountants \nand financial planners, over a period of several years. This is money \nthat could have been better spent to expand the business and create new \njobs--rather than dealing with the death tax.\n  The estate tax only raises one percent of federal revenue, yet it \ncosts farms, businesses and jobs. No American family should lose their \nfarm or business because of the federal government. I support full \nrepeal of the federal estate tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8634-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

FRIX\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize General Robert \nS. Frix, an outstanding individual from my State, who is the recipient \nof the Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.\n  This award is bestowed upon a select group of Eagle Scouts who are \nchosen by a national review board as distinguished individuals who, by \nsharing their talents and time with others, have improved their \ncommunities. General Frix clearly deserves this rare honor for his \nservice to our country, his profession and community.\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\n  Our country owes a great debt of gratitude to General Frix for his \ndecorated military service and accomplishments. A West Point graduate, \nhe served our country for 34 years, earning the rank of Major General \nand numerous decorations including two Distinguished Service Medals, 26 \nAir Medals, and two Meritorious Service Medals.\n  Through two tours each in Vietnam and Germany, he distinguished \nhimself as a leader, but his duty in the Middle East is most notable. \nAs Chief of Staff and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Forces \nCentral Command during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he was \ninstrumental in rescuing Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's siege. Commanding \nthe Joint Task Force Kuwait, he led the enforcement of U.N. Resolution \n688.\n  Following his military service, General Frix turned to a different \nkind of battle, that of decommissioning, cleaning-up, and restoring \nU.S. Department of Energy former nuclear weapons fabrication and \nmaterials production sites. Formerly at the Rocky Flats, Colorado site \nand currently at the Hanford site in my state of Washington, he manages \npersonnel and multimillion dollar budgets in order to accomplish the \nclean-up and disposal of highly radioactive, toxic and hazardous \nmaterials. At the helm of the DynCorp company, he and his employees \nhave achieved an outstanding environmental safety record.\n  All the while, General Frix uses his talents for the benefit of \nothers and remains committed to serving his community as the national \npresident of the Army Aviation Association of America Scholarship \nFoundation and as a lifetime member of the Disabled American Veterans. \nIn addition, he has used his military management skills to retire \ncouncil debts and raise almost $10 million in endowment as a member of \nthe Blue Mountain Council Executive Board and Senior Vice President of \nFinance.\n  General Frix willingness to help his community extends into his \nprofessional career in which he and his colleagues at DynCorp have \nworked side by side to construct park facilities and renovate a local \ncancer treatment facility. He is highly regarded by business associates \nas a community leader who sets an example for others to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8635-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REIT ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the real estate investment trust, \nor REIT, turned 40 years old yesterday. It has been a remarkable four \ndecades for this investment vehicle. The goal of Congress in creating \nREITs back in 1960 was to give the small investor an opportunity to \ninvest in portfolios of large-scale, commercial properties. Today, \nanyone and everyone can buy shares of real estate operating companies \nthat focus on particular sectors or regions of the country.\n  In January, the REIT Modernization Act will take effect. Adopted by \nCongress last year, this law will permit REITs to remain competitive in \nthe real estate marketplace by creating subsidiaries to offer the same \nrange of tenant services provided by its competitors. And, as the REIT \nmarks its 40th anniversary, so too does its association, NAREIT, the \nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. NAREIT's annual \nconvention will be held here in Washington, DC next month, and we wish \nthem well on another successful event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8635-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on today, September 15, \n2000, he presented to the President of the United States the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1374.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require \nmotor vehicle manufacturers and motor vehicle equipment manufacturers \nto obtain information and maintain records about potential safety \ndefects in their foreign products that may affect the safety of \nvehicles and equipment in the United States, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     motor vehicle and motor vehicle equipment defect notification \n                            improvement act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise along with several of my colleagues \nto introduce legislation to reform the process used by the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate and order recalls \nfor safety related defects in motor vehicles. We introduce this \nlegislation today partly in response to the recall of 14.4 million \nFirestone tires and the 88 deaths and more than 250 injuries associated \nwith those tires.\n  Over the past two weeks in a series of House and Senate hearings, we \nhave begun to learn the details of how the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, Ford Motor Company and Bridgestone/Firestone \nfailed to detect and effectively respond to defective tires that were \nkilling or causing serious harm to consumers. Based upon the still \nmounting evidence, it is increasingly difficult to believe that neither \nthe companies nor NHTSA knew anything of this problem until after this \nsummer. Annual claims reports from Firestone show an increase in claims \nassociated with the tires subject to the recall beginning in 1996 \nthrough 1999. Ford also received numerous complaints about Firestone \ntires on Explorers in overseas markets. These complaints were \nsignificant enough to cause Ford to replace tires in 16 foreign \ncountries. NHTSA was notified on at least two occasions by State Farm \nInsurance Company that there may be a problem with Firestone tires on \nFord Explorers. Taken individually each of these incidents may not be \ncause for alarm. But taken collectively it is difficult to believe that \nno one realized this was a problem until a month ago.\n  I cite these facts not as evidence of guilt but as an example of the \nproblems with the current system. NHTSA has neither the resources, the \nstatutory authority nor the internal processes to detect and remedy \nsafety related defects in timely fashion. The current system must be \nchanged. When manufacturers fail to tell the truth or purposely neglect \nto report safety data, and people lose their lives, severe penalties \nmust result.\n  It is my hope that in the remaining days of this Congress we can move \nfrom recrimination to reform. Our attention to ensuring the safety of \nthe driving public must not be fleeting. It\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\nunfortunately has taken the cumulative tragedy of more than 80 lives to \nbring our collective attention to the long overdue task of reforming \nthe way we investigate and remedy vehicle defects.\n  The proposal we introduce today attempts to make some basic reforms \nto ensure that the current situation does not repeat itself. It would \nauthorize the Secretary of Transportation to require manufacturers of \nmotor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment to report more information \nsuch as claims data, warrant data, and lawsuits. The bill establishes \ncriminal penalties for manufacturers that knowingly sell vehicle with a \nsafety-related defect that causes death or serious injury. The measure \nwill also increase the current cap on civil penalties to from $900,000 \nto $15 million. It provides the Secretary with authority to seek even \ngreater penalties in the conduct is willful and intentional.\n  I know that some of my colleagues believe this legislation does not \ngo far enough and would like to address other motor vehicles safety \nissues or require the reporting of other data. While I share their \nconcerns about those important issues, I caution that we must not make \nthe perfect the enemy of the good. I want to state openly that this \nproposal is no panacea to the problem, and I am perfectly open to \nmaking sensible and prudent adjustments. Next week, it is my intention \nto report this bill from the Senate Commerce Committee. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to address their concerns as we move \nthrough the process.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity before we adjourn to enact some \nbasic reforms to empower the Department of Transportation to respond \neffectively to safety related defects in the future. I hope we will not \nwaste this time and enact these reforms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 3060. A bill to amend the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act of \n2000 to extend the applicability of that act to certain former spouses \nof deceased Hmong veterans; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     technical amendments to the hmong veterans naturalization act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a technical \namendment today that, if passed, would ensure that widows and widowers \nof Hmong veterans who died in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam are also \ncovered by the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act. This critical change \nwould allow such widows to take the United States citizenship test with \na translator.\n  Hmong soldiers died at 10 times the rate of American soldiers in the \nVietnam war. As many as 20,000 Hmong were killed serving our country. \nThey left behind families with no means of support. They left their \nloved ones to fend for themselves in a hostile country.\n  Twenty-five years later, we cannot give widows back their loved ones, \nthough their loved ones gave their lives for us. All we can do is honor \ntheir service in a way that is long-overdue and give them the tools to \nbecome citizens in the nation for which they heroically fought, and \ndied.\n  I want to thank so many of my colleagues who worked so hard to see \nthat the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act pass through Congress and \nbecome law. Hmong widows should have been included when this \nlegislation was first passed and they were not. This amendment simply \ncorrects something that should have been done long ago. I urge its \nswift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 3061. A bill to require the President to negotiate an \ninternational agreement governing the recall by manufacturers of motor \nvehicles and motor vehicle equipment with safety-related defects; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             international consumer safety information act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInternational Consumer Safety Information Act. As we are all aware, \nthere has been a tragic loss of life associated with defects in \nFirestone tires.\n  The loss of 88 lives in the United States alone from defects in \nFirestone tires is extremely tragic. The death toll in other countries \nfrom this U.S. product is reportedly more than 50. Each of these people \nhad dreams that will not be realized. There is nothing we can do that \nwill ever compensate for the loss of one life.\n  However, we have a responsibility to the American people and to \nconsumers worldwide to do everything we can to create accountability \nand to ensure that innocent people are not put at such a high risk in \nthe future. By quickly alerting consumers about motor vehicle or motor \nvehicle equipment recalls around the globe, we will equip people with \npotentially life-saving information.\n  American consumers should be provided with immediate, life-saving \ninformation on motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment recalls, \nregardless of whether the recall originated in the United States or \nanother country. As the chairman of the Consumer Affairs and Foreign \nCommerce Subcommittee, I intend to do what I can on this issue. My \nconsumer protection plan would provide consumers--via the Internet--\nwith more immediate information about recalls of motor vehicles or \nmotor vehicle equipment.\n  U.S. drivers are just not finding out about the Firestone tire \ndefects, but there were tire failures in Venezuela as far back as 1998, \nand in Saudi Arabia, 1999. It is simply unacceptable that American \nofficials abroad did not inform the American public. My proposal would \nensure that this does not happen again.\n  Under the legislation I am introducing today, the President would \nnegotiate an international agreement requiring foreign countries and \nthe United States to maintain an Internet site to inform consumers \nworldwide of recalls of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment. My \nbill includes the following key provisions:\n  The international agreement would have countries include on an \nInternet site the names of companies that have issued recalls, the \ncompanies' contact information, the specific products that are being \nrecalled, the countries in which the recalls are effective, and the \ndate of the recall.\n  In addition, the international agreement would set up guidelines for \na company that initiate a recall of motor vehicle or motor vehicle \nequipment to ensure that they disclose all relevant information to \nconsumers and federal authorities in all countries it sells its \nproducts.\n  Finally, the bill would make the Administration accountable for \ndisclosing information on foreign recalls by ensuring that Congress is \nnotified and by posting the information on an Internet site for the \npublic.\n  It is my hope that the Senate Commerce Committee will act quickly on \nthis measure. At a Commerce Committee hearing this last Tuesday, I \npointed out another harm that can come from a lack of adequate \ninformation about recalls.\n  Almost half of all Ford Explorers, which was a model that used \ndefective Firestone tires, that are assembled in the U.S. are made at a \nplant in Hazelwood, Missouri. I want to visit the workers employed at \nthis plant. The plant has been closed the past two weeks and will not \nreopen to assemble the popular Ford Explorer until next Monday. Most of \nthe 2,000 workers are not reporting to work and are unsure about their \nfuture. Their overtime is nonexistence, and due to the 15,000 Explorers \nthat will not be produced, their profit-sharing is threatened. However, \nthey did not complain about Ford's decision to close the plant in order \nto get tires out to consumers as quickly as possible. In fact, they \nwere proud that the company was willing to take such a drastic measure \nto serve their customers. Most importantly, they want us all to realize \nthat what we do and what we say up here makes a difference. It makes a \ndifference in their lives, and it affects consumer confidence in the \nproduce these workers sweat and toil to produce.\n  My efforts today are intended to shine light on recalls worldwide. \nConsumers should know if there are recalls in other countries, and the \nFederal government should facilitate this transparency. The bill I am \nintroducing today will hopefully ensure that consumers in the U.S.--and \nconsumers worldwide--obtain updated information about recalls around \nthe globe.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8637-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 136\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Torricelli) was added as a cosponsor of S. 136, a bill to \nprovide for teacher excellence and classroom help.\n\n\n                                 S. 522\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith) was added as a cosponsor of S. 522, a bill to \namend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to improve the quality of \nbeaches and coastal recreation water, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1020\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Cochran) and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 1020, a bill to amend chapter 1 of title \n9, United States Code, to provide for greater fairness in the \narbitration process relating to motor vehicle franchise contracts.\n\n\n                                S. 1391\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Feinstein) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1391, a bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to improve benefits for Filipino veterans \nof World War II, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1726\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1726, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat for unemployment compensation \npurposes Indian tribal governments the same as State or local units of \ngovernment or as nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n                                S. 1851\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Enzi) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1851, a bill to amend the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that seniors \nare given an opportunity to serve as mentors, tutors, and volunteers \nfor certain programs.\n\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1900, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a credit to holders of \nqualified bonds issued by Amtrak, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2698\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Edwards) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2698, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an incentive to \nensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable access to the \nInternet over current and future generations of broadband capability.\n\n\n                                S. 2731\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2731, a bill \nto amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to enhance the \nNation's capacity to address public health threats and emergencies.\n\n\n                                S. 2858\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grams, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Mr. Breaux) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2858, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to ensure adequate payment rates for \nambulance services, to apply a prudent layperson standard to the \ndetermination of medical necessity for emergency ambulance services, \nand to recognize the additional costs of providing ambulance services \nin rural areas.\n\n\n                              S.

Bradley, Seth Storrs, Stephen Jacob, Daniel \n     Chipman, Lot Hall, Aaron Leeland, Gershom C. Lyman, Samuel \n     Miller, Jedediah P. Buckingham, and Darius Matthews, \n     petitioned the Vermont General Assembly for the establishment \n     of a new institution of higher education in the town of \n     Middlebury, Vermont;\n       Whereas on November 1, 1800, the Vermont General Assembly \n     adopted a law to establish a college in Middlebury and named \n     this group of distinguished Vermonters to be known as ``the \n     President and fellows of Middlebury college'', and designated \n     Jeremiah Atwater as the new college's first President;\n       Whereas on November 5, 1800, less than 1 week after \n     receiving its Charter, Middlebury College opened its doors to \n     7 students and 1 professor using space at the local grammar \n     school for instruction;\n       Whereas by 1810, the college had grown to 110 students and \n     needed space of its own, and the campus of Middlebury College \n     was built, and on May 19, 2000, the United States Postal \n     Service issued postcards to commemorate the Old Stone Row and \n     the first 3 buildings of the Middlebury College campus;\n       Whereas over the last 2 centuries, Middlebury College has \n     evolved from 1 of the first colleges in the United States \n     into 1 of the most respected liberal arts colleges in the \n     Nation, with more than 2,000 students, almost 200 professors, \n     and a main campus of over 250 acres;\n       Whereas the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning \n     Commission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this \n     milestone in Vermont's and the Nation's educational history;\n       Whereas this bicentennial is a celebration honoring the \n     people and events that have made and continue to make \n     Middlebury College a leader in higher education;\n       Whereas Celebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and \n     symposia, both on campus and at additional locations such as \n     the New York Public Library, and the dedication of a new \n     science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an exterior that \n     resembles the Old Stone Row and the early architectural \n     history of this 200-year-old school; and\n       Whereas the year-long celebration of 2 centuries of quality \n     higher education will culminate during Founders' Week, \n     November 1st through 5th, 2000, when a variety of events will \n     occur in honor of Middlebury, the college, and Middlebury, \n     the college's town: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate commends and congratulates Middlebury \n     College on the completion of its first 200 years of \n     educational excellence and wishes the college continued \n     success as it commences a third century of educational \n     opportunity and leadership; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Senate shall send a copy of this \n     resolution to the Middlebury College President, John M. \n     McCardell, Jr.\n\n\n            Honoring the Bicentennial of Middlebury College\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I want to express my thanks and \nappreciation to my colleagues in the Senate for their support of Senate \nResolution 355 congratulating Middlebury College on the successful \ncompletion of their first 200 years of higher education. I also want to \nthank my friend Senator Hatch and my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee for discharging this resolution in such a timely manner.\n  Later this fall, Middlebury College will enjoy the honor of \ncelebrating its bicentennial. Middlebury College is one of the most \nrespected liberal arts colleges in the nation and it was one of the \nfirst institutions of higher education in Vermont. In November 1800, \nthe school first opened its doors for business to seven students and \none professor in space at the local grammar school. Today, the school \nhas more than two thousand students, almost two hundred professors, and \na main campus of over 250 acres.\n  In recognition of 200 years of educating students from across this \ncountry and the world, the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning \nCommission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this milestone \nin Vermont's and the nation's educational history. The year-long \nbicentennial celebration honors the people and events that have made \nand continue to make Middlebury College a leader in higher education. \nCelebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and symposia, both on campus \nand at additional locations such as the New York Public Library, and \nthe dedication of a new science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an \nexterior that resembles the Old Stone Row and the school's early \narchitectural history. This year-long celebration will culminate later \nthis fall during Founders' Week, a series of events on campus during \nthe first week of November.\n  I am pleased this body has moved so quickly to commend and \ncongratulate Middlebury College on the completion of its first two \nhundred years of educational excellence. I thank my colleagues for \njoining Senator Jeffords, the other cosponsors of this resolution and \nme in honoring the contributions of the school, its students and its \nalumni.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/15/senate-section/article/S8639-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n                NATIONAL ALCOHOL AND DRUG RECOVERY MONTH\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
