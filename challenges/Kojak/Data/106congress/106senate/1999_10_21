The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1692, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1692) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Boxer amendment No. 2320 (to the text of the language \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 2319), to express \n     the Sense of the Congress that, consistent with the rulings \n     of the Supreme Court, a woman's life and health must always \n     be protected in any reproductive health legislation passed by \n     Congress.\n       Harkin amendment No. 2321 (to amendment No. 2320), to \n     express the Sense of Congress in support of the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Roe v. Wade.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n2321.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I also want to say something about the prayer which I found to be \nquite beautiful. I think talking about making sure we have no hate in \nour heart is really important. It is so important to all of us as we \ndebate this legislation, to understand that we have great differences \nbut to try to reach for that part of ourselves that brings us all \ntogether.\n  I thank the guest Chaplain as well.\n  This morning I am very pleased to be here. I know that while \nDemocratic Senators were attending a dinner last evening, the debate \ninto the late hours was rather one-sided. So I really do appreciate the \nfact we have a little time this morning to set the record straight.\n  I am very pleased the Senator from Iowa, who is on his way here, was \nable to place his amendment before the Senate so we could bring back \nthis debate on a woman's right to choose, the fundamental right women \nwon in this country in 1973 when the Court decided that, in fact, a \nwoman in the earlier stages of her pregnancy has a right to choose \nfreely, with her doctor and her husband and her family, as to how to \nhandle their situation. I think it was a very important, landmark \ndecision.\n  The decision went on to say that in the later term, which we are \ntalking about a great deal, the State has the\n\n[[Page S12950]]\n\nright to regulate it. So what Roe did was to balance the rights of the \nwoman, if you will, with the child she is carrying. It says in the late \nterm and in the midterm, the States can regulate the procedure, and \nthat is very important, but the woman's life and the woman's health \nmust always be paramount. This is important.\n  What we have in the underlying bill is just the opposite. The \nunderlying bill makes no exception for a woman's health. Now, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania says there doesn't need to be that exception. \nI didn't know he had a medical degree. I would prefer to listen to the \nobstetricians and gynecologists. He cites 600 doctors. There are 40,000 \nstrong. I prefer to listen to the nurses, to the women who have chosen \nto go into the health professions. All those letters were put into the \nRecord.\n  And so I believe very strongly that we must always protect the life \nand health of a woman while we grapple with the obvious religious, \nmoral, and ethical questions as to what type of restrictions ought to \nbe placed on abortion in the later term.\n  I was very discouraged and saddened by the debate yesterday because I \nthought what came out on this floor were words that were full of hate. \nTo call a doctor an executioner is wrong; to talk about killing babies \nis wrong; and I don't think it brings this Nation closer together on \nthis issue. I do not think it sets an atmosphere in which we can try to \nwork together. But this morning I think we are debating something \ndifferent. We are debating a very fundamental Court decision. The \nHarkin amendment simply says that Court decision should not be \noverturned. I look forward to an overwhelming vote, and I hope it will \nbe overwhelming, not to overturn Roe. Because I think if we do that, \nand that amendment is attached to the underlying bill, it will give the \nPresident even more reason to veto the underlying bill because we will \naffirm that this Senate stands in favor of a woman's right to choose, \nand of Roe. Remember, Roe says that at every stage of a pregnancy the \nwoman's health must be protected. The underlying bill makes no such \nexception.\n\n  When you talk about abortion, you are really talking about choice. \nShould the Government, this Government, this Senate, tell women and \nfamilies what to do in an emergency tragic health situation? That is \nwhat we are talking about in the underlying bill. The Senator from \nPennsylvania says, yes, the Government should tell families what to do. \nUnfortunately, in his argument, in my view--and it is shared by many--\nhe demeans women; he demeans families; and he demeans doctors. Worse \nthan that, far worse than that, he demonizes women, demonizes families \nwho do not agree with him. He demonizes doctors, doctors who bring \nbabies into this world, doctors who help save lives, who protect our \nhealth, who protect a woman's fertility. He does that only if these \nwomen and these families and these doctors do not agree with his views.\n  I guess perhaps the biggest insult and the biggest injury that was \ndone yesterday on this floor was when the Senator from Pennsylvania \ndismissed heartfelt stories of women and their families who have \nstruggled through the biggest tragedy, almost, that anyone can \nimagine--of having to terminate a pregnancy at the final stages because \nsomething has gone horribly wrong and the baby, if born, would suffer \nand the mother would suffer adverse health consequences, irreversible; \nhe called those stories anecdotes. Don't be blinded, he says, by the \nanecdotes of women. I want to say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nwith no hate in my heart whatsoever, you call these stories anecdotes. \nI say these stories are these families' lives. It is what they have \nexperienced. It is what they will forever have to live with. I think it \nis shameful to dismiss them in that fashion.\n  Many of these women are here in the Capitol. They are here with their \nfamilies; they are here with their children; they are telling their \nstories. To dismiss it and say don't be blinded by a few anecdotes is, \nto me, very cruel, indeed.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the Senators who support \nhim, that I support his right to view this issue in any way he chooses. \nI support the right of his family to handle these health care \nemergencies in any way they decide with their doctor, with each other, \nwith their God, with their priest, with their rabbi, with their \nminister. It is their right. I would no sooner tell the Senator from \nPennsylvania's family how to handle this matter than anything I can \nimagine. I would never do that. I do not want the Senator from \nPennsylvania telling my family and my rabbi and my children how to \nhandle a health emergency. I resent that.\n  I have enough respect for my family that we would do what is right. I \nhave enough respect for every family in America that they would do what \nis right. If the families in America did not agree with me, I would say \nGod bless you; you handle this in any way you want.\n  That is where the differences lie between the philosophy of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the philosophy of those of us who \nconsider ourselves pro-choice. We trust the women of America. We trust \nthe families of America. We trust them to seek the appropriate counsel. \nWe trust them to make this painful and difficult decision without \nGovernment telling them what to do.\n\n  When the women in this country have a health problem, they do not go \nto see their Senator. They don't go to see Dr. Santorum or Dr. Boxer or \nDr. Helms or Dr. Mikulski. They go to their physician. We should not \nplay doctor. It is not appropriate, it is not right, and it is \ndangerous. It is very dangerous to the health of women. We will get \ninto that when we talk about why the Roe v. Wade decision was so \nimportant. As long as the women in this country and the families in \nthis country choose what is legal and available to them, we should \nrespect that. The legalities have been settled since 1973. Make no \nmistake about it, the entire purpose of this underlying bill and other \namendments that may come before us--I do not know what amendments they \nwill be--are all about one thing: undermining this basic legal decision \ncalled Roe v. Wade.\n  At 11:30 this morning, the Senate will make an important vote as to \nwhether or not they believe Roe v. Wade should be confirmed by this \nSenate. I want to read a quote that was put in the Record yesterday. I \nthink it is very important to understand this statement is a statement \nof Supreme Court Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter. In a case \ncalled Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, listen \nto what these three Justices, all Republicans appointed by Republican \nPresidents, said about the basic issue we are talking about:\n\n       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own \n     concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the \n     mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not \n     define the attributes of personhood were they formed under \n     compulsion of the State.\n\n  ``Compulsion of the State.'' What these Justices said, all appointed \nby Republican Presidents, was that the state should stay out of this \ncrucial decision. It is something that exists in our hearts, in our \nsouls, in our beings.\n  The ``meaning of the universe and the mystery of human life'' should \nnot be dictated by the state, by Senator Santorum, by Senator Boxer, by \nany Senator. It is up to each individual.\n  When Roe was decided and it was reaffirmed by the Court, and \nhopefully it will be reaffirmed today by this Senate, it basically gave \nthat liberty to the people of this country. I think it is very \nimportant to note it has been stated on this floor over and over again, \nthe underlying bill has nothing to do with Roe v. Wade. I ask you, \ncolleagues, to look at the 19 Court decisions that have contradicted \nthat statement. In each and every case, the Court said the Santorum \nbill, the approach he has taken, contradicts Roe, because in each and \nevery case they found the definition of this partial-birth abortion--of \nwhich there is no medical meaning, there is no medical term--is so \nvague that it could, in fact, apply to any procedure and, therefore, it \nessentially stops all abortion. Indeed, if you look at some of the \nStates, in some of the States, before the Court overturned these \nstatutes, there was no abortion being performed at any stage because of \nthe vaguely worded law, the words of the Santorum bill.\n  In Alaska, the vagaries of the law are obvious, and Alaska overturned \nthe Santorum bill.\n  In Florida, this statute ``may endanger the health of women''--they \noverturned the Santorum bill.\n\n[[Page S12951]]\n\n  In Idaho, the act bans the safest and most common methods of abortion \nand they overturned--this is Idaho--the Santorum bill.\n  In Louisiana, the judge said this is truly a conceptual theory that \nhas no relation to fact, law, or medicine, and they overturned this \nbill.\n  In Michigan, they said physicians simply cannot know with any degree \nof confidence what conduct may give rise to criminal prosecution and \nlicense revocation, and they overturned the bill.\n  And it goes on--Missouri, Montana. They say the problem here is that \nthe legislation goes way beyond banning the type of abortion depicted \nin the illustrations.\n  Court after court has stated this bill overturns Roe, and that is why \nthe Senator from Iowa was so correct to bring his amendment to the \nfloor to reaffirm Roe.\n  I see the Senator from Washington is here, and I ask her how many \nminutes she would like to use on this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator from California will yield \nme 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I so yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from \nCalifornia for her tremendous amount of work on the floor on a very \nemotional and difficult issue to show all of us what is really behind \nthe bill that is before the Senate and to stand up for women across \nthis country to make their own health care decisions, along with their \nfamily and their own faith, without the interference of those of us on \nthis floor who are not medical doctors and who are not members of that \nfamily.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for offering the amendment \nwe are now debating because his amendment--and I want my colleagues to \nlook at it very carefully--is really what this debate is about, and I \nthink everyone here knows it.\n  The question is, Do we really stand for and behind Roe v. Wade? Do we \nreally support a woman's right of choice? Are we going to allow women \nto make this incredibly important decision in consultation with their \nphysician and their family and their faith or are we going to stand on \nthe floor of the Senate and make that decision for her?\n  I have often heard many of my colleagues talk about being pro-choice \nsimply because they do not support overturning Roe v. Wade. But over \nand over, when it comes time to provide access or services or to allow \nFederal employees access to these services, these same pro-choice \nMembers vote to restrict a woman's right to choose.\n  I know the difference, as do the voters in my home State of \nWashington. In 1992, my State voted overwhelmingly in support of a \nwoman's right of choice. The voters in Washington State recognized the \nimportance of the landmark Supreme Court decision giving a woman the \nright to determine her own fate and make her own personal health and \nreproductive decisions.\n  Washington State voters have also spoken out on this particular \neffort--the underlying bill--which attempts to undermine Roe v. Wade by \noutlawing one abortion procedure after another.\n  In 1998, a year ago, the voters of my State overwhelmingly defeated a \nballot initiative to ban the so-called partial-birth abortions. That \ninitiative was almost identical to S. 1692.\n  I am really proud of Washington State voters who stood up to defend a \nwoman's right to her own reproductive health and choice decisions. That \ninitiative which was on our ballot a year ago was defeated because \nthere was no exception, no consideration for the health of the woman. \nHer life and her health were made not just secondary concerns but of no \nconcern at all. In my State, voters understood why this kind of ban was \na threat to all women.\n  The Harkin amendment we are now debating gives us the opportunity to \ntalk about the role of the woman in this decision. It will allow \nMembers to stand up and say the Roe decision was an important one, one \nwe stand behind. The Harkin amendment will send a message to women that \nwe recognize the turning point in equality that followed the 1973 \nlandmark ruling.\n  As the Senator from Iowa pointed out, there was a time in our \ncountry's history when a woman could not own property, could not vote, \nor could not have access to safe family planning services. There was a \ntime when women were not allowed access to equal education. There was a \ntime in our history when having a child meant being forced out of the \nworkplace.\n  Those times have passed. Women made gains as those offensive policies \nwere changed, banned, and overturned, and I will do everything I can to \nmake sure votes such as the one we are talking about do not take us \nback to the dark days because the women of America are not going back.\n\n  The proponents of S. 1692 say their intent is to end late-term \nabortions. We are not going to be fooled. We know this is just another \nattempt to chip away at Roe v. Wade. This is just another attempt to \nundermine that decision and deny access to safe and legal abortion \nservices. This is just another attempt to harass providers and generate \nhateful rhetoric. This is just another attempt to limit access.\n  The proponents are trying to achieve through public relations what \nthey cannot do in the courts or in the legislatures. Their ultimate \ngoal is to make the rights and health protections guaranteed in Roe \nworth nothing more than the paper on which it was written. The Harkin \namendment calls them on this bluff and demands accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator from California for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since 1995, we have had more than 110 \nanti-choice votes in Congress. More than 110 times, we have voted to \nrestrict or deny access to safe and legal reproductive health care. \nMore than 110 times we have voted to undermine and limit the \nconstitutional guarantees that were provided in the Roe v. Wade \ndecision.\n  The goal is clear: Little by little, the proponents of the underlying \nbill want to place so many barriers and obstacles in front of women and \ntheir physicians that abortions will only be available to a few wealthy \nwomen, just as it was before the Roe v. Wade decision. A woman who is a \nvictim of rape or incest, a woman whose life is at stake, will not even \nbe able to find a provider. In fact, I want my colleagues to know we \nare already seeing this. In some States, there are no doctors now who \nare willing to provide a legal health care procedure. We are going back \nto the dark days when women's health was at risk because of the laws of \nthis land.\n  Let there be no confusion; the proponents of this bill want to outlaw \nabortions step by step since they know a majority of Americans will not \ngive up their rights to make this decision on their own with their own \nfamily and their own faith.\n  If you support the Roe v. Wade decision, you have to support the \nHarkin amendment. If you support a woman's right to choose, you have to \nsupport the Harkin amendment. And a ``no'' vote will send a message \nthat the Senate does not support Roe or recognize the importance that a \nwoman has to make this decision on her own.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Harkin amendment and put us on \nrecord where we ought to be: To allow women to have safe, legal \nreproductive choices that allow them to make this decision with their \nfamily and their faith. That is where this decision rests, not on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I thank my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa, the author of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me this \ntime, and I thank her for her strong support for women's rights and the \nconstitutional right of women to make their own decisions in terms of \nreproductive health.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for her strong \nsupport, and my friend and colleague\n\n[[Page S12952]]\n\nfrom Illinois who will be speaking shortly, Senator Durbin.\n  It has been said by the proponent of the underlying bill that this \namendment of mine has nothing to do with his underlying bill. I beg to \ndiffer and to disagree.\n\n  This amendment has everything to do with the underlying amendment \nbecause, really, what my friend from Pennsylvania is seeking to do is \nto begin the long process--which I am sure he would like to have a \nshorter process--to overturn Roe v. Wade, to take away the \nconstitutional right that women have in our country today to decide \ntheir own reproductive health and procedures. That is really what this \nis about: A chipping away--one thing here, another thing there.\n  If anyone believes, by some fantasy dream, if the underlying bill of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania would ever become the law of the land, \nthat this would be the end of it, that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand those who believe and feel as he does would not feel the need to do \nanything else with regard to a woman's right to choose, is sadly \nmistaken. They will be back again with something else, and back again \nwith something else, until Roe v. Wade is overturned. That is really \nwhat they are about.\n  So as far as I know, this will be the first time that the Senate of \nthe United States has ever been able to speak; that is, to vote on how \nwe feel and how we believe Roe v. Wade ought to be interpreted as the \nlaw of the land.\n  This is the first time, that I know of, that we have had the \nopportunity to vote up or down on whether or not we believe that Roe v. \nWade should stand and should not be overturned and that it is, indeed, \na good decision.\n  Again, I just read the ``Findings'' of my amendment. My amendment is \nvery short. It just says:\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) reproductive rights are central to the ability of women \n     to exercise their full rights under Federal and State law;\n       (2) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade;\n       (3) the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n     established constitutionally based limits on the power of \n     States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy; and\n       (4) women should not be forced into illegal and dangerous \n     abortions as they often were prior to the Roe v. Wade \n     decision.\n       (b) . . . It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures an \n     important constitutional right; and\n       (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n\n  Very simple and very straightforward. It has everything to do with \nthe underlying bill because what the underlying bill really seeks to do \nis overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  Why? Because Roe v. Wade leaves an exception in to protect the \nwoman's life or health. The Court, in siding with Roe in the Texas case \nthat was filed, struck down the Texas law. The Court recognized for the \nfirst time the constitutional right to privacy ``is broad enough to \nencompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her \npregnancy.''\n  The Court set some rules. It recognized that the right to privacy is \nnot absolute, that a State has a valid interest in safeguarding \nmaternal health, maintaining medical standards, and protecting \npotential life. A State's interest in ``potential life'' is ``not \ncompelling,'' the Court said, until viability, the point in pregnancy \nat which there is a reasonable possibility for the sustained survival \nof the fetus outside the womb.\n  This is the important part: A State may, but is not required, to \nprohibit abortion after viability, except when it is necessary to \nprotect a woman's life or health. That is what Mr. Santorum's \nunderlying bill does; it strikes out those very important words ``or \nhealth.''\n  As we have repeated stories of women who have had this procedure, \nwho, if they had not had this procedure, could have been injured \npermanently for life, been made sterile for life, not being able to \nhope to even raise a family after that, that has a lot to do with a \nwoman's health.\n  I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania say something yesterday about \nwe should not be guided by these anecdotes that people come and tell \nus. But what we do hear affects people's lives. These are not \nanecdotes.\n  I told the story yesterday of my friend, Kim Coster, and her husband. \nShe had to go through this procedure twice. She still has hopes of \nraising a family--a very wrenching, painful decision for her and her \nhusband. Is that an anecdote? No. It is a true-life story of what \nhappens to individuals because of what we do here.\n  Let us always keep in mind that the votes we cast, the laws that we \npass, affect real people in real-life situations. These are not \nanecdotes. These are not something to cloud and to fog our reasoning. I \nbelieve I paraphrased a little bit what the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaid. I may not have said the words correctly, but that is sort of what \nhe said.\n  No, we should use real-life stories to guide and direct us as to what \nwe should do within the constitutional framework and what we should do \nto ensure that we do not trample on constitutional rights, and \nespecially, here, the constitutional rights of women to control their \nown reproductive health.\n\n  So I would just say to my friend from Pennsylvania, this amendment, \nthis sense-of-the-Congress resolution that is now pending, has \neverything to do with the underlying bill. It is the first time that we \nwill be able to speak as to whether or not we believe Roe v. Wade \nshould continue, should not be overturned, and was a wise decision.\n  I am certain the Senator from Pennsylvania will vote against my \namendment. That is his right. I know he does not believe in Roe v. \nWade. I know he believes that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. There \nare others who believe that. But I hope the vast majority of the Senate \nwill vote, with a loud voice, that Roe v. Wade was a wise decision. It \nsecured an important constitutional right for women. It should not be \noverturned.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If there was any extra time, I hope we will keep it on \nour side. I discussed this with the Senator from Pennsylvania, and he \nhas been gracious enough to agree, since our colleagues have time \nproblems; what I would like to propound is that Senator Durbin be given \n5 minutes, followed by Senator Feinstein for 12 minutes, and then we \nwill reserve the remainder of our time for the closing debate. And the \nSenator from Pennsylvania will then have an hour left on his side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for yielding me this time.\n  I am going to vote in favor of the Harkin amendment. The Senator from \nIowa has put the question before the Senate, which is very \nstraightforward: Do you support the 1973 decision of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt which said that we will protect a woman's right to choose?\n  The decision of that Court said that the privacy of each of us, as \nindividuals, has to be protected, and particularly the privacy of a \nwoman when she is making a critical decision about her health.\n  I have, over the past day or so, been involved in a debate on this \nfloor about this issue. And I thank all of my colleagues for \nparticipating in this debate. On an amendment I offered, there were \nsome 38 votes last night. I wish there were more. Any Senator would. I \nam proud of those who stood with me and hope we have taken one small \nstep toward finding common ground consensus, while conceding what the \nSenator from Iowa has made a point in his amendment; that is, first, we \nwill keep abortion procedures safe and legal in America and, second, we \nwill try to find reasonable restrictions within that decision. I \nbelieve that is what the debate was about yesterday.\n\n  The point I make this morning, in the brief time I have, goes to the \nheart of this issue. This amendment really tests us as to our feelings \nabout the women of America, particularly those who are mothers, and the \nchildren of America. I am troubled by those who oppose the Roe v. Wade \ndecision and\n\n[[Page S12953]]\n\nsay they are doing it because they believe in the women of America. \nThen we look at their voting records and say, where are they?\n  For example, let's use one very basic issue. We on the Democratic \nside, with the help of Senator Kennedy and others, have been fighting \nhard to increase the minimum wage. Our belief is that people who are \ngoing to work every day deserve a decent living wage. The minimum wage \nhas been stuck at $5.15 an hour for too long. Who are the largest \nrecipients of the minimum wage in America? Women, women who go to work, \nmany with children, struggling to survive. If we believe in the dignity \nof women, we should be voting for an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Not too long ago, the Republican majority in the House suggested \ncutting back on a tax credit for lower-income working families, the \nearned-income tax credit. They said: This is the way we will balance \nthe budget. Thank goodness even a Republican candidate for President \ncame out against that idea.\n  It raises a question in my mind: Those who oppose the idea of Roe v. \nWade and say they still stand up for the women of America, where are \nthey on these other issues as well? Historically, the same people who \nare opposed to Roe v. Wade are opposed to increasing the minimum wage \nand want to cut the tax credit for working families, particularly \nsingle-parent families.\n  Let's take a look at the children's side of the equation. Many who \noppose abortion procedures say these children should be born. The \nquestion is, Once they are born, will you help care for them? The \nrecord is not very encouraging. The same people who oppose the abortion \nprocedures oppose an increase in the minimum wage, by and large. The \nsame people who oppose Roe v. Wade are the folks who are leading the \ncharge for cutting the earned-income tax credit, cutting the Head Start \nProgram for the children, cutting education and health care and the \nbasics of life.\n  If this is a question of commitment to life, take a look at this next \nroll call on the Harkin amendment, which I will support. Line up those \nSenators on both sides of the aisle and ask: If you say you want more \nchildren born in this world, are you willing to stand by and help the \nfamilies raise them? Too many times, I think we will be sadly \ndisappointed.\n  There was a study that came out a few days ago. It was from a woman \nat Claremont Graduate University in California who did a survey of all \nthe States that have the strongest anti-abortion laws and found they \nare many times over more likely to have less assistance for families \nand children. Those who stand here and say, oppose Roe v. Wade, allow \nthese children to be born, the obvious question of them is, Will you \nstand, then, for the programs to help these children? Time and time \nagain, they do not.\n  I believe Roe v. Wade has in a way recognized the constitutional \nreality of privacy in this country. It is said a woman should have the \nright to choose. In that critical moment when she is making that \ndecision with her doctor, with her husband, with her family, with her \nconscience, the Government should not be there making the decision for \nher.\n  Yes, there are restrictions in Roe v. Wade. Some people think they \nare too much; some, too little. Be that as it may, the basic \nconstitutional principle is sound. Members of the Senate will have, in \na very brief moment in time, a critical opportunity to decide whether \nor not they want to turn back the clock to back-alley abortions, to the \ndays when abortions were not safe and legal in this country.\n  I hope we have a solid, strong majority vote in support of the Harkin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n12 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I begin by thanking the Senator from California for her leadership on \nthis issue. I have watched her on the floor. She has carried the \nmessage of this important issue in a very significant way. I thank her \nvery much.\n  I want to speak today as a mother of a daughter, as a stepmother of \nthree young women and a grandmother of one granddaughter. I speak as a \nwoman who grew up in this country when abortion was illegal, who went \nto university at that time and saw things I wish I hadn't seen, like \nyoung women on the verge of suicide because of the predicament they \nwere in. I want to speak about a time when I sat on the California \nWomen's Parole Board in the 1960's, a board that sentenced doctors who \nperformed abortions and women who had had abortions. Abortion carried a \nsentence of 6 months to 10 years. I remember their stories. I used to \nread the case histories of the patients and I saw the terrible \nmorbidity and mortality that took place in California when abortion was \nillegal. I don't want to go back to those days and those stories of \nabsolute desperation.\n  As I have listened to the debate, what I have heard has been a kind \nof moral sanctimony of people who think they know better than anyone \nelse. They maintain that their lifestyle, their way of handling \nproblems, is the way everybody should handle problems. In the real \nworld, it doesn't work that way. Nobody knows anyone else's condition, \ncircumstances, health, life or frailties.\n  Roe v. Wade came down in 1973 and established a trimester system for \nthe Nation which took abortion out of the arena of politicians telling \nmy four daughters what they could do or could not do with their \nreproductive systems.\n  Frankly, I find the discussion deeply humiliating and very \ndistressing--the discussion of women's body parts in the Senate of the \nUnited States of America, as if we don't have sense enough to do with \nour bodies what we know is ethically and morally right.\n  The fact is, the overwhelming majority of women in this great Nation \ndo know and they do what is right. They want to have children and they \ndo deliver children. The beauty of Roe v. Wade was that it took the \nexplosive issue of abortion out of the political arena and set a \ntrimester system that made sense, both for the unborn child as well as \nfor the woman herself.\n  I will quickly summarize what that is. Roe essentially said that for \nthe stage prior to the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, the \nabortion decision must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant \nwoman and the woman's attending physician. For the stage approximately \nfollowing the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its \ninterest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the \nabortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal \nhealth.\n  Finally, for the stage following viability--that is, the time when \nthe fetus can live outside of the womb--the State, in promoting its \ninterests in the potentiality of human life, may, if it chooses, \nregulate and even ban abortion, except where it is necessary, in the \nappropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or \nhealth of the mother.\n  That is Roe v. Wade. It took the debate off these legislative floors \nall across this great Nation. It set up a constitutional right so that \nwomen could protect themselves from the views of one person who got \nelected to public office or another person who got elected to public \noffice, an imposition of their views on all of the women of America.\n  Roe v. Wade has stood the test of time. It should be supported, and \nwe now have an opportunity to do so. Let me make a couple of comments \non what we have before us.\n  Since 1992, there have been 120 votes that sought to infringe on Roe \nand sought to constrain a woman's right to control her own reproductive \nsystem; 113 of them have been successful. My colleague from California \nand I have watched the march to limit a woman's right to choose, to \nfind ways to encroach on it, whether it is not allowing women on \nMedicaid to have abortions; whether it is not giving money to the \nDistrict of Columbia if the District of Columbia uses Federal, or even \nits own dollars for abortion services for women; limiting the rights of \nwomen in the military, and on and on and on--a steady march to \neliminate Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose. And now we have \nthis issue of so-called partial-birth abortion before us.\n  I sit on the Judiciary Committee. I have attended all of the hearings \non this subject. What has been interesting to me is, in the many years \nthat we have discussed this, there has been no medical definition \npresented in the legislation describing what a partial-birth\n\n[[Page S12954]]\n\nabortion really is. No one has used what I think they aim at, which is \nsomething called intact D and X, which is in fact a specific medical \nprocedure and which is known to physicians.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a statement of policy \nby the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n                        ACOG Statement of Policy\n\n\n             statement on intact dilatation and extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements:\n       1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days;\n       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling \n     breech;\n       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and\n       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a \n     living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but \n     otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on \n     the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how many of \n     these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show that \n     second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a safe \n     procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are critical to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and \n     dangerous.\n       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, instead of recognized medical language \nlike that of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the \nlanguage the underlying bill before us is vague.\n  Let me tell you why I say it is vague. It is vague because it not \nonly affects third-trimester abortions, it affects second-trimester \nabortions; therefore, it is a continuation of the march to limit and \nconstrict a woman's rights under Roe v. Wade.\n  Let me give you some examples of testimony that we had in our \nJudiciary Committee hearings. Doctors who testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee could not identify, with any degree of certainty or \nconsistency, what medical procedure this legislation refers to. The \nvagueness meant that every doctor who performs even a second-trimester \nabortion could be vulnerable and face criminal prosecution.\n  The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has told us that \n``the legislation could be interpreted to include, and thus outlaw, \nmany other widely used, accepted, and safe abortion and operative \nobstetric techniques.''\n  Dr. Louis Seidman, Professor of Law from Georgetown University, told \nus:\n\n       . . . as I read the language, in a second-trimester \n     previability abortion, where the fetus will in any event die, \n     if any portion of the fetus enters the birth canal prior to \n     the technical death of the fetus, then the physician is \n     guilty of a crime and goes to prison for two years.\n\n  That is what we are doing here. Dr. Seidman continued his testimony \nbefore our committee and said this:\n\n       If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed \n     abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no \n     way to tell whether the procedure will eventuate in some \n     portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the \n     fetus is technically dead, much less being able to \n     demonstrate that after the fact.\n\n  Dr. Courtland Richardson, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, testified in the House that:\n\n       In any normal second trimester abortion procedure, by any \n     method, you may have a point at which a part, a one-inch \n     piece of [umbilical] cord, for example, of the fetus passes \n     out of the cervical [opening] before fetal demise has \n     occurred.\n\n  That would violate the so-called partial-birth abortion ban and \nsubject a physician to 2 years in prison. That is the impact of this \nlegislation. People can say what they want, but that is the impact, the \nmedical impact.\n  Now let me give you the legal impact.\n  The legal impact is that courts throughout America have ruled that \npartial-birth abortion laws are unconstitutional. Most recently, the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit unanimously ruled \nunconstitutional three State laws--in Arkansas, in Iowa, and in \nNebraska--that mirror the Santorum bill. The Eighth Circuit is the \nfirst Federal appellate court to review the legal merits of partial-\nbirth abortion bans. In ruling on the Iowa and Nebraska laws, which \nwere nearly identical to S. 1692, the district court in both cases held \nthat the language in the State laws was unconstitutional because it was \noverly vague, imposed an undue burden on pregnant women and did not \nadequately protect a woman's health and life. The Eighth Circuit Court \nof Appeals affirmed this ruling, noting that the State law's vague \nlanguage would ban more than just partial-birth abortion; it would ban \nother abortion procedures protected by the landmark Roe v. Wade. \nCircuit Court Judge Richard Arnold wrote--and I quote this because it \nis important:\n\n       The difficulty is that the statute covers a great deal \n     more. It would also prohibit, in many circumstances, the most \n     common method of second trimester abortion, called a dilation \n     and evacuation (D and E).\n\n  This is the circuit court writing.\n  D and E is a recognized medical procedure, dilation and evacuation. \nJudge Arnold continued:\n\n       Under the controlling precedents laid down by the Supreme \n     Court, such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right \n     of women to choose whether to have an abortion. It is \n     therefore our duty to declare the statute invalid.\n\n  In 20 out of 21 States, partial-birth abortion laws have been blocked \nor severely limited; 18 State partial-birth abortion laws have been \nblocked by a Federal or State court; 6 out of 9 States that passed \npartial-birth abortion laws using the language as found in S. 1692 have \nhad their laws enjoined, including Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, New \nJersey, and West Virginia. One court limited the enforcement of \nGeorgia's partial-birth abortion ban to redefine partial-birth abortion \nin medical terms, to limit its application to postviability abortion. \nThat is the point.\n  If proponents of this bill are really serious, they should use a \nmedical procedure and prohibit that procedure in postviability \nabortions.\n  And the court stated that Georgia's law was invalid because it \ncreated an exception in the law to allow abortions in cases necessary \nto protect the health of the woman. Six States, where the laws have \nbeen blocked, used identical language to H.R. 1122, vetoed by President \nClinton in 1997.\n  Mr. President, courts across the country have made it all too clear \nthat legislation like S. 1692 does not do what the proponents of the \nbill say it does. The bill does not limit State bans on abortion to \npostviability procedures. It does not protect a woman's\n\n[[Page S12955]]\n\nhealth. For these reasons, this bill violates the basic constitutional \nrights of women provided by Roe v. Wade in 1972, and other Supreme \nCourt decisions. Simply stated, the main bill before us today is \nunconstitutional on its face and will be struck down.\n  I urge this body to support the Harkin resolution and to defeat the \nunderlying Santorum bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me respond to the comments of the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer, about the constitutionality. The \ncentral point is that most of the cases have focused around the \ndefinition. I think she accurately described the concern some of the \ncourts have, and the issue on vagueness, and that this procedure being \noutlined, partial-birth abortion, is not adequately defined so as not \nto outlaw other abortions at that time.\n  The interesting part of the argument is that you presume with the \nargument that it outlaws more than this. I think you can make the \nlogical assumption that the courts might accurately only include this \nprocedure, and that it would be constitutional, but what makes it \nunconstitutional is that it applies to more than this procedure.\n  In a sense, arguing for the unconstitutionality of this, if we were \nable to better define what a partial-birth abortion is in this \nlegislation, we would make it clear that it does not ban any other type \nof abortion. Then the presumption I hear from the Court's own reasoning \nis that it would be constitutional. I think we need to look at that \nvery carefully.\n  In a sense, in making their argument, they leave open the possibility \nthat banning a particular procedure--as long as it doesn't ban all \nprocedures or more than one procedure--the courts would be receptive to \nthe constitutionality of such a piece of legislation. We are working \nright now with other Members to see if we can come up with a better \ndefinition, a more clear definition, one which would clearly pass \nconstitutional muster with respect to vagueness.\n  I am encouraged. I think it is helpful that the Senator from \nCalifornia put the reasoning in the Record, because I think the \nreasoning clearly points to the fact the procedure itself could, in \nfact, be banned under Roe v. Wade. But the fact that the procedure is \nbeing defined in such a vague manner as to include other procedures is \nthe reason they are finding it unconstitutional.\n  I think it creates an opportunity for us to craft in the eyes of the \ncourts that have reviewed this to date a constitutional piece of \nlegislation that does not create an undue burden on women because it \nonly bans one particular procedure and not others. I see this as an \nopportunity.\n  I thank the Senator from California for laying that out. I think that \nis an important point of debate. We will get to that later in this \ndebate as we get down to the end when we provide what I hope to be some \ntechnical amendments to correct this problem.\n  I find it interesting--I talked about it yesterday--what we are \ntalking about now is Roe v. Wade. While I and others have stood up here \ntime and time again and have said this is not about Roe v. Wade, one of \nthe reasons we are bringing this bill to the floor is because we \nbelieve this is outside of the scope of Roe v. Wade's restrictions on \nCongress' right to limit abortion. I can go through the long list of \nthat.\n  One, obviously, is the Texas Roe v. Wade case itself. It was brought \nbefore the Supreme Court. In that decision, part of the appeal was to \nstrike a Texas law that prohibited killing a child in the process of \nbeing born. It is a Texas statute that was under review by the Supreme \nCourt in the Roe v. Wade decision. The Supreme Court let stand the \nTexas law that prohibited the killing of a child in the process of \nbeing born. That is exactly what we are attempting to prohibit in the \npartial-birth abortion amendment.\n\n  To make the argument we are trampling on Roe v. Wade with this bill, \nwhen the case itself upheld a law that said you couldn't do that, in \nother words, kill a child in the process of being born, I think is \nstretching Roe v. Wade far beyond its own face of what it actually did.\n  Again, it is a distortion that is not surprising. I understand why if \nyou don't think you have the arguments on the merits you try to change \nthe subject. That is what this vote is about today. It changes the \nsubject. They want to turn this into a debate on abortion. This is not \na debate on abortion. This is a debate on infanticide. This is why \npeople on both sides of the abortion issue in both Chambers support \nthis ban--because it is less about abortion and very much about \ninfanticide.\n  I am not going to say much about the underlying amendment we are \ntalking about--the Harkin amendment--but have a couple of comments \nabout Roe v. Wade. You hear so much about first trimester, second \ntrimester, third trimester, the State has an interest, and the State \ncan do this.\n  I remind you that Senators who are talking about these restrictions \nand about the second- and third-trimester have never in their lives \nvoted for any of those restrictions. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land \ntoday. For all the rhetoric that is around, it is there. You can have \nan abortion at any time, anywhere, and any place as long as you can \nfind an abortionist to do it. Period. There are no restrictions. In \nreality, there are no restrictions. All you have to do is find an \nabortionist who will say the health of the mother is at stake and you \ncan have an abortion.\n  I had a chart up here yesterday. We can get it. I will put it back \nup. Warren Hern wrote the definitive textbook on abortion and said, I \nwill certify that with every pregnancy there is a risk of grievous \nserious physical health to the mother; injury to the mother.\n  What you have is, in fact, no restriction. In fact, that is what \noccurs today. There are no limits on abortion in America. That is why \none in four children conceived in America die through abortion. One in \nfour. One in four.\n  So your chances of surviving in the womb are 75 percent once you are \nconceived. Once you are born, your chances of surviving the first 5 \nyears are 99.9 percent. If you can make it through to be born, you are \nprobably going to be OK. But the biggest risk to children's health in \nAmerica is abortion.\n  Roe v. Wade promised a lot of things. When people came up and argued \nabout Roe v. Wade, they promised a lot of wonderful things would happen \nto women and to women's health and to children and to child abuse. The \npromises were made. Look at the debate.\n  There would be a reduction in child abuse because there would be less \nunwanted pregnancies. I don't think we have to look up a whole lot of \nrecord to see that child abuse has not been reduced since Roe v. Wade. \nIn fact, it is over double since Roe v. Wade.\n  There would be a reduction in divorce. I don't think that needs any \ncomment. Obviously, it did not happen.\n  There would be a reduction in spousal abuse. Obviously, that did not \nhappen.\n  We would lower poverty among children. Obviously, that did not \nhappen--all the promises that this would be a better world if we just \ngot rid of these children who weren't wanted, that life would be \nbetter.\n  What we found as a result of Roe v. Wade is a desensitizing of our \nappreciation for life, and all the promises have turned into disasters. \nNow we are faced with a world where we have reached the point in \nAmerica that a child who is 3 inches away from being protected by Roe \nv. Wade, being protected by the Constitution can be executed--executed, \nbrutally executed by a partial-birth abortion.\n  The reason this is an issue I feel so passionately about is not \nbecause I believe we will reduce the number of abortions in America. We \nwill not. I will say that categorically. This bill will probably not \nreduce the number of abortions in America with its passage. Hopefully, \nin the debate we will touch some hearts but in its passage we will not.\n  This is not an attempt to infringe on a woman's right. This is not an \nattempt to change or overturn Roe v. Wade. That is why I reject the \nSenator's amendment as irrelevant.\n  This bill attempts to draw a bright line between what is and is not \nprotected. At least we should be able to draw the line so when a child \nis in the process of being born, it is too late to have an abortion. It \nis too late.\n  I asked the Senator from California this question: You allow an \nabortion if\n\n[[Page S12956]]\n\nthe child's head is inside the mother? You can then kill the baby? I \nsaid: What if the baby came out head first and the child's foot was \ninside the mother. Would you still be allowed to kill the baby? She \nsaid: Absolutely not.\n  A pretty clear line, isn't it, depending on which way the baby is \nborn as to whether you can kill the baby. We get to the slippery slope, \nand this is what concerns me for our culture--if we can kill a baby \nthat is moving, one can see the baby, the abortionist is holding the \nbaby in his or her hands, the baby is moving, and then they take a pair \nof scissors at the base of the skull and jam it into the back of the \nbaby's head and suction the brains out.\n  This is where humanity has arrived in the United States in 1999. In \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world, we can stand here and \ndebate this is a proper procedure in America; this is legal in America; \nthis is ethical in America; this is moral in America. This is not a \ndebate about abortion. This is a debate about who we are as a society.\n  I know the abortion sides have lined up and want to make this an \nabortion line, where we draw the line in protecting humanity. If we \ndon't draw it here, the next logical step is easy. From the New Yorker \nmagazine last month, the September issue, an article by Peter Singer. \nPeter Singer is a philosopher --pop philosopher, I guess--who was just \nhired at Princeton University.\n  What does Peter Singer say? I will read part of the article. Viewers \nwill say that guy is a whacko, this guy is out there on the fringe; he \nis at Princeton University, but he is out there on the fringe. No one \ncan make this credible argument in America today. I argue that 40 years \nago no one could make this credible argument that this procedure would \nbe legal. But here we are. Put on your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen. \nWe are in for a ride, and the roller coaster is going down. I don't see \nthe bottom yet. Let me describe how far down the roller coaster we can \ngo when it comes to civility in America, when it comes to respect for \nlife in America.\n  Peter Singer:\n\n       Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to \n     killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.\n\n  I remind everybody of these anecdotes I have talked about that have \noffended so many. What are the stories about? The backbone for the \ndefense of this procedure given by the Senator from California, the \nSenator from Iowa, the Senator from Illinois. What is the subject of \nthese tragic stories? In every instance, in every instance, these were \npregnancies that had gone awry, where, in the course of fetal \ndevelopment, the infant became disabled, a problem developed--whether \nit was trisomy, hydrocephaly, some abnormality occurred, some \ndisability occurred in the baby.\n  Is there an argument on any of these cases that the health or the \nlife of the mother was endangered by carrying the baby itself? The \nanswer is no. In none of these cases is the issue brought up that the \nhealth of the mother was jeopardized by carrying the baby. In all of \nthese cases the point was made, the baby is going to die anyway or the \nquality of the baby's life is not going to be good; killing a disabled \ninfant is not morally equivalent to killing a person.\n  We see how the slope gets slippery. We don't hear from the other side \nin defending partial-birth abortion--the cases of healthy mothers and \nhealthy women. They are not used to defending this procedure. However, \n90 percent of the partial-birth abortions are healthy mothers and \nhealthy babies. They don't use those as an example because they are not \nsympathetic examples to those who are within the sound of my voice. \nPeople won't sympathize with a healthy mother and healthy baby--\naborting a baby late in pregnancy, killing her healthy baby. People \ndon't see a rationale for someone to do that.\n\n  The folks here know when people hear about a deformed baby being \nkilled, they are OK with that. Think about what they are doing by \nbringing these cases up. Think about what they are presuming people are \nthinking when they use disabled children as a legitimate reason to be \nkilled under this procedure. They are assuming that America doesn't \ncare as much; they assume they are not as worthy as a normal, healthy \nbaby.\n  Do you know what. They are right. Absorb that, America. They won't \nuse healthy mothers and healthy babies to defend this procedure because \npeople will have no sympathy for that, people have no tolerance for \nthat. Throw up a disabled child as the object of this execution, and \nthen it is OK; then there is sympathy.\n  What a slippery slope when killing a disabled infant is not morally \nequivalent to killing a person. And you say that is outrageous. They \nare using it now to justify this position. It is not outrageous; it is \ntoday in America. It is the reason for this procedure to be kept legal. \nOpen your eyes and see what they are doing. Open your eyes and see \nwhere we are headed.\n  Dr. Peter Singer:\n\n       When the death of a disabled infant will lead to a birth of \n     another infant with better prospects of a happy life, the \n     total amount of happiness will be greater if the disabled \n     infant is killed. The loss of happy life for the first infant \n     is outweighed by the gain of a happier life for the second. \n     Therefore, if killing a hemophiliac infant had no adverse \n     effect on others, it would, according to the total view, be \n     right to kill him.\n\n  We will see family pictures of a mother and father who had a partial-\nbirth abortion now being shown with another new baby. They will say, \nsee, it is OK because this other baby is happy.\n  This is not craziness that is going to happen in the future. This is \nthe roller coaster, folks, we are headed down. This debate should point \nAmericans in the direction as clear as my finger is pointing to Senator \nVoinovich that we are headed toward Peter Singer's world.\n  Two or three Senators have quoted the oft-quoted paragraph out of \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey. They use that to legitimize what they are \ndoing. Let me read something for you. I want you to think about the \nlogic behind what they are saying here. Listen, America. This is an \nabortion case.\n\n       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own \n     concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the \n     mystery of human life.\n\n  I am going to paraphrase that. I am going to use the words of \nsomebody who all of you know because of some things that he did in the \nlast year. I am going to use the words of Eric Harris, who wrote before \nhe killed 13 children at Columbine:\n\n       When I say something, it goes. I am the law.\n\n  What this says is very simple: You are the law. What you say goes. \nYou have the right to define, again ``one's own concept of existence,'' \none's own concept of the ``meaning of the universe and of the mystery \nof life.'' What I say goes.\n  Fredrich Neitzsche would be proud of us all for this debate. Peter \nSinger is proud, I am sure, of this debate today being put forward in \ndefense of something that he supports, the killing of little children \nif they are not perfect like you and me. Remember, you will not hear \none word, you have not heard one word in three debates, in 5 years--you \nhave not heard one word about the normal, healthy baby being killed by \nthis procedure. You have not heard one word about a normal, healthy \nmother having one of these abortions. They will not use that case even \nthough over 90 percent of the abortions that occur with partial birth \nare those cases.\n  They use the ones that tug at your heartstrings. Having lost a baby, \nthey tug at mine. I know the pain of what these men and women who \nsuffered through pregnancies that went awry--I know what they suffered \nthrough. I do not demean them when I talk about their cases. They are \nreal and they suffered. But to use--and I emphasize the word ``use''--\nthese cases to justify the killing of a baby, to use abnormal \nchildren--abnormal to whom, I might add? Disabled to whom? Imperfect to \nwhom? Not to me. My son who died was not perfect in the eyes of this \nworld, but he was perfect to me. He was perfect to my wife. Most \nimportant, he was perfect in God's eyes.\n  To abuse these cases, to pull at your heartstrings, to legitimize \nkilling children 3 inches away from being born is beneath the dignity \nof the Senate and feeds into Peter Singer's view that ``killing a \ndisabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very \noften it is not wrong at all.''\n  Peter Singer takes it even further. I said he supports this \nprocedure. I am sure he does, but he thinks this is probably not the \nbest way to go. Here is\n\n[[Page S12957]]\n\nwhat he thinks. You say this is absurd, Senator? Listen:\n\n       If a pregnant woman has inconclusive results from \n     amniocentesis, Singer doesn't see why she shouldn't carry the \n     fetus to term. Then, if the baby is severely disabled and the \n     parents prefer to kill it, they should be allowed to. That \n     way, there would be fewer needless abortions and more healthy \n     babies.\n\n  In defense we almost do that with partial-birth abortion, don't we? \nWe deliver the baby, get a chance to see the baby, and then we kill the \nbaby. We have case after case now, several cases, of botched partial-\nbirth abortions where babies who were to be aborted ended up being born \nbefore the doctor could kill the baby. There are three cases I am aware \nof, two in the last few months, where little children were born; not \nfetuses, not products of conception--which I think is another term that \nis used to dehumanize what is a living human being. Is there anybody in \nthe Senate or within the sound of my voice, any Senator, who would \ndisagree that a fetus or baby inside the mother is a living human \nbeing? I do not think there is any question that is a living human \nbeing. But we try to dehumanize it by using ``fetus,'' ``products of \nconception.''\n\n  In the case of a partial-birth abortion, you are talking about at \nleast a 20-week-old living human being that is delivered feet first \noutside of the mother except for the head and then killed. The \njustification, the stories, the ``cases,'' all involve disabled \nchildren--never healthy children.\n  Let me tell you about some healthy children who were to be aborted \nusing a partial-birth abortion. The first known survivor was a girl \nborn in Phoenix, June 30, 1998, known as Baby Phoenix. The little girl \nwas accidentally born as a result of a botched partial-birth abortion. \nHow does a partial-birth abortion work? How could it be botched?\n  You present yourself to the abortionist. The abortionist says you are \npast 20 weeks.\n  By the way, when you are past 20 weeks and you deliver a child, the \nbaby will be born alive, so we are talking about the delivery of a \nliving baby. That baby may not survive for a variety of reasons, but \nthe baby will be born alive, this little baby. This baby's mother did \nnot want this baby to be born alive, so she went to an abortionist \nafter 20 weeks and the abortionist said: Fine, we are going to do a \npartial-birth abortion.\n  Were there health concerns with this baby? Was the mother in physical \nproblems? Was the baby physically deformed? The answer in both cases: \nNo. Could she get an abortion after 20 weeks? The answer was yes.\n  Let me tell you how much after 20 weeks you can get an abortion in \nthis country. Based on the sonogram performed at the abortion clinic, \nDr. Biskind believed baby Phoenix to be 23 weeks, at least that is what \nhe says. During the actual abortion procedure, the doctor realized the \nchild was much older. He stopped the partial-birth abortion and \ndelivered a 6-pound, 2-ounce baby girl. Baby Phoenix was actually 37 \nweeks. Both the 17-year-old biological mother and child were healthy. \nThis was an elective abortion.\n  You don't hear the other side talk about elective abortions and \nhealthy mothers and healthy babies, do you? Do you? There is no \nsympathy for them. Oh, but it is OK, it is all right. We have sympathy \nif the baby is not perfect--in our eyes. In our eyes.\n  Following delivery, Baby Phoenix was sent to a hospital across the \nstreet for treatment. She suffered from a fractured skull and cuts on \nher face as a result of the attempted abortion. Amazingly, there was no \napparent brain damage. In October of 1997, by the way, the year before \nthis happened, a Federal court struck down Arizona's law that would \nhave prevented this brutality in the first place.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Today, Baby Phoenix lives in Texas with her adopted \nparents. The doctor who performed this abortion has since lost his \nlicense.\n  That was not the last victim of partial-birth abortions. Baby Hope, \nthe second known survivor, survived an abortion attempt which began in \nthe clinic of Dr. Martin Haskell who has been up here and has \ntestified, who is one of the inventors of the procedure, who, in fact, \ntestified in court cases. By the way, when he testified in those court \ncases and was asked the question, Is partial-birth abortion ever used \nto protect the life of the mother? The answer was no--from the inventor \nof the procedure. Is partial-birth abortion ever necessary or is it the \nonly option available to protect the health of the mother? The answer \nby Dr. Haskell: No.\n  Baby Hope's biological mother underwent a dilation phase of a \npartial-birth abortion. What happens is: You present yourself to the \ndoctor. The doctor gives you pills to dilate your cervix. In 3 days, \nyou come back to the abortion clinic. Your cervix is dilated, and they \ncan perform the abortion.\n  She dilated too quickly. She went to a hospital and was admitted for \nabdominal pain. The woman gave birth as she was being prepared for an \nexamination. This was the point at which the hospital personnel first \nlearned she was in the dilation phase of a partial-birth abortion.\n  On April 7, Baby Hope was born in the emergency room. She was 22 \nweeks old. An emergency room technician who was asked to remove the \nbaby from the room noticed she was alive. Neonatal staff were called to \nexamine her, and doctors did not believe the child's lungs were \ndeveloped enough to resuscitate her, so they did not put her on life \nsupport. Hospital staff wrapped the baby in a blanket. The ER \ntechnician named the baby Hope and then rocked and sang to the little \ngirl for 3 hours 8 minutes of her life. Hope's death certificate lists \nthe cause of death as extreme prematurity secondary to induced \nabortion.\n  Ironically, the manner of death listed on the death certificate is \n``natural.'' They do not talk about these cases.\n  The 22-week-old baby girl died tragically, but she touched the hearts \nof the people whom she touched in her life. If this partial-birth \nabortion procedure had been performed, she would have died a violent, \nbarbaric, painful death.\n  A third case, Baby Grace. Four months after Baby Hope's death, \nanother baby survived a botched abortion, again at Dr. Haskell's \nabortion clinic in Dayton, OH. Baby Grace was born August 4, 1999--just \na couple of months ago.\n  Once again, the child's biological mother went into premature labor \nas a result of the dilation phase of the partial-birth abortion. As in \nthe case of Baby Hope, the mother went to the hospital and delivered \nthe baby. In this case, the child was between 25 and 26 weeks old. Baby \nGrace is still alive. She is being cared for at a hospital as a \npremature baby. The Montgomery County, Ohio, Children Services Board \nhas temporary custody of her and plans to put her up for adoption.\n  Baby Grace is living proof of the horror of partial-birth abortion. \nShe is not a footnote in case law. She is a real baby who would have \ndied. You do not hear anyone talking about those cases.\n  What this amendment does has nothing to do with the underlying bill. \nThe underlying bill is about banning a barbaric procedure that crosses \nthe line of civility in America; at least I hope so. Let me assure you, \nif we do not draw that line, we will be having debates here, I hope \nwith all my heart, when I am not here, about whether killing children \nis OK if they are not perfect in our eyes. We are 3 inches from having \nthat debate right now. It is only a matter of time before those inches \nfade away. It is irrelevant, really, isn't it, whether it is 3 inches \nor not. God bless America.\n  The Senator from Ohio, I understand, wants to be recognized. How much \ntime do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act. I am grateful to the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis courageous fight to ban this barbaric procedure. Any of us who has \nlistened to him today and last night cannot help but be moved by his \neloquence in regard to the importance of banning this procedure.\n  It is difficult even to talk about it because it is so gruesome, but \nwe need to remind Members of the Senate that this is a procedure that \nis not done on an emergency basis. First, the woman\n\n[[Page S12958]]\n\ngoes through 2 days of doctor visits to get dilated. On the third day, \nthe baby is positioned for delivery in the birth canal. The fetus is \nturned so that it is delivered feet first, leaving only its head in the \nwomb. An incision is then made in the base of the skull. Finally, with \na suction device, the baby's brain matter is suctioned out. The skull \ncollapses, enabling delivery of the dead baby.\n  I cannot understand how anyone can support this procedure or can \nsupport it being legal. There are some I have heard in this debate who \nsay it is hard to believe we are even talking about this question on \nthe floor of the Senate. When I think of other things that have been \ndiscussed on the floor of the Senate--for example, endangered species \nor animal rights--for anyone to say we ought not to be talking about \nthis procedure on the floor of the Senate is hard for me to believe.\n  The subject of partial-birth abortion is not a new one for me. Four \nyears ago, in 1995, Ohio was the first State to pass a partial-birth \nabortion ban. The bill prohibited doctors from performing abortions \nafter the 24th week of pregnancy and banned completely the dilation and \nextraction procedure which we call the partial-birth procedure in this \nbill. The bill allowed late-term abortions to save the life of the \nmother. The women seeking abortions after the 21st week of pregnancy \nwere required to undergo tests to determine the viability of the fetus. \nIf the fetus was deemed to be viable, the abortion would be illegal.\n  The Ohio Senate passed that bill 28-4. The Ohio House passed it 82-\n15. These were overwhelming vote majorities which included Democrats \nand Republicans, pro-life and pro-choice legislators. This is not an \nissue today of Roe v. Wade or pro-life or pro-choice. If it were, the \nvote in the Ohio Senate and Ohio House would not have been so \noverwhelming to ban this procedure.\n  The truth is that most of these abortions are elective. According to \nDr. Martin Haskell, to whom the Senator from Pennsylvania has referred, \nwho happens to be from Dayton, OH, about 80 percent are elective. We \nare talking about 80 percent being elective. We are talking about 80 \npercent are healthy mothers and healthy babies.\n  We can all quote different statistics, but the bottom line is that \nthere is no need for this procedure. It is never medically necessary. \nIf a mother really needs an abortion, she has alternatives available to \nher that are not as torturous as partial-birth abortion.\n  One of the other main reasons we do not need these late-term \nabortions is, thanks to technology available today, we can identify \nproblems really early in pregnancy so abortions can take place earlier. \nWe do not need to have that type of procedure. Women today are being \nencouraged to come in early on, in the first trimester, for the various \ntests they need, so that if abortion is acceptable to them, they can \nhave an early abortion while the baby is not viable.\n  The Senator from California earlier today talked about the OB/GYN \ndoctors who have expressed opposition to this legislation. I think the \nsignificant thing about her statement today is the fact that she \nverified that there are other procedures available besides dilation and \nextraction. In fact, the Senator indicated doctors were worried about \nthe possibility that these other procedures might be banned by the \nlanguage in this bill.\n  So I want to make it clear to those who believe in abortion and have \nthat tremendous decision in terms of whether or not they are going to \ndeliver the baby that there are other procedures available to them. In \nfact, dilation and extraction are not even taught in medical school.\n  These babies are humans. They can feel pain. When partial-birth \nabortions are performed, as the Senator from Pennsylvania said, they \nare just 3 inches away from life and, for that matter, seconds away.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to stand up against what I \nrefer to as human infanticide. This is not a vote on Roe v. Wade. This \nis a vote about eliminating a horrible procedure that should be \noutlawed in this country. I urge my colleagues to vote to ban partial-\nbirth abortion in the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes and about 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. And I will not use \nall that time because just since I have been down here, many of the \nthings I was going to say have already been said.\n  I think the Senator from Ohio was very specific when he talked about \nthe fact that 80 percent of those abortions using this barbaric, \ntorturous, painful procedure are elective. I could also quote from the \nAmerican Medical News transcript of 1993 and others, but I think that \npoint has been well made.\n  I wish everyone could have watched last night, as I did, Senator Bill \nFrist, Dr. Bill Frist, when he talked about it from a medical \nperspective. I do not think anyone could have watched that and not been \nvery supportive of Senator Santorum and everything he is trying to do.\n  One of the things I do not think has really been answered \nappropriately is the fact that we keep hearing from the other side that \nboth the National Abortion Federation and the National Abortion Rights \nAction League, all of these pro-abortion organizations which claim that \nthe anesthesia that is administered to the mother prior to a partial-\nbirth abortion kills the child and, therefore, the child feels no pain. \nNorig Ellison, the president of the American Society of \nAnesthesiologists, unequivocally stated that those claims had \n``absolutely no basis in scientific fact.''\n  In fact, I think the whole idea of pain really needs to be discussed \nmore. Dr. Robert White, a neurosurgeon at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity School of Medicine said:\n\n       The neuroanatomical pathways which carry the pain impulses \n     are present in fetuses by the 20th week of gestation.\n       Also, the neurosystems which would modulate and suppress \n     these pain impulses are either not present or immature during \n     this stage of fetal development.\n\n  What this means is, if you stop and think how painful this procedure \nof going into the back of your head and opening the scissors and \nsucking the brains out would be to you--to anyone who is here on this \nfloor--it could be more painful to the baby because those systems that \nmodulate and suppress the pain are not developed at that stage.\n  So I look at this in terms of human life. Almost all these faces that \nare standing up here supporting this technique, if you were to inflict \nthat type of pain on a dog or a cat, they would be protesting in front \nof your offices.\n  A minute ago, the Senator from Ohio made some reference to the fact \nthat it is infanticide. I hope the pro-choice people, a lot of people \nout there who are pro-choice who believe abortion should be an \nalternative, will listen to the words of Senator Patrick Moynihan, who \nis pro-choice. He said: I am pro-choice, but this isn't abortion, this \nis infanticide.\n  Lastly, let me just mention to you, I have this picture. This is Jase \nRapert. He lives in Arkansas. I have seven grandchildren. He is No. 4. \nI can remember, and some of you older people can remember, back when \nour wives had babies, they would not even let you in the hospital, let \nalone in the delivery room.\n  When my little Molly, who is now a professor at the University of \nArkansas, called me up and said: Daddy, delivery time is here; do you \nwant to come in the delivery room? I did. I was in there for all three \nof her children. This is a picture of the first one, Jase.\n  What registered to me at that time was, we have heard a lot of talk \nabout maybe a baby isn't perfect or something. I do not \nthink perfection exists anyway. But in every sense of the word, that is \na perfect baby.\n\n  If they had made that decision, if my Molly or her husband had made \nthat decision at the time while I was in that room they were delivering \nthis beautiful baby, they could have murdered Baby Jase. That is what \nis going on in America now. You have to put it in a personal context \nthat we understand, that this can happen to someone we love very much.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S12959]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum, for his continuing work on this important issue.\n  I express my strong support for legislation that would ban this \nunconscionable form of infanticide known as partial-birth abortion. \nAbortion is a moral and governmental issue of unsurpassed importance. \nIt strikes at the very core of who we are as a people and a nation. It \nhits our deepest notions of liberty and questions our most fundamental \nassumptions about life.\n  For decades, my home State of Missouri has been at the forefront of \nthe abortion debate, and for the last several years, the discourse \nthere has been focused on the procedure being discussed here today--\npartial-birth abortion, infanticide. While the specific language of S. \n1692 is different from the Missouri legislation, the question posed is \nthe same: Are we willing to end a procedure that is so barbaric and \nextreme as to defy rational, reasoned support? Both Democrat and \nRepublican legislators in Missouri answered, ``Yes, we are willing to \nban that procedure.''\n  I had the privilege of serving as Missouri Governor. Regrettably, the \nlegislature did not deliver a ban on this barbaric procedure to my desk \nwhen I was Governor. Had they done so, I would have signed it \nenthusiastically. Had that happened, the legislature could now be \nfocused on other pressing problems, such as failing schools in Kansas \nCity or St. Louis or the methamphetamine drug plague in Missouri.\n  Most Missourians see, as I do, the effort to ban partial-birth \nabortion as part of a larger commonsense approach, restricting late-\nterm abortions, ending taxpayer funding, and requiring parental \nconsent. These sensible ideas are not about the right of choice. They \nare about the right of Missouri and America to act in a manner \nbefitting humanity. We are talking about a barbaric procedure that is \ninhumane. It is not befitting humanity.\n  Tragically, the Missouri partial-birth infanticide bill was vetoed, \ndespite its overwhelming passage by the bipartisan Missouri General \nAssembly. Fortunately, both the Democrats and Republicans who fought \nfor the original bill led a successful veto override effort in \nMissouri. It is an incredible accomplishment that represents only the \nseventh veto override in Missouri history, the third override this \ncentury, the first veto override since 1980.\n  Banning partial-birth abortion, which is the destruction of a \npartially born child, requires a historic bipartisan effort here, as it \ndid in Missouri. America must rise above this morally indefensible, \ncruel procedure. It is cruel to society's most vulnerable members. \nMissouri's Democrat and Republican legislators got past the \nobfuscation, the confusion, and the deceptions. It is time for the \nSenate to do the same.\n  The defenders of the indefensible are already fast at work. They tell \nus that the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother. The \nsimple truth is, this procedure is never necessary to save and preserve \nthe health of an unborn child's mother. Four specialists in OB/GYN and \nfetal medicine representing the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth \nhave written:\n\n       Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, \n     partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \n     opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and \n     immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and \n     fertility.\n\n  That quote was from the Wall Street Journal, September 19, 1996.\n  Nor should we accept the myth that this procedure is rarely utilized. \nAccording to interviews conducted by The Record of Bergen County, NJ, \nphysicians in New Jersey alone claim to perform at least 1,500 partial-\nbirth abortions every year--three times the number the National \nAbortion Federation claimed occurred in the entire country.\n  Once we have established that the procedure is neither rare nor \nmedically necessary, we will hear from the other side that our law \nwould be unconstitutional. This is just another falsehood. A \nlegislative ban on partial-birth abortions is constitutional. Indeed, \nallowing this life-taking procedure to continue would be inconsistent \nwith our obligation under the Constitution to protect life.\n  Although opponents will point to decisions in which activist Federal \njudges invalidated State-passed bans, language nearly identical to that \nwhich is in this bill has also been upheld in the Federal courts. These \nbans' requirements that the abortionist deliberately and intentionally \ndeliver a living fetus that is then killed implicates the partial-birth \nprocedure. This is not a generalized ban. Judges who have deemed the \nban unconstitutionally vague ignored this text and instead have \nsubstituted their views in place of the views clearly expressed by the \nvarious State legislatures.\n\n  I also want to share a word of caution with those claiming that a ban \non partial-birth abortions is unconstitutional. If they truly believe \nthat outlawing this procedure is impermissibly vague, the inevitable \nconclusion people will draw is that infanticide and abortion are \nindistinguishable. This argument provides little solace to the \ndefenders of this gruesome procedure.\n  On January 20 of last year, I chaired a committee meeting of the \nConstitution Subcommittee on the 25th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. In \nthat hearing, we learned much that is relevant to the debate over \npartial-birth abortion. We looked at how the Supreme Court's decision \nfailed to provide a framework for sound constitutional interpretation \nor to reflect the reality of modern medical practice. This latter \nfailure is not surprising, since the Court had neither the capacity to \nevaluate the accuracy of the medical data nor a way to foresee the \nremarkable advances in medical science that would make the then-current \ndata obsolete.\n  From Dr. Jean Wright of the Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory \nUniversity, we learned at the hearing that the age of viability has \nbeen pushed back from 28 weeks to 23 and fewer weeks since Roe v. Wade \nwas decided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 8 minutes have expired. The \nSenator is recognized for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Surgical advances now allow surgeons to partially \nremove an unborn child through an incision in the womb, to repair the \ncongenital defect, and slip the previable infant back into the womb. \nHowever, I think the most interesting thing we learned at the hearing \nwas that unborn babies can sense pain in just the seventh week of life. \nThese facts should help inform this debate.\n  For instance, if we know the unborn can feel pain at 7 weeks, why is \nit such a struggle to convince Senators that stabbing a 6-month, fully \ndeveloped and partially delivered baby with forceps, and extracting his \nor her brain is painfully wrong. It should be very easy to convince \npeople that it is painful and that it is wrong.\n  I realize, however, that not everyone agrees with my view on \nabortion. Indeed, I recognize the American people remain divided on \nthis issue. Where there is a consensus, we need to move forward to \nprotect life. The measure being discussed today to end the cruel, \nbrutal practice of partial-birth abortion presents such an opportunity \nwhere consensus exists. The American people agree that a procedure \nwhich takes an unborn child, one able to survive outside the womb, \nremoves it substantially from the womb and then painfully kills it is \nso cruel, so inhumane, so barbaric as to be intolerable and that it \nshould be illegal. Legislatures in more than 20 States have followed \nCongress' lead and passed laws outlawing this procedure. Two-thirds of \nthe House of Representatives voted to overturn the President's second \nveto last year. When this Chamber voted, more than a dozen Democrat \nSenators joined us in attempting to override the veto. A consensus has \nformed.\n  Americans want this gruesome procedure eliminated. They should not be \nthwarted by the twisted science and moral confusion that has been \nargued in this Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 more minute.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Now more than ever we need to pass this legislation to \nmake it clear that human life is too precious to permit legally \nsanctioned infanticide. As we as a nation confront the terrible \nviolence in our schools, we in Congress need to embrace a culture that \ncelebrates life, not a culture that celebrates convenience. The values \nat issue are too important to be lost in the legislative shuffle.\n\n[[Page S12960]]\n\n  We will pass this legislation again this year. If, again, the \nPresident vetoes it, despite the debunking of the so-called medical \nevidence that he used to justify that action in the past, we will \ncontinue to vote on this issue of life and death until the voice of the \nAmerican people is heard and the lives of these unborn children, who \nare painfully destroyed while they are substantially born, are \nrespected.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nHarkin's Sense of the Senate amendment to the partial birth abortion \nban. The reason why this amendment is so important is that it really \ngets to the heart of this debate on the so-called partial birth \nabortion. The battle is really about chipping away Roe v. Wade. Let's \nnot pretend any longer. It's about ultimately denying a woman the right \nto an abortion, maybe even the right to contraception.\n  This Sense of the Senate is a ``put your money where your mouth is'' \nvote. It calls the Senate on their true motives. This is the beginning \nof a step by step process to find an abortion procedure that seems \nawful, to make an inaccurate portrayal about how and why it is used, to \ndraw a ridiculous cartoon and put it on the Senate floor, and to then \noutlaw the procedure and make doctors into criminals and women into \nmurderers. In fact, the term partial birth abortion is a political \nslogan, not a medical procedure.\n  So who knows what the next term will be used to outlaw another type \nof abortion procedure. Let's be thankful that we have the courts. This \nlegislation has been consistently found unconstitutional by the courts. \nIn 19 different cases, including federal courts, the definition of \npartial birth abortion used in this bill has been found to be too \nvague, and to apply to pre and post viability abortions. As a result, \nthis legislation violates the terms of Roe v. Wade, the cornerstone of \na woman's right to choose in this country. This bill is also \nunconstitutional because it lacks an exception to protect a woman's \nhealth.\n  The Supreme Court has concluded that woman's health is the \nphysician's paramount concern, and that a physician's discretion to \ndetermine the course of treatment must be preserved. But Congress is \nhardly concerned with physician authority these days. In fact, this \nbill tries to turn lawmakers into doctors. It would take medical \ndecisions out of the hands of women and their doctors and give it to \npoliticians.\n  My colleague's amendment underscores our commitment to the terms of \nRoe v. Wade, and emphasizes the right of women to choose will continue \nto be upheld. If you really believe that the problem is the so-called \npartial birth abortion, and you are truly sincere that this is not the \ncamel's nose under the tent of undoing Roe v. Wade, vote yes on the \nHarkin amendment. If this is instead the first step toward making all \nabortion illegal--as I believe it is--then vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 6 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We would like to close the debate. If the Senator will \ntake the minute, we appreciate it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator from Iowa 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for her tremendous leadership on this issue \nthat is so important to women of this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Robb be added as a cosponsor of \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, once again, the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaid that my amendment is about changing the subject. He also made the \npoint that this bill has nothing to do with Roe v. Wade.\n  Most respectfully, I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  This law does not provide for any protection of a woman's health. Of \ncourse, they keep using the term ``partial-birth abortion.'' That is \nnowhere found in the medical lexicon. That is not a medical term. That \nis a political pejorative term used to excite and inflame passions. \nThat is all it is. Let's be honest about that. I think if the other \nside was sincere in wanting to end late-term abortions, they could have \nsupported Senator Durbin's amendment yesterday, which would have \naccomplished that.\n  Finally, in States where they have passed legislation such as the \nSantorum bill--the underlying bill here--doctors in those States \nstopped performing all abortions because it was so unclear as to the \ntimeframe. There is no timeframe in this at all. That is why the \ncircuit courts, in all these instances, have struck these laws down as \nbeing unconstitutional. A recent case in our circuit upheld a case in \nIowa on this law.\n  So, really, what this vote is about is whether or not the Senate \nwants to turn back the clock and move back to the pre-Roe v. Wade days \nof back-alley abortions, the days when women committed suicide when \nthey were faced with a desperate choice, the days of women dying or \nbeing permanently disfigured from illegal abortions, when women became \nsterile and could not have children because they had illegally botched \nabortions.\n  This vote about to occur is whether the Senate believes that in the \nmost personal and heart-wrenching decisions the politicians should know \nwhat is best, and not the women, their families, and their doctors, and \naccording to their own religious beliefs and faiths. That is what this \nvote is about. It is about whether or not we believe Roe v. Wade was a \nwise decision and whether or not ought to have their rights to decide \ntheir own reproductive health. It has everything to do with the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his insight in offering this \nimportant amendment. I am very hopeful the Senate will go on record as \nsupporting Roe v. Wade. I think it may well do just that. That would \nsend a wonderful signal to the families of America that we trust them \nto make the most personal, private decisions that perhaps they will \never be called on to make.\n  Once again, I have to say I think some of the language used on the \nother side of the aisle in this debate has been offensive. I think it \nhas been wrong. I think it has been inflammatory. The Senator from \nPennsylvania continues to say those of us who disagree with him, in \nessence, want to kill children. We are mothers. We have bore children. \nWe are grandmothers. We love the children. So it is highly offensive to \nhear those words used on the Senate floor.\n  My colleague says he feels the pain of the families who went through \nthis horrible experience; yet he demeans them. He basically says they \ndon't know what they are talking about when they beg us not to pass \nthis legislation, when they beg us to turn away from this legislation, \nwhich makes no exception for the health of a woman.\n  Again, we are not doctors. We are Senators. When the women of this \ncountry need help--and serious help--they don't turn to us. They turn \nto us for other things, but they don't turn to us to get the help they \nneed. They turn to a physician they trust; they turn to their God, to \ntheir families, to their closest friends, and they turn to their \nconscience. So I hope we will reaffirm Roe v. Wade because that is what \nRoe v. Wade says--trust the women, respect them, respect their privacy.\n\n  I want to put into the Record a statement sent to us by an award-\nwinning actress, Polly Bergen, who came forward to talk about her \nillegal abortion in the 1940s. She said:\n\n       Someone gave me the phone number of a person who did \n     abortions. . . . I borrowed about $300 from my roommate and \n     went alone to a dirty, run-down bungalow in a dangerous \n     neighborhood in east L.A. A . . . man came to the floor and \n     asked for the money. . . . He told me to take off all of my \n     clothes except for my blouse. . . . I got up on a cold metal \n     kitchen table. He performed a procedure, using something \n     sharp. He didn't give me anything for the pain--he just did \n     it. He said . . . I would be fine.\n\n  Well, Polly Bergen was rendered infertile.\n  Vote for the Harkin amendment. Vote no on the underlying bill.\n\n[[Page S12961]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, earlier today I voted against tabling a \nsense of the Congress amendment proposed by Senator Harkin regarding \nthe Supreme Court's 1973 decision in the case of Roe v. Wade. Because \nthat vote was, to the best of my recollection, the first time the \nSenate has directly and specifically addressed the issue of the Court's \nruling, I wish to take a few moments to explain my position for the \nbenefit of my constituents in West Virginia.\n  First, despite the fact that I supported the Harkin amendment, I \nreiterate that I am, as I always have been, personally opposed to \nabortion, with few exceptions--such as when the life of the woman would \nbe endangered, or in cases of incest or rape, when promptly reported.\n  However, the reality of the situation is that the decision of the \nSupreme Court in Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. No matter what I \nthink personally of the procedure in question, I accept the fact that \nthe Court, in a 7-to-2 ruling, has definitively spoken on this matter. \nAccordingly, I felt it was appropriate to support the language of the \nHarkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I submit for the Record a speech given \nby Mother Teresa. I think it is quite germane to this debate we are \nhaving on partial-birth abortion. It is piercing in its view of the \ntruth. It is piercing in its view of the issue of abortion. It is quite \nclear. I think it is full of great wisdom.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                This Gift of Peace--Smile at Each Other\n\n                           (By Mother Teresa)\n\n       As we have gathered here together to thank God for the \n     Nobel Peace Prize, I think it will be beautiful that we pray \n     the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi which always surprises me \n     very much--we pray this prayer every day after Holy \n     Communion, because it is very fitting for each one of us, and \n     I always wonder that 4-500 years ago as St. Francis of Assisi \n     composed this prayer that they had the same difficulties that \n     we have today, as we compose this prayer that fits very \n     nicely for us also. I think some of you already have got it--\n     so we will pray together.\n       Let us thank God for the opportunity that we all have \n     together today, for this gift of peace that reminds us that \n     we have been created to live that peace, and Jesus became man \n     to bring that good news to the poor. He being God became man \n     in all things like us except sin, and he proclaimed very \n     clearly that he had come to give the good news. The\n\n[[Page S12962]]\n\n     news was peace to all of good will and this is something that \n     we all want--the peace of heart--and God loved the world so \n     much that he gave his son--it was a giving--it is as much as \n     if to say it hurt God to give, because he loved the world so \n     much that he gave his son, and he gave him to Virgin Mary, \n     and what did she do with him?\n       As soon as he came in her life--immediately she went in \n     haste to give that good news, and as she came into the house \n     of her cousin, the child--the unborn child--the child in the \n     womb of Elizabeth, lit with joy. He was that little unborn \n     child, was the first messenger of peace. He recognized the \n     Prince of Peace, he recognized that Christ has come to bring \n     the good news for you and for me. And as if that was not \n     enough--it was not enough to become a man--he died on the \n     cross to show that greater love, and he died for you and for \n     me and for that leper and for that man dying of hunger and \n     that naked person lying in the street not only of Calcutta, \n     but of Africa, and New York, and London, and Oslo--and \n     insisted that we love one another as he loves each one of us. \n     And we read that in the Gospel very clearly--love as I have \n     loved you--as I love you--as the Father has loved me, I love \n     you--and the harder the Father loved him, he gave him to us, \n     and how much we love one another, we, too, must give each \n     other until it hurts. It is not enough for us to say: I love \n     God, but I do not love my neighbour. St. John says you are a \n     liar if you say you love God and you don't love your \n     neighbour. How can you love God whom you do not see, if you \n     do not love your neighbour whom you see, whom you touch, with \n     whom you live. And so this is very important for us to \n     realize that love, to be true, has to hurt. It hurt Jesus to \n     love us, it hurt him. And to make sure we remember his great \n     love he made himself bread of life to satisfy our hunger for \n     his love. Our hunger for God, because we have been created \n     for that love. We have been created in his image. We have \n     been created to love and be loved, and then he has become man \n     to make it possible for us to love as he loved us. He makes \n     himself the hungry one--the naked one--the homeless one--the \n     sick one--the one in prison--the lonely one--the unwanted \n     one--and he says: You did it to me. Hungry for our love, and \n     this is the hunger of our poor people. This is the hunger \n     that you and I must find, it may be in our own home.\n       I never forget an opportunity I had in visiting a home \n     where they had all these old parents of sons and daughters \n     who had just put them in an institution and forgotten maybe. \n     And I went there, and I saw in that home they had everything, \n     beautiful things, but everybody was looking toward the door. \n     And I did not see a single one with their smile on their \n     face. And I turned to the sister and I asked: How is that? \n     How is it that the people they have everything here, why are \n     they all looking toward the door, why are they not smiling? I \n     am so used to see the smile on our people, even the dying \n     ones smile, and she said: This is nearly every day, they are \n     expecting, they are hoping that a son or daughter will come \n     to visit them. They are hurt because they are forgotten, and \n     see--this is where love comes. That poverty comes right there \n     in our own home, even neglect to love. Maybe in our own \n     family we have somebody who is feeling lonely, who is feeling \n     sick, who is feeling worried, and these are difficult days \n     for everybody. Are we there, are we there to receive them, is \n     the mother there to receive the child?\n       I was surprised in the waste to see so many young boys and \n     girls given into drugs, and I tried to find out why--why is \n     it like that, and the answer was: Because there is no one in \n     the family to receive them. Father and mother are so busy \n     they have no time. Young parents are in some institution and \n     the child takes back to the street and gets involved in \n     something. We are talking of peace. These are things that \n     break peace, but I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today \n     is abortion, because it is a direct war, a direct killing--\n     direct murder by the mother herself. And we read in the \n     Scripture, for God says very clearly. Even if a mother could \n     forget her child--I will not forget you--I have curved you in \n     the palm of my hand. We are curved in the palm of His hand so \n     close to Him that unborn child has been curved in the hand of \n     God. And that is what strikes me most, the beginning of that \n     sentence, that even if a mother could forget something \n     impossible--but even if she could forget--I will not forget \n     your. And today the greatest means--the greatest destroyer of \n     peace is abortion. And we who are standing here--our parents \n     wanted us. We would not be here if our parents would do that \n     to us. Our children, we want them, we love them, but what of \n     the millions. Many people are very, very concerned with the \n     children in India, with the children of Africa where quite a \n     number die, maybe of malnutrition, of hunger and so on, but \n     millions are dying deliberately by the will of the mother. \n     And this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today. \n     Because if a mother can kill her own child--what is left for \n     me to kill you and you to kill me--there is nothing between. \n     And this I appeal in India, I appeal everywhere: Let us bring \n     the child back, and this year being the child's year: What \n     have we done for the child? At the beginning of the year I \n     told, I spoke everywhere and I said: Let us make this year \n     that we make every single child born, and unborn, wanted. And \n     today is the end of the year, have we really made the \n     children wanted? I will give you something terrifying. We \n     are fighting abortion by adoption, we have saved thousands \n     of lives, we have sent words to all the clinics, to the \n     hospitals, police stations--please don't destroy the \n     child, we will take the child. So every hour of the day \n     and night it is always somebody, we have quite a number of \n     unwedded mothers--tell them come, we will take care of \n     you, we will take the child from you, and we will get a \n     home for the child. And we have a tremendous demand for \n     families who have no children, that is the blessing of God \n     for us. And also, we are doing another thing which is very \n     beautiful--we are teaching our beggars, our leprosy \n     patients, our slum dwellers, our people of the street, \n     natural family planning.\n       And in Calcutta alone in six years--it is all in Calcutta--\n     we have had 61,273 babies less from the families who would \n     have had, but because they practice this natural way of \n     abstaining, of self-control, out of love for each other. We \n     teach them the temperature meter which is very beautiful, \n     very simple, and our poor people understand. And you know \n     what they have told me? Our family is healthy, our family is \n     united, and we can have a baby whenever we want. So clear--\n     these people in the street, those beggars--and I think that \n     if our people can do like that how much more you and all the \n     others who can know the ways and means without destroying the \n     life that God has created in us. The poor people are very \n     great people. They can teach us so many beautiful things. The \n     other day one of them came to thank and said: You people who \n     have evolved chastity you are the best people to teach us \n     family planning. Because it is nothing more than self-control \n     out of love for each other. And I think they said a beautiful \n     sentence. And these are people who maybe have nothing to eat, \n     maybe they have not a home where to live, but they are great \n     people. The poor are very wonderful people. One evening we \n     went out and we picked up four people from the street. And \n     one of them was in a most terrible condition--and I told the \n     sisters: You take care of the other three, I take of this one \n     that looked worse. So I did for her all that my love can do. \n     I put her in bed, and there was such a beautiful smile on her \n     face. She took hold of my hand, as she said one word only: \n     Thank you--and she died.\n       I could not help but examine my conscience before her, and \n     I asked what would I say if I was in her place. And my answer \n     was very simple. I would have tried to draw a little \n     attention to myself, I would have said I am hungry, that I am \n     dying, I am cold, I am in pain, or something, but she gave me \n     much more--she gave me her grateful love. And she died with a \n     smile on her face. As that man whom we picked up from the \n     drain, half eaten with worms, and we brought him to the home. \n     I have lived like an animal in the street, but I am going to \n     die like an angel, loved and cared for. And it was so \n     wonderful to see the greatness of that man who could speak \n     like that, who could die like that without blaming anybody, \n     without cursing anybody, without comparing anything. Like an \n     angel--this is the greatness of our people. And that is why \n     we believe what Jesus has said: I was hungry--I was naked--I \n     was homeless--I was unwanted, unloved, uncared for--and you \n     did it to me. I believe that we are not real social workers. \n     We may be doing social work in the eyes of the people, but we \n     are really contemplatives in the heart of the world. For we \n     are touching the body of Christ 24 hours. We have 24 hours in \n     this presence, and so you and I. You too try to bring that \n     presence of God in your family, for the family that prays \n     together stays together. And I think that we in our family \n     we don't need bombs and guns, to destroy to bring peace--\n     just get together, love one another, bring that peace, \n     that joy, that strength of presence of each other in the \n     home. And we will be able to overcome all the evil that is \n     in the world. There is so much suffering, so much hatred, \n     so much misery, and we with our prayer, with our sacrifice \n     are beginning at home. Love begins at home, and it is not \n     how much we do, but how much love we put in the action \n     that we do. It is to God Almighty--how much we do it does \n     not matter, because He is infinite, but how much love we \n     put in that action. How much we do to Him in the person \n     that we are serving. Some time ago in Calcutta we had \n     great difficulty in getting sugar, and I don't know how \n     the word got around to the children, and a little boy of \n     four years old, Hindu boy, went home and told his parents: \n     I will not eat sugar for three days, I will give my sugar \n     to Mother Teresa for her children. After three days his \n     father and mother brought him to our house. I had never \n     met them before, and this little one could scarcely \n     pronounce my name, but he knew exactly what he had come to \n     do. He knew that he wanted to share his love. And this is \n     why I have received such a lot of love from you all. From \n     the time that I have come here I have simply been \n     surrounded with love, and with real, real understanding \n     love. It could feel as if everyone in India, everyone in \n     Africa is somebody very special to you. And I felt quite \n     at home I was telling Sister today. I feel in the Convent \n     with the Sisters as if I am in Calcutta with my own \n     Sisters. So completely at home here, right here. And so \n     here I am talking with you--I want you to find the poor \n     here, right in your own home first. And begin love there. \n     Be that good news to your own people. And find out about \n     your next-door neighbor--do you know who they are? I had \n     the most extraordinary experience with a Hindu family who \n     had eight children. A gentleman came to our house and \n     said: Mother Teresa, there is a family with eight \n     children, they had not eaten for so\n\n[[Page S12963]]\n\n     long--do something. So I took some rice and I went there \n     immediately. And I saw the children--their eyes shining \n     with hunger--I don't know if you have ever seen hunger. \n     But I have seen it very often. And she took the rice, and \n     divided the rice, and she went out. When she came back I \n     asked her--where did you go, what did you do? And she gave \n     me a very simple answer: They are hungry also. What struck \n     me most was that she knew--and who are they, a Muslim \n     family--and she knew. I didn't bring more rice that \n     evening because I wanted them to enjoy the joy of sharing. \n     But there was those children, radiating joy, sharing the \n     joy with their mother because she had the love to give. \n     And you see this is where love begins--at home. And I want \n     you--and I am very grateful for what I have received. It \n     has been a tremendous experience and I go back to India--I \n     will be back by next week, the 15th I hope--and I will be \n     able to bring your love.\n       And I know well that you have not given from your \n     abundance, but you have given until it hurts you. Today the \n     little children they gave--I was so surprised--there is so \n     much joy for the children that are hungry. That the children \n     like themselves will need love and care and tenderness, like \n     they get so much from their parents. So let us thank God that \n     we have had this opportunity to come to know each other, and \n     this knowledge of each other has brought us very close. And \n     we will be able to help not only the children of India and \n     Africa, but will be able to help the children of the whole \n     world, because as you know our Sisters are all over the \n     world. And with this Prize that I have received as a Prize \n     of Peace, I am going to try to make the home for many \n     people that have no home. Because I believe that love \n     begins at home, and if we can create a home for the poor--\n     I think that more and more love will spread. And we will \n     be able through this understanding love to bring peace, be \n     the good news to the poor. The poor in our own family \n     first, in our country and in the world. To be able to do \n     this, our Sisters, our lives have to be woven with prayer. \n     They have to be woven with Christ to be able to \n     understand, to be able to share. Because today there is so \n     much suffering--and I feel that the passion of Christ is \n     being relived all over again--are we there to share that \n     passion, to share that suffering of people. Around the \n     world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the \n     poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When \n     I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a \n     plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have \n     removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that \n     feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has \n     been thrown out from society--that poverty is so hurtable \n     and so much, and I find that very difficult. Our Sisters \n     are working amongst that kind of people in the West. So \n     you must pray for us that we may be able to be that good \n     news, but we cannot do that without you, you have to do \n     that here in your country. You must come to know the poor, \n     maybe our people here have material things, everything, \n     but I think that if we all look into our own homes, how \n     difficult we find it sometimes to smile at each other, and \n     that the smile is the beginning of love. And so let us \n     always meet each other with a smile, for the smile is the \n     beginning of love, and once we begin to love each other \n     naturally we want to do something. So you pray for our \n     Sisters and for me and for our Brothers, and for our co-\n     workers that are around the world. That we may remain \n     faithful to the gift of God, to love Him and serve Him in \n     the poor together with you. What we have done we would not \n     have been able to do if you did not share with your \n     prayers, with your gifts, this continual giving. But I \n     don't want you to give me from your abundance, I want that \n     you give me until it hurts. The other day I received 15 \n     dollars from a man who has been on his back for twenty \n     years, and the only part that he can move is his right \n     hand. And the only companion that he enjoys is smoking. \n     And he said to me: I do not smoke for one week, and I send \n     you this money. It must have been a terrible sacrifice for \n     him, but see how beautiful, how he shared, and with that \n     money I bought bread and I gave to those who are hungry \n     with a joy on both sides, he was giving and the poor were \n     receiving. This is something that you and I--it is a gift \n     of God to us to be able to share our love with others. And \n     let it be as it was for Jesus. Let us love one another as \n     he loved us. Let us love Him with undivided love. And the \n     joy of loving Him and each other--let us give now--that \n     Christmas is coming so close. Let us keep that joy of \n     loving Jesus in our hearts. And share that joy with all \n     that we come in touch with. And that radiating joy is \n     real, for we have no reason not to be happy because we \n     have Christ with us. Christ in our hearts, Christ in the \n     poor that we meet, Christ in the smile that we give and \n     the smile that we receive. Let us make that one point: \n     That no child will be unwanted, and also that we meet each \n     other always with a smile, especially when it is difficult \n     to smile.\n       I never forget some time ago about 14 professors came from \n     the United States from different universities. And they came \n     to Calcutta to our house. Then we were talking about home for \n     the dying in Calcutta, where we have picked up more than \n     36,000 people only from the streets of Calcutta, and out of \n     that big number more than 18,000 have died a beautiful death. \n     They have just gone home to God; and they came to our house \n     and we talked of love, of compassion, and then one of them \n     asked me: Say, Mother, please tell us something that we will \n     remember, and I said to them: Smile at each other, make time \n     for each other in your family. Smile at each other. And then \n     another one asked me: Are you married, and I said: Yes, and I \n     find it sometimes very difficult to smile at Jesus because he \n     can be very demanding sometimes. This is really something \n     true, and there is where love comes--when it is demanding, \n     and yet we can give it to Him with joy. Just as I have said \n     today, I have said that if I don't go to Heaven for anything \n     else I will be going to Heaven for all the publicity because \n     it has purified me and sacrificed me and made me really \n     something ready to go to Heaven. I think that this is \n     something, that we must live life beautifully, we have Jesus \n     with us and He loves us. If we could only remember that God \n     loves me, and I have an opportunity to love others as He \n     loves me, not in big things, but in small things with great \n     love, then Norway becomes a nest of love. And how beautiful \n     it will be that from here a centre for peace of war has been \n     given. That from here the joy of life of the unborn child \n     comes out. If you become a burning light in the world of \n     peace, then really the Nobel Peace Prize is a gift of the \n     Norwegian people. God bless you!\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside. Obviously, we have a vote locked in at 2 \no'clock. I ask unanimous consent that it be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what I want to do is give an opportunity \nfor other Senators who have amendments to come to the floor and offer \ntheir amendments during this time so we can move forward on the bill, \nwith the expectation we can finish the bill sometime today.\n  Also, if any Senator has a statement on either side of the issue, \nthis is a good opportunity to come down and make their statement about \nthe bill or about any amendment that has been offered to date. I hope \nwe will use this time fruitfully and not delay the Senate any further \nin acting upon this very important measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Pennsylvania intend \nto stay on the floor for a while?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. For another 10 minutes, and then I am going to be gone.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have to leave as well. I have come a couple times \ntrying to engage in a colloquy on this piece of legislation. I thought \nnow would be the time to take a few minutes to do so.\n  I support a woman's right to choose. I voted yes on Medicaid funding. \nI think it is critical for me to support a woman's right to choose for \nthose people who cannot afford it. I supported Federal employees' \nrights to use health insurance, and I supported rights of people in the \narmed services to reproductive services. I think I voted five times \nagainst your legislation or something to that extent, and a couple \ntimes to sustain the President's veto.\n  I want people on both sides of the aisle to understand this procedure \ndeeply troubles me. I am not certain how I am going to vote this time \naround. I indicated to people in Nebraska that I am listening to their \nconcerns about this procedure.\n  I state at the beginning this is a very difficult issue because very \noften we do not have a chance to debate and talk about it in a personal \nway, as in the way the Senator from Pennsylvania did last evening. I \ncaught about the last 30 minutes of the presentation. It is a very \nmoving and personal presentation the Senator makes, and oftentimes we \njust do not get that. We lock in our positions early on in our \npolitical careers and are told by our political consultants: You cannot \nchange your position or modify your position in any way--especially in \nmy case; I am coming up on an election--you are doing it for political \nreasons, so forth, your supporters get bitterly disappointed, on and on \nand all that political advice.\n  I have, in my case, to ignore that. I find this to be very much about \nwhat kind of a country we want to be, and it is a very serious debate. \nI do not know\n\n[[Page S12964]]\n\nthat we have time, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, today or \nright now to do it, but at some point, even when the Senator from \nCalifornia is down here, I want to talk about this question of medical \nnecessity because for me it turns on that. If this procedure is not \nmedically necessary, then your legislation is not an undue burden upon \nanyone who chooses to undergo an abortion. It is not an undue burden. \nIf it is medically necessary, then it can be an undue burden. That is \nwhere it gets in a hurry for me as I consider this.\n\n  I have talked to people in Nebraska about this, both for and against. \nIt is very difficult for anybody, once they consider what this \nprocedure is, to say: Gosh, that's good; it doesn't bother me; I am not \nconcerned about it. Almost unanimously people say there is something \nabout this that just does not seem right.\n  I wonder if the Senator can talk for a bit--I do not want to drag him \ntoo long into this discussion--about this issue of medical necessity. I \nwill announce ahead of time for the staff, for the Senator from \nCalifornia, I will give her an opportunity, as well, to describe why \nshe believes this is medically necessary. I have heard the Senator from \nPennsylvania say it is not. I appreciate very much an opportunity to \nhear directly from him.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first off, I thank the Senator very much \nfor his interest in an honest and open debate. I agree, this is one of \nthe critical issues we have to address, and the courts have confronted \nthis question of undue burden.\n  Underlying that are two issues; one is the center point: Is this \nmedically necessary. Second, are there alternatives to this procedure \nso as not to have an undue burden.\n  That gets into a couple issues. Let me address the medical necessity \nissue.\n  I will present the evidence as best I can that supports, we believe, \nthe fact that this is not medically necessary. We have, of course, the \nAMA which said it is not medically necessary. That is the American \nMedical Association. They have said in a letter and stand by it that \nthis procedure is not medically necessary.\n  We have C. Everett Koop, obviously someone who has a tremendous \namount of respect in this country, who has written directly this is not \nmedically necessary.\n  We have an organization of 600--actually more than 600--obstetricians \nand gynecologists, many of them members of the American College of \nObstetrics and Gynecology, many of them fellows, who have written \nwithout any hesitation this procedure is not medically necessary and \nis, in fact, dangerous to the health of the mother. They go one step \nfurther: It is never medically preferable, not only medically \nnecessary.\n  On the other side of the issue--and I am trying to present it, and I \nknow the Senator from California will present her side--what is used is \nthe American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology policy statement on \nthe issue. Several years ago, they put together a select panel, and the \nselect panel reviewed the procedure to determine whether there were \ncases in which it was medically necessary to perform this procedure. \nThey came forward with a statement. This is what their statement said:\n\n       [We] could identify no circumstances under which this \n     procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or \n     preserve the health of the woman . . . \n\n  They went on to say--and this is where the Senator from California \nwill come in and say, see, that is not the whole story, so I will go \non. It says:\n\n       An intact D\n\n  Partial-birth abortion--\n\n       however, may--\n\n  May--\n\n     be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision.\n\n  We have asked the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology to \nprovide us an example of where this procedure may be the best procedure \nbecause what they say is it ``may.'' For 3 years we have asked them to \nprovide us a factual situation where, in fact, this ``may'' would come \ninto play, and they have not done so.\n  In fact, we have letters, and I would be happy to share them with \nyou; there are dozens--in fact, there is a whole stack--from \nobstetricians and gynecologists throughout America who take issue with \nthis statement, saying there are no circumstances where this would be \nthe most appropriate procedure.\n  Dr. Frist addressed that issue last night. He went through the \nmedical literature and talked about it. I have asked him to come over, \nif he can, because I think, as a physician, as a surgeon, he may be \nbetter to answer this question than me.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, I expect, after lunch, to come back. I hope there is \nan opportunity to engage in this kind of colloquy.\n  I will give you an example. There was a woman who approached me and \nsaid: Senator, there are times when a woman gets an abortion where she \nwould prefer not to. She has gone in for delivery--that is the \nsituation this woman described to me. She went in to deliver a baby. \nShe went in and delivered prematurely, and the doctor had to make a \ndecision and chose, she thought, this procedure--I don't know \nprecisely; I don't have the documentation on this--but thought the \ndoctor chose this procedure and was worried that if this procedure was \nnot available, the doctor might not have been able to save her life.\n  I presume the Senator has a response to that. This is not a unique \nsituation. In other words, this is not a woman who has chosen to have \nan abortion. She wanted to have the baby. She wanted to deliver the \nbaby.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. She was in the process of delivery, and they had to do \nsomething?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Two comments.\n  First of all, the definition of ``partial-birth abortion'' is very \nclear. It requires an intent to do an abortion. So if you were going \nin, and you were having a delivery, and the delivery is breech, for \nexample, that would not be covered under this. It is very clear. There \nis no court in the land, that has reviewed this, that has suggested \nthat anyone who is in the process of delivering a child for the purpose \nof a live birth is covered under this definition because you have to \nhave the intent to have an abortion. If there is no such intent, then \nyou are not covered under the act.\n  Mr. KERREY. Has the Senator examined the Eighth Circuit decision that \noverturned it?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have.\n  Mr. KERREY. Can we speak to that later? I don't want to keep you any \nlonger. You were kind enough to stick around a few minutes. I need to \nleave for a luncheon, as well. Perhaps we can speak later this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I would be happy to. In fact, I shared with the \nSenator from Nebraska yesterday an amendment to the bill that I think \ndirectly is on point with what the Eighth Circuit decision had concern \nwith, which is the vagueness of the definition, that it could cover \nmore than one abortion. I think this refinement of the definition makes \nit crystal clear that we are only talking about this one procedure.\n  As I said to the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, when she \nwas going through the Eighth Circuit decision earlier, the Eighth \nCircuit said our problem with this is it includes too much. Obviously, \nif you take the logic of that, they would probably not have a problem \nif it did not include too much.\n  Mr. KERREY. The language you showed me earlier to modify your \namendment was to respond to the Eighth Circuit?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I accomplished at least the objective of \nletting people know that: Please, don't put me in the ``no column'' on \nthis immediately. I indicated the last time this thing was around that \nI have significant reservations about it. I have listened to people and \ntalked to people, especially at home, and under no circumstances do I--\nI was Governor for 4 years and have been a Senator for 10 years. The \nworst thing is to be locked into a position from which people say you \ncan't change, even if you acquire evidence that your previous position \nis wrong.\n  So I want both the Senator from Pennsylvania and especially the \npeople\n\n[[Page S12965]]\n\nin Nebraska to understand that I am looking at it. If I conclude I was \nwrong the other time, I will vote differently this time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \nopenmindedness on this. From my perspective, in looking at his career, \nit comports very well with his previous practice. I appreciate the \nopportunity to converse with the Senator.\n  I might just say, this is the kind of dialog I think we need to have \non the Senate floor when it comes to this issue. Let's get to the \nmaterial facts that are before us, and let's have an enlightened \ndiscussion about what underpins this case.\n  Dr. Frist is here. If the Senator would care to add to this colloquy, \nI would certainly appreciate his comments.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is interesting. I believe much of the \ndiscussion centers on the fact of this being a particular procedure; \nthat is, as I have said on the floor of the Senate, this particular \nprocedure, as described, is a subset of many other types of procedures \nof abortion.\n  As I talk to physicians and surgeons, which I do on a regular basis--\nbecause, as I said, I am not an obstetrician, I am a surgeon who is \ntrained in looking at surgical techniques--this is a specific technique \nwhich is a subset of a much larger armamentarium. This is where much of \nthe confusion is. It is confusing to many physicians. Physicians today \nhave this great fear that by prohibiting a single procedure, in some \nway that is going to be expanded to eliminate the much larger \narmamentarium of tools used.\n  That is what we have to be very careful of. We are talking about a \nvery specific procedure that has been described. We do not need to go \nthrough the details now. There are other procedures that are in a \nbroader arena called D and all these more medical terms it is not \nworth getting into.\n  But it is important for people to understand this is a very specific \ntype of procedure that is different, that is on the fringe; that does \nnot mean the other procedures can't and in certain cases shouldn't be \nused.\n  Mr. KERREY. If the Senator will yield for a question in this regard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. This bill, then, is inaccurately characterized as a late-\nterm abortion bill? It is not? I have had people ask me about it: Are \nyou going to support the partial-birth abortion bill because it is \ngoing to end this procedure, late-term procedure? This is a bill that \nwould make illegal a specific medical procedure?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. KERREY. The second part, is there precedent for us to do this \nsort of thing?\n  Mr. FRIST. No, there is not, or to my mind, there is not. You can \nfind certain examples, because we are talking about life, and other \nplaces that the Senate has intervened.\n  The real concern among physicians, which I think is very accurate, is \nyou are taking a specific procedure and taking it off the table. And \nthe question is, Why?\n\n  The other big concern is, is this a slippery slope? Does this mean \nthe Congress is going to come in and take another procedure and another \nprocedure to accomplish a goal with some hidden agenda of eliminating \nall abortions for everybody under all circumstances at a certain point \nin life? It is not.\n  In is this unusual nature of being a specific procedure that is what \nis hard for the American people to understand and physicians to \nunderstand and our colleagues to understand. This basically takes a \nprocedure, which is one of many, at any point --really 22 weeks and \nlater--and eliminating it because of the brutality, the inhumaneness, \nthe way it is performed, the risk, the unstudied risk of the safety of \nthe mother, and the damage to the fetus, which during that period, I \nwould argue, does feel pain.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you.\n  Let me move to something that I commented on very briefly, and that \nis this whole concept of a slippery slope. I have talked to a number of \nphysicians in the last several days. Their concern is exactly as I \nimplied. We have the Congress coming in and taking a procedure--and \nnone of the physicians I have talked to have tried to justify this \nprocedure in any way--but the great fear is that you take this \nprocedure, and the Congress will come back a year from now, or 2 years \nfrom now or 3 years from now, and ban other very specific procedures.\n  I struggled with this a great deal because I do not want to see the \nFederal Government coming in to that decision making capacity. I \nstruggled with it night and day. I struggled with it since we last \ndebated this on the floor. But ultimately, I come back to the fact that \nwomen are being hurt by a specific procedure; thus, we have a public \nresponsibility, as being trustees to the American people, since there \nare women being hurt by a procedure, which is unnecessary today, that \ncontinues to be performed on the fringe, out of the mainstream, that we \ndo have a public obligation to reach out and prohibit that specific \nprocedure.\n  I described in some detail last night the out-of-mainstream whole \nfringe nature of this procedure. Again, I think it is very important \nfor people to understand this is a fringe procedure.\n  Then people will come and say: If it's such a fringe procedure, why \ndo you say we need to go so far as to have the Federal Government \nbecome involved?\n  Again, it comes back to the fact that being a fringe procedure, the \nsafety, the efficacy of this procedure has not been discussed.\n  As a surgeon, as someone who has spent his entire adult life, or 20 \nyears of his life, studying surgical procedures, studying the \nindications for operation, the techniques of operation, the potential \ncomplications of operation, the risks of operation, and the outcome of \noperation, none of that--none of that--has been studied by the medical \nprofession for partial-birth abortion, which involves the rotation of \nthe fetus in utero, pulling out most of the fetus, inserting scissors \ninto the base of the cranium of the skull, expansion of those scissors, \nand evacuation of the brain. It has not been studied.\n\n  I have also mentioned I wanted to see what our medical students are \nlearning. Therefore, over the last several days, I reviewed 17 \ndifferent textbooks. In fact, they are sitting in my office. I thought \nabout bringing a couple and putting them on the desk. In 17 of those \ntextbooks, not once is that procedure described. Not once are the \nindications for that procedure there. Not once is there any discussion \nof the risk of the complications or of the outcome.\n  I challenge my colleagues and others: Where else would we allow a \nprocedure which we know has complications? They have been outlined on \nthe floor. We know there is hemorrhage or bleeding, or perforation of \nthe uterus by a blind manipulation. We know there is a rupture of the \nuterus. The list goes on in terms of the complications of the \nprocedure. But where else in medicine today do we actually allow a \nprocedure to be performed that we know hurts people, that is on the \nfringe, which has not been studied by the medical profession? There are \nno trials. There are no publications in peer review journals. Of the \nthousands and thousands of peer review articles out there, the \nthousands in obstetrics each year, this procedure has not been studied. \nWe have an option. We have alternatives in each and every case.\n  It is interesting because a number of people have called around and \ntalked to their own medical schools trying to gather more information. \nThey will call me afterwards and say: Senator Frist, or Dr. Frist, I \njust talked to the obstetrician back home and he says that abortions \nare indicated at certain points, in his or her mind. Therefore, to \noutlaw this procedure would mean no abortions will be performed in that \nmiddle or late trimester. You could argue, depending on your moral \nbeliefs or medical beliefs, whether or not that should be the case, but \nthat is not what is under discussion today.\n  What is under discussion is the elimination of a specific procedure \nfor which there are alternatives; a specific procedure I argue not only \noffends the basic civil sensibilities of all Americans but is inhumane \nto the fetus and hurts and damages and threatens the health of women.\n  I was talking to an obstetrician yesterday at one of the very \nesteemed medical centers. I basically asked, do you teach this \nprocedure. I have not talked to anybody yet--I know it is not in the \nliterature--who teaches this procedure in an established surgical \nresidency training program. That is the\n\n[[Page S12966]]\n\nprogram where we train the board certified obstetricians.\n  There might be some abortionists who are not board certified, who \nhave not gone through board programs. It is important for people to \nknow you can perform abortions, you can actually do surgery without \nbeing board certified. You don't have to go through the certification \nprocess. Yes, there are people performing this procedure, but if you go \nto the established licensing, credentialling bodies, you won't find \nthis procedure being taught.\n  Are abortions being taught? It depends on which medical school you \nare attending. It depends on which residency training program. One \nperson I was talking to yesterday said: No, at our hospital, as part of \nour program, we don't go in and teach midtrimester abortions. We don't \nteach the procedures. If you voluntarily come forward, yes, we will \nteach abortion. But we will not teach the partial-birth abortion, which \ninvolves manipulation within the uterus, blind extraction of 90, 95 \npercent of the fetus, and opening the cranium with scissors bluntly and \nevacuation of the brain. We teach abortion voluntarily, but we do not \nactually teach the partial-birth abortion.\n  Therefore, when my colleagues talk to people, be very specific that \nthis procedure, the partial-birth abortion procedure as described on \nthe floor of the Senate, is the procedure that is under discussion.\n  To summarize, this is a fringe procedure. It is outside of the \nmainstream. It is not studied or taught in our medical schools. Of the \n17 textbooks I reviewed last night, I did find one reference, after \nlooking through all 17 books, to partial-birth abortion. It had nothing \nto do with technique. It had nothing to do with complications. It had \nnothing to do with outcome. The only mention was one paragraph in this \nparticular textbook. It mentioned the veto by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  There are alternatives to this inhumane, barbaric procedure. Thus, I \ncontinue to support the Senator from Pennsylvania in prohibiting this \nprocedure and its practice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is my intention at some \npoint later on in the proceedings of the debate on this partial-birth \nabortion ban bill to offer an amendment that would bring some sunshine \nand light into the abortion industry in terms of disclosure.\n  As I indicated last night in a rather lengthy presentation on the \nSenate floor, the sale of fetal body parts is illegal. Ironically, \nPresident Clinton himself signed the legislation banning that. Yet it \nis taking place in America. I think we need to look into this matter in \ngreat detail.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to provide that we have disclosure so \nwe know who is selling, who is buying, what is being sold, and whether \nor not laws are being violated.\n  As many of you know, several years ago, in 1994 and 1995, I took to \nthe floor of the Senate on this legislation. As a matter of fact, I \nwrote the original partial-birth abortion ban bill. I took a lot of \nheat for it. I received a lot of attacks from the media, a lot of \nattacks from some colleagues, and certainly from the abortion industry.\n  President Clinton came to my State and campaigned against me in my \nreelection efforts, as did Vice President Gore and Mrs. Clinton. They \nhad a regular celebrity group up there making pretty much of a big deal \nout of the fact that I had been this ``extremist'' who stood on the \nSenate floor and exposed partial-birth abortion. I didn't even know it \nexisted 6 years ago.\n  The interesting thing to me is, why is it that those of us who are \nopposed to this barbaric procedure are ``extremists'' and those who \nperform it are not? They are ``thoughtful liberals,'' I guess. It is \namazing what we can do with semantics and, with a little disingenuous \ndiscussion, how we can change the debate in this country.\n  Senator Santorum and others have talked extensively on what happens \nin a partial-birth abortion. I am not going to go into all of that. But \nI will say this: It is infanticide. It is killing children in some \ncases outside of the womb.\n  We have a child who is 90-percent born but for the head, and under \nthe so-called Roe v. Wade law, unfortunately, that child, because the \nhead has not come through the birth canal, can be killed by using a \nbarbaric means of needle and sucking the brains from the child. It is a \nhorrible procedure which has been discussed here in great detail. It is \namazing to me that we are ``extremists,'' we who are exposing it, and \nthose who do it are not. But that is the way we are with semantics.\n  When I came down to the floor several years ago, I brought a little \nplastic medical doll. When the press was finished writing about it, it \nwas a ``plastic fetus.'' I was accused of showing aborted children on \nthe floor of the Senate when in fact I showed a picture of premature \nbabies who had been born who had lived. But as many times as I \ncorrected papers such as the New York Times, they still couldn't get it \nright.\n  This debate has been pretty harsh at times. Frankly, it is very \ngraphic. My goal is not to try to revisit all of that but to try to get \ninto your heart, if I cannot your face, on this issue. We all have very \nstrong feelings about this. But I have to believe most Americans are \nappalled, sickened, angered, and disgusted that such a brutal act would \ntake place in this country to be carried out against a defenseless \nchild. Yet we condone it.\n\n  As I said last night on the floor, if every SPCA in America announced \ntomorrow they were going to kill all of their dogs and cats, unwanted \ncats and dogs, puppies, kittens, by using this procedure with no \nanesthetic, putting a needle to the back of the head and sucking the \nbrains from those animals, I guarantee there would be a firestorm. \nThere would be people protesting in front of the SPCA. But we do it to \nour children.\n  Then we say we are surprised when our children go out and kill other \nchildren, when they get into trouble with drugs and all the other \nthings that sometimes happen to our children in society. What are we \ntelling them? What is the message we are giving them? We are telling \nthem: You are worthless. We tell them: You go to school today, Johnny, \nbe a good boy, and we will abort your sister with this horrible \nprocedure while you are in school. That is what we are telling them.\n  I was told from a very early age that when you are around children \nand talk, they listen. They hear you. A lot of times, you ask a 3-year \nold. I can discuss this or that, and they don't care what I am saying. \nThey are not paying any attention. They are playing with their toys. \nYou would be surprised at what they hear.\n  I tell you what they are hearing when they hear this debate. They are \nhearing: We are worthless; nobody cares about us. We can just go ahead \nand abort you, kill you--you are just to be discarded in a trash can--\nand go right on about our business, keep working on our jobs, having a \nnice vacation and our 401(k)s; everything is fine. We just go ahead and \nkill babies.\n  The vast majority of partial-birth abortions are performed on healthy \nwomen with healthy babies. Dr. Martin Haskell, who is the leading \npractitioner of partial-birth abortions, said: I will be quite frank; \nmost of my abortions are elective in that 20- to 24-week range, and, in \nmy particular case, 20 percent are for genetic reasons and 80 percent \nare purely elective. Mr. President, 24 weeks is 6 months.\n\n  I received a telephone call in one of my offices several weeks ago. A \n9-year-old girl relayed to my staff this message:\n  I want to thank the Senator for being pro-life. I'm 9 years old and I \nwould like him to tell America when he has the chance that my mother \ngave birth to me prematurely when she was 5 months pregnant. I'm here \ntalking to you now. Please tell your fellow Americans not to kill \nchildren like me.\n  That is pretty powerful stuff.\n  When President Clinton held his press conference and said he had five \nwomen at the press conference who had all undergone health-saving \npartial-birth abortions, one of the women later\n\n[[Page S12967]]\n\ninvolved in that press conference admitted her abortion was not \nnecessary at all. As far as her health was concerned, it was not \nmedically necessary. She said on a radio show soon after the press \nconference:\n\n       This procedure was not performed in order to save my life. \n     This procedure was elective. That is considered an elective \n     procedure, as were the procedures of all the women who were \n     at the White House veto ceremony.\n\n  The sad truth is we will pass this bill; that is the good news. The \nbad news is it will be vetoed again for the third time by this \nPresident because we need 67 votes to override it and we don't have \nthem. That is sad because thousands more children are going to die in \nthe next few years because President William Jefferson Clinton won't \nsign this bill--thousands--and they will die brutally. We are \nresponsible for it in this Senate because we can't get 67 men and women \nwith the guts. Does it really take guts to stand up, go down to the \nwell and say, aye, to ban this horrible procedure? We don't have them. \nAnd Bill Clinton has the pen. That is the Constitution.\n  I want everybody to know, three votes, maybe four--probably three--\nwill decide whether thousands of children live or die. Hopefully, we \nkeep that in mind as the debate moves forward.\n  I don't enjoy talking about abortions and about killing children. Why \nare we on the Senate floor doing this? Let me state why. Roe v. Wade \nwas passed in 1973 that said anyone can have an abortion any time they \nwant for any reason. Over 4,000 babies, 4,100 to be exact, die every \nday from legalized abortion; not from partial-birth abortion, to be \nfair, but from abortions. Many of them are partial-birth abortions.\n  When I first took the floor on this issue several years ago, I was \ntold it might be a dozen or two dozen at the most, in extreme cases--\nhydrocephalic babies and other horrible deformities were the only times \nthey were aborting. I was knocked by some, certainly in the media, that \nI made a mountain out of a molehill, this was not prevalent in our \nsociety, and why was I doing all this.\n  Now we find from the admission of their own people who perform the \nabortions that partial-birth abortions are very frequent. I will point \nout in a few moments why they are frequent. I will point out some of \nthe dirty little secrets of this industry. It will shock Members. It \nshocked me.\n  Mr. President, 40 million children have died since 1973, since Roe v. \nWade, from abortion--not partial-birth abortion but all abortions. \nThere are 260 million Americans. Roughly one-seventh, about 15 percent, \nof America's population has been executed through abortion; never to be \na mom, never to be a dad, never to be a doctor. Who knows. Maybe one of \nthose kids could have been a scientist who found a cure for cancer--\nnever have the chance to be happy, never have a chance to fulfill their \ndreams. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson said we \nhave the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Down the \ndrain. They didn't have a choice.\n\n  I hear a lot about choice in this debate. What choice do they have? \nIt would be interesting to have in the gallery some of the 40 million. \nThey could be sitting up here today. I wonder how they would vote on \nthis bill if they could vote. I think the vote would be different. I \ndon't think there is any question about it.\n  Sometimes we make judgments about why a woman, mother, should have a \nright to have an abortion. I am reminded of a story I mentioned last \nnight on the floor. I will mention it again because I know some missed \nit. I ask this question. Answer silently. If you knew a woman who had \nthree children born blind, then she had two more children born deaf, a \nsixth child born mentally retarded, and she was pregnant again and she \nhad syphilis, would you recommend she have an abortion? If you said \nyes, guess who you just killed. Beethoven. He made a pretty fair \ncontribution to the world, as I recall, but we would have killed \nBeethoven. How many Beethovens have we killed in those 40 million? How \nmany great baseball players such as my colleague presiding, have we \nkilled? How many entertainers? We will never know. But we did it. We \ndid it.\n  One of the things about America, people want to blame somebody else. \nMy kid gets in trouble; it is not my fault; it is somebody else's \nfault.\n  We are responsible for this. We go to work; everything is fine. But \ndon't worry about those 40 million kids--gone. Mr. President, 95 \npercent of those abortions are used for birth control. They were \ntotally elective. One to two percent are done because the life of the \nmother was threatened or she was perhaps raped or some other horrible \nthing. That means that more than 38 million abortions are performed for \nreasons that boil down to one word: Convenience. It is convenient, \nisn't it? How convenient it is. Mom was too old; mom was too young; mom \nwas in high school; mom was in college; mom needed to work.\n  Who knows. I want to speak directly to any woman out there now \nlistening to me who may be pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy. There \nis help out there. One does not need to do this. Do not listen to those \nwho say that is the only alternative. There is another alternative. If \nanyone wants help, there are professionals to help. Call my office or \nthe office of any other pro-life Senator. We will steer anyone to the \nright people to get that help. I beg women to do it. They will be glad \nthey did when they look back 10, 15, 20 years from now. They will be \nglad.\n  I had the privilege of helping to raise funds for a home for unwed \nmothers, a clinic in Baton Rouge, LA, from a woman who is a saint on \nEarth. Her name is Dorothy Wallace. She saved 10,000 women since 1973, \nadvising them to choose life.\n  If you want something emotional, attend one of her meetings and see \nthose 10-, 12-, 15-year-old boys and girls sitting there in the \naudience applauding Dorothy Wallace. You can have that experience too, \nI would say to any young woman out there; we can help you. There are \nprofessionals who will help you get through this. Choose life.\n  Let me say to the three or four Senators we need, who might change \ntheir votes--I am always an optimist; you never know--pick up your \ngrandchild, or your child, if you are that young. Most of us are too \nold to have young children in here--not everybody. But pick up your own \nchildren, hold them in your arms, and ask yourself this question: How \nclose is that little child in the birth canal that you are voting to \nkill, how close is that child to that little grandchild of yours you \nare now holding? Six months? Six years? I don't know. But look at that \nlittle grandchild. He or she has feet, has a face or body. So does that \nlittle child being executed in a partial-birth abortion.\n  I am going to talk for a few moments on the subject of my amendment, \nwhich is on the marketing and sale of fetal tissue from aborted babies. \nThis is a gruesome story, but I want to tell you, it is happening. I \nsay to my colleagues, this is happening in America, and it is \ndisgusting. It is illegal, it is immoral, and it is unethical. If \nsomebody says, What does that have to do with partial-birth abortion? \nin my amendment we will find out whether partial-birth abortions are \nbeing used, in fact, to sell babies' body parts.\n  Like partial-birth abortion, fetal tissue sales are morally and \nethically reprehensible. It is a practice I hadn't heard of until \nrecently. I couldn't believe we did it. But it does show how far this \nindustry has gone beyond the ethical boundaries that even most pro-\nchoice Americans believe is legitimate. Also, like partial-birth \nabortion, this industry has taken a practice, the selling of fetal body \nparts, which is illegal under Federal criminal law, and has created a \nloophole to allow them to do it. There is a loophole in partial-birth \nabortion, too. I coined the term ``head loophole'' because, you see, if \nthe arms or the toes or the trunk or the leg or anything else exits the \nbirth canal, it is not a baby yet. Somebody created a loophole, legal \nmumbo-jumbo. It makes lawyers rich and kills children.\n  Ironically, if you turn the baby around--and they have done that; the \nabortionists do turn the baby around, so it is a breach birth, so the \nhead is last--by doing that, under the law of Roe v. Wade, they can \nkill the child. If it is the other way around and the head exits first, \nthey cannot. Is the head less baby than the torso and the legs and the \ntoes? You be the judge.\n  Stabbing a baby in the back of the head is murder, infanticide. Call \nit whatever you want; that is what it is. It is done for convenience. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S12968]]\n\ngoing to pay a severe price for this one day. The bottom line is, they \ncall it medicine. Are you kidding me?\n  Let's go back to the sale of body parts and how it relates here. Look \nat this chart. We see a woman walking into an abortion clinic. She is \nobviously pregnant. She is in distress. She is emotional. She is mixed \nup. ``What do I do? I don't want this child. I am in a mess.'' Let me \ntell you what happens when she comes in there.\n  In a room adjacent to where the abortion is to be performed usually, \nor someplace on the premises, is a person called the wholesaler or the \nharvester of the child's organs. This is what is going on in this \nindustry. That person or persons--represented here by two \norganizations, Opening Lines and Anatomic Gift Foundation--sit there. \nThey have a work order in their hands.\n\n  Bear in mind the brutality and the gruesomeness of this. Here is this \nwoman obviously pregnant, obviously in distress, sitting there. I don't \nknow whether they have a one-way mirror or a one-way glass or what. \nPerhaps they just come in, cruise in, take a good look at her to see if \nshe is healthy. But they have a work order. They have already done \nthis. They did prep it up. You now find out this woman has a normal \nfetus; she is not sick; the baby is fine. That is what they find out.\n  While she is still pregnant with a living child, still going through \nthe turmoil of an abortion decision, they have a work order on her \nblood type, on how pregnant she is, what body parts they want. I am \ngoing to prove all that to you in a moment. That is the brutality of \nit. Then they make some kind of deal. They say it is fee for service, \nbut it is selling body parts--I will go into that for a moment--the \nbuyer or buyers, universities, government agencies, pharmaceutical \ncompanies, NIH, private researchers. This is against the law, and I \nread the law last night.\n  There are four illegal and immoral things that happen with this \nissue.\n  The first is, the current law prohibits receiving any valuable \nconsideration for the tissue of aborted children, but it is happening.\n  Second, live births are occurring at these clinics. Live births are \noccurring at these clinics. It is the law of every State, when a live \nbirth occurs, to save the life of that child if possible. But this is \nnot happening either. Our tax dollars are being used to fund Planned \nParenthood and NIH. On the one hand, if you are pro-life, you are \nfunding Planned Parenthood with your tax dollars, and on the other hand \nyou are funding the research on aborted children.\n  We will go down and finish this chart. Let's go through the steps. \nThe buyer orders the fetal body parts from the wholesaler; that is, the \nbuyer, the university, and so forth. The clinic provides the space for \nthe wholesaler to procure the body parts. The wholesaler faxes an order \nto the clinic while the baby is still alive inside the mother. The \nwholesaler technicians harvest the organs--skin, limbs, et cetera. The \nclinic donates fetal body parts to the wholesaler who, in turn, pays \nthe clinic a ``site fee'' for access to the babies. Then the wholesaler \ndonates the fetal body parts to the buyer, and then the buyer \nreimburses the wholesaler for the government retrieving the fetal body \nparts.\n  That is a bunch of gobbledygook that means nothing but one thing--the \nsale of little babies chopped into pieces. This whole process is being \nthought out and carefully calculated while this woman is sitting there \nin the clinic.\n  Tell me the abortionists care about the welfare of a woman. Some \nestimates say the market for this is in the $420 million range. Some \nsay it is as high as $1 billion.\n  I know it is difficult for those in the galleries to see it, but on \ntelevision you will be able to see. This is a price list for body \nparts. I want you to understand what is happening here. This clinic, \nwhere this young woman in trouble goes in an agonizing, gut-wrenching \ndecision as to whether to have an abortion or not, has a price list \nthey are going to provide to the marketer for her baby's body parts \neven before she gets there.\n  In addition, they have a work order prepared on her as to what it is \nthat is her background, what parts we can provide. Then they tell us \nthis is just fee for services. If it is fee for services, why is it \n$600 for an intact cadaver and $325 for a spinal cord? I am not a \ndoctor, but I assume it takes a lot more time to extract a spinal cord \nfrom a 2- or 3-pound baby than it does to put a cadaver in a box and \nmail it somewhere.\n  We have a brochure. I will read directly from the brochure. The \nbrochure is the Opening Lines. Those are the sellers. Here is what the \nbrochure says:\n\n       We have simplified the process for procuring fetal tissue. \n     We do not require a copy of your approval of summary or of \n     your research, and you are not required to cite Opening Lines \n     as the source of tissue when you publish your work.\n\n  I guess not; it is against the law.\n\n       If you like our service, you will tell your colleagues, \n     word of mouth. We are very pleased to provide you with our \n     services. Our goal is to offer you and your staff the highest \n     quality, most affordable, and freshest tissue prepared to \n     your specifications and delivered in the quantities you need \n     when you need it. We are professionally staffed and directed. \n     We have over 10 years experience in tissue harvesting and \n     preservation. Our full-time medical director is active in all \n     phases, and we look forward to serving you.\n\n  That is what is given to the wholesaler while this poor woman sits \nthere deciding whether or not to have an abortion. It is a great \ncountry, isn't it?\n  Let me explain to you how this all works directly from the horse's \nmouth. I am going to quote from a woman we will call Kelly. She was a \nwholesaler. She was a buyer. She said:\n\n       We were never employees of the abortion clinic. We would \n     have a contract with an abortion clinic that would allow us \n     to go in and procure fetal tissue for research. We would get \n     a generated list each day to tell us what tissue researchers, \n     pharmaceuticals and universities were looking for. Then we \n     would go and look at the patient charts.\n\n  Then we would go and look at the patient charts.\n  Kind of like going out and looking at a steer on the hoof, isn't it?\n\n       We had to screen out anyone who had . . . fetal anomalies. \n     These had to be the most perfect specimens we could give \n     these researchers for the best value that we could sell for. \n     Probably only 10 percent of fetuses were ruled out for \n     anomalies. The rest were healthy donors.\n\n  That is showing a lot of compassion for the woman, isn't it?\n  Let me talk a little bit more about what other things happen in this \nclinic. The abortionists are having problems. It is not fun to be an \nabortionist anymore. The pro-life advertising and, frankly, the wake-up \ncall to doctors and physicians have shown that abortions are declining \nin this country. This $300 to $1,000 they are going to charge that \nwoman who walks in is not enough. They cannot live on that anymore. \nThey have to make money from the fetus, from the aborted child.\n  What happens? Here is what the abortionists are saying, their own \nobservations:\n\n       Abortion has failed to escape its back-alley associations . \n     . . [It is the] dark side of medicine . . . Even when \n     abortion became legal, it was still considered dirty.\n\n  And on and on.\n  One abortionist said:\n\n       [Abortion is] a nasty, dirty, yukky thing and I always come \n     home angry.\n       Organized medicine has been sympathetic to abortion--not \n     abortionists.\n\n  What had to happen is they had to come up with another way to make \nmoney, and they just did: selling body parts.\n\n  Warren Hern is the author of the most widely used textbook on \nabortion procedures. Dr. Hern says:\n\n       A number of practitioners attempt to ensure live fetuses \n     after late abortions so that genetic tests can be conducted \n     on them.\n\n  Hello? Are you listening? Live fetuses should be ensured. It is Dr. \nHern's position that ``practitioners do this without offering a woman \nthe option of fetal demise before abortion in a morally unacceptable \nmanner since they place research before the good of their patients.\n  That is a dirty little secret you are not hearing about.\n  In talking about live births, I said last night on the Senate floor, \nI have worked this issue for 15 years. I have witnessed the birth of my \nthree children. It was the most beautiful thing I will ever experience. \nBut this brief paragraph I am going to read you now is the worst that I \nhave encountered in my lifetime of working on this issue. How anybody \ncan sit anywhere watching and hearing what I am going to say to you now \nand say it is all right to allow this to continue in this country is \nbeyond me. But it happens, and it is\n\n[[Page S12969]]\n\ngoing to happen tomorrow and the next day and the day after that until \nwe stop it.\n  Listen to this from a woman who witnessed this:\n\n       The doctor walked into the lab and set a steel pan on the \n     table. ``Got you some good specimens,'' he said. ``Twins.'' \n     The technician looked down at a pair of perfectly formed 24-\n     week-old fetuses, moving and gasping for air. Except for a \n     few nicks from the surgical tongs that had pulled them out--\n\n  That, my colleagues, could very well be a partial-birth abortion--\n\n     they seemed uninjured. The technician--\n\n  The technician is the buyer of the body parts--\n\n     said, ``Wait a minute, there is something wrong here. They \n     are moving. I don't do this. That's not in my contract.''\n       She watched the doctor take a bottle of sterile water and \n     fill the pan until the water ran up over the babies' mouths \n     and noses. Then she left the room. ``I couldn't watch those \n     fetuses moving, she recalls. That's when I decided it was \n     wrong.''\n\n  If that is not murder, can somebody please tell me what it is? What \nis it? Do you realize what we are doing in this country? We are \naborting and murdering our posterity.\n  Here is a headline from a transcript from a TV station in Columbus, \nOH, April 20, 1999:\n\n       Partial-birth Abortion Baby Survives 3 Hours.\n       A woman 5 months pregnant comes to Women's Medical Center \n     in Dayton, Ohio, to get a partial-birth abortion. During the \n     3 days it takes to have the procedure, she began to have \n     stomach pains and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Within \n     minutes, she was giving birth.\n       Nurse Shelly Lowe in an emergency room at the hospital was \n     shocked when the baby took a gasp of air. [Lowe said] ``I \n     just held her and it really got to me that anybody could do \n     that to a baby . . . I rocked her and talked to her because I \n     felt that no one should die alone.'' The little girl survived \n     3 hours.\n       Mark Lally, Director of Ohio Right to Life believes this is \n     why partial-birth abortions should be banned.\n\n  We have a chance to do it right now, today, ban it, stop it, and we \nare not going to do it because we are going to fail to get three or \nfour people to say enough is enough. How much more can we take?\n\n  Abortion isn't something that just happens early in pregnancy. It \nhappens in all stages of pregnancy. And it is legal under Roe v. Wade. \nSome States have banned them. Give them credit for that.\n  But we have the chance right here. A vote means something for a \nchange around here. This isn't about a budget. It is not about how much \ntaxes you are going to pay. It is not about whether you are going to \nget your Social Security check. It is about life. It is about whether \nor not a baby is going to die tomorrow and another one and another one. \nWe can stop it with three or four votes, if three or four people have \nthe courage to say enough is enough.\n  My God, Jill Stanek, the nurse at Chicago's Christ Hospital, has \nopenly admitted that live births occur at her hospital, live births \nfrom abortions. The hospital staff offers comfort care which amounts to \nholding the child until it dies. There is testimony after testimony of \nit, live birth after live birth. I am not going to go through it all. \nIt is pretty bad.\n  One little quote here:\n\n       ``Once a fetus is born, it's no longer a fetus, it's a \n     child,'' said George Annas, a professor of health law at the \n     Boston University School of Public Health. ``And you have to \n     treat it that way.''\n       Aborting a viable fetus is against the law in most States \n     unless the mother's life or health is in danger. ``If you're \n     not sure, you can't do it,'' Annas said.\n       Nurses at Christ Hospital give ``comfort care'' to the \n     aborted fetuses.\n       ``Their skin is so thin you can see the heart beating \n     through their chest,'' said nurse Jill Stanek. ``It's not \n     like they kick a lot and fight for air. They're weak.''\n\n  This is going on in this industry every day. As I speak, children are \ndying. And we can stop it right here with four of you changing your \nvotes. What is the big deal? You are going to lose a couple of votes \nfrom the abortion industry? Hey, those votes are worth the sacrifice \nfor these children.\n  The ``dreaded complication''--that is what they call it. The \n``dreaded complication''--oh, my God, we have a live child. What are we \ngoing to do?\n  I tell you what they do. They drown them in pans. They leave them in \nlinen closets, gasping for air hours at a time, and sometimes, if there \nis somebody with some compassion in the place, they will hold them in \ntheir arms until they die.\n  This is America--the ``dreaded complication.''\n  You know what some of the abortionists say?\n\n       Reporting abortion live births is like turning yourself in \n     to the IRS for an audit. What is the gain?\n\n  You know: Sure. Hey, we had a live birth here. My goodness, that is \nembarrassing.\n  Now we have come to this; not only do we have a live birth, if we let \nit die, we can sell its body parts, and we can make a fortune that we \ncould not make off the woman because she could not afford to pay me. \nThat is what we are doing.\n  I am going to expose this filthy, disgusting fraud as many times and \nas often as I can. I am going to get the sunshine into this industry. I \nam going to get to the bottom of it; and I am going to stop it, if it \nis the last thing I do. And it may be, but I am going to do it.\n\n       You have to have a feticidal dose of saline solution. It is \n     almost a breach of contract not to. Otherwise what are you \n     going to do? Hand her back a baby that's been aborted and \n     has questionable damage?\n\n  Another one says:\n\n       If a baby is rejected in abortion and lives, then it's a \n     person under the Constitution.\n\n  I witnessed it. Gianna Jessen was aborted. She is now 26, 27 years \nold. I saw her sing ``Amazing Grace'' before 1,000 people 4 or 5 years \nago. She said: I forgive my mother. She made a mistake, and I forgive \nher. But please, help other mothers get through this so what happened \nto me doesn't have to happen to somebody else.\n  Change your votes, colleagues--four of you. Let's once--just one \ntime--let's beat President Clinton on something. He has gotten away \nwith everything--everything. He always wins. We never win against him. \nJust one time, let's override his veto.\n  This guy says:\n\n       I find late abortions pretty heavy weather both for myself \n     and for my patients.\n\n  I guess it is heavy weather; it is real heavy weather.\n  I want to go back to these charts. This is an emotional experience. \nAnybody who can't be passionate on this issue when we are talking about \nthe lives of children--and all we need is four or five votes on the \nfloor of this Senate to stop this killing; that is all we need.\n  Look here. These are the charts. What does it say? NIH, that is where \nthis stuff is going. It is illegal, but it is going there anyway; and \nwe are paying for it.\n  Do you know what it says here? Ten minutes from the fetal cadaver, \nwithin 10 minutes they want it on ice. Nobody could get a cadaver on \nice in 10 minutes--unless it is a live birth or a partial birth. And I \nwill prove it to you.\n  One method of killing children is saline. That has to go into the \namniotic sack and poison the baby. Another one is D, where you chop \nthe child to pieces with an instrument in the womb so it comes out in \nso many pieces the nurse has to assemble them all in a towel to be sure \nall the pieces are there so there is nothing left inside the woman. The \nthird method is one here called digoxin, DIG, where the needle goes \ninto the heart of the baby and dissolves the organs. That is a nice way \nto die.\n  Let me ask you a question. Those of you, those three or four of you \nthat I pray to God will get on this vote, let me ask you a question: If \nyou are buying body parts, and you need one of those body parts to do \nresearch can you take a body part that has been hacked to pieces in the \nD method? No. You know it.\n  Can you take a body part from some baby who has been poisoned with \nsaline or had their tissues dissolved from digoxin? No.\n  There are only two methods left: partial birth and live birth. That \nis where they are getting the tissue. Wake up, America. That is where \nthey are getting the tissue. And here is the proof right here. Here is \nthe work order: ``Please send list of current frozen tissues.'' ``No \ndigoxin donors.'' They are telling them: Give us a live birth. Give us \na partial birth. We don't want any babies like this. We can't use their \norgans.\n  This is happening in America, and I am sick of it. And I am sick of \nlosing\n\n[[Page S12970]]\n\nevery year. ``Prefer no DIG.'' Over and over again, the requests would \nmention the tissue must be fresh. It is over and over again. You see it \neverywhere.\n  Here is another one: Remove specimen and prepare within 15 minutes, \n10 minutes.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is, you cannot get this kind of \ntissue the way they want it without a live birth or partial birth.\n  That is a fact: Dirty little secrets, in a dirty, disgusting industry \nthat is profiting at the expense of women who are in a horrible \nsituation, and then selling the body parts--the ultimate humiliation of \nthis poor aborted child--and we cannot get 4 people, we cannot get 67 \nvotes on the floor of the Senate to override this President. What would \nDaniel Webster, at whose desk I sit, say? What would our founders say? \nWhat would Jefferson say, who said life first, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness? I could go on and on.\n\n  I am going to stop because I am mentally exhausted, to be candid \nabout it. There is sexual abuse of these women. They are lying there on \nthe table, and people are making mocking remarks about their genitalia. \nI could go on and on with stories about it. It is disgusting.\n  I am going to shine the light into this industry, and I am going to \nexpose it. I am going to stop it. If I have to do it myself, I am going \nto stop it. If it is not an amendment, it will be a bill; whatever it \ntakes, it is going to provide for full disclosure. It is going to put \nthe light into those clinics, and we are going to find out about this \nstuff. We are going to stop it.\n  Everything else is regulated in this country. You can't do anything \nwithout the Government being on your back. Then let's put the \nGovernment on the backs of the abortion industry, for crying out loud: \nAny entity that receives human fetal tissue obtained as a result of an \ninduced abortion shall file with the Secretary of HHS a disclosure \nstatement. Let's find out who is buying, who is selling, and what is \nhappening.\n  Oftentimes in these clinics, a young woman comes in; she is pregnant \nand needs an abortion. She is presented with a form, which she is asked \nto sign, that says that her baby can be chopped up and sold.\n  We get two stories out of the abortion industry. They say: Now, look, \nthis woman is in a distraught emotional state. We are here for her \nhealth and safety and her good emotional state. We are not going to put \nthis form in front of her. We will do it after she has the abortion.\n  I hate to give my colleagues the bad news, those of you who support \nthis god-awful procedure, but they want the baby within 10 minutes. So \nunless they are going to wake her up out of whatever state she happens \nto be in, they don't have time to do that then. They do it before. That \nis what they do. They are going to tell you they don't, but they do.\n  Here is some proof for you. The name is changed to protect the \ninnocent.\n  On July 1, 1993, Christy underwent an abortion by--fictitious name--\nJohn Roe. After the procedure, Roe looked up to find Christy pale with \nbluish lips and no pulse, no respiration. Christy's heart had stopped. \nThere are no records that her vital signs were monitored during the \nprocedure. Additionally, Roe was not trained in anesthesia and the \nclinic had no anesthesia emergency equipment or staff trained to handle \nan anesthesia complication. Paramedics were able to restore Christy's \npulse and respiration, but she was left blind and in a permanent \nvegetative state. Today, she requires 24-hour-a-day care and is fed \nthrough a tube in her abdomen. She is not expected to recover and is \nbeing cared for by her family. Christy had an abortion on her 18th \nbirthday. Happy birthday, Christy.\n  Any hospital in America would have had licensed anesthesiologists who \nwere capable of stopping that from happening. But it didn't happen. For \nthose of you who say, well, I guess she must have, she could have \nsigned that card--really? In a vegetative state, you think she signed \nthe permission slip?\n  I have her permission slip here. It was signed on June 29, 1993. Does \nanybody think she signed that in a vegetative state? She was brought in \nthere, and she was told--the language was pretty gruesome in there--\nwhat we can do with your baby after you are finished with the abortion. \nShe signed it. Not only that, she said: I understand I will receive no \ncompensation for consenting to this study. Study? It is a study? It is \nchopping the baby up into God knows how many parts and sending it off \nto some research laboratory. She doesn't get a dime out of it, and they \nmake probably $5,000, when added all up. That is what is happening.\n  I say bring a little sunshine in. I have two options on this \nproposal--one, to offer an amendment to this bill. I want to be honest \nabout it. I don't want to do anything at this point to stop this bill \nfrom passing, nothing, not even this amendment, if that is what it \ntakes. So it will either be an amendment, if we gain votes; if we can't \ngain and we lose votes as a result of it, I will prepare a bill. But I \nwill not stop on this issue. I will not stop until the light shines in \non this disgusting industry.\n  It is amazing. We go after the tobacco people. What bad guys they \nare. Somebody smokes a cigarette, and somehow everybody else is to \nblame but the guy who smokes it. So we go after the tobacco company, \nfine them billions. This is a heck of a lot worse than that. If they \ncan go after the tobacco companies, then we can go after these guys. \nThat is exactly what I am going to do. Be prepared out there because I \nam coming. I am not going to stop until the light shines in on this.\n  I will close with one final plea. Several times on my side of the \naisle I have made a personal appeal to the five or six Republicans who \nrefuse to support the ban on partial-birth abortions. I have asked \nprivately, please change your vote, please change your vote and save \nlives. Two times we voted on this and the President vetoed it, and two \ntimes I couldn't switch those votes. I understand vote switching. I \ndon't like it when I am asked to switch mine. But it is not about the \nbudget and taxes and health care or anything else; it is about life. We \nare going to save lives if four Members change their votes.\n  I make another appeal that I hope, for once, will not fall on deaf \nears: Please consider changing your vote on this bill. Let's pass this \nthing with over 67 votes, so President Clinton can have his little veto \nceremony and we will override it. That is the day I am looking forward \nto in America. And then, whether it is on this bill or some separate \nbill, we are going to shine the light into these abortion clinics. We \nare going to find out what is going on, and the American people will \nknow.\n  So be prepared. If you have any documents to hide, you had better \nhide them. We are coming after you. I have had enough of it. Live \nbirths and partial births, killing children coming into the world, \ndrowning babies in a pan--I have had enough of it. You can defend it, \nif you want to, and go ahead and vote to defend it. Not me. I am coming \nafter you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S12970-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12970-S12972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for yielding the \nfloor. I know he waited a long time yesterday to speak, and I have \nwaited as well. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  I take the opportunity for a few minutes this afternoon to talk about \nan issue of enormous importance to millions of older people and their \nfamilies. Specifically, it is the question of including prescription \ndrug coverage under Medicare for the Nation's older people.\n  There is one, just one, bipartisan bill before the Senate to offer \nthis vital coverage to the Nation's elderly. I have teamed up on this \nbill with Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine because the two of us believe \nit is critical that the Congress address this issue now and address it \non a bipartisan basis. So Senator Snowe and I, in an effort to get this \nissue out of the beltway, beyond Washington, DC, as you can see in the \nposter next to me, are urging that seniors send in copies of their \nprescription drug bills. Just as this poster says, send copies of their \nprescription drug bills to their Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC \n20510.\n  What we are going to do, in an effort to get bipartisan support for \nour legislation, is come to the floor every few days--this is the \nfourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate--and\n\n[[Page S12971]]\n\nread directly from letters we are receiving from the Nation's elderly \npeople. Here is one I just received yesterday from an elderly person in \nCentral Point, OR. She wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Wyden, I write to ask for your support for \n     Medicare coverage of prescription medicine. In my case such \n     coverage is a financial necessity. I suffer from rheumatoid \n     arthritis. My physician recommends that I use medicine to \n     combat it. The only problem I have is that the dosage I \n     require would require an annual outlay in excess of $1,000 \n     a month. I desperately wish I could have the relief Enbrel \n     could give me. Please champion coverage.\n\n  Another letter I received from my home community, from an elderly \nwidow, states that her Social Security is $1,179 a month. Each month, \nfrom that $1,179 check, she spends $179 on the medicine Fosamax, $209 a \nmonth on Prilosec, $112 on Lescol; that is $500 a month, each month, \nfor her prescription medicine from her monthly Social Security check, \nwhich is the only income she has. Almost half of her income goes to pay \nfor her prescription drug bills.\n  Here is a letter I have just received from King City, OR. The writer \nsays:\n\n       I am a constant user of Lovenox inhaler. Two uses per day \n     come to $839. Fortunately, I drove a Chevrolet when my \n     friends were driving Cadillacs, and our family vacation was \n     spent in the U.S. not the South Seas, so I may be able to \n     carry the load at least for a while. My annual cost for this \n     one medicine is $30,600, just about what it would equal to \n     stay in a nursing home.\n\n  These are just a few of the bills that are coming into my office, \ncoming into Senator Snowe's office, and our colleagues' here in the \nSenate as a result of the concern among the Nation's senior citizens \nthat this issue be addressed. I hope we will see that more senior \ncitizens follow just as we say in this poster: ``Send in your \nprescription drug bills.''\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. It uses market forces to \nhold down the cost of medicine. That is the biggest problem, holding \ndown the enormous cost of these medicines. More than 20 percent of the \nNation's senior citizens spend over $1,000 a year out of pocket on \ntheir prescription medicine, and the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill would \nuse a market-oriented approach to address this issue. It is modeled on \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. Our view is, if health care \nis good enough for Members of Congress, we certainly ought to look at \nusing that kind of approach for the Nation's seniors. We call it the \nSPICE bill, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, \nbecause we would cover all of the Nation's older people eligible for \nMedicare. It is absolutely key that we do this now.\n  When people ask, ``Can we afford to cover prescription drugs under \nMedicare?'' my response is: ``We cannot afford not to cover \nprescriptions any longer.'' The reason for that--and I know my \ncolleague currently in the Chair was involved in aging issues when he \nwas in the House and was involved with Social Security, so he is \nfamiliar with this. We know the most important drugs that would be \ncovered under the Snowe-Wyden legislation are preventive drugs. They \nhelp to deal with blood pressure problems and cholesterol problems. \nThey keep people healthy and well, and they keep them fit. That helps \nhold down the cost for what is called Medicare Part A, the acute care \nportion of Medicare that covers hospitals and institutional services. \nUnder the Snowe-Wyden approach, we contain costs without shifting them \nonto the backs of somebody else.\n  One of the things that concerns me, there is a well-meaning bill that \nhas been introduced that suggests we ought to have Medicare buy up all \nthe drugs and act as a buyer for everybody. The problem with that \napproach is that it will result in tremendous cost-shifting onto the \nbacks of other Americans who are having difficulty paying for their \nprescription drug bills. I don't want to see a 27-year-old divorced \nAfrican American woman with two kids, who is working hard, playing by \nthe rules and doing everything she can to get ahead, have to see a big \nincrease in her prescription drug bill because the costs are shifted \nonto her when somebody doesn't think about the implications of trying \nto do this through approaches that don't involve marketplace forces.\n  So these are letters I am receiving from seniors across the country. \nHere is another one from Myrtle Creek, OR. This is a senior citizen who \nhas to take a variety of medicines, including Albuterol, Dulcolax, and \nother drugs. She writes me that she spent $370 recently on prescription \ndrugs from a Social Security check of $1,152. She went to a small \ndrugstore in Myrtle Creek, OR--a terrific small community--and spent \n$370 from a Social Security check of $1,152 on her medicines.\n\n  I think a lot of these seniors are asking themselves, what is it that \nthe Senate is so busy doing that it cannot work in a bipartisan way to \nbe responsive to older people and families on this issue? I am very \nhopeful that if seniors just read what it says in this poster: ``Send \nin your prescription drug bills'' to Senators--Senator Snowe and I are \nparticularly interested in hearing from older people because we want to \ndo this in a bipartisan way. A lot of people think the prescription \ndrug issue is just going to be fodder for the campaign in the year 2000 \nand in the fall of 2000 we will just have the Democrats and Republicans \nslugging it out on the issue. The last time I looked, it was more than \na year until that election comes up.\n  I don't want to see seniors such as the ones I am hearing from in \nMyrtle Creek and King City, and all over the Willamette Valley in my \nhome State--I don't want to see them suffer. I know the Chair doesn't \nwant to see people suffer in Kentucky. Other colleagues feel the same \nway. If we can put down the partisanship for a little while and work \ntogether in an effort to get the vulnerable seniors across this country \nthe coverage they need, we will have a truly lasting legacy from this \nsession of the Senate.\n  I was codirector of the Gray Panthers, a great senior citizens group, \nfor about 7 years before I was elected to the Congress. Some of my most \njoyous memories are working with older people back then. We talked \nabout how important it was to cover prescriptions.\n  Well, what has happened with the evolution of the pharmaceutical \nsector over those 20 years is, prescription drugs have become even more \nimportant since those days when I was codirector of the Gray Panthers; \nthe drugs are even more important now because they do so much to \npromote wellness. We needed them before because you do need medications \nfor so many who are acutely ill. But today, this could result in \nkeeping people healthy and save Medicare, particularly the \ninstitutional part of the program, Part A, that it could save Medicare \nPart A money and we could do it through marketplace forces.\n  Snowe-Wyden doesn't go out and set up a price control regime. We give \nsenior citizens the kind of bargaining power a health maintenance \norganization would have through the marketplace. Seniors would get to \nchoose the various kinds of coverages that are available to Members of \nCongress, such as the President of the Senate and myself. It would not \nbe bureaucratic. We know our health care doesn't create a whole lot of \nnew redtape and bureaucracy. We know it works. So that is what Senator \nSnowe and I are trying to do.\n  This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to \nurge seniors, as this poster says, to send in their prescription drug \nbills. I intend now to come back to the floor of this Senate every few \ndays until this session ends and read, as I have, directly from copies \nof these prescription drug bills I am receiving.\n  I know that so many Senators care about the needs of the elderly. I \nsee Senator Chafee, who has long been an expert in health and a member \nof the Finance Committee; our friend, Senator Mikulski, who has \nchampioned the Older Americans Act issue so passionately for so many \nyears in the Appropriations Committee.\n  When we have these colleagues who have expertise in these issues and \nwe know how acute the need is and we know we can do it in a bipartisan \nway, as Senator Snowe and I have been trying to do, it would be a \ntragedy for the Senate to pass on this issue and say: Well, let's just \nput it off until after the year 2000.\n  We have consulted with senior groups. We have consulted with the \ninsurance industry. We have consulted with those in the pharmaceutical \nsector. All of them have told us that our\n\n[[Page S12972]]\n\nbill, while perhaps not their first choice for how to ensure that \nseniors get their coverage, will work. It will get seniors the help \nthey need, and it will be something that we can do and do now--not \nafter the 2000 election, not after some other period of campaign \nactivity, but it is something we can do now.\n  The Nation's seniors and our families can see as a result of my \nreading from these bills and what I am receiving from Oregon that I am \nvery serious about their input. I hope that seniors and their families, \nas this poster says, will send in their prescription drug bill to their \nSenator. I hope they will be for the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. \nFrankly, I am much more interested in hearing from them about the need \nfor Congress to act. We can act. We can do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S12972-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12972-S12999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VOINOVICH).

Under the previous order, the underlying \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2320), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I voted against the Harkin amendment \nbecause I disagree with the findings stated in the resolution and \nbecause it is not relevant to the underlying bill. However, I would not \nvote to repeal Roe v. Wade, as it stands today, which has left room for \nStates to make reasonable restrictions on late-term abortions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am about to send an amendment to the \ndesk. The purpose of the amendment is a modification of the language \nthat defines what a partial-birth abortion is in S. 1692.\n  The reason for the modification is in direct response to the Eighth \nCircuit decision where the court asserted the procedure defined--it was \na similar definition to the one here--was unconstitutionally vague; \nthat it could have included other forms of abortion and, thereby, was \nan undue burden because it would have eliminated other forms of \nabortion and would have, by doing so, restricted a woman's right \nunduly, according to the court.\n  I am not going to take issue with the court whether they are right or \nwrong. I do not believe they are right, but in response to that, I am \ngoing to be offering an amendment that makes it very clear we are not \ntalking about any other form of abortion; that we are talking about \njust the abortion procedure that has been described over and over about \na baby being delivered outside of the mother, all but the head, and \nthen killed; not a baby that is being killed in utero and a part of the \nbaby's body may be in the birth canal. That is what the court said they \nwere concerned about.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I think I have the language that--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We made a slight modification.\n  Mr. KERREY. The language you gave me earlier said:\n\n       As used in this section, the term ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' means an abortion in which the person performing \n     the abortion deliberately and intentionally delivers through \n     the vagina some portion of an intact living fetus until the \n     fetus is partially outside the body of the mother for the \n     purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will \n     kill the fetus while the fetus is partially outside--\n\n  Any changes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The only change is in the first few words.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask the Senator to respond to me. We had a colloquy \nearlier. I have the Eighth Circuit decision. Earlier all I had was \nopinions on the Eighth Circuit decision from both opponents and \nsupporters of the Senator's legislation. The Eighth Circuit says, \nreferencing the Nebraska statute, which is the concern I have, that it \ndid create an undue burden because, in many instances, it would ban the \nmost common procedure of second-trimester abortions, and that is the \nD You are saying you are drawing it more narrowly so it does not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. Here is the language, I say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, that the court found objectionable, and it sounds awfully \nsimilar to your amended version. I want to give you an opportunity to \ntalk to me about it. It says:\n\n       . . . deliberately and intentionally delivering into the \n     vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion \n     thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the \n     person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn \n     child and does kill the unborn child.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is similar to the language that is in the bill \nright now. But the amended language further specifies the fetus is \npartially outside the body of the mother. The court was concerned about \na D performed in utero, but the baby during this procedure could be \npartially delivered into the birth canal and that occasionally an arm \nor leg or something might be delivered, and that was the confusing part \nfor the court.\n\n  This is clear that the living baby has to be outside of the mother \nbefore the act of killing the baby occurs; that the act of killing the \nbaby is not occurring in utero, but occurring when the baby is outside \nthe mother. I think it pretty well carves out any other form of \nabortion.\n  Mr. KERREY. May I ask him one more question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, ask as many as you like.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will get you the comparative language. Again, I will \nnot give the precise Eighth Circuit compared to yours. You have been on \nthis a lot longer than I have, and I know the Senator from California \nhas as well. Perhaps between the two of you, you can clarify if this \nchange meets the Eighth Circuit's test.\n  I understand that this is one circuit, and you may get--I have voted \nagainst other circuits before when they have had decisions, so there is \ncertainly precedent for me ignoring what a court says.\n  But in the earlier discussion we had, I expressed one of the concerns \nI have. And since we talked earlier, I have talked to an OB/GYN from \nOmaha who does not, in a normal practice, conduct abortions. What she \ndoes is work with women who are pregnant and helps them through their \ndelivery. She is expressing a concern that if she is working with a \nwoman who is having some difficulty, because of the penalties that are \nin here, she finds herself saying: Am I going to be able to do \nsomething that I ordinarily might have done?\n\n[[Page S12973]]\n\n  In other words, you said to me earlier, when I talked about this, \nthat this is for people who intentionally make a decision to go in and \nget an abortion as opposed to somebody, as this doctor described to me, \nwho is not going in for an abortion. I think it is a very important \npoint because the universe consists of people who get abortions but do \nnot want one; they were intending to deliver, and the doctor, for \nmedical reasons, makes this decision, but the woman may prefer that \nthat not have happened. The doctor is making the decision based upon \nlife and health considerations. And you said to me it has to be the \nintent. Where in the bill does it say that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. Do you have the bill in front of you? Page 3, \nlines 9 and 10:\n\n       As used in this section, [the] term ``vaginally delivers a \n     living fetus before killing the fetus'' means deliberately \n     and intentionally delivers into the vagina a living fetus, or \n     a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing \n     a procedure the physician knows will kill the fetus, and \n     [then] kills the fetus.\n\n  So it is----\n  Mr. KERREY. It seems to me that can still easily cover a doctor \nmaking a decision with a woman who does not want an abortion, but the \nabortion is selected by the doctor as a consequence of some \ncomplications occurring.\n  What this doctor said to me was----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If you have some language that could clarify--but if \nyou read the definition, it says:\n\n       . . . means deliberately and intentionally delivers into \n     the vagina a living fetus, or a substantial portion thereof, \n     for the purpose of performing a procedure the physician knows \n     will kill the fetus. . . .\n\n  That is, if you deliver for the purpose of killing the fetus, as this \nsays, as opposed to delivering for the purpose of delivering a live \nbaby where that may go awry and something may happen, and that would \nrequire the killing of a fetus. And that is not covered. I think it is \npretty clear that is not covered.\n  If you have some language that would make you more comfortable with \nthat, it is certainly not our intention--let me make it very clear--to \ncover any case where you have a birth where a complication arises and \nsomething has to be done.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that. I will give that some consideration.\n  I say that I have had a very interesting conversation--both the \nearlier one and subsequent one with this OB-GYN physician in Omaha--\nbecause, again, she is not an abortion doctor. That is not her \npractice.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Right.\n  Mr. KERREY. Her practice is in working with women who either are \npregnant or want to get pregnant; and that is her business.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Has she read this language?\n  Mr. KERREY. I just faxed the language to her, both the amended \nversion and the original version.\n  Again, one of the problems that all of us have--I have two problems: \nOne, as a man, I have difficulty trying to figure all this out; but \nsecondly, as a nonphysician, I have a difficult time figuring it out. \nShe starts talking to me and says: Understand, the cervical arteries \nare at 3 and 9 o'clock.\n  What you are dealing with here is a situation where you can produce \ndamage. You have to be careful not to. In other words, she is saying to \nme: Understand that delivery itself is a life-threatening process--as \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania knows all too well. Delivery itself is a \nlife-threatening process to the mother, and decisions are being made by \nthe physician as to what to do and what not to do. And she is very \nconcerned that this will make it difficult for her to continue her \npractice.\n  As I said, I faxed it to her. And I look forward to further \ncolloquies with the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. I state for the record this is part \nof the legislative history. Obviously, if there is some language that \nmakes you more comfortable, that we need to be more clear here, it is \ncertainly clearly the legislative intent not to include situations \nwhere the baby is in the process of being born and the process of a \nnatural childbirth and a complication arises which forces the doctor to \ndo things that result in the death of the child. That is clearly \noutside the scope of this. It certainly is our intent for it to be \noutside the scope. We think the language here is clear that it is.\n\n  But, again, I would be willing to work with the Senator from Nebraska \nto make sure he is comfortable that that is clearly outside the scope \nof this.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that. I said earlier, when we had our \ncolloquy, that I am comfortable in my position in saying I believe a \nwoman or doctor, physician, should--and her spiritual counselor--be \nmaking this decision. I consider myself to be a pro-choice individual \nas a consequence of that.\n  I supported Medicaid funding because I think it is hypocritical of me \nnot to if I am going to let people who have the means get a legal \nprocedure. But this procedure troubles me. I have voted against you on \na number of occasions. And I have promised people in Nebraska I would \nkeep an open mind. I listened, especially last evening, to your \narguments. And I am willing to keep an open mind on this.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be sending an amendment to the desk, \nwhich the Senator from Nebraska referred to in our colloquy, that \nredefines what a partial-birth abortion is--the definition section of \nthe act.\n  Again, it is in response, as the Senator from Nebraska accurately \npointed out, to the Eighth Circuit's concern about this provision in \nthe bill as being unconstitutionally vague. In other words, it is a \nprovision in the bill that defines the procedure, that the Eighth \nCircuit said could include other procedures.\n  As I described to the Senator from Nebraska, the most common form of \nlate-trimester abortion is a D in which the baby is killed in utero. \nDuring that procedure, occasionally, I am told, a part of the body may \nenter into the birth canal. And the concern of the court, of other \ncourts--not just the Eighth Circuit but other courts--is that the \ndefinition we have in place right now--and the definition states as \nfollows: ``means an abortion in which the person performing the \nabortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the \nfetus and completing the delivery.'' According to the court, it is \nunclear that we are talking about a baby outside the mother.\n  Of course, from the charts we have shown here, we described partial \nbirth as the baby being outside of the mother and then killed. We do \nnot say that in this underlying bill. So the courts have said: Well, it \ncan mean partially delivered; it could be a body part in the birth \ncanal. That could be seen as partially delivered; therefore, overly \nbroad.\n  Again, I think that is, frankly, stretching it to the extremes. But \nbecause of the other sections--again, to address the issue of \nvagueness--we have come up with an alternative definition. It is as \nfollows:\n\n       As used in this section, the term ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' means an abortion in which the person performing \n     the abortion deliberately and intentionally--\n       (A) vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living \n     fetus--\n\n  I underline ``intact living fetus.''\n  Again, with a D, the baby is killed in utero and is not intact or \nliving at the time it is coming through the birth canal, and certainly \nnot intact or living if it is outside the mother.\n  Again:\n\n       . . . vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living \n     fetus until the fetus is partially outside of the mother,--\n\n  ``Intact living . . . outside of the mother''--\n\n     for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person \n     knows will kill the fetus while the fetus is partially \n     outside the body of the mother; and\n       (B) performs the overt act that kills the fetus while the \n     intact living fetus is partially outside the body of the \n     mother.\n\n  So this makes it crystal clear that what we are talking about here is \njust this specific procedure, just a partial-birth abortion, not a D, \nnot any other kind of abortion that occurs in utero. This is an \nabortion where the killing occurs when the baby is intact, outside of \nthe mother.\n  I do not know how there could be any vagueness attached with this \nclarifying definition. I am hopeful that in combination with the other \nconcern the Senator from Nebraska had, which is the intent clause--\nit is section (b)(3) of the bill--again, killing the fetus means \ndeliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living \nfetus or\n\n[[Page S12974]]\n\nsubstantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure \nthe physician knows will kill the fetus, and kills the fetus. You have \nto have intent to kill when you do this. You have to have the baby \noutside of the mother with the intent to kill the baby outside the \nmother, and then do it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator going to send it up and ask unanimous \nconsent to modify?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that we want to get an overall \nagreement. I will hold off until we get all----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to have a chance to discuss what the Senator \nhas done, whenever it is easy for him.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Why don't I suspend right here if the Senator would \nlike to make a comment. I am interested to hear what she has to say, as \nalways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I don't know how this is all going to end, but my side has no problem \nwith the Senator from Pennsylvania changing his legislation in any way \nhe wants to change it. We on our side are not going to object at all. \nHe can change it any way he wants to change it.\n  I will say something very important from our side, and that is, the \nchange he is submitting does nothing at all to meet the health concerns \nof the mother. He is changing a definition, and he doesn't at all say, \nif a woman's health is at stake, this procedure can be used. So if the \nSenator is trying to meet the constitutional objection from the courts \nwhich have thrown out his bill across this country, he doesn't do it \nwith his modification. He still doesn't make an exception for the \nhealth of a woman, and this bill remains a very dangerous bill. It \nmakes no exception for health.\n  Secondly, as I understand it, he still keeps the criminal penalties \nfor the doctors. This caused the American Medical Association to back \noff its support for the bill. That still is a defect because, as the \nSenator from Nebraska said, after speaking to an OB/GYN, who brings \nlife into the world, when these dangerous situations present themselves \nto a physician, they have to make a quick-second judgment on what to do \nto preserve life, to preserve health, to make sure the woman is not \nparalyzed, deformed, made infertile, to make sure the fetus isn't \ninjured. All these things come into play. We don't want to have doctors \nsaying: Just a minute, I have to read Senator Santorum's law.\n  What we want is for the physicians to do what has to be done, do the \nright thing, according to their oath they take when they become \nphysicians. We take an oath of office when we become Senators. We are \nnot physicians. We don't take the Hippocratic oath. When we take the \noath, we swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates of America. We do not get sworn in to be physicians. Physicians \ntake their oath to do no harm. Our oath is to uphold the Constitution. \nAnd to uphold the Constitution, we should be upholding the landmark \ndecision Roe v. Wade, which, by a very slim majority, this Senate says \nit upholds.\n\n  So this so-called fix the Senator from Pennsylvania will be \nsubmitting, which I have no objection to his submitting, still renders \nthe bill unconstitutional because the health of the woman is not \naddressed. Roe says clearly, yes, the State can get involved in the \nright to choose after viability, but you always have to respect the \nhealth of the woman. No such exception.\n  Secondly, I only had a little time to send this new language, because \nwe did not see it until literally less than an hour ago, to the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I want to ask them \nif they believe this new language Senator Santorum is going to place \ninto his bill, in fact, makes the whole issue clearer, whether or not \nit is still vague, vaguely describes a procedure that is used in the \nearlier terms, which is the second reason the courts have struck it \ndown. The way partial-birth abortion is described--and that is a \npolitical term, not a legal term--the courts say applies to all \nabortions, regardless of whether they are in the first month, second, \nthird, fourth, fifth, or sixth. So the court struck it down.\n  This is what Ann Allen, general counsel of the American College of \nOB/GYNs--those 40,000 physicians who bring babies into the world and, \nyes, if things go tragically wrong, may have to resort to this \nprocedure--says:\n\n       Upon review of the attached language . . . in my opinion \n     the language does not correct the constitutional defects of S \n     1692. In particular, this language does not correct the \n     issues addressed by many states and federal courts, including \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which have \n     held similar legislation to be unconstitutional.\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says he is reacting to the Eighth \nCircuit Court. The doctors at the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, through their general counsel, say it does not cure that \nproblem.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record during the \ndebate.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Upon review of the attached language, \n     an amendment to S. 1692, the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \n     of 1999,'' by Senator Rick Santorum, in my opinion the \n     language does not correct the constitutional defects of S. \n     1692. In particular, this language does not correct the \n     issues addressed by many states and federal courts, including \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which have \n     held similar legislation to be unconstitutional.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ann Allen, JD,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a second letter on the new Santorum language from \nthe Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. It was addressed to Senator \nChafee.\n\n       Dear Senator Chafee: You have asked for our advice \n     regarding the significance of new language defining partial-\n     birth abortion in substitution for the prior language. In our \n     opinion, the changes are without legal significance and will \n     not correct the constitutional infirmities of S. 1692. Nor do \n     they limit the prohibition's wide-ranging ban on previability \n     abortion procedures.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Center for Reproductive\n\n\n                                               Law and Policy,\n\n                                                 October 21, 1999.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n                  Re: New Santorum language (S. 1692).\n\n       Dear Senator Chafee: You have asked for our advice \n     regarding the significance of proposed new language defining \n     ``partial-birth abortion,'' in substitution for the prior \n     language of Section 1531(b)(1). In our opinion, the changes \n     are without legal significance and will not correct the \n     constitutional infirmities of S. 1692, the proposed \n     ``partial-birth abortion'' ban. Nor do they limit the \n     prohibition's wide-ranging ban on pre-viability abortion \n     procedures.\n       The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (CRLP), lead \n     counsel in 14 state cases successfully challenging ``partial-\n     birth abortion'' bans including challenges to laws in Iowa, \n     Arkansas, and Nebraska struck down by the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, appreciates the opportunity \n     to comment on this iteration of ``partial-birth'' definition.\n       (1) The proposal continues to preclude any procedure at any \n     gestational age of a pregnancy. Court after court--including \n     the unanimous 8th Circuit--has held that such an approach \n     unduly burdens the right to abortion.\n       (2) The proposal purports to add a requirement of \n     intentionality. Numerous statutes containing similar language \n     (``deliberate'' and ``intention'') have been enjoined, \n     including those in Nebraska, Iowa, New Jersey, Rhode Island, \n     and West Virginia,\n       (3) Similarly the requirement that an ``overt act'' be \n     performed adds nothing. Every abortion procedure requires an \n     ``overt act.''\n       (4) The new Santorum formulation is similar to proposed \n     abortion bans labeled ``infanticide'' in some states. \n     Although the rhetoric is extreme and the images repellant, \n     the fundamental legal prohibition remains the same--and is \n     similarly unconstitutional.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Benshoof,\n       President.\n     Sana F. Shtasel,\n       Washington, DC Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  To sum up my feeling on this and the feeling of those of us who \nactively oppose the Santorum bill, we have no objection to the Senator \namending his bill in this fashion, but we still believe very strongly \nthat it doesn't meet the\n\n[[Page S12975]]\n\nconstitutional arguments. It still doesn't do anything to protect the \nhealth of a woman, and it doesn't do anything to remove criminal \npenalties on physicians.\n  I hope we will get this moving forward. We will amend the bill the \nway the Senator from Pennsylvania wants. I hope we can get to a vote at \nsome point, although I know Senator Smith is still talking about an \namendment. Senator Landrieu has a very important amendment. I hope when \nwe can get this wrapped up, all of those things can be done, perhaps in \nthe next hour or two.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2323\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that the Federal \nGovernment should fully support the economic, educational, and medical \n         requirements of families with special needs children)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2323.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS CONCERNING SPECIAL NEEDS \n                   CHILDREN.\n\n       ((a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) middle income families are particularly hard hit \n     financially when their children are born with special needs;\n       (2) in many cases, parents are forced to stop working in \n     order to attempt to qualify for medicaid coverage for these \n     children;\n       (3) the current system of government support for these \n     children and families is woefully inadequate;\n       (4) as a result, working families are forced to choose \n     between terminating a pregnancy or financial ruin; and\n       (5) government efforts to find an appropriate and \n     constitutional balance regarding the termination of a \n     pregnancy may further exacerbate the difficulty of these \n     families.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Federal Government should fully cover all expenses \n     related to the educational, medical and respite care \n     requirements of families with special needs children.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2323, as modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I send a modified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2323), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS CONCERNING SPECIAL NEEDS \n                   CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) middle income families are particularly hard hit \n     financially when their children are born with special needs;\n       (2) in many cases, parents are forced to stop working in \n     order to attempt to qualify for medicaid coverage for these \n     children;\n       (3) the current system of government support for these \n     children and families is woefully inadequate; and\n       (4) as a result, many families are forced to choose between \n     terminating a pregnancy or financial ruin.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Federal Government should fully cover all expenses \n     related to the educational, medical and respite care \n     requirements of families with special needs children.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, when Justice Blackmun delivered the \nopinion of the Court in Roe v. Wade, which is one of the most \nsignificant decisions--regardless of how one feels about this issue, it \nis one of the most significant decisions rendered by our highest \ncourt--he wrote for the Court the following:\n\n       We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and \n     emotional nature of the abortion controversy, the vigorous \n     opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and \n     seemingly absolute convictions that this subject inspires. \n     One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the \n     raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's \n     attitude toward life and family, and their values and the \n     moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe are all \n     likely to influence and to color one's thinking and \n     conclusions about abortion. In addition, population growth, \n     pollution, poverty and racial overtones tend to complicate, \n     not simplify, the problem.\n\n  Mr. President, he was quite accurate, as we have witnessed on the \nfloor of this Senate in the last few hours a very emotional and tough \ndebate regarding one of the most serious issues I think this body has \never considered in the history of the Congress.\n  Regardless of how one feels about this issue, or the way we vote on \nthese amendments, whether we regard ourselves as pro-life or pro-\nchoice, or somewhere in the middle, the amendment I send to the desk \nand urge my colleagues to vote for and support is an amendment that is \nquite simple. It simply states that all individuals families or who \nfind themselves in a situation of having a child with a birth defect \nwould have their expenses covered--their medical expenses, their \neducational expenses, and the respite care for those families. That is \nso important for the many families who find themselves in the most \ndifficult of situations. At that time in a family's life, there should \nbe no hesitation on the part of this Government to come forward with \nthe money and resources to support that family in this great time of \nneed.\n  So I offer this amendment with great spirit and hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, regardless of how they are going to vote on \nthe final outcome, will understand the merit of this amendment and will \nput this Senate on record as saying we believe all families should have \nassistance when faced with the great challenge and heartache of raising \na child who has been challenged in some special way.\n  So I thank the managers for the time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher amendment. It gets to the heart of the concern for people with \ndisabilities. I think it reflects that we should open our arms to \nunborn children who are faced with disabilities and the difficulties \nthey are going to deal with. I talked about it over and over again--how \nthe debate for this abortion technique to be kept legal centered upon \ndisabled children who were not wanted. There may be a percentage of \nthose cases where abortion is done because of the financial concerns of \nparents in dealing with a disabled child. Those are real concerns and \nthings people think about--whether they can provide a quality of life \nunder the financial constraints of a child who may need a lot of care.\n  So to have an amendment that is a sense of the Congress that we \nshould be open to helping and supporting life and affirming the \ndecision of someone who wants to carry their child to term and accept \nthem the way God has given that child to them is something I think \nCongress should do.\n  So I commend the Senator from Louisiana. I would be willing to accept \nthe amendment, but I understand the Senator would like a recorded vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to be heard on the amendment \nif my friend has finished.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to respond to her remarks about my \namendment, also.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to add my voice on this amendment. I am really \npleased that the Senator from Louisiana has brought this amendment to \nthe floor. It is very important that we make a statement today that the \nchildren of America will be protected, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania said he views this amendment as opening our arms to unborn \nchildren. To me, this is opening our arms to children regardless of \nwhere they come from, so the children born in this country will get \nhelp.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that \nappeared in the Washington Post a couple of weeks ago. Its title is, \n``Study Links Abortion Laws, Aid to Children.'' It says, ``States With \nStricter Rules Are Less Likely To Spend on the Needy.'' That is \nincredible. Legislators stand up and say Roe v. Wade ought to be \noverturned, women should not have a right to choose, and what happens? \n``States with the strongest anti-abortion laws generally are among the\n\n[[Page S12976]]\n\nStates that spend less on needy children and are less likely to \ncriminalize''--this is amazing--``the battering or killing of fetuses \nin pregnant women by a third party. . . .''\n  That doesn't add up. So I think what we are doing today with the \nLandrieu amendment--because I think it is going to get overwhelming \nsupport--is saying whatever side of the aisle we fall into on the \nSantorum amendment--and there are strong differences there--we agree \nwith her sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should fully \ncover all expenses related to the educational, medical, and respite \ncare requirements of families with special needs children.\n  Many times, these children come into the world, and it is anticipated \nby their parents that it will happen, and the parents choose to go \nforward with the pregnancy. Many times, we have children born and it is \na total surprise to parents that they have special needs requirements. \nEither way, any way, however it happens, how could our hearts not go \nout to children in this country with special needs?\n\n  By the way, I would like to engage my friend in a colloquy. Wouldn't \nthis apply to any child--perhaps a child who is 1, 2 or 3--who gets \ninjured in a car accident and suddenly the family finds that they need \nspecial care for the child?\n  My friend isn't just talking about newborn babies. I think she is \nbasically saying all children and all families that have this need \nought to be covered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. The Senator from California is correct. The way \nthat this is drafted is in a broader way because I believe that we have \nto be very sensitive to children with special needs, and their families \nthat sometimes find themselves--even families at a fairly significant \nincome level--in great financial distress. Often one of the parents has \nto quit their job or give up their job to qualify for the woefully \ninadequate. It would be my intention to do that. There would be others \nwith other opinions. But I think it would be important for us to reach \nout to all families with children with special needs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Again, I think it is really important because to have this study come \nout and say that States with the strongest antiabortion laws and want \nto end a woman's right to choose are the weakest in taking care of \nthese children seems to be a horrible contradiction to me. I think what \nmy friend is saying is regardless of our position, my goodness, we \nought to come together when it comes to taking care of our children who \nhave special needs.\n  I thank her. I will be proud to support her amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I cannot support amendment No. 2323, offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. I appreciate \nher concern regarding the devastating financial impact that having a \nspecial-needs child can place on working families.\n  However, I am also mindful of the fact that, as we strive to complete \nour budgetary work, nearly all Members have agreed that we should do so \nwithout using Social Security Trust Fund surpluses or raising taxes. \nDespite the fact that this is a sense of the Congress amendment and \ntherefore has no statutory consequence, I am nevertheless concerned \nwith the unknown financial consequence that a commitment of this \nmagnitude could have. For that reason, I am constrained to oppose the \nLandrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Louisiana if she \nwould be willing to withhold a vote until we have a couple of votes so \nthat we can stack them together a little later in the afternoon. \nSenator Smith has an amendment that I think he would require a vote on. \nSenator Boxer may have an amendment to the Smith amendment. Hopefully, \nwe will be able to work that out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor. \nDoes he yield the floor?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments about my amendment \nand the attempt that I am trying to make to address the constitutional \ninfirmities that the Eighth Circuit found in this language of the \npartial-birth abortion bill. The Arkansas statute is similar to the \nlanguage that is in the bill presently.\n  The Senator from California talked about this not addressing the \nother constitutional issues that the Eighth Circuit brought up.\n  I remind the Senator from California. I am quoting from the case.\n  The district court held the act unconstitutional for three reasons.\n\n       Because it was unconstitutionally vague, because it imposes \n     an undue burden on women seeking abortions, and because it \n     was not adequate to protect the health and lives of women. We \n     agree the act imposes undue burdens on women and therefore \n     hold the act unconstitutional. And because we based it on \n     undue burden grounds as we did in Carhart, we do not decide \n     the vagueness issue or whether the act fails to provide \n     adequate protections.\n\n  The Eighth Circuit did not address that issue. The only circuit court \nthat addressed it, addressed it on the issue that we are addressing \nhere, which is that this could include other procedures, would ban \nother procedures, and as a result it could be unduly burdensome because \nit would eliminate all forms of abortions late in pregnancy.\n  We are making it clear what the court said, and not what some say the \ncourt said. That is what the court said. That is the only circuit court \nto have ruled on the case. Now we have an amendment which clearly deals \nwith the issues of the circuit court which we are concerned about. I \nthink we have cleared that constitutional hurdle.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from California talks about we \nhave to follow the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is the \nissue of partial-birth abortion mentioned, as far as I can see. Nowhere \nin the Constitution is the right to privacy mentioned. Nowhere is it \nmentioned. It is created by the Supreme Court.\n  To be technically correct, the Senator from California should say \nthat we need to follow the Supreme Court, and not the Constitution, \nbecause there is a difference. The Supreme Court has interpreted and \nlegislated rights through their Court decisions. The Senator from \nCalifornia accurately reflects that the law of the land is the high \ncourt. But to suggest we are following the Constitution, which is clear \nabout this issue as far as I am concerned because the Constitution says \nthat we have the right to life. So if the Constitution speaks at all to \nthis issue, it speaks on our side.\n  Again, the law of the land is--I think she would be correct if she \nphrased it that way. We need to comport with the law of the land as the \nCourt has interpreted the Constitution.\n  I would like to get back to my amendment and go through my \nmodification to the bill. I am trying to get my terms correct. It is \nnot going to be an amendment. It will be a modification. I would like \nto get back to the modification of the underlying bill that will \nredefine partial-birth abortion, and again focus on the fact that this \nsolves one of the two issues that are out there with respect to the \nconstitutionality.\n  More importantly, in my mind, it deals with the two issues that I \nthink concern Members of the Senate as to whether to support this bill. \nOne is, is it an undue burden? Do we ban more than what we say we do? \nIf people are concerned whether that is the case, I think we have \nsolved that problem--that if this bill passes no procedure other than \npartial-birth abortion, when the baby is outside of the mom after 20 \nweeks, outside the mother, would otherwise be born alive, and then \nbrutally killed, executed by having a sharp pair of scissors thrust \ninto the base of the skull of the baby and then its brains suctioned \nout. That would be outlawed under this procedure. But no other \nprocedure would.\n\n[[Page S12977]]\n\n  I want to make clear Congress' regard as to what the intent of the \nCongress is. Again, I think the language is amply clear for the court \nto do so.\n  It was interesting that the Senator from California contacted ACOG, \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and on an \nhour's notice, when asked about our amendment, ACOG was able to fax \nback to the floor of the Senate a response objecting to this provision. \nBut those of us who have asked ACOG for 3 years, 3 years, to provide us \na for instance as to when and under what circumstances this procedure \nwould be a preferable or more proper procedure than other abortion \ntechniques, they have yet to respond. It is interesting they can \nrespond in an hour with great specificity about their concerns about \nthis bill, about this modification. But in 3 years they have not been \nable to respond to a very simple question. You state--and they did--\nthat it ``may be'' the best or most appropriate procedure in a \nparticular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of the \nwoman. We have asked for a ``for instance.'' We have asked for that for \ninstance to be peer reviewed, to see whether their suggestion is, in \nfact, an accurate suggestion. In more than 3 years, in three sessions \nof Congress, they have refused to provide an example.\n\n  That, my friends, is the underpinning of the second objection to the \npeople to this bill that it unduly infringes upon the health of the \nmother; that this is medically necessary to preserve the health of the \nmother under Roe v. Wade.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on his criticism of ACOG?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask my friend from Pennsylvania, am I right, he \nis critical of the general counsel of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, who are the doctors in charge of \nwomen's health in this country; he is critical that their general \ncounsel, upon reading his amendment, could determine on its face that \namendment or that modification does not meet the criticism of the \nEighth Circuit Court? Is he critical that the general counsel trusted \nher law degree, her reading of his bill, her understanding of the law, \nto come back with an opinion? It is hard for me to believe that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Please. I know the Senator wants to criticize the \ndoctors, but now he is criticizing the lawyers.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Any reasoned understanding of what I just said would \nlead one to believe I was not criticizing the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists for promptly responding to your \nrequest. I was comparing their swift response to your request to what \ncould whimsically be considered a casual response to my request which \nhas taken now 3 years on the core point, on the core question, as to \nwhether this bill restricts or in any way inhibits the health of the \nmother.\n  Again, I will read their own report: We could identify no \ncircumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to \nsave the life or preserve the health of a woman. Then they go on to say \nit may be best or appropriate in some circumstance, but they give no \nsuch circumstance, no such evidence.\n  This is the only pillar upon which the other side stands, saying it \nis medically necessary.\n  I will read several letters from members of ACOG, fellows in ACOG, \nwho dissect their policy statement and say this second sentence, it may \nbe the best position, is hogwash. That is a medical term--it is \nhogwash.\n  Again, ACOG has not responded to a letter, now in, 2\\1/2\\ years.\n\n       I would like to respond to the January 12th statement of \n     policy issued by the executive board. I am a former abortion \n     provider.\n\n  Let me repeat. This is an obstetrician, a member, a fellow of the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:\n\n       I am a former abortion provider and I would like to take \n     issue with the ``Statement'' for a number of reasons.\n       First, I can think of no ``established obstetric \n     technique'' that ``. . . evacuat(es) the intercranial \n     contents of a living fetus to affect vaginal delivery of a \n     dead but otherwise intact fetus.'' The closest technique that \n     I can imagine is a craniocentesis on a hydrocephalic infant \n     to allow for vaginal delivery. There is no necessity that \n     the infant be killed in this situation, and you must admit \n     that there is a vast difference between craniocentesis for \n     hydrocephaly and suctioning the brain of an otherwise \n     normal infant who would be viable outside the womb.\n       Second, as to the number of abortions performed after 16 \n     weeks, I do not trust the CDC's data on this since abortion \n     statistics are at best, arguable. Abortion industry lobbyist \n     Mr. Ron Fitzsimmons' recent admission of purposely \n     misinforming the media and Congress on the statistical \n     incidence of the procedure and its predominant usage (normal \n     infants) should at a minimum demand an accurate audit of \n     second and third trimester abortions in America. . ..\n       Finally, I'm sure there are many ACOG members who join me \n     in reminding you that your stand on this issue, published as \n     an official policy statement, does not reflect the views of \n     many, if not most, ACOG members. However, the perception of \n     the general public and the media is that you speak for all of \n     us. Please recognize that you have a responsibility to all \n     members of ACOG if not to stay neutral in sensitive areas \n     such as this, to at least issue a disclaimer on such \n     statement that the opinions of ACOG Executive Committee do \n     not reflect those of its members.\n\n  This is signed by three members of ACOG.\n  I can go through another letter of a physician in Northern Virginia \nwho writes in detail, a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, a letter to Senator Torricelli last year:\n\n       My name is Dr. Camilla Hersch. I am a board certified \n     Obstetrician and Gynecologist, a fellow of the American \n     College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in private practice, \n     caring exclusively for the health needs of women for thirteen \n     years. I am also a clinical assistant professor of [OB/GYN] \n     for Georgetown University. I have been involved with teaching \n     medical students and OBGYN residents for fourteen years at \n     two major medical teaching centers.\n\n  Not, by the way, compared to the inventor of partial-birth abortion. \nNot an obstetrician or gynecologist but a family practitioner who does \nabortions. That is who they are defending --a procedure not taught in \nmedical school, not in any of the literature which Senator Frist, Dr. \nFrist, went through in detail last night. His thorough review of all \nthe medical literature on the subject of abortion had not a mention of \nthis procedure.\n  Back to the letter:\n\n       I have delivered over two thousand babies. On a daily basis \n     I treat pregnant women and their babies. In my everyday work \n     I am privileged to participate in the joy of healthy birth \n     and the agony and sorrow of complications in pregnancy which \n     can lead to loss of life or heartbreaking disability.\n       As a member of the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, \n     which now has more than 600 members, I strongly support and \n     applaud the legislative efforts to ban this heinous Partial-\n     Birth Abortion procedure.\n       Many of the members of PHACT, Physicians' Ad Hoc Committee \n     for Truth, hold teaching positions or head departments of \n     obstetrics and gynecology or perinatology at universities and \n     medical centers across the country. To our knowledge, there \n     are no published peer-reviewed safety data regarding the \n     procedure in question. It is not taught as a formally \n     recognized medical procedure. Proponents of partial-birth \n     abortion tout it as the safest method available. Nothing \n     could be further from the truth.  There are in fact several \n     recognized, tested, far safer, recommended methods to \n     empty the uterus when it is medically necessary to do so.\n       There is no data in the accepted standard medical \n     literature that could possibly support any assertion of the \n     appropriateness of this procedure.\n       If you ask most obstetricians or family practice physicians \n     about partial-birth abortion, they will tell they have never \n     seen or heard of such a treatment for any reason in their \n     educational training or practice.\n       Most physicians I have questioned are incredulous that \n     anyone knowledgeable about Obstetrics and Gynecology would \n     ever consider this procedure as any kind of serious \n     suggestion, because it is so obviously dangerous. It has \n     never been proposed or taught as the safest method to empty \n     the uterus and end a pregnancy whether for purely elective \n     reasons for abortion or in those grave instances when it is \n     medically necessary to do so to save the mother's life.\n       Consider the grave danger involved in partial-birth \n     abortion, which usually occurs after the fifth month of \n     pregnancy, even into the last month of pregnancy. A woman's \n     cervix is forcibly dilated over several days. This risks \n     creating an incompetent cervix, a leading cause of subsequent \n     premature delivery. It also risks serious infection, a major \n     cause of subsequent infertility. In the event of a truly life \n     threatening complication of pregnancy, the days of delay \n     involved substantially add to the risk of loss of life of the \n     mother.\n       The abortionist then reaches into the uterus to pull the \n     child feet first out of the mother's body, up to the neck, \n     but leaves the head inside. He then forces scissors through \n     the base of the baby's skull--which remains\n\n[[Page S12978]]\n\n     lodged just within the opening of the forcibly dilated \n     cervix, because the baby's head is larger and of course \n     harder than the remainder of the soft little body.\n       I think it is obvious that for the baby this is a horrible \n     way to die, brutally and painfully killed by having one's \n     head stabbed open and one's brains suctioned out.\n       But for the woman, this is a mortally dangerous and life \n     threatening act.\n       Partial-birth abortion is a partially blind procedure, done \n     by feel, thereby risking direct scissor injury to the \n     mother's uterus and laceration of the cervix or lower uterine \n     segment. Either the scissors or the bony shards or spickules \n     of the baby's perforated and disrupted skull bones can \n     roughly rip into the large blood vessels which supply the \n     lower part of the lush pregnant uterus, resulting in \n     immediate and massive bleeding and the threat of shock, \n     immediate hysterectomy, blood transfusion, and even death to \n     the mother.\n       Portions of the baby's sharp bony skull pieces can remain \n     imbedded in the mother's cervix, setting up a complicated \n     infection as the bony fragments decompose.\n       Think of the emotional agony for the woman, both \n     immediately and for years afterward, who endures this process \n     over a period of several days.\n       None of this nauseating risk is ever necessary, for any \n     reason. Obstetrician-gynecologists like myself across the \n     U.S. regularly treat women whose unborn children suffer the \n     same conditions as those cited by proponents of the \n     procedure.\n       Never is the partial-birth abortion procedure necessary: \n     not for polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid \n     collecting around the baby),\n\nThat is one of the cases given by the other side. Never is a partial-\nbirth abortion procedure necessary--\n\n     not for trisomy (genetic abnormalities characterized by an \n     extra chromosome), not for anencephaly (an abnormality \n     characterized by the absence of the top portion of the baby's \n     brain and skull),\n\nNever is a partial-birth abortion necessary,\n\n     not for hydrocephaly (excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the \n     head),\n\nWater on the brain. Never is partial-birth abortion necessary,\n\n     not for life threatening complications of pregnancy to the \n     mother.\n       Sometimes, as in the case of hydrocephaly, it is first \n     necessary to drain some of the fluid from the baby's head, \n     with a special long needle, to allow safe vaginal delivery. \n     In some cases, when vaginal delivery is not possible, a \n     doctor performs a Cesarean section. But in no case is it \n     necessary or medically advisable to partially deliver an \n     infant through the vagina and then to cruelly kill the \n     infant.\n       The legislation proposed clearly distinguishes the \n     procedure being banned from recognized standard obstetric \n     techniques.\n\nWe are even further clarifying it.\n\n     I must point out, even for those who support abortion for \n     elective or medical reasons at any point in pregnancy, \n     current recognized abortion techniques would be unaffected by \n     the proposed ban.\n       Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at the least \n     seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst so \n     consumed by narrow minded ``abortion-at-any-cost'' activism, \n     to be criminally negligent. This procedure is blatant and \n     cruel infanticide, and must be against the law.\n  Mr. President, I would like to put in place as legislative history \nfor this modification that I will add to the bill a colloquy. Senator \nDeWine is here. We are going to go through a colloquy that will create \nfor the court a clear understanding of what is meant by this amendment.\n  So I yield to the Senator from Ohio for a question.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator. I am looking at the language \nobtained in the modification. I do have some questions concerning some \nof the language that is in there, some of the wording.\n  First, let me ask the sponsor, my colleague from Pennsylvania, what \nis the meaning of the word ``living'' as used in the amendment, as \nwhere it refers to a living fetus?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  In the Michigan partial-birth abortion case, Evans v. Kelly, the \nFederal District Court found that:\n\n     [t]he doctors were . . . unanimous in their understanding of \n     the meaning of the term ``living,'' as used in the statute's \n     definition of a ``partial-birth abortion'': A living fetus \n     means a fetus having a heartbeat.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me also ask, then, what is the meaning of the word \n``intact,'' as used in the amendment where it refers to an ``intact'' \nliving fetus? Intact?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The word ``intact'' is used in this context to refer to \nthe living fetal organism rather than a fetal part that has been \nremoved from a fetus. Because of the use of the word ``intact,'' a \nperson performing a partial-birth abortion would not fall under the \nprohibition that the law provides if, for example, he or she delivers a \ndismembered fetal arm or leg. To fall under the prohibition, the \nabortionist would have to deliver a living fetal body, functioning as \nan organism.\n  The use of the word ``intact'' is not, however, meant to allow the \nkilling of a partially born fetus merely because some nonessential body \npart is missing. An abortionist cannot cut a toe of the fetus off \nbefore partial delivery and then claim in defense that the fetus killed \nafter the partial-birth abortion was not intact.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for that answer.\n  Let me also ask about this. The amendment referred to an ``overt \nact'' that kills the fetus; an ``overt act'' that kills the fetus. I \nwonder if my friend from Pennsylvania could tell us what is meant by \nthe term ``overt act'' in this particular context?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  The term ``overt act'' is used to mean some separate specific act \nthat the abortionist must undertake to deliberately and intentionally \nkill the fetus, other than delivering the fetus into a partial-birth \nposition or causing the fetus to abort. It does not mean the overall \nabortion procedure which typically begins with a living fetus and ends \nwith a dead fetus.\n  Under the amendment, the abortionist must not only deliver the fetus \nin such a way that some portion of the body of the fetus is outside of \nthe mother's body, he or she must also separately and specifically act \nto then kill the fetus while it is in the partially-delivered position, \nfor example, by puncturing the fetal skull or suctioning out the fetal \nbrain.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I again thank my colleague. Let me ask a further \nquestion.\n  Would the bill as amended prohibit the suction curettage abortion \nprocedure?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. The bill would have two elements. First, the fetus \nmust be delivered into the partially delivered position for the purpose \nof performing an overt act that will kill the fetus while it is in the \npartially delivered position. Second, the fetus must actually be \nkilled; that is, it must die while it is in the partially delivered \nposition. Neither of these would happen with the suction curettage. \nRemoval of the dismembered fetal parts entailed in a suction curettage \nis not prohibited because the parts do not constitute an intact living \nfetus. Suction curettage also typically involves dismemberment and \nfetal death in utero, conduct beyond the scope of the bill.\n  In the extremely implausible event that an entire fetus was suctioned \nthrough the cannula and died after removal from the mother's body, then \nthe bill would not apply either, since it requires that the fetus be \nkilled while in a partially delivered position.\n  Even if one argues that a fetus might occasionally die in the cannula \nwhile partially outside the mother's body during the course of a \nsuction curettage procedure, the fetus would not have to be \ndeliberately positioned there for the purpose then of taking a \nseparate, second step to end its life at that point. Nor is any such \nseparate step ever taken. Rather, suction curettage involves a single \ncontinuous suction process that removes the fetus from the uterus \nthrough a cannula and out of the mother's body. The physician could not \nknowingly deliver an intact living fetus into the partially delivered \nposition by this method because he would have no way of knowing that \nthe fetus yet lived at this point when it was partially outside the \nmother's body. The abortionist would, thus, never knowingly cause fetal \ndeath to occur at the partially delivered stage because the physician \nwould never know at what point fetal demise occurred.\n  Even State partial-birth abortion statutes that did not have the \n``fetus partially outside the mother's body'' have been held not to \ngovern suction curettage abortion, and that is the Federal district \ncourt in Virginia and Kentucky.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for that answer.\n  Let me pose an additional question. Would the bill, as amended, \nprohibit the conventional dilation and evacuation abortion procedure \nwhich involves dismemberment of the fetus?\n\n[[Page S12979]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Absolutely not. In the conventional D procedure, the \nintact living fetus is never positioned partly outside the mother's \nbody for the purpose of taking a separate overt act to end its life \nwhile it remains in that position. Moreover, the second step to end \nfetal life in that position is never taken. Also, once a physician has \nbegun performing a conventional D dismemberment, he typically does \nnot know when the fetus dies. Thus, he cannot meet the mens rea \nrequirement of knowingly bringing an intact living fetus partially out \nof the mother for the purpose of performing a separate overt act \nintended to kill the fetus in the partially delivered position.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Again, I thank my colleague for his answer.\n  I pose one additional question. Would the bill, as amended, prohibit \nthe induction abortion procedure?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. Physicians doing inductions never deliberately and \nintentionally deliver an intact living fetus partially outside the \nmother's body for the purpose of pausing to perform an act that they \nknow will kill the fetus while it remains in a partially delivered \nposition before continuing the delivery.\n  It is possible that rarely during an induction abortion, an intact \nliving fetus could be trapped in a partially delivered position with \ncomplete delivery being prevented by entanglement of the umbilical cord \nor the fetal head being lodged in the cervix. In such circumstances, \nthe physician may cut the cord or decompress the skull before \ncompleting delivery without being in violation of the bill because he \ndid not intentionally and deliberately get the fetus in that position \nfor the purpose of killing it while it was in that position.\n  Even State partial-birth abortion statutes that did not have ``fetus \npartially outside the mother's body'' language have been held not to \ngovern induction abortions, and again, Federal district courts in \nVirginia and Kentucky have so ruled.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague very much for those answers.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  The Senator from Nebraska had questions about how this amendment from \na constitutional standpoint would be perceived. This is very clear. \nWith this colloquy, we very clearly address all the different aspects \nof different kinds of abortions which would not be outlawed by this \nprocedure and why they would not be outlawed by this procedure.\n  For those who have suggested--and I know many have suggested--that \nwhat we are about here is the first step to eliminating abortions, I \nagain state for the record that I cannot honestly say we will eliminate \none abortion in this country if we pass this bill. I can honestly say \nthat is not the thrust of what we are trying to accomplish.\n  I have said it once, and I will say it again and again: What we are \ntrying to accomplish is to make sure that in a society where the lines \nare ever blurring, in a society where sensitivity to life may be at an \nall-time low, in a society where the Peter Singers of the world are \nrunning rampant with their talk of being able to kill children if they \nare not perfect after they are born, we need a bright line. And the \nbright line should be that if the child is in the process of being \nborn, you cannot kill the child, you cannot do an abortion where the \nbaby is in the process of being born.\n  That has to be the bright line, except, of course, to save the life \nof the mother. But to deliberately birth the baby for the purpose of \nkilling the baby goes over the line.\n  In closing, I refer to what the Senator from California said when I \nsaid she defends a procedure in which the baby is born all but the \nhead; that under those circumstances you can still kill the baby. But \nif the baby is born head first and all but the foot is still inside the \nmother, when I asked her, can you kill the baby in this circumstance, \nshe said no, ``Absolutely not.''\n  If that is a bright line to anybody in this Chamber, if that is where \nwe want to stand, I will tell you, that is on shifting ground. In fact, \nthat is on quicksand, and pretty soon the Peter Singers of this world \nwho say, ``Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to \nkilling a person. Very often it is not wrong at all''--a professor at \nthe University of Princeton. And you say that is outrageous?\n  Look at the examples the other side has given as reasons to keep this \nprocedure legal. The examples are all about disabled infants. None of \nthem concerns the health of the mother. They all concern a case where \nchildren were going to be born with profound abnormalities, disabled. \nThe argument is, we need to keep this legal because disabled children \nare less entitled to protection than healthy ones.\n  You have heard no example. You will hear no example. You will hear no \nexample of a healthy mother and a healthy child being used to \nlegitimize this procedure. They won't dare do that. Why? Because it \nwould shock you. Yet 90 percent of abortions performed under partial \nbirth are performed on just those cases. What they will use is the \ndisabled child, and the American public, incredibly, to me, will say: \nOK; that's OK; I understand; it's OK; if the child is disabled, of \ncourse you can kill it.\n  If that is what we are thinking, America, if that is a legitimate \nreason to keep this ``safe'' procedure--which, of course, it is not--\nhow far are we from, killing a disabled infant is not morally \nequivalent to killing a person? How far away are we, America? If this \nSenate today upholds, by not passing this bill by a constitutional \nmajority, that logic, then, Dr. Singer, come on down because you are \nnext.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Let me say at the outset, I am so grateful to the younger Senators \nwho have taken up this battle. And they are doing well with it. They \nmay not win, but they are doing the Lord's work as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  I remember, on January 22, 1973--and I had barely arrived in the \nSenate--Jim Buckley and I were sitting right over there, and the clerk \nbrought in a bulletin from the Associated Press announcing the Supreme \nCourt decision in Roe v. Wade. Jim Buckley looked at me, and he said: \nWe've got to fight this. I said: We certainly do. And we did. And we \nare still fighting it--in different ways. He is a Federal judge now, \nand I am a somewhat older Senator.\n  But my respect goes out to the ladies outside who are standing up for \nthe right to life. They will always be dear to me.\n  Mr. President, before I launch into what I want to say, I have \nthought so many times of a beautiful Afro-American lady named Ethel \nWaters, born in Mississippi, the product of a rape. Her mother was much \nbeloved by citizens in that Mississippi town. And they offered to take \ncare of an abortion for her. She said: No. I don't want it. The Lord \nput that child in me, and I want it to be born. The baby turned out to \nbe a girl who grew up to be one of the greatest singers in the history \nof this country. Ethel Waters' name is in all of the musical records as \nbeing a great voice.\n  That brings me up to the point that I want to try to make today, as \nbriefly as possible. The United Nations recently sounded its alert \nbutton to announce what the United Nations described as the arrival of \nthe six-billionth baby born in this world. And the news reports went on \nand on, of course, in great lamentation that the Earth does not produce \nenough resources to handle such population growth, the point being, of \ncourse, that the United Nations crowd does not believe bringing more \nbabies into the world is advisable.\n  If I may be forgiven, I do not regularly agree with the United \nNations, and this is another time when I do not agree.\n  In fact, the spin doctors worked steadily drumming up all manner of \ncontrived environmental statistics to persuade the American people to \nsupport abortion. And those spin doctors, of course, used the term \n``population control''--which is nothing more than a diplomatic way of \npromoting abortion because that is exactly what ``population control'' \nmeans. It means brutally killing innocent unborn babies.\n  Anyone doubting the horrors of population control need only to look \nat Red China, a Communist country, that proudly boasts of its \npopulation control program, a program which forces\n\n[[Page S12980]]\n\npregnant women, who have already given birth to a male child, forces \nthose women to undergo an abortion.\n  Astonishingly, Red China's Premier, Zhu Rongji, boasted that the \nworld had been spared the ``burden'' of 300 million babies as a result \nof Red China's forced-abortion policy.\n  So I think there is no doubt that the ``population control'' spin \ndoctors are, without fail, pro-abortionists with an undying and \nunyielding commitment to the abortion movement.\n  And no matter where it is performed, whether it is in Red China or in \nthe United States, abortion, in any form, is atrocious and wrong. And \nmy critics may come out of their chairs, but they are breaking one of \nthe Ten Commandments.\n\n  That is why I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, for his strength and conviction in standing \nup in defense of countless unborn babies. Rick Santorum's willingness \nto continue to lead the fight on behalf of the passage of the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act is a demonstration of his courage.\n  From the moment the Senate first debated the Partial-Birth Ban Act in \nthe 104th Congress, the extreme pro-abortion groups have sought to \njustify this inhumane, gruesome procedure as necessary to protect the \nhealth of women in a late-term complicated pregnancy. That is what they \nalways say. However, well-known medical doctors, obstetricians, and \ngynecologists have repeatedly rejected this assertion that a partial-\nbirth abortion can be justified for health reasons.\n  Moreover, there is much to be said about the facts surrounding the \nnumber of partial-birth abortions performed every year and the reasons \nthey are performed--or at least the stated reasons. It is difficult to \noverlook the confession of Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, who acknowledged that he \nhimself had deceived the American people on national television about \nthe number and nature of partial-birth abortions. Mr. Fitzsimmons has \nsince then estimated that up to 5,000 partial-birth abortions are \nconducted annually on healthy women, carrying healthy babies--a far cry \nfrom the rhetoric of Washington's pro-abortion groups who have insisted \nthat only 500 partial-birth abortions, as they put it, are performed \nevery year, and only--they say, every time--in extreme medical \ncircumstances.\n  It is time for the Senate, once and for all, to settle this matter \nand pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act with a veto-proof vote and \naffirm the need to rid America of this senseless, brutal form of \nkilling.\n  It is also important to note that the American people recognize the \nmoral significance of this legislation. The majority of Americans agree \nthat the Government must outlaw partial-birth abortion. In fact, in \nrecent years, polls have found as many as 74 percent of Americans want \nthe partial-birth procedure banned.\n  Unfortunately, the American people have to contend with President \nClinton's adamant refusal to condemn this senseless form of killing, \ndespite the public's overwhelming plea to ban it.\n  The President of the United States should have to explain, over and \nover again, to the American people why he will not sign this law. The \nspotlight will no longer shine on the much proclaimed ``right to \nchoose.''\n  I remember vividly the day when the Supreme Court handed down the \ndecision to legalize abortion. As I said earlier, Jim Buckley and I--\nSenator Jim Buckley of New York and I--were sitting side by side \nbecause we were back-bench Senators at that time. Each of us who has \nfought, heart and soul, to undo that damaging decision, understood so \nwell that day that we had yet to see what devastation would come of \nsuch a horrendous rule.\n  Indeed, when you stop to think about it, when the President of the \nUnited States condones the inhumane procedure known as ``partial-birth \nabortion,'' it is clear that our worst fears that January morning are \ncoming true. So it is time, once again, Mr. President, for Members of \nthe Senate to stand up and be counted for or against the most helpless \nhuman beings imaginable, for or against the destruction of innocent \nhuman life in such a repugnant way. Senators are going to have to \nconsider whether an innocent, tiny baby, partially born, just 3 inches \nfrom the protection of the law, has a right to live and to love and to \nbe loved. In my judgment, the Senate absolutely must pass the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act. I pray that it will do it by a great margin, of \nat least the 67 votes to override Bill Clinton's veto.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Modification to S. 1692\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to send a modification of the bill to the desk, the \nmodification of the bill be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Pursuant to the agreement, I send the modification to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is so modified.\n  The modification was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 18 through 21, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b)(1) As used in this section, the term `partial-birth \n     abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing \n     the abortion deliberately and intentioinally--\n       ``(A) vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living \n     fetus until the fetus is partially outside the body of the \n     mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the \n     person knows will kill the fetus while the fetus is partially \n     outside the body or the mother; and\n       ``(B) performs that overt act that kills the fetus while \n     the intact living fetus is partially outside the body of the \n     mother.\n       On page 3, strike lines 8 through 13.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, while I have a few minutes, I want to \ncontinue building the record, not from Rick Santorum, not from other \nSenators who are not experts in the field, but building the record from \nphysicians, obstetricians, and experts who comment directly, fellows of \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an \norganization that the other side uses as defense.\n  Again, this defense is a paper bag that simply needs to be tested. It \nis a facade. It will collapse. It will be punched through.\n  Let me strike a blow. This is a statement of Dr. Don Gambrell, Jr. \nM.D., with the Medical College of Georgia, again, a fellow of the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. He is a clinical \nprofessor of endocrinology and OB/GYN. First sentence right out of the \nblock:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or fertility.\n\n  You have heard several other comments I have made about obstetricians \nwho have said the exact same sentence. Think about who is saying this. \nThis is an expert. We have 600 such physicians. The American college \nitself, who is against this bill, said it is never the only option. So \nthey even agree it is not the only option. What they say is, it may be \npreferred. But they give no case; in 3 years, they have given no case. \nTheir own members say it is never medically indicated--never.\n  He underlined the word ``never.'' This is a doctor at a medical \ncollege. By the way, I have reams of letters here, all from physicians, \nall from obstetricians from all over the country who say the same \nthing.\n  Think about this he is a doctor. For a doctor to say ``never,'' put \nit in writing and stand behind it--in this case, this was submitted as \ntestimony to the House of Representatives in Atlanta, GA--to put this \nin sworn testimony, to be able to stand up and, without flinching, to \nlead off, first sentence, ``never medically necessary.''\n  What do we have on the other side of this medical necessity debate? I \nwill read it one more time. The only factual evidence that supports the \nother side is this statement:\n\n       The select panel could identify no circumstances under \n     which this procedure would be the only option to save the \n     life or preserve the health of the woman.\n\n  They agree with us: Not the only option; it is not an undue burden; \nthere are, in fact, other procedures that can be used that are as safe.\n  But they go on to say, however, it ``may be the best or most \nappropriate procedure.'' It ``may be.''\n  Here is one of their members--by the way, there are at least five, \nsix dozen members, their members, who have written, who have said \n``never,'' letter after letter after letter after letter after letter, \n``never.'' What did they respond to their own members? A deafening \nsilence.\n\n[[Page S12981]]\n\n  Their own members have asked: Give us a for instance. What has been \ntheir response? Nothing.\n  Then we are to defeat a bill based on no evidence and an assertion \nthat it may be, without a shred of evidence to support that ``may be.''\n  We have mountains of evidence, of expert opinion, of specific \nindications, of, as I just read from Dr. Hersh, where she went through \nspecific abnormalities and said, not appropriate, not appropriate, not \nappropriate, not appropriate. Why these abnormalities? Because they \nwere all the abnormalities listed in their anecdotes, in their case \nhistories, that said ``requires'' a partial-birth abortion or is a \npreferable procedure to perform under these circumstances. Again, \nexperts on the record under oath--never.\n\n  Now they go further than that. These people say not only is it never \nmedically indicated, it is contraindicated. It is more dangerous to do \nthis.\n  I want Members to know, when they walk to this floor and vote on this \nbill this time, A, the medical evidence is crystal clear: Never \nmedically necessary to protect the health of the mother. And anybody \nwho walks outside this Chamber and asserts that is doing so against 100 \npercent of the record before us.\n  By the way, that won't stop people. It won't stop anybody. But look \nat the record; look at the facts. Anybody who walks out of here and \nsays, I am opposed to this because it is unconstitutional, it is vague, \nit may cover more of this abortion, and it is an undue burden because \nof that, read the modification that has just been sent to the desk and \nadopted. It is crystal clear that no other abortion is banned by this \nbill now. I don't believe it was before, but if you had any doubt, it \nis not now.\n  Senator DeWine and I entered into a colloquy that specifically listed \ninstances and other abortion techniques used that are not covered by \nthis bill. We explain in legal and medical detail why they are not. We \nsay to the courts, that is not our intention; it is not covered. Here, \nlegally and medically, is why it is not.\n  If you want to walk out here and tell your constituents that you \nvoted against this because we needed to protect the health of the \nmother, ``check strike one, not true.'' You can say it. You might get \naway with it. But it is not true. They don't have a shred of evidence \nto say that it is.\n  They will put up pictures and tell stories about difficult decisions. \nEvery one of those cases have been reviewed and every single one of \nthem, experts in the field, 600 of them have said, not true. You may \nwalk out this door and tell your constituents that I need to vote \nagainst this because it bans other procedures; it would be an undue \nburden; it would prohibit a woman's right to choose. Not true. It does \nnot ban any other procedures. If it conceivably did, by some distortion \nof the words, which is what I think the courts have done, we make it \ncrystal clear. This bill, the new bill, the first time any Member of \nthis Senate will be voting on this particular bill be careful, be \ncareful, because all of the trees you can hide behind in the game of \nabortion politics are being cut down at the base. In fact, there aren't \neven stumps left to hide behind. There is no medical evidence to \nsupport what they suggest. There is no constitutional argument on undue \nburden left with this new bill.\n\n  So if you want to support this procedure, look your constituents in \nthe eye and say: I believe abortion should be done at any time, at any \nplace, in any manner, anyone wants to do it, and that includes 3 inches \nfrom being completely born and being protected by the Constitution. If \nyou want to say that, then you are telling the truth; then you are \nbeing honest.\n  If you want to say anything else, then you are hiding behind what was \na truth. It is gone. There is no protection. You will have to look your \nconstituents in the eye and say: I am not concerned about the dividing \nline between what is protected under our Constitution and what is not; \nI am not concerned that this is a slippery slope, where if the head is \nnot born, you can kill the baby, but if the foot is not born, you \ncan't, and it doesn't concern me at all; it doesn't set a double \nstandard at all; it doesn't cause a problem in our society where a baby \n3 inches away from life can be executed. It doesn't bother me, America. \nI want you to know that, constituents. This doesn't bother me. It \ndoesn't bother me that all of the reasons given by the other side as to \nwhy this procedure should be kept legal are because of disabled \nchildren who were either not going to live long, or live long with a \ndisability.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, not at this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask, how much longer does the Senator plan on \ngoing at this point in the debate?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. A couple of minutes. The Senator from Illinois wants to \nspeak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have not objected to his modification, \nbut I wanted to speak on it. The Senator did it when I was talking \nabout Senator Smith. I would like to have a little time prior to the \nSenator from Illinois to respond to the modification.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So if you want to look your constituents in the eye and \nsay: I am not concerned that we need to draw a bright line, and that \nthe examples being used as to why this procedure should be kept legal--\nand the stories and the cases to legitimize this procedure all involve \ndeformed babies; they all involve babies who were not perfect in \nsomeone's eyes--if you want to look at them and say we need to keep \nthis procedure legal because of these cases, then you need to look them \nin the eye and say: Well, I don't mean what Dr. Singer says, that \nkilling a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a \nperson. But if you say that, then you have to look them in the eye and \nsay: By the way, I want this procedure to be legal to kill healthy \nchildren with healthy mothers because that is how 90 percent of these \nabortions are done.\n  So if you can look in the eyes of constituents and say a 25-week-old \nbaby who is from a healthy mother, a healthy baby, which would \notherwise be born alive, that may in fact be viable, can in fact be \ndelivered, all but the head, its brains punctured and suctioned out, \nand that is OK in America, and that doesn't bother us, and that doesn't \ncreate a slippery slope and create a cultural crisis--if you can look \nin the eyes of your constituents and tell them that, then come down \nhere and vote no. Vote no, and you can do so with a clear conscience; \nyou can do so with a clear conscience as to what you are saying.\n\n  I don't know about other aspects of your clear conscience, but know \nwhat you are doing because anybody who will take the time to read the \nRecord of what happened over the last 2 days will have no doubt as to \nwhat you are doing. I know most folks don't read the Record. But you \nhave, you listened, and your staff listened. You know the facts. You \nknow what is at stake. You know the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we finally have reached a point where the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and I have a strong agreement; we are urging \neverybody to read the record of this debate. I do hope the American \npeople will read the record of this debate, and they will find out who \nstands for the mainstream view on the issue of a woman's right to \nchoose and who stands for the extreme view on a woman's right to \nchoose. The extreme view is overturning Roe v. Wade, which, from 1973, \nhas protected the right of a woman to make a personal, private, moral, \nspiritual decision with her family, her doctor, her God, her advisers.\n  That is the mainstream view in America. That is the law of the land. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania is right that it is the law of the land \nbecause the Supreme Court found a right of privacy in the Constitution \nand said that, yes, women count. We have a right to privacy. So, \nplease, read the record.\n  We voted on the issue of Roe v. Wade and by a thin, small margin--the \nvote was 51-48--we said don't overturn Roe. That is a dangerous vote. \nForty-eight Members of this body want to criminalize abortion, make it \nillegal, go back to the days when women died--5,000 women a year. This \nis the first time this Senate in history has ever voted on that \nlandmark decision, and 48 Senators don't trust women; 48 Senators want \nto tell women what to do in\n\n[[Page S12982]]\n\na personal, private, religious, moral decision.\n  So, yes, I do hope the people of this country will read the Record \nbecause the Record is complete on this issue. We heard from the other \nside that we don't care about Roe v. Wade; we are not going to overturn \nit. We don't want to do anything about it. We just want to talk about \nthis one procedure. And many of us on this side of the aisle said it is \na smokescreen, and we tested it today. What did we find out? The \nleaders of this ban, which has been called unconstitutional by 19 \ncourts, also voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  I hope the families of America read this Record. It is very clear \nabout who stands where. Let me tell you the difference between the two \nsides. It is not so much about how we feel on the issue because that is \na personal matter. I have given birth to children--the greatest joy in \nmy life. I have a grandson--a new joy in my life. I have one view; the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has another. Let me tell you the difference. \nIt is who decides. I respect the right of the Senator from Pennsylvania \nto make that decision by himself with his wife, with his family. He \ndoes not respect my right, or your right, or the right of anyone in \nAmerica to be trusted to make that decision. He wants to tell you what \nto do. I didn't think we were elected to play God or to play doctor. I \nthought we were elected to be Senators. I thought we were elected to \nuphold the Constitution and the laws of the land.\n\n  Yes, this Record is full. It is important. It ought to be reflected \nupon. Our votes ought to be scrutinized. I agree with the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Every word that was spoken here ought to be looked at. \nEvery single time we engage in a conversation ought to be reviewed. I \nthink it is important.\n  I also think it is important to understand that this modification \nthat was sent to the desk--we had no objection to the Senator from \nPennsylvania rewriting his law. That is his right. I don't have a \nproblem with it. It does not do what the Senator from Pennsylvania says \nit does. The Senator from Pennsylvania says his new language addresses \nthe objection of the Eighth Circuit and of the other courts that have \nruled on his law that has been enacted in many States as \nunconstitutional on its face.\n  In the short period of time we have had to send out his new language, \nwe have heard from the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. The \nletter is in the Record. It says:\n\n       The proposal continues to preclude any procedure at any \n     gestational age of a pregnancy. Court after court--including \n     the unanimous Eighth Circuit--has held that such an approach \n     unduly burdens the right to abortion.\n\n  That is the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.\n  The general counsel of the Association of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the very group that deals with bringing life into the \nworld, the very group of doctors we go to when we are ready to have our \nfamilies and to help us have our families, says about this new \nlanguage, upon review of it, that the language does not address the \nissues addressed by many States and Federal courts, including the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n  The Senator may say he has met constitutional objections. But those \nwho deal with this law, who deal with it every day, say it does not.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Northwestern University\n\n\n                                               Medical School,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, October 21, 1999.\n       I have reviewed Senator Santorum's amendment. It would \n     apply to all second trimester procedures. It does not narrow \n     the definition of the so-called ``Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban'' Act. It would effectively ban the safest and most \n     common form of second trimester abortions.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                Marilynn C. Frederiksen, M.D.,\n\n                                              Associate Professor,\n                                        Obstetrics and Gynecology,\n\n                          Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this letter is from Northwestern \nUniversity Medical School signed by Marilynn Frederiksen, M.D., \nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who says:\n\n       I have reviewed Senator Santorum's amendment. It would \n     apply to all second trimester procedures. It does not narrow \n     the definition . . . [and] would effectively ban the safest \n     and most common form of second trimester abortions.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, if you were looking for a fix on the \nconstitutionality, it isn't here.\n  Again, I repeat that if you believe in the Constitution, if you \nbelieve in the right of privacy, and if you believe in following court \nprecedent, a woman's health must always be protected. Under this law, \nas modified, the woman's health isn't even mentioned.\n  It is possible she could be paralyzed. All kinds of horrible things \ncould happen. She could be made infertile. And, yet, no exception.\n  We have another letter that I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: In response to the current Senate floor \n     debate on the so-called ``partial birth abortion'' ban, I \n     would like to clarify that there are rare occasions when \n     Intact D & X is the most appropriate procedure. In these \n     instances, it is medically necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Stanley Zinberg, MD,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                     Clinical Practice Activities.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this letter is from Stanley Zinberg, vice \npresident, clinical practices, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecology. This is a new letter:\n\n       . . . I would like to clarify that there are rare occasions \n     when intact D is the most appropriate procedure. In these \n     instances, it is medically necessary.\n\n  The very words that some Senators said were not present in this \ndebate are suddenly present in this letter. The doctors are telling us \nthat the procedure that many Senators are voting to ban without making \na health exception is medically necessary on certain occasions.\n  I will conclude with these remarks in the next few minutes by \naddressing something that has been very upsetting to me as a human \nbeing. Forget that I am a Senator. We have heard from people who would \nhave to go through this procedure a series of stories that could break \nyour heart. They decided, because they believed it was in their best \ninterests, in the best interests of the fetus they were carrying, and \nin the best interests of their families, they decided after consulting \ntheir spiritual counselors that it was the right thing to do for their \nfamilies.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania wants to outlaw this option, this \nchoice. But, worse than that, he calls these stories anecdotes. He \nsays: Do not listen to anecdotes. But yet he cites his own experience \nand doesn't call it an anecdote. He calls it a tragedy. I have to say I \nhope we would apply the same kind of language to all Americans as we do \nto our own families.\n  These are stories. Let me share some with you.\n  Tiffany Benjamin: Genetic tests revealed that her child had an extra \nchromosome. Doctors advised her that her condition was lethal. No one \ncould offer hope. They determined the most merciful decision for their \nchild and the family would be to terminate the pregnancy. She says, \n``Although three years have passed for us, the depth of our loss is \nvivid in our minds.'' She says to every Senator who would outlaw this \nprocedure, ``We are astounded that anyone could believe that this type \nof decision is made irresponsibly and without a great deal of soul \nsearching and anguish. These choices were the most painful of our \nlives.''\n  Is that an anecdote? That is a true life experience of a woman who \nsays to us, please don't ban a procedure that is medically necessary.\n  Coreen Costello, a registered Republican, describes herself as very \nconservative. She made it clear that she is opposed to abortion. She \nwas 7 months pregnant in 1995 with her third child. She was rushed to \nthe emergency\n\n[[Page S12983]]\n\nroom, and an ultrasound showed something seriously wrong. The baby had \na deadly neurological disorder, had been unable to move inside her womb \nfor 2 months. She goes on. The doctors told Coreen and her husband that \nthe baby was not going to survive, and they recommended terminating the \npregnancy. The Costellos say this isn't an option for us: ``I want to \ngo into labor.'' She said: ``I want my baby to be born on God's time. I \ndid not want to interfere.''\n  They went from expert to expert. And the experts told her labor was \nnot an option. They considered a cesarean section. But the doctors said \nthe health risks were too great. In the end, they followed the doctor's \nrecommendation and Coreen had an abortion. She says now they have three \nhappy, healthy children, and she since then has had a fourth.\n  She writes to us: ``This would not have been possible without the \nprocedure.'' She says please give other women and their families this \nchance. Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary \ninterference from the Government. Leave us with our God. Leave us with \nour families. Leave us with our trusted medical experts.\n  I could go on and on with these stories, these real-life tragedies. \nThey are not anecdotes. They are not stories that are made up. They are \nnot rumors. They are real people who have gone through this. I daresay \nwe ought to listen because they are people who count. They are telling \nus to stay out of their private lives. Stay out. If anyone wants to \nmake a decision about their family, please, that is their right. I \nwould do anything in my power to fight for anybody's right not to have \nan abortion if that is their choice. I am as strongly for that.\n\n  However, I think it is an insult, an indignity, a slap in the face of \nthe women and the families of this Nation for government to tell them \nwhat to do in these tragic moments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have heard on this floor that there \nhaven't been any of these late-term abortions performed by doctors or \nperformed in hospitals. The Senator has been diligent on the floor of \nthe Senate in these last days in making sure women's rights are \nprotected. It has been a tough fight. I wonder, to the Senator's \nknowledge, is it true these late-term abortions have been done \nexclusively outside of hospitals by nonobstetricians, by nonphysicians? \nDoes the Senator have that kind of information?\n  I had a chance to speak to Ms. Koster, portrayed in the photograph, a \nwoman very happy with her decision to have an abortion in late term. By \nthe way, this is not an unreligious person or not a person we could \naccuse of immorality. She insisted and told me she had obstetricians \nand she had it performed in a hospital, as I remember, in Iowa.\n  Is the Senator familiar with that situation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, and I want to say in my State we have a law. A \nprocedure done in the late term must be done inside a hospital.\n  We have received a letter from the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists who work in hospitals all over this country and have \nsaid this procedure that the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to ban is, \nin certain instances, medically necessary.\n  We have the most prestigious group of doctors from the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists saying banning this \nprocedure is dangerous. That, in fact, even with the changes that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania made, it is so broadly worded it allows most \nabortions. There is still no health exception.\n  My friend is absolutely right. These procedures, and abortions in \ngeneral, are done by physicians.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My most recent grandchild was delivered 1 week ago, a \nlarge baby. My daughter is very active athletically. She produced a 9-\npound, 7-ounce baby girl, larger than the two brothers who preceded \nher.\n  I also have two other daughters, each of whom has two children; one \ndaughter carried a fetus for almost 8 months and something happened. \nShe called me and said: Daddy, I've got bad news. The baby got caught \nin the cord and apparently choked to death. She wasn't feeling a \nheartbeat when she went to the doctor. Nothing hurt me more, nothing \nhurt her more.\n  We are not the kind of family that casually looks at abortion and \nsays everybody ought to have one. This is the right of privacy, is it \nnot?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is absolutely about the right to privacy and respect \nof the woman and her family.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator find women's organizations coming \nforward about outlawing this procedure? Does it make sense in any way \nto protect women who have an unfortunate condition or whose health is \nin danger in the late term in their pregnancy?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Anyone who believes in the basic right to choose and the \nbasic decision in Roe, which protected a woman's health, is opposed to \nthis Santorum bill.\n  Let me read into the record a few groups, and I will not even name \nwomen's groups; I will name other groups: The American Public Health \nAssociation opposes this bill; the American Medical Women's Association \nopposes this bill; the American Nurses Association opposes this bill; \nthe Society for Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health opposes \nthis bill; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nopposes this bill; and the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice \nopposes this bill.\n\n  I say to my friend, women's groups who support a woman's right to \nchoose see this as chipping away at the right of a woman to make a \ndecision with her God and her doctor and her conscience. They oppose it \nas well as the medical and religious groups.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I inquire as to the Senator's response, if this is an \nattempt to establish the moral platitudes around which this country \nshould operate--and that is fortified in my view by the fact that while \nwe ignore the opportunity to protect a born child 15 or 10 years old in \nschool, we are unwilling to pay attention to the mother's plea in that \ncase to protect the child; but we hear the National Rifle Association's \nvoice.\n  Does the Senator see a born child, a child going to school, a child \nwalking in the neighborhood, a child at play, as being as protected as \nthe definition that we want to exert here on a woman whose pregnancy is \nin a late term, and a doctor and she agree that it is an appropriate \nthing to do? Does the Senator see some kind of conflict here? Or \nperhaps even hypocrisy? The Senator ought to correct me if I am wrong \nbecause I don't want to be wrong about this.\n  As I remember, those who are presently so strongly advocating \nremoving the right of a woman to make a decision, vote against gun \ncontrol measures that we have when it comes to protecting children. \nDoes the Senator see the same question raised that I see?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The irony of this issue is right there. I say that the \nleading voices in this Chamber on this issue are the same voices that \nwe hear against any type of sensible laws to protect our children that \ndeal with gun violence.\n  Interestingly, in my State, gunshots are the leading cause of death \namong children. It is a supreme irony.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the Senator aware that 13 kids a day are killed by \ngunfire in this country, over 4,500 children a year are killed by \ngunfire? Children who are alive, working, and with their families, \nexchanging love with their parents, brothers and sisters. Is the \nSenator aware that 13 children every day in this country are killed by \ngunfire because we lack control over that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am aware and it is a tragedy.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Where does the Senator think we are in terms of \nsaying to women, you can't make a choice on your own; you don't have \nthe moral rectitude to go ahead and make this decision, even though you \nand your doctor agree and there is some risk to the mother's health in \ncarrying this pregnancy.\n  We can't even get an exception to that. Am I right in that \ninterpretation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. No exception for health.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It reverts back to wanting to control other people's \ndestinies, other people's decisions by a few other-than-experts in this \nbody on pregnancy, and the health care necessary to attend to that.\n\n[[Page S12984]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right. There is not one obstetrician or \ngynecologist in this Senate, yet we see the pictures used, the cartoon \nfigures of a woman's body--which I find rather offensive. The bottom \nline is, we were not elected to be doctors, but we were elected, it \nseems to me, to be tough on crime and to stop crime and to do what it \ntakes to protect our citizens.\n  My friend from New Jersey has been a leading voice in that whole \narea. I do not know how many months it has been since the Vice \nPresident broke the tie there, when my friend had a very important \namendment up to close the gun show loophole so people who are mentally \nunbalanced and people who are criminals can no longer get guns at a gun \nshow to shoot up kids and shoot up a school.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator has mentioned we have drawings on the \nfloor, of the horror that is involved in performing a surgical \nprocedure. Aren't surgical procedures generally unpleasant to witness?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I once saw an appendix removed and saw a couple of \npeople around me faint. It is never pretty, but it is done for a \npurpose. When a lung is removed, or a colon is removed, it is never a \nbeautiful procedure. But the fact is, the person for whom the procedure \nis done often is in better health afterward.\n  Has the Senator ever seen pictures of the kids jumping out of the \nwindows at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I say to my friend, I think those are images that \nare in everybody's mind.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. They are not drawings.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They are real TV images of children escaping gun \nviolence.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know the Senator's home State is California. Did \nthe Senator see the picture of the tiny children being led hand-in-hand \nby policemen and others trying to protect them from gunfire?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, my friend is evoking images I don't think anyone \nin America will ever forget, of those children grasping the hands of \nthose policemen in the hopes of being saved.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Did the Senator see the pictures from, I believe the \ncity was Fort Worth, TX, of those young people praying together, \nreaching out to God?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Trying to correct what imbalances they saw in life. \nDid the Senator see the pictures of those people?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I saw the horror, yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Did you see them crying and holding each other?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Can the Senator tell me why it is we refused to \nidentify those buyers of guns at gun shows here? In a vote we had here? \nWe finally eked out a vote, 51-50, that said we should not have it. But \nour friends on the Republican side in the House dropped it out of the \njuvenile justice bill, and we do not see it here.\n  Can the Senator possibly give me her description of what might be the \nlogic there, as those on the other side want to take away the right of \nwomen to make a decision that affects their health and their well-being \nand their families' well-being?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I can only say to my friend, we see an enormous amount of \npassion, which I think, in the end, puts women in danger. It goes \nagainst the basic right of privacy and the basic dignity of women and \ntheir families in their to make a personal decision. We see a lot of \nemotion to end those rights. But we do not see the same intensity of \nemotion--we do not even get the votes of those people--to make sure our \nchildren who are living beings, who are going to school, have the \nprotection they deserve to have.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the Senator aware, because we serve on \nthe environment committee together, of the threat to children's health \nthat is resulting from the contamination of our air quality?\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I have authored a bill called the Children's \nEnvironmental Protection Act which would, in fact, strengthen our laws. \nThere are very few cosponsors, I might add, from the other side of the \naisle. But it is a good law and would protect our children from \nhazardous waste and toxic waste and make sure our standards are \nelevated, because, when a child breathes in dirty air and soot and \nsmog, et cetera, it has a much worse impact than it does on a full-\ngrown adult.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Has the Senator seen the recent news reports about \nchildren, the numbers of children increasingly becoming asthmatic, as a \nresult?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I have.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a daughter who is my third daughter. She is a \nsuperb athlete. She suffers from asthma. It is a very painful thing to \nwitness.\n  My sister was a board member at a school in Rye, NY, a school board \nin Rye, NY. She was subject to asthmatic attacks. One night at a school \nboard meeting--she carried a little machine she would plug into the \ncigarette lighter in the car to help her breathe--she felt an attack \ncoming on and she tried to get to her car and she didn't make it. She \ncollapsed in the parking lot, went into a coma, and 2 days later had \ndied.\n  I have a grandson who has asthma and I have a daughter who has \nasthma.\n  Does the Senator remember anything that got support from the other \nside to protect lives by adding to the cleansing of our environment by \ngetting rid of the Superfund sites, the toxic sites around which \nchildren play and from which they get sick? Does the Senator recall any \nhelp we got to protect those children? No. No. No. What we got was a \ndenial.\n  But, heaven forbid a woman should make a decision to protect her \nhealth for the rest of her children, or her health for her family, or \nto continue to be a mother to her other children. Does the Senator \nrecall any similar passion or zeal on those issues when we went up to \nvote here?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I do not.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Well, I thank the Senator because of her courage in \nstanding up against what I consider an onslaught against the lives and \nwell-being of women by those men who would stand here primarily and \nsay: No, Madam, you can't do that because according to my moral \nstandard you are wrong.\n  But the Senator does recall, as I do, when we had votes to protect \nchildren from gunfire or protect children from a contaminated \nenvironment, the votes were not there from that side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is correct. I want to say his series of \nquestions and comments have moved me greatly. I consider him a great \nSenator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is very kind.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I only wish he would stay here longer than he plans.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the Senator aware I have been a protector of \nchildren's health by raising the drinking age to 21?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator know we saved 14,000 children, \n14,000 families from having to mourn the loss of a little child or \nyoungster in school?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator knows I tried to take away guns from \nspousal and child abusers, and succeeded by attaching an amendment to a \nbudget bill that had to get through, that was signed over the \nobjections of our friends on the other side--\n  Mrs. BOXER. I recall.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Almost unanimously. So I think the Senator, as she \nsaid, knows I have credentials in terms of wanting to protect the \nchildren in our society.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Frankly, that is my main mission in being here.\n  So I conclude my questions by asking the Senator if she will continue \nto fight no matter what is said--anecdotally, hypocritically, falsely \nin some cases--will she continue to fight this fight for the women of \nAmerica?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he has asked me if I will continue to \nfight for the women of America. The answer is yes. I believe while I \nfight for them, I am fighting for their families, for the people who \nlove them, their fathers, their mothers, their grandfathers, their \ngrandmothers, and their children.\n  I think underlying all this debate is that basic difference between \nmyself and the Senator from Pennsylvania; between the Senator from New \nJersey and the other Senators on the other\n\n[[Page S12985]]\n\nside of the aisle. I think it is about basic respect of the women and \nthe families of this Nation.\n  In concluding my remarks, because I know the Senator from Illinois \nhas been waiting very patiently, I will conclude with a quote from \nthree Justices. I ask my friend from New Jersey to once more listen to \ntheir words.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will hear them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I heard them yesterday. He said to me how touched he was \nby them. I think it would be suitable to quote them again, reminding \neveryone these are three Republican Justices of the Supreme Court.\n  In their decision upholding Roe v. Wade, this is what they said:\n\n       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own \n     concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the \n     mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not \n     define the attributes of personhood were they formed under \n     compulsion of the State.\n\n  The Senator from New Jersey and I and those of us in this body who \nvoted today to uphold Roe, and many of us who will vote against the \nSantorum bill, believe the State must not, should not be able to tell \npeople in this country how to think, what to believe, and especially \nwhat to do for themselves and their families when it comes to a medical \nprocedure.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I again appreciate the indulgence of the \nSenator from Illinois who has been incredibly patient now for 50 \nminutes.\n  Let me make a couple points first to the Senator from California. She \nseems to object to the term ``anecdote'' in referring to the cases that \nwere brought here. I looked up the word ``anecdote'' in the dictionary \nright at the leader's desk, the Standard College Dictionary.\n\n       Anecdote: A brief account of some incident; a short \n     narrative of an interesting nature.\n\n  I will put it over here and share it with the Senator from \nCalifornia, and if she finds that to be an offensive word in describing \nwhat she has presented, I think we have gotten rather touchy.\n  The Senators from New Jersey and California mentioned that the \nleading cause of death in California is gun violence among children. \nWrong. The leading cause of death in California among children is \nabortion. The Senator from New Jersey said 13 children a day die of gun \nviolence. Mr. President, 4,000 children a day die from abortions--4,000 \nchildren die a day--that some say they want legal, safe, and ``rare,'' \n4,000 a day.\n  The Senator from New Jersey equates the medical procedure of partial-\nbirth abortion to the equivalent of an appendectomy. That is not an \nappendix, I say to my colleagues.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is not a blob of tissue. That is a living human \nbeing.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Did the Senator hear me say that I compared an \nabortion to a surgical procedure? Might I offer a correction to our \ncolleague from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I hope the Senator will.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I said surgical procedures are never pretty. I did \nnot say abortions and appendectomies are the same thing. Don't distort \nthe Record, if the Senator will oblige me.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think the Record speaks for itself.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California suggested this in her \nopening comments: Banning this procedure of taking a child who would \notherwise be born alive, taking it outside of the mother and killing \nthe child is an extreme view; banning this procedure is an extreme view \nin America.\n  Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? This now defines ``extreme.'' \nKilling a child, a living being outside of its mother is now an extreme \nview in America. The mainstream view, according to the Senator from \nCalifornia, is the mother has the absolute, irrefutable right to \ndestroy her child at any point in time for whatever reason. That is the \nmainstream view in America.\n  Our Nation turns its eyes to you, Joe. That is the mainstream view in \nAmerica. So welcome to America; welcome to America 1999. Welcome to an \nAmerica with which Peter Singer, the new prophet of America, who is \nfrom Australia, will feel most comfortable; Peter Singer, the \nphilosopher who writes:\n\n       Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to \n     killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.\n\n  Welcome to America 1999 because this is killing an infant, and the \nreason given is because it is not perfect, and they say it is not \nmorally wrong. And by the way, who are we to judge? Why is murder wrong \nif it is not morally wrong? Is it because we have a number of votes \nthat ban murder? Is that the only reason, because the majority says we \nthink murder is wrong? Not morally wrong because we can't make moral \njudgments; God forbid we make a moral judgment on the floor of the \nSenate. Oh, no, who am I to tell you that murder is wrong? I mean, how \ndare me. How can you tell me that murdering someone is wrong if it is \nnot based on some moral judgment?\n  So, please, don't come down here and say I have no right to impose \nmoral judgments. We do it every day in the Senate. How many speeches do \nI hear that it is immoral not to provide health insurance? That is \nimmoral, this isn't. That is immoral and this isn't.\n  We can't judge anybody. We can't say that taking a child almost born \noutside of the mother, 3 inches from legal protection, and killing that \nbaby in a barbaric fashion, we can't say that is wrong because that \nwould be judging somebody else; we can't judge anybody here. Who are we \nto judge anybody?\n  Welcome to America 1999. Welcome to the mainstream America 1999. \nWelcome to the Peter Singers of the world. Read the New Yorker \nSeptember 6 issue. Read it when he says:\n\n       If a pregnant woman has inconclusive results from \n     amniocentesis, Singer doesn't see why she shouldn't carry the \n     fetus to term. Then, if the baby is severely disabled and the \n     parents prefer to kill it, they should be allowed to. That \n     way there would be fewer needless abortions and more healthy \n     babies.\n\n  Welcome to America because here you can find out if the baby is \nhealthy or not. If you want to kill it, you can. If not, you can \ndeliver it. Welcome to Peter Singer's world.\n  And you are not concerned about the lines drawn in America? You are \nnot concerned we need to a have a bright line to prevent the Columbines \nin the future? When the Senator from California reads the Casey \ndecision, doesn't she see Columbine in the Casey decision? What does \nthe Casey decision say that she so proudly stands behind? ``At the \nheart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, \nof meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. . .''\n  A young boy in Littleton, CO, said the same thing just before he shot \n13 people. He said: What I say goes; I am the law.\n  This is what the Casey decision says. It says each one of us has the \nright to determine our own reality. We are the law. We can do whatever \nwe want to do.\n  God help us. God help us if that is the law of the land. God protect \nus, if that is the law of the land, from predators who think they can \ndo whatever they want to do to us because they are the law; they can \ndefine their own meaning of existence. They can define their own \nmeaning of the universe. They can define their own meaning of human \nlife. God help us.\n  And where does this decision come from? It comes from the poisonous \nwell of keeping procedures like this legal. Drink from it, America. \nDrink from it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2324 to Amendment No. 2323\n\n   (Purpose: to provide for certain disclosures and limitations with \n           respect to the transference of human fetal tissue)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send a second-degree \namendment to the pending amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2324 to amendment No. 2323.\n\n\n[[Page S12986]]\n\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the Landrieu amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity to be \nheard.\n  Mr. President, listening to my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, I thought back to earlier this year. We had \nan issue on which we agreed; in fact, we have had a few this year. This \nisn't one of them, however.\n  But earlier this year, Senator Boxer was very concerned about the \ninhumane treatment of dolphins who are getting caught in tuna fishing \nnets. In fact, she spoke so eloquently on the cruel and inhumane \ntreatment of dolphins that I distinctly remember during that debate, I \ncalled home to see how my family was doing, and my 7-year-old boy \nanswered the phone, and he said to me: Daddy, I hope you're going to \nvote tonight to protect the dolphins. And boy, when I heard that, I \nreally took a careful look at Senator Boxer's bill. I was inclined to \nsupport her already, but when I heard that from my son, and I started \nto focus on that debate, and the eloquence with which she spoke, I \nwound up voting with her to support and protect those dolphins.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would my friend yield for a question so I have a chance \nto thank him for that support, and thank his son, and tell his son that \nI am going to fight just as hard to protect the life and health of his \nmother and all the moms of this country and to make sure we protect the \nchildren as well. Thank you.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would like to encourage the Senator from \nCalifornia, and others in the Senate, to maybe think about the humanity \nissue here as we focus on the debate on partial-birth abortion.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of this bill, \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999. I would like to thank \nSenator Santorum for sponsoring it again and for his forceful and \neloquent arguments on behalf of the innocent unborn.\n  Every time I think about partial-birth abortion, I think of the \nobservations which, I believe, capture the essence of this debate. My \nesteemed colleague from Illinois, Representative Henry Hyde, asked: \nWhat kind of people have we become that this procedure is even a matter \nof debate?\n  He went on to say: You wouldn't even treat an animal, a mangy raccoon \nlike this.\n  What is a partial-birth abortion? As it has been described so \nthoroughly by my colleague from Pennsylvania, and many others, it is a \ntruly gruesome procedure. It is barbaric. It is chilling. It is cruel. \nMore than anything else, what I would like to emphasize here is that it \nis inhumane.\n  The medical term for this procedure is ``intact dilation and \nextraction,'' or ``intact D,'' for short. I have also heard it \nreferred to as ``intrauterine cranial decompression.'' What do these \nmedical terms mean?\n  Briefly, what happens is this: The abortionist turns the baby around \nin the womb so it is in the breech position--feet first. The \nabortionist then pulls the baby out of the womb and into the birth \ncanal so all but its head is outside the mother; thus, the term \n``partial birth.'' At this point, the abortionist takes out a sharp \nsurgical instrument, often a pair of scissors, and stabs the baby in \nthe back of its head to create a hole. The abortionist then inserts a \ntype of suction tube into the hole and sucks out the baby's brain. \nSucking out the baby's brain causes the skull to collapse, or implode, \nand the delivery can then be completed.\n\n  I will read an excerpt from testimony given to Congress by Mrs. \nBrenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse. While working for a temporary \nplacement agency in 1993, Mrs. Shafer was assigned to an Ohio abortion \nclinic, where she was asked to assist with a partial-birth abortion on \na woman who was just over 6 months pregnant. Here is some of what Mrs. \nShafer testified to Congress that she observed that day:\n\n       He delivered the baby's body and arms, everything but his \n     little head. The baby's body was moving. His little fingers \n     were clasping together. He was kicking his feet. The baby was \n     hanging there, and the doctor was holding his neck to keep \n     his head from slipping out. The doctor took a pair of \n     scissors and inserted them into the back of the baby's head, \n     and the baby's arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle \n     reaction, like a baby does when he thinks he might fall. Then \n     the doctor opened up the scissors, stuck the high-powered \n     suction tube into the hole [in the head] and sucked the \n     baby's brains out. The baby went completely limp. Then, the \n     doctor pulled the head out, and threw the baby into a pan.\n\n  This is inhumane. You wouldn't treat an animal, a mangy raccoon like \nthat.\n  In an attempt to somehow justify the humaneness of this procedure, \nopponents of a ban have cited the statements of a handful of medical \nprofessionals who contend that the unborn baby is actually killed, or \nrendered brain dead, prior to being extracted\n\n[[Page S12987]]\n\nfrom the womb by the anesthesia given to the mother.\n  Mr. President, and my colleagues, consider this: Professor Robert \nWhite, director of the Division of Neurosurgery and Brain Research at \nCase Western Reserve School of Medicine, testified before a House \ncommittee several years ago that:\n\n       The fetus within this timeframe of gestation, 20 weeks and \n     beyond, is fully capable of experiencing pain.\n\n  He stated, regarding partial-birth abortions:\n\n       Without question, all of this is a dreadfully painful \n     experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical \n     procedure.\n\n  Dr. Norig Ellison, president of the 34,000-member American Society of \nAnesthesiologists, testified before Congress:\n\n       I think the suggestion that the anesthesia given to the \n     mother, be it regional or general, is going to cause the \n     brain death of the fetus is without basis of fact.\n\n  And finally, Dr. Martin Haskell, who has been called a ``pioneer'' in \nthe use of the partial-birth abortion procedure, in 1993, stated:\n\n       . . . the majority of fetuses aborted this way are alive \n     until the end of the procedure.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       . . . probably about a third of those are definitely dead \n     before I actually start to remove the fetus. And probably the \n     other two-thirds are not.\n\n  What kind of a people have we become that this procedure is even a \nmatter of debate in the Senate? You wouldn't treat an animal, a mangy \nraccoon like that.\n  To my colleagues today who are still seriously considering this \ndebate, this is an issue of basic humaneness, and humaneness is an \nissue that many of us, on both sides, have often found quite troubling. \nIn my short time in the Senate, I have joined a number of my colleagues \non several occasions to speak against the inhumane treatment of \nanimals. In fact, it wasn't very long ago, during the debate on the \nInterior appropriations bill that I voted in support of an amendment \noffered by Senator Torricelli that would have prohibited the use of \nfunds in the Interior budget to facilitate the use of steel-jawed traps \nand neck snares for commerce or recreation in national wildlife \nrefuges.\n  During the debate on this amendment, my distinguished colleague from \nNevada, Senator Reid, described the amendment as a ``no-brainer.'' My \ncolleague went on to say that ``these traps are inhumane. They are \ndesigned to slam closed. The result is lacerations, broken bones, joint \ndislocations, and gangrene.'' In conclusion, Senator Reid stated that \n``in this day and age, there is no need to resort to inhumane methods \nof trapping. . . .'' And many of us were persuaded.\n  And why were we persuaded? Why are we troubled by steel-jawed traps? \nIsn't it, Mr. President, because there's something in our gut that \ntwists and turns over the unnecessary suffering and pain of creatures \nwith whom we share this Earth? The majestic animals that are as much a \npart of God's wonderful creation as we are. Wonderful animals who add \nrichness and texture to our own experience of the planet. Animals whom \nwe thank God for allowing us to appreciate and admire.\n  The suffering of a bear or a deer can lead many of us to say no to a \nsteel-jawed trap and a neck snare. But what about a scissor through the \nhead and neck of a child? What about sucking out a baby's brain.\n  Mr. President, You wouldn't treat an animal, a mangy raccoon like \nthis.\n  The Senate also acted this year to do more to fight the inhumane \ntreatment of dolphins. On July 22, I supported an amendment offered by \nSenator Boxer to the fiscal year 2000 Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill to force countries to pay their fair share of the \nexpenses of the Tuna Commission and delay the importation of tuna \ncaught using fishing methods that unnecessarily harm and kill dolphin. \nDuring debate on this amendment, Senator Boxer spoke eloquently of the \nthousands of dolphin killed each year by fishing methods that cruelly \nand unnecessarily harass, chase, encircle, maim, and kill dolphin that \nhappen to be swimming over schools of tuna. I appreciated hers and \nothers' efforts in the name of humaneness.\n  God has given us dominion over a wondrous planet, a beautiful blue \nsphere that takes our breath away when we see it silhouetted against \nthe dark of the universe. And with that dominion we know comes a \nstewardship, a responsibility to appreciate, care, and speak for God's \ncreation who cannot speak for themselves.\n  I believe our Maker has touched our human conscience with something \nthat makes us almost instinctively recoil from causing unnecessary pain \nand suffering to animals. I know there's a tender spot in the hearts of \nsome who now oppose a ban on this procedure. I know it's there because \nI've seen it in debates on the floor of this body. But I don't \nunderstand how those who can hear the howl of a wolf or the squeal of a \ndolphin, can be deaf to the cry of an unborn child.\n  Mr. President, if people were sticking scissors in the heads of \npuppies, we would not abide it. In the name of common decency and \nhumanity, I implore my colleagues not to let this happen to our own \nyoung.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the only amendments in order be the pending Smith of New \nHampshire amendment and the pending Landrieu amendment, that they both \nbe separate first-degree amendments, and the votes occur in relation to \nthese amendments at 5:30 in the order listed, with 3 minutes prior to \neach vote for explanation.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the votes described \nabove, the bill be immediately advanced to third reading and passage \noccur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--can \nwe be sure the 3 minutes are equally divided between the two sides?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is our understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fine. That is fine with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will \nthen be three votes beginning at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all colleagues, I \nbelieve there are going to be three rollcall votes commencing at 5:30. \nSo hopefully everybody will be present and we can move the votes fairly \nrapidly.\n  I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, for the \noutstanding debate he has conducted on the floor during the last couple \nof days. In addition, Senator Smith and others, I think, have presented \na very compelling case that this procedure, the so-called partial-birth \nabortion procedure, should be stopped. There is no medical necessity \nfor it. It is not necessary to save the life of the mother under any \ncircumstances, according to experts such as Dr. Koop, the American \nMedical Association, and others. It is a gruesome, terrible procedure. \nIt needs to be stopped.\n  We have laws on the books that protect unborn endangered species from \nOregon to Florida. We have fines and penalties that if you destroy an \nanimal, or an insect, you can be subjected to fines and penalties of \nthousands of dollars. You can even go to jail for destroying the unborn \nof a particular type of insect which happens to be classified as \nendangered.\n  Yet in this procedure, when we are talking about a child who is \npartially born, we won't give it any protection whatsoever. We are \ntalking about a child, a human being. I know some people say, ``It's a \nfetus and not a child; it\n\n[[Page S12988]]\n\nis not a human.'' Well, if we waited maybe 30 seconds, then it would be \na child, or a human being, totally outside the mother's womb. I just \nfind that incredible that we are not going to offer at least some \nprotection for these unborn children.\n  I want to allude to something else. There was a sense of the Senate \npassed earlier today, and some people have talked on it and said it \nreaffirms Roe v. Wade, as the law of the land. That Roe v. Wade is a \ngreat thing. There are a couple of points about this I would like to \naddress. From a legislative standpoint, we are the legislative body; we \npass the laws of the land. The Supreme Court is not supposed to \nlegislate. I read the Constitution. We all have a copy. It says, in \narticle I, section 1, of the Constitution:\n\n       All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  All legislative powers.\n  Then if you read through the conclusion of the Constitution, in the \n10th amendment it says:\n\n       All of the rights and powers are reserved to the States and \n     to the people.\n\n  It does not say in the case of abortion we give the Supreme Court the \nright to legislate. That is exactly what they did in Roe v. Wade. So \nnow we have a sense of the Senate that says we agree with Roe v. Wade. \nI wonder how many people have really looked at Roe v. Wade. I thought I \nmight introduce it into the Record because it is a very convoluted, \npoorly-drafted piece of legislation in which the Supreme Court \nlegalized abortion.\n  The Supreme Court doesn't have the constitutional power to legalize \nanything. They don't have the constitutional power to pass laws. That \nis what they did. I was going to insert Roe v. Wade into the Record, \nbut it is too long, it has too many pages. I object to the Supreme \nCourt legislating at any time, even if I agree with the legislative \nresult.\n  If Congress wants to codify Roe v. Wade, let somebody introduce \nlegislation and let it go through the process. Let's have hearings. \nDoes it make sense to have abortion legal, totally legal, without any \nrestrictions whatsoever in the first trimester, and maybe little \nrestrictions on the second trimester, and further on the third \ntrimester? Is that the way Congress would do it? If we are going to do \nit this way, at least if the people don't like the laws Congress \npasses, they would have some recourse. There is no recourse to \nlegislation dictated by the Supreme Court.\n\n  So I strongly object to the idea of the Supreme Court legislating. I \nthink the sense of the Congress was a serious mistake. I don't know if \nI am going to be a conferee or not, but I will work hard to make sure \nthe sense of the Senate language is not included in anything that will \nbe reported out on this bill. I think that would be a serious mistake.\n  Again, I compliment the authors of the bill and state for the Record \nthat I urge all people, Members of Congress, to vote for the \nlegislation by the Senator from Pennsylvania to protect unborn children \nwho are three-fourths born, or two-thirds born; give them protection--\nmaybe not as much protection as we give unborn animals under the \nendangered species. Evidently, we are not going to do that, but let's \ngive them some protection.\n  So let's pass this bill. We can go to conference with the House, and \nwe can drop this sense-of-the-Senate resolution and pass the bill, and \nhopefully this time the President will sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand we are ready now to do a series \nof three votes back to back.\n  For the information of all Senators, these votes will be the last \nvotes of the day.\n  It will be my intention to begin debate on the African trade bill, \nwhich includes, of course, the CBI enhancement provisions, immediately \nfollowing these votes. It is my hope that the Senate will begin \ndebating and amending the bill yet this evening because we do have some \nmore time that we could keep working on this bill.\n  I had the opportunity this afternoon to talk to the President about \nthis legislation. He is committed to being of assistance in any way he \ncan to the Senate taking this bill up and passing it in its present \nform.\n  I have been working with the Democratic leader, the chairman and \nranking member of the committee, all of whom support this legislation.\n  This is a free trade initiative that will be good for a America, good \nfor the Caribbean Basin, and good for Africa.\n  Assuming the Senate begins debate on this bill, any votes relative to \namendments would be postponed to occur at a time determined by the \nmajority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  On Monday, the Senate will be debating the African trade bill with \nthe CBI provisions.\n  I will propose to confirm six nominations from the Executive \nCalendar. If debate is necessary on these nominations, that debate \nwould also occur on Monday.\n  However, the votes, if necessary, would be postponed to occur on \nTuesday at 9:30 a.m.\n  I thank all Members, and will notify each Senator as the voting \nsituation becomes clearer.\n  Based on what I said, I believe we will have only debate on Friday. \nIt is not clear at this time what the situation would be with regard to \nMonday. We will have debate. We do have nominations we want to clear. \nBut we will be in communication with both sides of the aisle and notify \nthe Members as soon as further decisions can be made.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2324\n\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 2324.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have a minute and a \nhalf per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote shortly on the Smith \namendment.\n  I tried very hard to work with my colleague. There is one very \nserious flaw in his legislation which I fear could escalate the \nviolence at health care clinics all over this country. Now it is \nillegal in any way to sell fetal tissue. We all support that ban. We \nhave voted on that ban. You cannot sell fetal tissue.\n  The Senator is concerned that this sale, nonetheless, is taking \nplace. He wants certain disclosure as it relates to this issue. In the \ncourse of that, he has amended his legislation to deal with some of my \nproblems by making sure that we can identify the woman who agreed to \ndonate that tissue for research. It won't identify physicians. For that \nI am grateful.\n  The one area we couldn't reach agreement on had to do with the \nidentity of the health care facility in which the woman had her legal \nand safe abortion. That will be subject to disclosure. Anyone could \nfind out through a Freedom of Information request where that clinic is.\n  There have been 33 instances of violence against health care \nfacilities since 1987.\n  I really am sad that the Senator from New Hampshire was unable to \nprotect the confidentiality of these clinics.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please protect the \nidentity of these clinics. We don't want to have anyone calling up and \nfinding out where they are. I am very fearful it could escalate the \nviolence. We certainly don't want to do that unwittingly.\n  Thank you very much. I will be urging a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Senator Boxer and I made \nan attempt to come to accommodation on this amendment. We were not able \nto do that.\n  As you heard from my presentation on the floor, we know that fetal \nbody parts are being sold in violation of law. Abortions may be induced \nin certain ways, such as possibly partial birth, or perhaps even live \nbirths in order to have good fetal body tissue to sell.\n\n[[Page S12989]]\n\n  This is a serious problem. Clearly, it is a big industry.\n  This amendment requires disclosure of certain information prior to \nthe transfer of any of this fetal body tissue or parts in induced \nabortions. That is what it does. It is against the law to sell fetal \ntissue for research. It is against Federal law.\n  This amendment allows HHS to track these transfers to enforce current \nlaw. You can donate tissue, but you can't sell it. It is being sold. We \nneed the sun to shine in on this industry to find out what is \nhappening.\n  It protects the privacy of all women undergoing abortions and the \ndoctors providing them.\n  But this is something that is occurring within the industry. It is a \nvery elaborate network of abortion providers getting those body parts \nto a wholesaler who then in turn is selling those body parts to \nuniversities and other research institutions. It simply let's the light \nin. That is all it does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2324. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island.

Mr. President, as I understand the unanimous consent \nagreement, Senator Landrieu will have 1\\1/2\\ minutes and the other side \nwill have 1\\1/2\\ minutes on her amendment, which I strongly support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Landrieu has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, we have been debating \na very contentious and emotional issue for many, many hours now. This \ndebate will perhaps go on for some years to come as we try to resolve \nour many differences. It is a very tough issue for many families and \nfor policymakers all over our Nation.\n  This amendment is an attempt to help because whether you are for or \nagainst, pro-life or pro-choice, or somewhere in the middle, we can say \ntoday it is the sense of this Congress that we want to help all \nfamilies who have children with birth defects or special needs, \nregardless of their circumstances.\n  It is a very tough situation when families, even with a wanted \npregnancy, have to sometimes make a very tough decision that could \nresult in their financial ruin. We should step up to the plate, and \nthat is what this amendment does.\n  It simply says it is the sense of the Senate that many families \nstruggle with very tough decisions and that we should fully cover all \nexpenses related to educational, medical, and respite care requirements \nof families with special-needs children.\n  I commend this to my colleagues and ask for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I support the amendment, and I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2323, as modified. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The question is on the engrossment and the \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 3 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the arguments against the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Act keep changing. During previous consideration, for example, \nwe heard from proponents of the procedure that it was used in only rare \nand tragic cases, so it would be wrong to ban it. Here is how the \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America characterized partial-birth \nabortion in a November 1, 1995 news release: ``The procedure, dilation \nand extraction (D), is extremely rare and done only in cases when the \nwoman's life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' \nPlanned Parenthood was not the only group to make such sweeping \nstatements at the time.\n  But it did not take long for the story to unravel. On February 26, \n1997, the New York Times reported that Ron Fitzsimmons, executive \ndirector of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted he \n``lied in earlier statements when he said [partial-birth abortion] is \nrare and performed primarily to save the lives or fertility of women \nbearing severely malformed babies.'' According to the Times, ``He\n\n[[Page S12990]]\n\nnow says the procedure is performed far more often than his colleagues \nhave acknowledged, and on healthy women bearing healthy fetuses.''\n  Mr. Fitzsimmons told American Medical News the same thing--that is, \nthe vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week \nrange on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. He said, ``The abortion \nrights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, \nprobably, does everyone else.''\n  We heard about the frequency of the procedure from doctors who \nperformed it. The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, published an \ninvestigative report revealing that far more of these abortions were \nperformed in New Jersey and across the country than the abortion lobby \nwanted Americans to believe.\n  Now, after the truth is exposed, we see an advertising campaign by a \ngroup called the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, claiming that \nit is the legislation that is deceptive and extreme. The claim is that \nthe bill would prohibit ``some of the safest and most commonly used \nmedical procedures and risk the health and well-being of women.'' \nApparently out of convenience, opponents have now flipped their \nargument and claim the procedure is common, not rare at all--which is \nwhat supporters of the legislation contended all along.\n  On the issue of safety, they have been more consistent. They claim \nthe procedure is safe, but here is what the former Surgeon General of \nthe United States, Dr. C. Everett Koop, had to say on the subject. \nAccording to Dr. Koop, ``partial-birth abortion is never medically \nnecessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the \ncontrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.'' A \nthreat to health and fertility.\n  We heard the same thing from other medical experts during hearings in \nthe Judiciary Committee a few years ago. Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing \nOb-Gyn from Ohio, testified that in her 13 years of experience, she \nnever felt compelled to recommend this procedure to save a woman's \nlife. ``In fact,'' she said, ``if a woman has a serious, life \nthreatening, medical condition this procedure has a significant \ndisadvantage in that it takes three days.''\n  Even Dr. Warren Hern, the author of the nation's most widely used \ntextbook on abortion standards and procedures, is quoted in the \nNovember 20, 1995 edition of American Medical News as saying that he \nwould ``dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to \nuse.'' He called it ``potentially dangerous'' to a woman to turn a \nfetus to a breech position, as occurs during a partial-birth abortion. \nDangerous, Mr. President.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was quoted by \nCharles Krauthammer in a March 14, 1997 column as indicating that there \nare ``no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only \noption to save the life of the mother and preserve the health of the \nwoman.''\n  And of course, the American Medical Association (AMA), on the eve of \nthe Senate vote during the 105th Congress, endorsed the bill to ban the \ntechnique. According to the chairman of the AMA's board of trustees, \n``it is a procedure which is never the only appropriate procedure and \nhas no history in peer reviewed medical literature or in accepted \nmedical practice development.''\n  To those who call the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act extreme, I ask: \nIs it extreme to want to ban a procedure that medical experts tell us \nis dangerous and threatening to women? Or are the extremists those who \nare so radically pro-abortion that they defend even a such a dangerous \nand threatening procedure?\n  What about those rarest of instances when it might be necessary to \nuse this dangerous procedure to save a woman's life? Those are provided \nfor, despite what President Clinton said when he vetoed the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act on October 13, 1997. He said he did so because \nthe bill did not contain an exception that ``will adequately protect \nthe lives and health of the small group of women in tragic \ncircumstances who need an abortion performed at a late stage of \npregnancy to avert death or serious injury.''\n\n  Let me read the language of the bill that was vetoed. This is \nlanguage from the bill's proposed section 1531. The ban, and I am \nquoting, ``shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is \nnecessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a \nphysical disorder, illness, or injury.'' Identical language providing a \nlife-of-the-mother exception appears in this year's version of the \nbill, S. 1629, as well. I do not know how the language can be any \nclearer.\n  Mr. President, another charge now being made against this bill is \nthat it is unconstitutional. Of course, we all can speculate about how \nthe U.S. Supreme Court might rule on the matter. The Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals recently struck down partial-birth abortion bans in \nNebraska, Iowa, and Arkansas, but a three-judge panel from the Fourth \nCircuit stayed an injunction against a similar Virginia law, pending \nreview by the full court. The Fourth Circuit has yet to rule, but \nobservers expect it to uphold the Virginia ban.\n  Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court is going to have to rule on the \nquestion, given the differing Circuit Court decisions. And as Harvard \nLaw School Professor Lawrence Tribe noted in a November 6, 1995 letter \nto Senator Boxer, there are various reasons ``why one cannot predict \nwith confidence how the Supreme Court as currently composed would rule \nif confronted with [the bill].'' He noted that the Court has not had \nany such law before it. And he noted that ``although the Court did \ngrapple in 1986 with the question of a state's power to put the health \nand survival of a viable fetus above the medical needs of the mother, \nit has never directly addressed a law quite like [the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act].''\n  Mr. President, neither Roe v. Wade nor any subsequent Supreme Court \ncase has ever held that taking the life of a child during the birth \nprocess is a constitutionally protected practice. In fact, the Court \nspecifically noted in Roe that a Texas statute--one which made the \nkilling of a child during the birth process a felony--had not been \nchallenged. That portion of the law is still on the books in Texas \ntoday.\n  Remember what we are talking about here: ``an abortion in which the \nperson performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living \nfetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' That is \nthe definition of a partial-birth abortion in the pending legislation.\n  So we are talking about a child whose body, save for his or her head, \nhas been delivered from the mother--that is, only the head remains \nunborn. No matter what legal issues are involved, I hope no one will \nforget that we are talking about a live child who is already in the \nbirth canal and indeed has been partially delivered.\n  I dare say that, even if the Court were somehow to find that a \npartially delivered child is not constitutionally protected, the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act could still be upheld under Roe and \nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. Under both \nRoe and Casey, the government may prohibit abortion after viability, \nexcept when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. But \nthe exception would never arise here because, as the experts tell us, \nthis procedure is never medically necessary.\n  Although I believe the law would be upheld by the Court, I will \nconcede that no one can say with certainty how the Supreme Court will \nrule until it has ruled. Until then, I suggest that we not use that as \nan excuse to avoid doing what we believe is right.\n  The facts are on the table. The bill includes a life-of-the-mother \nexception--an exception that would probably never be invoked given that \nmedical experts tell us a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to \nprotect the life or health of a woman, and indeed may even pose a \ndanger to life and health. Let us do what is right and put a stop to \nwhat our colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, has appropriately \ncharacterized as infanticide. Let us pass this bill.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I enter this debate sad that partisan \npolitics has obstructed the effort of many of us to address this \nproblem in a meaningful way. Put simply, I oppose partial-birth \nabortions. Indeed, I oppose all late-term abortions unless they are \nnecessary to save the life of the mother or to avert grievous damage to \nthe physical health of the mother.\n\n[[Page S12991]]\n\n  I have voted for the Durbin amendment and will vote against the \nSantorum measure. One, the Durbin proposal, has failed. The other will \npass the Senate but accomplish nothing.\n  The Santorum bill suffers from a number of serious flaws. First, it \nis clearly unconstitutional. The vast majority of federal courts \ndealing with this issue have held so, and no amount of wishful thinking \ncan alter that fact. Second, even if it were constitutional, it would \nnot stop a single abortion. Let me reiterate that: it would not stop a \nsingle abortion. It would simply spur doctors and women to seek other \nmethods to achieve the same goal.\n  Before explaining why the Santorum measure is unconstitutional, let \nme elaborate on why it is ineffective. Long before the procedure of \npartial-birth abortion was developed, late-term, postviability \nabortions were available through alternative methods. Under the \nSantorum bill, which only prevents one particular procedure, physicians \ncan simply revert to the use of other more dangerous procedures if \npartial-birth abortion is banned. This bill will not end late-term \nabortions. It will simply force doctors to fall back on antiquated \nmedical interventions that will further endanger the lives and health \nof women. Is that really what we want?\n  In addition, 19 recent court rulings have determined that similar \nproposals are unconstitutional. There is a strong likelihood that this \nbill, if passed, will be struck down as unconstitutional according to \nthe precedent set by Roe v. Wade. As drafted this legislation is \nunconstitutionally vague and violates the clear dictates of the Supreme \nCourt. Our objective should not be to pass divisive legislation that \nhas no chance of ever becoming law.\n  And so I support the Durbin amendment. I believe it achieves a rare \nbalance in the debate about abortion. It is constitutional. It limits \ngovernment interference in a woman's most personal and important \ndecisions. And it provides a framework for dealing with the late-term \nabortions--including partial birth abortions--that the so many of us \nstruggle to find sense in.\n  I have spoken with women who have had late-term abortions. They \nstruggled mightily with their God and their consciences. They made \ntheir decisions with their husbands, their families and their doctors. \nAnd they alone confronted the awful moment when hope for a new life \ncollided with terror about the fate of their own life. I can never \nunderstand that conflict. But I believe that the Durbin amendment \noffers a bridge between those women and all of us who try to understand \nhow or why a woman might choose to have a late-term abortion.\n  I simply do not believe that Senators or any government \nrepresentative has the authority or expertise to determine that a \npartial-birth or late-term abortion will never be necessary to prevent \nsevere injury to a woman's physical health or a threat to her life. But \nI do believe that we do have the authority to ask that before a late-\nterm abortion is performed it be determined that the woman's life or \nphysical health are truly at stake. The Durbin amendment would \naccomplish this goal. It would bar, except in narrow circumstances and \nunder the advice and consent of two physicians, all late-term \nabortions.\n  On balance, I believe that the difficult question of abortion should \nbe left for a woman to decide in consultation with her family, her \nphysician and her faith. However, once the fetus has reached viability, \nI believe that we do have a responsibility, and a constitutional \nability, to protect the unborn child. I believe that the Durbin \namendment was the piece of legislation before us that would have most \neffectively accomplish that goal. And so I have voted in its favor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it boggles the mind to think that we are \nback here again, trying to convince the President that there is no \nplace in this nation for partial-birth abortions.\n  It is hard to believe that we are having to go through this exercise \nagain because this particular procedure is so clearly barbaric. It is \nsuch a clear case or genocide.\n  In two Congresses now--during both of which is served in the House of \nRepresentatives--Congress has passed a ban of this barbaric procedure \nonly to see the President veto that ban and allow the killing to \ncontinue.\n  In both of these Congresses, the House of Representatives voted to \noverride the President's veto--but this body did not.\n  Hopefully, we can change that. If not today--then maybe tomorrow or \nthe next day--the next month--or the next year--because this is such a \nclear case of human justice--moral justice--and plain old humanity--we \ncannot ever give up until partial-birth abortions are banned across the \nland.\n  It is really hard to believe that we have to go through this exercise \nevery Congress because nobody--with a straight face and clear \nconscience--can stand up and defend this procedure.\n  The only way anyone can justify it is to say that--hey, it doesn't \nmatter--because not that many partial birth abortion are actually \nperformed. They say that partial birth abortions are only utilized in \ncases when the mother's life is in jeopardy.\n  And we know this just isn't true. We know that some of the most \nardent and visible defenders of abortion have actually lied about the \nnumbers. It's not just a few hundred a year--it is thousands.\n  But the numbers really shouldn't make any difference. If it is wrong \nand inhumane we should ban it--whether it affects one or one million.\n  But misleading facts about the numbers--trying to downplay the \nprevalence and the frequency of the procedure--are no justification at \nall.\n  This bill does not ignore the health needs of women. It clearly makes \nan exception when the life of the mother is jeopardy. This bill clearly \nsays that the ban on partial-birth abortions does not apply when such a \nprocedure is considered necessary to save the life of a mother whose \nlife is endangered by a physical disorder, illness or injury.\n  So, even though many medical experts insist that there is never any \nmedical justification for partial-birth abortion, this bill permits it \nif the mother's life in jeopardy.\n  No one can deny that partial-birth abortion is cruel. No one can deny \nthat it is patently inhumane. No one can deny that it is grotesque.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill--support this ban.\n  It is simply a matter of respect for human life.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am proud today to join the Senator from \nPennsylvania and a large majority of my other colleagues in support of \nS. 1692, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in passing this bill by a sufficient margin to \nwithstand President Clinton's promised veto.\n  We are debating an issue that has an important bearing on the future \nof this Nation. Partial-birth abortion is a pivotal issue because it \ndemands that we decide whether or not we as a civilized people are \nwilling to protect that most fundamental of rights--the right to life \nitself. If we rise to this challenge and safeguard the future of our \nNation's unborn, we will be protecting those whose voices cannot yet be \nheard by the polls and those whose votes cannot yet be weighted in the \npolitical process. If we fail in our duty, we will justly earn the \nscorn of future generations when they ask why we stood idly by and did \nnothing in the face of this national infanticide.\n  We must reaffirm our commitment to the sanctity of human life in all \nits stages. We took a positive step in that direction two years ago by \nunanimously passing legislation that bans the use of federal funds for \nphysician-assisted suicide. We can take another step toward restoring \nour commitment to life by banning partial-birth abortions.\n  In this barbaric procedure, the abortionist pulls a living baby feet \nfirst out of the womb and through the birth canal except for the head, \nwhich is kept lodged just inside the cervix. The abortionist then \npunctures the base of the skull with long surgical scissors and removes \nthe baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the head \nto collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the \nnow dead baby. I recount the grisly details of this procedure only to \nremind my colleagues of the seriousness of the issue before the Senate. \nWe must help those unborn children who are unable to help themselves.\n  Opponents have argued that this procedure is necessary in some \ncircumstances to save the life of the\n\n[[Page S12992]]\n\nmother or to protect her health or future fertility. These arguments \nhave no foundation in fact. First, this bill provides an exception if \nthe procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother and no \nalternative procedure could be used for that purpose. Moreover, leaders \nin the medical profession including former Surgeon General C. Everett \nKoop have stated unequivocally that ``Partial-birth abortion is never \nmedically necessary to protect a mother's health or her future \nfertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant \nthreat to both.''\n  A coalition of over 600 obstetricians, perinatologists, and other \nmedical specialists have similarly concluded there is no sound medical \nevidence to support the claim that this procedure is ever necessary to \nprotect a woman's future fertility. These arguments are offered as a \nsmoke-screen to obscure the fact that this procedure results in the \ntaking of an innocent life. The practice of partial birth abortions has \nshocked the conscience of our nation and it must be stopped.\n  Even the American Medical Association has endorsed this legislation. \nIn a letter to the chief sponsor of this bill, Senator Santorum, the \nAMA explained ``although our general policy is to oppose legislation \ncriminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such \nlegislation where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically \nindicated. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act now meets both these \ntests . . . Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards \nrestricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.''\n  I have based my decision on every bill that has come before this body \non what effect it will have on those generations still to come. We in \nthe Senate have deliberated about what steps we can take to make \nsociety a better place for our families and the future of our children. \nWe as Senators will cast no vote that will more directly affect the \nfuture of our families and our children that the vote we cast on this \nbill.\n  When I ran for office, I promised my constituents I would protect and \ndefend the right to life of unborn babies. The sanctity of human life \nis a fundamental issue on which we as a nation should find consensus. \nIt is a right which is counted among the unalienable rights in our \nNation's Declaration of Independence. We must rise today to the \nchallenge that has been laid before us of protecting innocent human \nlife. I urge my colleagues to join me in casting a vote for life by \nsupporting the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  All of us in this body have had significant life experiences that \nhelp to shape our political philosophies. Nearly 4 years ago, I had a \ntorn heart valve and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. \nI had never been in a hospital except to visit sick folks before. I \nhave to tell you that I am impressed with what they were able to do, \nbut I have also been impressed with what doctors do not know. That is \nnot a new revelation for me.\n  Over 26 years ago, a long time ago, my wife and I were expecting our \nfirst child. Then one day early in the sixth month of pregnancy, my \nwife starting having pains and contractions. We took her to the doctor. \nThe doctor said, ``Oh, you may have a baby right now. We know it's \nearly and that doesn't bode well. We will try to stop it. We can \nprobably stop it.'' I had started storing up books for my wife for 3 \nmonths waiting for the baby to come. However, the baby came that night, \nweighing just a little over 2 pounds. The doctor's advice to us was to \nwait until morning and see if she lives. They said they didn't have any \ncontrol over it.\n  I could not believe the doctors could not stop premature birth. Then \nI could not believe that they could not do something to help this \nnewborn baby. Until you see one of those babies, you will not believe \nwhat a 6-month-old baby looks like. At the same time my wife gave birth \nto our daughter, another lady gave birth to a 10-pound baby. This was a \nsmall hospital in Wyoming so they were side by side in the nursery.\n  Some of the people viewing the other baby said, ``Oh, look at that \none. Looks like a piece of rope with some knots in it. Too bad.'' And \nwe watched her grasp and gasp for air with every breath, and we watched \nher the whole night to see if she would live. And we prayed.\n  Then the next day they were able to take this baby to a hospital \nwhich provided excellent care. She was supposed to be flown to Denver \nwhere the best care in the world was available, but it was a Wyoming \nblizzard and we couldn't fly. So we took a car from Gillette, WY, to \nthe center of the State to Wyoming's biggest hospital, to get the best \nkind of care we could find. We ran out of oxygen on the way. We had the \nhighway patrol looking for us and all along the way, we were watching \nevery breath of that child.\n  After receiving exceptional care the doctor said, ``Well, another 24 \nhours and we will know something.'' After that 24 hours there were \nseveral times we went to the hospital and there was a shroud around the \nisolette. We would knock on the window, and the nurses would come over \nand say, ``It's not looking good. We had to make her breathe again.'' \nOr, ``Have you had the baby baptized?'' We had the baby baptized in the \nfirst few minutes after birth. But that child worked and struggled to \nlive. She was just a 6-month-old-3 months premature.\n  We went through 3 months of waiting to get her out of the hospital. \nEach step of the way the doctors said her ability to live isn't our \ndoing. It gave me a new outlook on life. Now I want to tell you the \ngood news. The good news is that the little girl is now an outstanding \nEnglish teacher in Wyoming. She is dedicated to teaching seventh \ngraders English, and she is loving every minute of every day. The only \nproblem she had was that the isolette hum wiped out a range of tones \nfor her, so she cannot hear the same way that you and I do. But she can \nlip read very well, which, in the classroom, is very good if the kids \nare trying to whisper. But that has given me an appreciation for all \nlife and that experience continues to influence my vote now and on all \nissues of protecting human life.\n  Life is such a miracle that we have to respect it and work for it \nevery single day in every way we can. I think this bill will help in \nthat effort, and I ask for your support for this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe that late-term abortion \nprocedures should be used as sparingly as possible, when all other \noptions have been ruled out. But I do believe that it should be \npermitted as a last resort, and that when doctors judge it necessary to \nsave a woman's life or to avert grievous injury to the physical health \nof the mother, they should not be subject to criminal prosecution. That \nis why I cosponsored the Durbin amendment. This amendment outlaws all \npost-viability abortions, regardless of the procedure used, except to \nsave the life of the mother or avert grievous injury to her physical \nhealth. It also requires that both the attending physician and an \nindependent non-treating physician certify in writing that, in their \nmedical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the \nmother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. Grievous \ninjury is defined as (1) a severely debilitating disease or impairment \nspecifically caused or exacerbated by the pregnancy or (2) an inability \nto provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition, and is \nlimited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy is \nmedically indicated.\n  The underlying legislation, on the other hand, would not prevent a \nsingle late-term abortion as it is written. It only seeks to outlaw one \nprocedure, which is broadly and vaguely defined. The term partial birth \nabortion is a political term, not a medical one. In fact, this \nlegislation is written so vaguely that it is highly likely to be \ndeclared unconstitutional. In 19 of 21 states considering legislation \nsimilar to this legislation, courts have partially or fully enjoined \nthe laws. These decisions have been made by judges who have been \nappointed by every President from President Reagan on.\n  Further, Mr. President, the Constitution protects a woman's right to \nmake decisions about her pregnancy up to the point that the fetus is \nviable. The bill before us, and similar state bills, are vague and \nbroad enough that this basic right is not protected, according to the \nvast majority of judges ruling on these laws.\n  For these reasons, I support the Durbin amendment and oppose the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Supreme Court has ruled that a ban on \nall\n\n[[Page S12993]]\n\nabortions after viability is permitted under the Constitution, \nproviding the ban contains an exception to protect the life and health \nof the woman.\n  S. 1692 does not meet that test because the exception it provides for \ndoes not include constitutionally required language relative to a \nwoman's health.\n  The Supreme Court has also held that states may not ban pre-viability \nabortions. S. 1692 bans a specific abortion procedure that is not \nlimited to post-viability abortions and therefore would ban certain \npre-viability abortions, also making it unconstitutional.\n  In fact, 19 out of 21 state laws similar to S. 1692 have been held \nunconstitutional by the courts, including a Michigan statute. In \nMichigan, the U.S. District Court has held that:\n\n       [T]he Michigan partial-birth abortion statute must be \n     declared unconstitutional and enjoined because, under \n     controlling precedent, it is vague and over broad and \n     unconstitutionally imposes an undue burden on a woman's right \n     to seek a pre-viability second trimester abortion . . .\n\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has \ncontinually expressed deep concern about legislation prohibiting the \nintact D procedure, which is the technical name for the so-called \npartial birth abortion procedure. They have urged Congress not to pass \nlegislation criminalizing this procedure and not to supersede the \nmedical judgment of trained physicians. They have stated the \nlegislation, ``continues to represent an inappropriate, ill advised and \ndangerous intervention into medical decision-making. The amended bill \nstill fails to include an exception for the protection for the health \nof the woman.''\n  Principally for these reasons, I oppose this legislation. I supported \nan alternative bill which would ban all post-viability abortions, \nregardless of the procedure used, except in cases where it is necessary \nto protect a woman's life or health. I think that approach is \npreferable to S. 692 which would criminalize the procedure and which \nfails to protect a woman's health. However, it would be even more \npreferable to leave this matter to the states which already have the \nright to ban postviability abortions by any method, as long as the ban \nmeets the constitutional standard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we once again are debating \nlegislation to ban the dilation and extraction, or D, procedure used \nby doctors. I am again opposed to this legislation and will once again \nbe voting against this ban for the fifth time in as many years.\n  My reasons for opposing this legislation are many. Most have been \ndiscussed on the floor during the many debates on this difficult issue. \nFirst, and most importantly I believe that this bill undermines the \nSupreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade to leave these critical matters \nin the hands of a woman, her family and her doctor. The pending \nlegislation is an effort to chip away at these reproductive rights \nestablished in that 1973 decision and upheld by court cases since 1973. \nI understand many people disagree with my position. This issue has been \ncontentious since I came to Congress in 1975.\n  Second, with the Roe decision, the Supreme Court wisely gave states \nthe responsibility to restrict third-trimester abortions, so long as \nthe life or health of the mother were not jeopardized. As of 1999, all \nbut ten states have done so. To me, the rights of states to regulate \nabortions, when the life or health of the mother are not in danger, is \nan adequate safeguard. In the event the states pass unconstitutional \nregulations on this point, the appropriate remedy is with the courts. I \nrealize that this policy leads to differences in law from state to \nstate, but just as families differ, so too do states. As has been said \nbefore during the debate on this issue:\n\n       When the Roe v. Wade decision acknowledged a state interest \n     in fetuses after viability, the Court wisely left \n     restrictions on post-viability abortions up to states. There \n     are expert professional licensing boards, accreditation \n     councils and medical associations that guide doctors' \n     decision-making in the complicated and difficult matters of \n     life and death.\n\n  Third, the legislation before us would prevent doctors from using the \nD procedure where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. \nThis clearly goes against the holding of the Supreme Court in Roe, as \nit required the health of the mother be safeguarded when states \nregulate late-term abortions. I will not vote for a bill that is \nneither Constitutional, nor takes into account those situations where \ncarrying a fetus to term would cause serious health risk for the \nmother. This is simply unacceptable. My vote in 1997, in favor of the \nFeinstein substitute amendment underscored my commitment to \nsafeguarding a doctor's options to protect the health of the mother in \ncases where a late-term procedure is necessary.\n  Finally, I believe that women who choose to undergo a D procedure \ndo so for grave reasons. We have established a delicate legal framework \nin which to address late-term abortions and we should not shift the \ndecision making to the federal government.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are not here today to debate the \nlegality of abortion. We are here to discuss ending partial-birth \nabortion--a particularly gruesome procedure that would be outlawed \ntoday but for the President's veto last year of a national ban.\n  Banning partial-birth abortion goes far beyond traditional pro-life \nor prochoice views. No matter what your personal opinion regarding the \nlegalization of abortion, we should all be appalled and outraged by the \npractices of partial-birth abortions. This procedure is inhumane and \nextremely brutal entailing the partial delivery of a healthy baby who \nis then killed by having its vibrant brain stabbed and suctioned out of \nthe skull.\n  This is simply barbaric.\n  Some would argue that abortion, including partial-birth abortion, is \na matter of choice--a woman's choice. Respectfully, I must disagree.\n  What about the choice of the unborn baby? Why does a defenseless, \ninnocent child not have a choice in their own destiny?\n  Some may answer that the unborn baby is merely a fetus and is not a \nbaby until he or she leaves the mother's womb. Again, I disagree, \nparticularly, in the case of infants who are killed by partial-birth \nabortions.\n  Most partial-birth abortions occur on babies who are between 20 and \n24 weeks old. Viability, ``the capacity for meaningful life outside the \nwomb, albeit with artificial aid'' as defined by the United States \nSupreme Court, is considered by the medical community to begin at 20 \nweeks for an unborn baby. Most, if not all, of the babies who are \naborted by the partial-birth procedure could be delivered and live. \nInstead, they are partially delivered and then murdered. These children \nare never given a choice or a chance to live.\n  Today, we have to make a choice. We can choose to protect our \nnation's most valuable resource--our children. We can choose to give a \ntomorrow full of endless possibilities to unborn children throughout \nour nation. We can choose to save thousands from being murdered at the \nhands of abortionists.\n  Or we can choose to allow this barbaric procedure to continue, \npermitting doctors to kill more innocent, unborn children.\n  We each have a choice, a choice which unborn children are denied. We \nmust make the right choice when we vote today--the choice to save \nthousands of unborn children by banning partial birth abortions in this \ncountry.\n  Today, I will choose to protect the unborn child. Today, I will once \nagain cast my vote to ban partial birth abortions.\n  I want to reiterate my strong support for this bill and my \nunequivocal and long-standing opposition to the practice of partial \nbirth abortion. I find it disconcerting that a few people are \nattempting to dilute my unequivocal support for banning this horrific \nprocedure as well as to cast doubt on my long standing commitment to \nprotecting the life of unborn children merely because of my vote on a \nprocedural motion.\n  Yesterday, I voted against a parliamentary maneuver designed solely \nto end debate on S. 1593, the campaign finance reform bill. This was an \nunnecessary move since a unanimous consent agreement had been offered, \nwith no known opposition, which would have allowed the chamber to \ntemporarily lay aside the campaign finance reform bill so that the \nSenate could consider the partial birth abortion ban legislation. Under \nthat procedure, when the Senate finished its work on the important bill \nbanning partial birth abortions, we could then return to complete the \ndebate on campaign finance reform. Instead, the opponents of\n\n[[Page S12994]]\n\nMcCain-Feingold forced a vote on a maneuver which returned the bill to \nthe Senate calendar, effectively cutting off the debate, well short of \nthe time promised to consider this important issue.\n  In no way does my vote yesterday and strong support for campaign \nfinance reform reduce my unequivocal, long-standing opposition to \nabortion, including the practice of partial birth abortion. I am a \ncosponsor of this legislation, as I was in previous years. I have voted \n5 times over the past 5 years to ban this repugnant and unnecessary \nprocedure, including 2 votes to overturn the President's veto of this \nlegislation. When the Senate votes today on S. 1692, I will again vote \nfor the ban.\n  Mr. President, I am pro-life and will continue fighting for measures \nwhich protect our nation's unborn children and provide them with an \nopportunity for life--the greatest gift each of us has.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the fifth time in the past two years, \nthe Republican leadership has chosen to debate and vote on legislation \nthat President Clinton has vetoed twice and that numerous courts have \nruled unconstitutional. No matter how often the Senate votes, the facts \nwill remain the same. This bill is unconstitutional--it's a violation \nof the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood \nv. Casey, and the Senate should oppose it.\n  The Roe and Casey decisions prohibit Congress from imposing an \n``undue burden'' on a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an \nabortion at any time up to the point where the developing fetus reaches \nthe stage of viability. Congress can constitutionally limit abortions \nafter the stage of viability, as long as the limitations contain \nexceptions to protect the life and the health of the woman.\n  This bill fails that constitutional test in two clear ways. It \nclearly imposes an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to an \nabortion in cases before viability. In cases after viability, it \nclearly does not contain the constitutionally required exception to \nprotect the mother's health.\n  Supporters of this legislation are flagrantly defying these \nconstitutional requirements, and they know it. Similar laws have been \nchallenged in 21 of the 30 states where they have been passed, and the \nresults are clear. In 20 states, laws have been blocked or severely \nlimited by the courts or by state legal action. Eighteen courts have \nissued temporary or permanent injunctions preventing the laws from \ntaking effect because of constitutional defects. One court and one \nattorney general have limited enforcement of the law. Of the states \nwhere the laws have been blocked, six have statutes identical to the \nSantorum bill.\n  Recently, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that laws in \nthree states under its jurisdiction--Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska--were \nunconstitutional. In the opinion on the Nebraska law, the court \nspecifically held that, ``Under controlling precedents laid down by the \nSupreme Court, [the] prohibition places an undue burden on the right of \nwomen to choose whether to have an abortion.''\n  The conclusion is obvious. The supporters of the Santorum bill would \nrather have an issue than a law. They have rejected compromise after \ncompromise. They have ignored President Clinton's plea to add an \nexemption for ``the small number of compelling cases where selection of \nthe procedure, in the medical judgment of the attending physician, was \nnecessary to preserve the life of the woman or avert serious adverse \nconsequences to her health.''\n  In doing so, the Republican leadership has chosen to ignore the \nConstitution. They are also ignoring the large number of medical \nprofessionals who oppose this legislation, including the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Nurses \nAssociation, and the American Medical Women's Association. The American \nMedical Association--which once endorsed the bill--no longer supports \nit. The AMA withdrew its support after independent investigators hired \nby the organization concluded that, ``rather than focusing on its role \nas steward for the profession and the public health . . . the board . . \n. lost sight of its responsibility for making decisions which, first \nand foremost, benefit the patient and protect the physician-patient \nrelationship.''\n  Most important, in its effort to pass this legislation, the \nRepublican leadership has ignored the tragic situations in which some \nwomen find themselves--women like Eileen Sullivan, Erica Fox, Vikki \nStella, Tammy Watts, and Viki Wilson. Women like Coreen Costello, who \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and told us that she \nconsulted with numerous medical experts and did everything possible to \nsave her child. She later had the procedure that would be banned by \nthis legislation, and, based on that experience, she told the Committee \nthe following:\n\n       I hope you can put aside your political differences, your \n     positions on abortion, and your party affiliations and just \n     try to remember us. We are the ones who know. We are the \n     families that ache to hold our babies, to love them, to \n     nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a \n     hole in our hearts. . . . please put a stop to this terrible \n     bill. Families like mine are counting on you.\n\n  For all of these reasons, I oppose the Santorum bill. We should stand \nwith Coreen Costello and others like her, who with their doctors' \nadvice, must make these tragic decisions to protect their lives and \ntheir health.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1692, \nthe Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. At the outset, I would like to \nthank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, for his great \nefforts here this week, and over the past few years, in trying to seek \npassage of this measure. Few people can speak on this issue with the \nsame passion and depth of understanding as Senator Santorum.\n  As we face this vote today, it is clear that the majority of the \nSenate supports this bill. It is a bipartisan effort. The hope we have, \nhowever, in the face of an inevitable veto, is that a number sufficient \nto override this veto will vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken in past years on this important \nlegislation. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I chaired a \nmajor hearing on this bill several years ago, and the graphic \ndescription of this procedure and the testimony I heard was compelling, \neven chilling.\n  This bill presents, really, a very narrow issue: whether one rogue \nabortion procedure that has probably been performed by a handful of \nabortion doctors in this country, that is never medically necessary, \nthat is not the safest medical procedure available under any \ncircumstances, and that is morally reprehensible, should be banned.\n  This bill does not address whether all abortions after a certain week \nof pregnancy should be banned or whether late-term abortions should \nonly be permitted in certain circumstances. It bans one particular \nabortion procedure.\n  I chaired the Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill that was held \non November 17, 1995. After hearing the testimony presented there as \nwell as seeing some of the submitted material, I must say that I find \nit difficult to comprehend how any reasonable person could examine the \nevidence and continue to defend the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  That procedure involves the partial delivery of an intact fetus into \nthe birth canal. The fetus is delivered from its feet through its \nshoulders so that only its head remains in the uterus. Then, either \nscissors or another instrument is used to poke a hole in the base of \nthe skull. This is a living baby at this point, in a late trimester of \nliving. Once the abortionist pokes that hole in the base of the skull, \na suction catheter is inserted to suck out the brains. This bill would \nsimply ban that procedure.\n  The committee heard testimony from a total of 12 witnesses presenting \na variety of perspectives on the bill. I wanted to ensure that both \nsides of this debate had a full opportunity to present their arguments \non this issue, and I think that the hearing bore that out.\n  Brenda Shafer, a registered nurse who worked in Dr. Martin Haskell's \nOhio abortion clinic for 3 days as a temporary nurse in September 1993, \ntestified to her personal experience observing Dr. Haskell performing \nthe procedure that would be banned by this bill. Dr. Haskell is one of \nonly a handful of doctors who have acknowledged performing the \nprocedure.\n  The committee also heard testimony from four ob-gyn doctors--two in \nfavor\n\n[[Page S12995]]\n\nof the bill and two against--from an anesthesiologist, from an \nethicist, and from three women who had personal experiences either with \nhaving a late-term abortion or with declining to have a late-term \nabortion. Finally, the committee also heard from two law professors who \ndiscussed constitutional and other legal issues raised by the bill.\n  The hearing was significant in that it permitted the issues raised by \nthis bill to be fully aired. I think that the most important \ncontribution of the hearing to this debate is that the hearing record \nputs to rest a number of inaccurate statements that have been made by \nopponents of the bill and that have unfortunately been widely covered \nin the press.\n  Because the Judiciary Committee hearing brought out many of the facts \non this issue, I would like to go through the most important of those \nfor my colleagues to clear up what I think have been some of the major \nmisrepresentations--and simply points of confusion--on this bill.\n  The first and foremost inaccuracy that we must correct once and for \nall concerns the effects of anesthesia on the fetus of a pregnant \nwoman. I must say that I am personally shocked at the irresponsibility \nthat led some opponents of this bill to spread the myth that anesthesia \ngiven to the mother during a partial-birth abortion is what kills the \nfetus.\n  Opponents of the measure presumably wanted to make this procedure \nappear less barbaric and make it more palatable. In doing so, however, \nthey have not only misrepresented the procedure, but they have spread \npotentially life-threatening misinformation that could prove \ncatastrophic to women's health.\n  By claiming that anesthesia kills the fetus, opponents have spread \nmisinformation that could deter pregnant women who might desperately \nneed surgery from undergoing surgery for fear that the anesthesia could \nkill or brain-damage their unborn children.\n  Let me illustrate how widespread this misinformation has become: In a \nJune 23, 1995, submission to the House Judiciary Constitution \nSubcommittee, the late Dr. James McMahon, the other of the two doctors \nwho has admitted performing the procedure, wrote that anesthesia \ngiven to the mother during the procedure causes fetal demise.\n\n  Let me note also that if the fetus was dead before being brought down \nthe birth canal, then this bill by definition would not cover the \nprocedure performed to abort the fetus. The bill covers only procedures \nin which a living fetus is partially delivered.\n  An editorial in USA Today on November 3, 1995, also stated, ``The \nfetus dies from an overdose of anesthesia given to its mother.''\n  In a self-described fact sheet, circulated to Members of the House, \nDr. Mary Campbell, Medical Director of Planned Parenthood, who \ntestified of the Judiciary Committee hearing wrote:\n\n       The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the \n     mother intravenously. A dose is calculated for the mother's \n     weight, which is 50 to 100 times the weight of the fetus. The \n     mother gets the anesthesia for each insertion of the \n     dilators, twice a day. This induces brain death in a fetus in \n     a matter of minutes. Fetal demise therefore occurs in the \n     beginning of the procedure while the fetus is still in the \n     womb.\n\n  When that statement was referenced to the medical panel at the \nJudiciary Committee hearing by Senator Abraham, the president of the \nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists, Dr. Norig Ellison, flatly \nresponded, ``There is absolutely no basis in scientific fact for that \nstatement.''\n  The American Society of Anesthesiologists was invited to testify at \nour hearing precisely to clear up this obvious misrepresentation. They \nsought the opportunity to set the record straight.\n  What was terribly disturbing about this distortion was that it could \nendanger women's health and women's lives. The American Society of \nAnesthesiologists has made clear that they do not take a position on \nthe legislation, but that they came forward out of concern for the \nharmful misinformation.\n  The spreading of this misinformation strikes me as a very sad \ncommentary on the lengths that those who support abortion on demand, \nfor any reason, at virtually any time during pregnancy and apparently \nregardless of the method, will do to defend each and any procedure, and \ncertainly this procedure. The sacrifice of intellectual honesty is very \ndisheartening.\n  As Dr. Ellison testified, he was ``Deeply concerned . . . that the \nwidespread publicity given to Dr. McMahon's testimony may cause \npregnant women to delay necessary and perhaps lifesaving medical \nprocedures, totally unrelated to the birthing process, due to \nmisinformation regarding the effect of anesthetics on the fetus.''\n  He stated that the American Society of Anesthesiologists, while not \ntaking a position on the bill, ``. . . have nonetheless felt it our \nresponsibility as physicians specializing in the provisions of \nanesthesia care to seek every available forum in which to contradict \nDr. McMahon's testimony. Only in that way we believe can we provide \nassurance to pregnant women that they can undergo necessary surgical \nprocedures safely, both for mother and unborn child.''\n\n  Dr. Ellison also noted that, in his medical judgment, in order to \nachieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth abortion \nprocedure, it would be necessary to anaesthetize the mother to such a \ndegree as to place her own health in jeopardy.\n  In short, in a partial-birth abortion, the anesthesia does not kill \nthe fetus. The baby will generally be alive after partly being \ndelivered into the birth canal and before having his or her skull \nopened and brain sucked out.\n  Mr. President, if this description is distasteful, that is because \nthe procedure itself is.\n  That is also consistent with evidence provided by Dr. Haskell \ndescribing his use of the procedure. In his 1992 paper presented before \nthe National Abortion Federation, which is part of the hearing record, \nDr. Haskell described the procedure as first involving the forceps-\nassisted delivery into the birth canal of an intact fetus from the feet \nup to the shoulders, with the head remaining in the uterus. He does not \ndescribe taking any action to kill the fetus up until that point.\n  In a 1993 interview with the American Medical News, Dr. Haskell \nacknowledged that roughly two-thirds of the fetuses he aborts using the \npartial-birth abortion procedure are alive at the point at which he \nkills them by inserting a scissors in the back of the head and \nsuctioning out the brain.\n  Finally, in a letter to me dated November 9, 1995, Dr. Watson Bowes \nof the University of North Carolina Medical School wrote, ``Although I \nhave never witnessed this procedure, it seems likely from the \ndescription of the procedure by Dr. Haskell that many if not all of the \nfetuses are alive until the scissors and the suction catheter are used \nto remove brain tissue.''\n  Simply put, anesthesia given to a mother does not kill the baby she \nis carrying.\n  Let me move on to the next misrepresentation. Another myth that the \nhearing record debunks is that the procedure can be medically necessary \nin late-term pregnancies where the health of the mother is in danger or \nwhere the fetus has severe abnormalities.\n  Now, there were two witnesses at the hearing who testified as to \ntheir experiences with late-abortions in circumstances in which Dr. \nMcMahon's performed the procedure. Both women, Coreen Costello and Viki \nWilson, received terrible news late in their pregnancies that the \nchildren they were carrying were severely deformed and would be unable \not survive for very long.\n  I would like to make it absolutely clear that nothing in the bill \nbefore us would prevent women in Ms. Costello's and Ms. Wilson's \nsituations from choosing to abort their children. That question is not \nbefore us, and it is not one that we face in considering this narrow \nbill.\n  I also would like to point out that I have the utmost sympathy for \nwomen--and their husbands and families--who find themselves receiving \nthe same tragic news that those women received.\n  Regardless of whether they aborted the child or decided to go through \nwith the pregnancy, which is what another courageous witness at our \nhearing, Jeannie French of Oak Park, Illinois, chose to do--and as a \nresult, her daughter Mary's heart valves were donated to other \ninfants--their experiences are horrendous ones that no one should have \nto go through.\n\n[[Page S12996]]\n\n  The testimony of all three witnesses was among the most heart-\nwrenching and painful testimony I have ever heard before the committee. \nMy heart goes out to those three women and their families as well as \nany others in similar situations.\n  However, the fact is that medical testimony in the record indicates \nthat even if an abortion were to be performed under such circumstances, \na number of other procedures could be performed, such as the far more \ncommon classical D procedure or an induction procedure.\n  When asked whether the exact procedure Dr. McMahon used would ever be \nmedically necessary--even in cases like those described by Ms. Costello \nand Ms. Wilson--several doctors at our hearing explained that it would \nnot. Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing Ob-Gyn and clinical professor in \nDayton, Ohio, stated that she had never had to resort to that procedure \nand that none of the physicians that she worked with had ever had to \nuse it.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, Director of Medical Education in the Department of \nObstetrics and Gynecology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, \nstated that a doctor would never need to resort to the partial-birth \nabortion procedure.\n  This ties in closely to what I consider the next misrepresentation \nmade about the partial-birth abortion procedure: the claim that in some \ncircumstances a partial-birth abortion will be the safest option \navailable for a late-term abortion. Testimony and other evidence \nadduced at the Judiciary Committee hearing amply demonstrate that this \nis not the case.\n  An article published in the November 20, 1995, issue of the American \nMedical News quoted Dr. Warren Hern as stating, ``I would dispute any \nstatement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' Dr. Hern is the \nauthor of ``Abortion Practice,'' the Nation's most widely used textbook \non abortion standards and procedures. He also stated in that interview \nthat he ``has very strong reservations'' about the partial-birth \nabortion procedure banned by this bill.\n\n  Indeed, referring to the procedure, he stated, ``You really can't \ndefend it. I'm not going to tell somebody else that they should not do \nthis procedure. But I'm not going to do it.''\n  In fairness to Dr. Hern, I note that he does not support this bill in \npart because he feels this is the beginning of legislative efforts to \nchip away at abortion rights. But, his statement regarding the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure certainly sheds light on the argument made by \nopponents that it is the safest procedure for late-term abortions.\n  Another misrepresentation that should be set straight concerns claims \nthat the partial-birth abortion procedure that would be banned by this \nbill is, in fact, performed only in later-term pregnancies where the \nlife of the mother is at risk or where the fetus is suffering from \nsevere abnormalities that are incompatible with life.\n  I certainly do not dispute that in a number of cases the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure has been performed where the life of the \nmother was at risk or where the fetus was severely deformed.\n  Substantial available evidence indicates, however, that the procedure \nis not performed solely or primarily where the mother's life is in \ndanger, where the mother's health is gravely at risk, or where the \nfetus is seriously malformed in a manner incompatible with life.\n  The fact of the matter is--and I know this is something that \nopponents of the bill have not faced--this procedure is being performed \nwhere there are only minor problems with the fetus, and for purely \nelective reasons.\n  Most important, however, medical testimony at our hearing indicated \nthat a health exception in this bill is not necessary because other \nabortion procedures are in fact safer and better for women's health.\n  Now, let me be perfectly clear that I do not doubt that in some cases \nthis procedure was done where there were life-threatening indications.\n  However, I simply must emphasize two points.\n  First, those cases are by far in the minority. We should get the \nfacts straight so that our colleagues and the American people \nunderstand what is going on here.\n  Second, the most credible testimony at our hearing--confirmed by \nother available evidence--indicates that even where serious maternal \nhealth issues exist or severe fetal abnormalities arise, there will \nalways be other, safer abortion procedures available that this bill \ndoes not touch.\n  On that note, I would like to close by highlighting a statement made \nat our hearing by Helen Alvare of the National Conference of Catholic \nBishops. She remarked that opponents of this bill keep asking whether \nenacting it would be the first step in an effort to ban all abortions.\n  In her view, however, the real question should be whether allowing \nthis procedure would serve as a first step toward legalized \ninfanticide. I urge the bill's opponents to ask themselves this \nquestion. What is the real purpose of this procedure?\n  That is the fundamental problem with this procedure, It involves \nkilling a partially delivered baby.\n  Let me say to my colleagues in the Senate that the evidence presented \nmore than confirms my view that this procedure is never medically \nnecessary and should be banned.\n  This evidence, regardless of one's view on the broader issue of \nabortion, provides ample justification for an ``aye'' vote on S. 1692.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  The courts in twenty States have said the Santorum law that has \nbasically been adopted in those States is unconstitutional. Senator \nSantorum, in an effort to fix his bill, sent up a modification to the \ndesk which he believes has narrowed the definition of what he means by \nthe term ``partial-birth abortion,'' which is not a medical term.\n  I have letters I have put in the Record from the obstetricians and \ngynecologists organization saying that, in fact, the new language \ndoesn't do anything to narrow the definition; the same problem still \nholds.\n  This ban is so vague, it could impact all abortions. That is why the \ncourts say it is wrong. There is no exception for the health of a \nwoman. That also goes against Roe. And 51 of us voted in favor of Roe. \nI hope we will vote no. I believe at least 35 of us or so will do that. \nThat will be enough to sustain the veto. I hope more of my colleagues \nwill consider standing with the life and health of a woman and voting \nno on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the amendment I offered to modify the \nlanguage, directly on point, addresses the Eighth Circuit concern. It \nspecifically talks about the baby having to be intact, living outside \nthe mother, before the baby is killed.\n  The concern of the Eighth Circuit was that other forms of abortion \nthat are performed in utero could be involved. This is absolutely, \npositively clear. We are not talking about that. We ban a particular \nprocedure. All other procedures would be legal under this bill. So \nthere is no undue burden.\n  Second, regarding the issue of health that Senator Boxer brings up, I \nhave hundreds and hundreds of letters from obstetricians who say this \nis never, never medically necessary, and is never the only alternative, \nand it is never the preferred alternative. I have entered into the \nRecord where the AMA has said that, and other organizations, 600 \nobstetricians.\n  On the other side is one organization, ACOG, which says, also, that \nit is never the only option, but says it may be necessary, or it may be \nthe preferred procedure. For 3 years, we have asked for an example of \nwhen it would be the preferred procedure. They have never given us an \nexample; never have they provided an example that backs up their \nspecious claim that this is in some way, somehow, somewhere necessary.\n  It is not medically necessary. There is no health exception needed \nbecause it is an unhealthy procedure. This is the opportunity to draw \nthe line in the sand about what is protected by the Constitution and \nwhat is not. A child three-quarters born deserves some protection.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S12997]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING A WOMAN'S LIFE AND \n                   HEALTH.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that, consistent with the \n     rulings of the Supreme Court, a woman's life and health must \n     always be protected in any reproductive health legislation \n     passed by Congress.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a brief period. The \nreason I want to speak is to read into the Record a great speech that \nwas given by a Nobel Laureate for Peace prize winner in 1979. It fits \nin with the culmination of what we discussed today, the partial-birth \nabortion ban. That vote has taken place and we have had extended \ndiscussion on that. I think this is actually a very fitting final \nconclusion to this debate.\n  Mr. President, this speech is titled ``The Gift of Peace.'' It was \ngiven by Mother Teresa, Nobel Laureate, on December 11, 1979. I think \nit relates to a lot of what we have talked about here today. I will \nread it. I think it puts a good summary on it.\n  Mother Teresa said:\n       As we have gathered here together to thank God for the \n     Nobel Peace Prize, I think it will be beautiful that we pray \n     the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi which always surprises me \n     very much--we pray this prayer every day after Holy \n     Communion, because it is very fitting for each one of us, and \n     I always wonder that 4-500 years ago as St. Francis of Assisi \n     composed this prayer that they had the same difficulties that \n     we have today, as we compose this prayer that fits very \n     nicely for us also. I think some of you already have got it--\n     so we will pray together.\n       Let us thank God for the opportunity that we all have \n     together today, for this gift of peace that reminds us that \n     we have been created to live that peace, and Jesus became man \n     to bring that good news to the poor. He being God became man \n     in all things like us except sin, and he proclaimed very \n     clearly that he had come to give the good news. The news was \n     peace to all of good will and this is something that we all \n     want--the peace of heart--and God loved the world so much \n     that he gave his son--it was a giving--it is as much as if to \n     say it hurt God to give, because he loved the world so much \n     that he gave his son, and he gave him to Virgin Mary, and \n     what did she do with him?\n       As soon as he came in her life--immediately she went in \n     haste to give that good news, and as she came into the house \n     of her cousin, the child--the unborn child--the\n\n[[Page S12998]]\n\n     child in the womb of Elizabeth, lit with joy. He was that \n     little unborn child, was the first messenger of peace. He \n     recognized the Prince of Peace, he recognized that Christ has \n     come to bring the good news for you and for me. And as if \n     that was not enough--it was not enough to become a man--he \n     died on the cross to show that greater love, and he died for \n     you and for me and for that leper and for that man dying of \n     hunger and that naked person lying in the street not only of \n     Calcutta, but of Africa, and New York, and London, and Oslo--\n     and insisted that we love one another as he loves each one of \n     us. And we read that in the Gospel very clearly--love as I \n     have loved you--as I love you--as the Father has loved me, I \n     love you--and the harder the Father loved him, he gave him to \n     us, and how much we love one another, we, too, must give each \n     other until it hurts. It is not enough for us to say: I love \n     God, but I do not love my neighbour. St. John says you are a \n     liar if you say you love God and you don't love your \n     neighbour. How can you love God whom you do not see, if you \n     do not love your neighbour whom you see, whom you touch, with \n     whom you live. And so this is very important for us to \n     realize that love, to be true, has to hurt. It hurt Jesus to \n     love us, it hurt him. And to make sure we remember his great \n     love he made himself bread of life to satisfy our hunger for \n     his love. Our hunger for God, because we have been created \n     for that love. We have been created in his image. We have \n     been created to love and be loved, and then he has become man \n     to make it possible for us to love as he loved us. He makes \n     himself the hungry one--the naked one--the homeless one--the \n     sick one--the one in prison--the lonely one--the unwanted \n     one--and he says: You did it to me. Hungry for our love, and \n     this is the hunger of our poor people. This is the hunger \n     that you and I must find, it may be in our own home.\n       I never forget an opportunity I had in visiting a home \n     where they had all these old parents of sons and daughters \n     who had just put them in an institution and forgotten maybe. \n     And I went there, and I saw in that home they had everything, \n     beautiful things, but everybody was looking toward the door. \n     And I did not see a single one with their smile on their \n     face. And I turned to the sister and I asked: How is that? \n     How is it that the people they have everything here, why are \n     they all looking toward the door, why are they not smiling? I \n     am so used to see the smile on our people, even the dying \n     ones smile, and she said: This is nearly every day, they are \n     expecting, they are hoping that a son or daughter will come \n     to visit them. They are hurt because they are forgotten, and \n     see--this is where love comes. That poverty comes right there \n     in our own home, even neglect to love. Maybe in our own \n     family we have somebody who is feeling lonely, who is feeling \n     sick, who is feeling worried, and these are difficult days \n     for everybody. Are we there, are we there to receive them, is \n     the mother there to receive the child?\n       I was surprised in the waste to see so many young boys and \n     girls given into drugs, and I tried to find out why--why is \n     it like that, and the answer was: Because there is no one in \n     the family to receive them. Father and mother are so busy \n     they have no time. Young parents are in some institution and \n     the child takes back to the street and gets involved in \n     something. We are talking of peace. These are things that \n     break peace, but I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today \n     is abortion, because it is a direct war, a direct killing--\n     direct murder by the mother herself. And we read in the \n     Scripture, for God says very clearly. Even if a mother could \n     forget her child--I will not forget you--I have curved you in \n     the palm of my hand. We are curved in the palm of His hand so \n     close to Him that unborn child has been curved in the hand of \n     God. And that is what strikes me most, the beginning of that \n     sentence, that even if a mother could forget something \n     impossible--but even if she could forget--I will not forget \n     your. And today the greatest means--the greatest destroyer of \n     peace is abortion. And we who are standing here--our parents \n     wanted us. We would not be here if our parents would do that \n     to us. Our children, we want them, we love them, but what of \n     the millions. Many people are very, very concerned with the \n     children in India, with the children of Africa where quite a \n     number die, maybe of malnutrition, of hunger and so on, but \n     millions are dying deliberately by the will of the mother. \n     And this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today. \n     Because if a mother can kill her own child--what is left for \n     me to kill you and you to kill me--there is nothing between. \n     And this I appeal in India, I appeal everywhere: Let us bring \n     the child back, and this year being the child's year: What \n     have we done for the child? At the beginning of the year I \n     told, I spoke everywhere and I said: Let us make this year \n     that we make every single child born, and unborn, wanted. And \n     today is the end of the year, have we really made the \n     children wanted? I will give you something terrifying. We \n     are fighting abortion by adoption, we have saved thousands \n     of lives, we have sent words to all the clinics, to the \n     hospitals, police stations--please don't destroy the \n     child, we will take the child. So every hour of the day \n     and night it is always somebody, we have quite a number of \n     unwedded mothers--tell them come, we will take care of \n     you, we will take the child from you, and we will get a \n     home for the child. And we have a tremendous demand for \n     families who have no children, that is the blessing of God \n     for us. And also, we are doing another thing which is very \n     beautiful--we are teaching our beggars, our leprosy \n     patients, our slum dwellers, our people of the street, \n     natural family planning.\n       And in Calcutta alone in six years--it is all in Calcutta--\n     we have had 61,273 babies less from the families who would \n     have had, but because they practice this natural way of \n     abstaining, of self-control, out of love for each other. We \n     teach them the temperature meter which is very beautiful, \n     very simple, and our poor people understand. And you know \n     what they have told me? Our family is healthy, our family is \n     united, and we can have a baby whenever we want. So clear--\n     these people in the street, those beggars--and I think that \n     if our people can do like that how much more you and all the \n     others who can know the ways and means without destroying the \n     life that God has created in us. The poor people are very \n     great people. They can teach us so many beautiful things. The \n     other day one of them came to thank and said: You people who \n     have evolved chastity you are the best people to teach us \n     family planning. Because it is nothing more than self-control \n     out of love for each other. And I think they said a beautiful \n     sentence. And these are people who maybe have nothing to eat, \n     maybe they have not a home where to live, but they are great \n     people. The poor are very wonderful people. One evening we \n     went out and we picked up four people from the street. And \n     one of them was in a most terrible condition--and I told the \n     sisters: You take care of the other three, I take of this one \n     that looked worse. So I did for her all that my love can do. \n     I put her in bed, and there was such a beautiful smile on her \n     face. She took hold of my hand, as she said one word only: \n     Thank you--and she died.\n       I could not help but examine my conscience before her, and \n     I asked what would I say if I was in her place. And my answer \n     was very simple. I would have tried to draw a little \n     attention to myself, I would have said I am hungry, that I am \n     dying, I am cold, I am in pain, or something, but she gave me \n     much more--she gave me her grateful love. And she died with a \n     smile on her face. As that man whom we picked up from the \n     drain, half eaten with worms, and we brought him to the home. \n     I have lived like an animal in the street, but I am going to \n     die like an angel, loved and cared for. And it was so \n     wonderful to see the greatness of that man who could speak \n     like that, who could die like that without blaming anybody, \n     without cursing anybody, without comparing anything. Like an \n     angel--this is the greatness of our people. And that is why \n     we believe what Jesus has said: I was hungry--I was naked--I \n     was homeless--I was unwanted, unloved, uncared for--and you \n     did it to me. I believe that we are not real social workers. \n     We may be doing social work in the eyes of the people, but we \n     are really contemplatives in the heart of the world. For we \n     are touching the body of Christ 24 hours. We have 24 hours in \n     this presence, and so you and I. You too try to bring that \n     presence of God in your family, for the family that prays \n     together stays together. And I think that we in our family \n     we don't need bombs and guns, to destroy to bring peace--\n     just get together, love one another, bring that peace, \n     that joy, that strength of presence of each other in the \n     home. And we will be able to overcome all the evil that is \n     in the world. There is so much suffering, so much hatred, \n     so much misery, and we with our prayer, with our sacrifice \n     are beginning at home. Love begins at home, and it is not \n     how much we do, but how much love we put in the action \n     that we do. It is to God Almighty--how much we do it does \n     not matter, because He is infinite, but how much love we \n     put in that action. How much we do to Him in the person \n     that we are serving. Some time ago in Calcutta we had \n     great difficulty in getting sugar, and I don't know how \n     the word got around to the children, and a little boy of \n     four years old, Hindu boy, went home and told his parents: \n     I will not eat sugar for three days, I will give my sugar \n     to Mother Teresa for her children. After three days his \n     father and mother brought him to our house. I had never \n     met them before, and this little one could scarcely \n     pronounce my name, but he knew exactly what he had come to \n     do. He knew that he wanted to share his love. And this is \n     why I have received such a lot of love from you all. From \n     the time that I have come here I have simply been \n     surrounded with love, and with real, real understanding \n     love. It could feel as if everyone in India, everyone in \n     Africa is somebody very special to you. And I felt quite \n     at home I was telling Sister today. I feel in the Convent \n     with the Sisters as if I am in Calcutta with my own \n     Sisters. So completely at home here, right here. And so \n     here I am talking with you--I want you to find the poor \n     here, right in your own home first. And begin love there. \n     Be that good news to your own people. And find out about \n     your next-door neighbor--do you know who they are? I had \n     the most extraordinary experience with a Hindu family who \n     had eight children. A gentleman came to our house and \n     said: Mother Teresa, there is a family with eight \n     children, they had not eaten for so long--do something. So \n     I took some rice and I went there immediately. And I saw \n     the children--their eyes shining with hunger--I don't know \n     if you have ever seen hunger. But I have seen it very \n     often. And she took the rice, and divided the rice, and \n     she went out. When she came back I asked her--where did \n     you go, what did you do? And she gave me a very simple \n     answer: They are hungry also. What struck me most was that \n     she knew--and who are they, a Muslim family--and she knew. \n     I didn't bring more rice that evening\n\n[[Page S12999]]\n\n     because I wanted them to enjoy the joy of sharing. But \n     there was those children, radiating joy, sharing the joy \n     with their mother because she had the love to give. And \n     you see this is where love begins--at home. And I want \n     you--and I am very grateful for what I have received. It \n     has been a tremendous experience and I go back to India--I \n     will be back by next week, the 15th I hope--and I will be \n     able to bring your love.\n       And I know well that you have not given from your \n     abundance, but you have given until it hurts you. Today the \n     little children they gave--I was so surprised--there is so \n     much joy for the children that are hungry. That the children \n     like themselves will need love and care and tenderness, like \n     they get so much from their parents. So let us thank God that \n     we have had this opportunity to come to know each other, and \n     this knowledge of each other has brought us very close. And \n     we will be able to help not only the children of India and \n     Africa, but will be able to help the children of the whole \n     world, because as you know our Sisters are all over the \n     world. And with this Prize that I have received as a Prize \n     of Peace, I am going to try to make the home for many \n     people that have no home. Because I believe that love \n     begins at home, and if we can create a home for the poor--\n     I think that more and more love will spread. And we will \n     be able through this understanding love to bring peace, be \n     the good news to the poor. The poor in our own family \n     first, in our country and in the world. To be able to do \n     this, our Sisters, our lives have to be woven with prayer. \n     They have to be woven with Christ to be able to \n     understand, to be able to share. Because today there is so \n     much suffering--and I feel that the passion of Christ is \n     being relived all over again--are we there to share that \n     passion, to share that suffering of people. Around the \n     world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the \n     poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When \n     I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a \n     plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have \n     removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that \n     feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has \n     been thrown out from society--that poverty is so hurtable \n     and so much, and I find that very difficult. Our Sisters \n     are working amongst that kind of people in the West. So \n     you must pray for us that we may be able to be that good \n     news, but we cannot do that without you, you have to do \n     that here in your country. You must come to know the poor, \n     maybe our people here have material things, everything, \n     but I think that if we all look into our own homes, how \n     difficult we find it sometimes to smile at each other, and \n     that the smile is the beginning of love. And so let us \n     always meet each other with a smile, for the smile is the \n     beginning of love, and once we begin to love each other \n     naturally we want to do something. So you pray for our \n     Sisters and for me and for our Brothers, and for our co-\n     workers that are around the world. That we may remain \n     faithful to the gift of God, to love Him and serve Him in \n     the poor together with you. What we have done we would not \n     have been able to do if you did not share with your \n     prayers, with your gifts, this continual giving. But I \n     don't want you to give me from your abundance, I want that \n     you give me until it hurts. The other day I received 15 \n     dollars from a man who has been on his back for twenty \n     years, and the only part that he can move is his right \n     hand. And the only companion that he enjoys is smoking. \n     And he said to me: I do not smoke for one week, and I send \n     you this money. It must have been a terrible sacrifice for \n     him, but see how beautiful, how he shared, and with that \n     money I bought bread and I gave to those who are hungry \n     with a joy on both sides, he was giving and the poor were \n     receiving. This is something that you and I--it is a gift \n     of God to us to be able to share our love with others. And \n     let it be as it was for Jesus. Let us love one another as \n     he loved us. Let us love Him with undivided love. And the \n     joy of loving Him and each other--let us give now--that \n     Christmas is coming so close. Let us keep that joy of \n     loving Jesus in our hearts. And share that joy with all \n     that we come in touch with. And that radiating joy is \n     real, for we have no reason not to be happy because we \n     have Christ with us. Christ in our hearts, Christ in the \n     poor that we meet, Christ in the smile that we give and \n     the smile that we receive. Let us make that one point: \n     That no child will be unwanted, and also that we meet each \n     other always with a smile, especially when it is difficult \n     to smile.\n       I never forget some time ago about 14 professors came from \n     the United States from different universities. And they came \n     to Calcutta to our house. Then we were talking about home for \n     the dying in Calcutta, where we have picked up more than \n     36,000 people only from the streets of Calcutta, and out of \n     that big number more than 18,000 have died a beautiful death. \n     They have just gone home to God; and they came to our house \n     and we talked of love, of compassion, and then one of them \n     asked me: Say, Mother, please tell us something that we will \n     remember, and I said to them: Smile at each other, make time \n     for each other in your family. Smile at each other. And then \n     another one asked me: Are you married, and I said: Yes, and I \n     find it sometimes very difficult to smile at Jesus because he \n     can be very demanding sometimes. This is really something \n     true, and there is where love comes--when it is demanding, \n     and yet we can give it to Him with joy. Just as I have said \n     today, I have said that if I don't go to Heaven for anything \n     else I will be going to Heaven for all the publicity because \n     it has purified me and sacrificed me and made me really \n     something ready to go to Heaven. I think that this is \n     something, that we must live life beautifully, we have Jesus \n     with us and He loves us. If we could only remember that God \n     loves me, and I have an opportunity to love others as He \n     loves me, not in big things, but in small things with great \n     love, then Norway becomes a nest of love. And how beautiful \n     it will be that from here a centre for peace of war has been \n     given. That from here the joy of life of the unborn child \n     comes out. If you become a burning light in the world of \n     peace, then really the Nobel Peace Prize is a gift of the \n     Norwegian people. God bless you!\n\n  I simply wanted to put Mother Teresa's speech here again as a \nreminder to us of one of the great people of the world of our time, one \nthat we have had the pleasure of having in this body, and that at the \nface of all this, we are really talking about peace. We are talking \nabout a caring peace.\n  I hope that we can move forward as a society, whether we want to do \nit by laws or not by laws. If we want to do it, we are persuading \npeople's hearts. What we are talking about is the peace of that \nindividual, and peace of mind, caring, caring through adoption.\n  I hope we can move our hearts--all of us, whether we disagree or \nagree on the legislation--forward to reach out to that child and to \nthose children the way she did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S12999-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12999-S13000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DAY OF NATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today has been designated by the Senate \nas a ``Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' \nSadly, thus far, the Senate seems indifferent to that fact.\n  Despite repeated acts of gun violence, the conference on the juvenile \njustice bill, which was convened 77 days ago, has yet to complete its \nbusiness. While the conference is stalled, more and more children are \nlosing their lives.\n  Every day in the United States, 12 children under the age of 19 are \nkilled with guns--1 child every 2 hours. Every day, three children \ncommit suicide using a firearm. Every day, approximately six children \nare murdered by gunfire. Between 1979 and 1997, gunfire killed nearly \n80,000 children and teens in America, more than the total number of \nsoldiers lost in the Vietnam war. In fact, homicide is the third \nleading cause of death among children ages 5 to 14.\n  That is why Senator Murray and others worked so hard to pass the \nresolution that declared today, this day, the ``Day of National Concern \nabout Young People and Gun Violence.''\n  The good news is that the number of children dying from gunfire has \ndeclined. Moreover, children across the country are engaged in positive \nendeavors to rid their communities of violence and to encourage their \nfriends to find peaceful ways to settle disputes.\n  This week, the Democrats in the House of Representatives hosted 300 \nteenagers from across the country for a conference entitled ``Voices \nAgainst Violence.'' At this conference, teens discussed their concerns \nabout violence and explored ideas for addressing this pressing problem.\n  Senate Democrats believe we, in the Senate, must join America's \nchildren and do our part to stem that violence. That is why we fought \nso hard to pass a comprehensive juvenile justice bill that included \ncommon sense gun safety provisions, money for programs designed to \nprevent violence before it occurs, and measures to ensure that those \nfew kids who are truly dangerous are punished appropriately.\n  On May 20th the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill, and on June \n17th the House passed their juvenile justice bill. After waiting weeks, \non August 5th--77 days ago--the juvenile justice conference had its \nfirst and only meeting. Yesterday marked the 6-month anniversary of the \nColumbine tragedy, and it is time for the stalling to stop.\n  The Y2K legislation conference report was produced 14 days after the \nSenate passed the bill, and the Republican tax cut conference report \nwas produced only 5 days after the Senate voted on that package. Why \ndon't we have the same commitment to producing legislation to combat \nyouth violence?\n  The conference should be working around the clock to produce a bill \nthe\n\n[[Page S13000]]\n\nPresident can sign before the end of this session. We ought to use this \nday and every day to ensure that this juvenile justice bill is passed \nand to ensure that we live up to the expectations of all who said on \nthe day when we passed the ``Day of National Concern about Young People \nand Gun Violence\" legislation that it was more than just words, it was \nmore than just a rhetorical commitment, it meant sincerely that the \nSenate was serious about addressing this issue. Indeed, we remind our \ncolleagues that thus far, our children have waited too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, for bringing to the attention of the Senate this extremely \nimportant day, October 21. It is the Day of National Concern about \nYoung People and Gun Violence. This is a day that all Members in the \nSenate have recognized as a day we want young people everywhere to take \na pledge to not bring a gun to school and to resolve their conflicts \nwithout using a gun. It is a very important message.\n  This is a bipartisan message. Senator Kempthorne and I began this \neffort 4 years ago. This year, Senator John Warner and I put this \nresolution forward in a bipartisan way. It was supported by all Members \nof the Senate. It is a simple message to young children. Millions of \nthem today took the pledge and joined with others in their community to \ntake the power of reducing violence into their own hands.\n  As leaders of the United States, we have a responsibility to do all \nwe can to reduce youth violence in this country. We need to stand \nbehind these young kids who are taking violence and the issue of \nviolence in their own hands and say we, as the leaders of this country, \nstand with you.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for his statement, for bringing to the \nattention of the Senate our responsibility as adults to reduce the \nnumber of guns to which our young kids have access, and urge our \ncolleagues to move forward on these critical issues that have been left \nbehind in this session of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday was the 6 month anniversary of \nthe shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. Fourteen \nstudents and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, \n1999. But still the Congressional leadership refuses to send to the \nPresident comprehensive juvenile justice legislation.\n  This is shameful.\n  As we have for months now, Senate and House Democrats stand ready to \nwork with Republicans to enact into law an effective juvenile justice \nconference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions. \nYesterday, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter \nto Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde calling for an open meeting of \nthe juvenile justice conference.\n  We need to bring this up. Vote it up. Vote it down. I don't know what \neverybody is scared of. But at least let's vote.\n  This delay is simply because of the opposition of the gun lobby to \nany new firearm safety laws. Even though the Senate passed the Hatch-\nLeahy Juvenile Justice Bill in May, we still have not moved forward on \na juvenile justice conference report.\n  I hope the majority will hear the call of our nation's law \nenforcement officers to act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile \njustice conference report.\n  Ten national law enforcement organizations, representing thousands of \nlaw enforcement officers, yesterday endorsed the Senate-passed gun \nsafety amendments and support loophole-free firearm laws: International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers; Police Executive Research Forum; Police Foundation; Major \nCities Chiefs; Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; National \nSheriffs Association; National Association of School Resource Officers; \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; and Hispanic \nAmerican Police Command Officers Association.\n  Law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns \nout of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking \nabout people who use guns for hunting or for sport, but about criminals \nand unsupervised children.\n  The thousands of law enforcement officers represented by these \norganizations are demanding that Congress act now to pass a strong and \neffective juvenile justice conference report. As a conferee, I am ready \nto work with Republicans and Democrats to do just that.\n  According to press reports, the Republicans are meeting and having \nsensitive negotiations over gun proposals. Apparently, the Republicans \non the conference and the Republican leadership met last Thursday to \nhammer out an agreement on guns. They were not successful. Bicameral \nRepublican meetings cannot be confused with bipartisan conference \nmeetings. Only in open conference meetings with an opportunity for full \ndebate will we be able to resolve the differences in the juvenile \njustice bills and get a law enacted.\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about \nschool violence over the last two years and worried about when the next \nshooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school \nor involve their children.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, \neffective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out \nof the hands of children and away from criminals.\n  I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile \njustice conference. It is well past the time for Congress to act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe).

Madam President, seven years ago legislation was enacted, \nwith my support, to create a memorial on the National Mall honoring \nThomas Paine. A site has been selected and approved at 1776 \nConstitution Ave. However, the memorial project needs to be \nreauthorized until 2003 in order to raise the necessary funding to \ncomplete construction. Today I want to spend a moment to recognize the \ngreat American patriot, Thomas Paine.\n  Thomas Paine thrived on new ideas, was broad minded and progressive. \nThrough brilliantly written persuasion, he advocated four concepts \nwhich have since become cornerstones of American society and \ngovernance: independence, representation, unity, and leadership. Thomas \nPaine was the first patriot to call for a ``Declaration of \nIndependence'' and a ``Continental Charter'' which proposed the basic \nprinciples of our constitution: ``securing freedom and property . . . \nand above all things, the free exercise of religion.''\n  Another cornerstone was laid when Paine had the foresight and courage \nto publicly advocate a representative, democratic/republican form of \ngovernment for this country. He influenced George Washington and \nnumerous other Revolution leaders as he stressed that government was a \nnecessary evil which could only become safe when it was representative \nand altered by frequent elections. The function of government's role in \nsociety ought only be to regulate society and therefore be as simple as \npossible.\n  Paine also introduced our status as a united, sovereign country with \ndue regard for individual and states rights. He coined the phrases \n``Free and Independent States of America'' and ``United States of \nAmerica.''\n  The last cornerstone that Thomas Paine set for our country was the \nconcept of a world leader fighting for human rights. Paine publicly \ndenounced chattel slavery and was the first patriot to publish a \ndefense of the rights of women in America. In his papers American \nCrisis I, Paine wrote:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. . . . Tyranny, \n     like hell, is not easily conquered; . . . What we obtain too \n     cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives \n     every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price \n     upon its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so \n     celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.\n\n  Paine has often been quoted by the leaders of this country on the \ngreat ideas of American independence, freedom and democracy--concepts \nwhich he was and still is unmatched in expressing. Without Paine's \nvision and initiative, our country would not be the republican world \npower that it is today.\n  I am honored to have been able to help authorize his memorial seven \nyears ago. I introduced S. 1681 to reauthorize the memorial until 2003 \nand I am glad that language from S. 1681 has been included in this bill \nto let this important work continue. Americans will be remembering \nThomas Paine for generations to come, because of what we are doing \ntoday.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I rise today to congratulate Senator Gorton on his \ngood work on the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill. I know \nthe negotiations which led to this conference report were difficult but \nI believe Senator Gorton and the other Senate conferees did an \nexcellent job under these trying circumstances. I hope that President \nClinton recognizes this and signs this appropriations bill into law.\n  Today, I want to highlight one particular program which has been the \nsubject of recent focus both in the Congress and in the Clinton \nAdministration--the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF Act \nauthorizes the expenditure of monies from the LWCF for two purposes \nonly: the acquisition of Federal land by the National Park Service, the \nBureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \nUnited States Forest Service; and formula grants to states for park and \nrecreation projects. The LWCF Act creates a balance--between the State \nand local communities and the Federal government; between urban and \nrural communities; between the western and eastern states--for the \ndevelopment of outdoor recreation resources.\n  Unfortunately, over the last four years the balance between the state \nand Federal-sides of the LWCF has been eliminated. With the action of \nthe Clinton Administration and the Congress to shut-down the state-side \nLWCF matching grant program in fiscal year 1996, the LWCF has become a \nFederal-only land acquisition program. As I have expressed before, I \nbelieve the loss of this balance is a tragic mistake and serves to \nincrease the already significant pressure on the Federal government to \nmeet the recreation demands of the American public.\n  I have worked tirelessly over the last 3 years to restore the state-\nside LWCF matching grant program. This year those efforts have reaped \nresults. Interior conferees provided $20 million for the state-side \nmatching grant program. While I wish more money could have been \nprovided, with tough budget targets, it was not easy to find $20 \nmillion in such a lean bill. It is a start.\n  I also would like to thank Senator Gorton for ensuring that no \nlimitations are placed on the expenditure of this money. It is \nimportant that States and local governments have the flexibility to \ndetermine how best to meet the recreation needs of their citizens.\n  There may be a need for changes to the state-wide LWCF matching grant \nprogram. However, it is not appropriate to make these changes on an \nappropriations bill. The President's budget proposal sought to \nfundamentally restructure the state-side matching grant program \nauthorized by the LWCF Act. The LWCF state-side program is a formula \ngrant program which provides monies to States and local communities for \nthe planning, acquisition, and development of parks and recreation \nfacilities. The President proposed to replace this program with a \ncompetitive grant program to the States for the purchase of land and \nopen space planning. This proposal would have changed the focus of the \nstate-side program and undercut the Federalism inherent in the existing \nprogram. The Federal government should not dictate a one-size fits all \nmandate for the administration of this program.\n  State-side LWCF matching grants, which address the highest priority \nneeds of Americans for outdoor recreation, have helped finance well \nover 37,500 park and recreation projects throughout the United States. \nThe state-side of the LWCF has played a vital role in providing \nrecreational and educational opportunities to millions of Americans. \nThe state-side program has worked because it has provided States and \nlocal communities--not the Federal government--with the flexibility to \ndetermine how best to meet the recreational needs of its residents. \nThis $20 million will begin the process of saving this important \nprogram.\n  The Interior conference report also provides more than $230 million \nfor land acquisition by the four Federal land management agencies \nincluding $40 million for the acquisition of Baca Ranch in New Mexico. \nA few months ago the President announced an agreement to purchase this \nproperty for $101 million. I have not taken a position on the merits of \nthe Baca Ranch acquisition but have an interest in this matter as \nchairman of the authorizing committee.\n  No money can be appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation \nFund for the acquisition of Federal land, including Baca Ranch, in the \nabsence of an authorization. The Federal-side LWCF program provides \nmonies for the Federal land management agencies to acquire lands \notherwise authorized for acquisition. The LWCF Act does not provide an \nindependent basis for Federal land acquisition. Rather, the LWCF Act \nestablishes a funding mechanism for the acquisition of Federal lands \nwhich have been separately authorized. Section 7 of the statute \nspecifies, with limited exceptions, that LWCF monies cannot be used for \na Federal land purchase ``unless such acquisition is otherwise \nauthorized by law.''\n\n  The Interior conference report recognizes this limitation by making \nthe acquisition of the Baca Ranch contingent\n\n[[Page S13002]]\n\non the enactment of authorizing legislation. No matter what the fate of \nthe Interior appropriations bill this contingency must be included. It \nis bad public policy to disregard the terms of the LWCF Act and expend \nthis significant amount of money for the purchase of additional Federal \nproperty absent a thorough, and open, public review. This review can be \nbest done in the authorizing committee. I want to thank Senator Gorton, \nwho sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for recognizing \nthe need for specific authorizing legislation and including this \ncontingency.\n  The Interior conference report also requires that the General \nAccounting Office review and report on the Baca Ranch appraisal. The \nUniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act \nrequires an appraisal of the fair market value of private property the \nFederal government desires to acquire, whether through negotiations or \ncondemnation. An appraisal has been done on the Baca Ranch. However, \nthe appraisal was conducted not by the Federal government but rather \nthe seller. While I have no reason to doubt the validity of the \nappraisal, before Congress spends this significant amount of money to \npurchase the Baca Ranch, Congress owes it to the American taxpayer to \nensure that the $101 million sale price represents the actual fair \nmarket value of the property. The General Accounting Office is the \nappropriate entity to conduct this review and report to the \nappropriators and the authorizers.\n  As many of us remember from two years ago, the conditions imposed on \nthe Baca Ranch purchase are consistent with the requirements the Senate \nimposed on the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine purchases. \nUnfortunately, these conditions were eliminated in conference and both \nacquisitions were authorized on the fiscal year 1998 Interior \nappropriations bill. That is wrong. Clearly by agreeing to placing \nthese limitations on the Baca Ranch acquisition, the House has realized \nthat authorizing, the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions \nin the appropriations bill was bad public policy. It is the role of the \nauthorizing committee--not the appropriators--to make sure that any \naddition to the Federal estate is warranted.\n  There has been talk about the next step in the process. There are \nrumors that the President will not sign this conference report because \nhe is disappointed that his Lands Legacy proposal was not totally \nfunded. I hope that is not true but if it is I find this reasoning \nnonsensical. The Lands Legacy proposal is nothing but budget gimmicky. \nIt seeks to charge against the $900 million LWCF ceiling the increased \nfunding of a variety of programs not authorized to derived monies from \nthe LWCF. These programs, which may or may not warrant increased \nFederal funding, already have independent authorizations. By engaging \nin this accounting game, the President artificially reduces the amounts \navailable for programs authorized by the LWCF Act, including the state-\nside matching grant program. If the President seeks to fund these \nprograms from the LWCF, he needs to introduce appropriate authorizing \nlegislation and work with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to \naccomplish this goal.\n  Finally--and most disturbing to me as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee--are indications that the Clinton \nAdministration wants to permanently authorize the use of revenues from \nthe Outer Continental Shelf for the Lands Legacy proposal in either the \nInterior appropriations bill or an omnibus appropriations bill. I \nsupport the use of OCS revenues as a permanent funding source for a \nvariety of important conservation programs, in fact I introduced S. 25, \nthe Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999, to accomplish this goal.\n  However, no matter how strong my support is for this goal, providing \nthis authorization on any appropriations bill is wrong. This \nproposition is extremely controversial. In the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, we have held hearing after hearing on S. 25 and \nother OCS revenue sharing proposals. Since completion of those \nhearings, committee members have struggled to reach a compromise. We \nhave struggled because, while every committee member cares about the \nconservation of this nation's natural resources, we each have a \ndifferent vision as to how best to conserve and protect these \nresources. But no matter how difficult this challenge, we will continue \nto strive to reach an agreement that is acceptable not only to the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee but also to the Senate.\n  What the Clinton administration is contemplating would be a unrivaled \nusurpation of the authorizing committees. If the most significant piece \nof conservation legislation introduced in the last 30 years is enacted \non an appropriations bill without any public input or participation, \nall of us who are authorizers should turn in our gavels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S13002-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13002-S13006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar \nNo. 215, H.R. 434, the trade bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 215.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa has been \ngenerous enough to let me speak a very short while on this measure, to \ntell you at the time we get on the bill the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, who cannot be here at this moment, will offer a manager's \namendment which includes the sub-Saharan Africa bill which we are now \ntechnically on, with the Caribbean Basin Initiative bill, as well as \nthe reauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences and the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance programs. These measures have been reported \nby the Committee on Finance by an all but unanimous vote, voice vote, \nin all these cases. We very much hope we will bring this to a \nsuccessful conclusion.\n  At stake is two-thirds of a century of American trade policy going \nback to the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 for which there is \na history. Cordell Hull began the policy, under President Roosevelt.\n  In 1930, the Senate and the House passed what became known as the \nSmoot-Hawley tariff. If you were to make a short list of five events \nthat led to the Second World War, that would be one of them. The \ntariffs went to unprecedented heights here. As predicted, imports \ndropped by two-thirds, but as was not predicted so did exports. What \nhad been a market correction--more than that, the stock market collapse \nin 1929--moved into a long depression from which we never emerged until \nthe Second World War.\n  The British went off free trade to Commonwealth preferences, the \nJapanese began the Greater East Asian Coprosperity Sphere, and in 1933, \nwith unemployment at 25 percent, Adolph Hitler came into power as \nChancellor of Germany. That sort of misses our memory. In 1934, Cordell \nHull, Secretary of State, began the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program \nwhich was designed to bring down, by bilateral negotiations, the levels \nof tariffs. This has continued through administration after \nadministration without exception since that time.\n  I would like to note in the bill we have before us that there are two \nmeasures of very large importance, both of which have expired. Unless \nwe move now, we will again lose immeasurably important trade provisions \nfor us.\n  The first of these is the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which \nis now in its 37th year. I can stand here as one of the few persons--I \nsuppose the only--who served in the administration of John F. Kennedy. \nI was an Assistant Secretary of Labor. President Kennedy had sent up a \nvery ambitious bill, the Trade Expansion Act. It was really the only \nmajor legislation of his first term. It required, in order to meet the \nlegitimate concerns of southern textile manufacturers and northern \nclothing unions--needle trades, let's say--that we get a long-term \ncotton textile agreement which Secretary Blumenthal, Secretary Hickman \nPrice, Jr., and I negotiated in Geneva successfully. True to their \nword, the Southern Senators came right up to this measure and voted for \nit. But we added something special, which was trade adjustment \nassistance.\n\n[[Page S13003]]\n\n  We agreed in a free trading situation, or freer trade situation, the \neconomy at large and the population at large would be better off, but \nsome would lose. Trade adjustment assistance was to deal with that \nsituation. It had been first proposed, oddly, by a fine labor leader, \nDavid MacDonald, of the United Steel Workers, in 1954, saying if we are \ngoing to have lower barriers to trade, we are going to lose some jobs; \ngain others. It was based on a modest and fair request from American \nlabor: If some workers are to lose their jobs as a result of freer \ntrade that benefits the country as a whole, a program should be \nestablished to help those workers find new employment.\n  It was Luther Hodges, Secretary of Commerce under President Kennedy, \nwho came before the Finance Committee to propose this measure. \nSecretary Hodges was the Governor of North Carolina, was he not? A \nwonderful man; I recall working with him. I know the Senator from South \nCarolina would. He said to the Finance Committee that ``the Federal \nGovernment has a special responsibility in this case. When the \nGovernment has contributed to economic injuries, it should also \ncontribute to the economic adjustments required to repair them.''\n\n  This has been in law, and we added a special program for NAFTA, and \nfor firms as well. It has been there for 37 years. The program has now \nexpired. The continuing resolution keeps it going for 3 weeks or \nwhatever, but if we lose this we lose a central feature of social \nlegislation that has allowed us to become the world's greatest trading \nnation with the most extraordinary prosperity in the course of a \ngeneration.\n  There is also the matter of the Generalized System of Preferences for \nthe developing world. It was a response to a plea by developing \ncountries that the industrial world ought to give them an opportunity \nand a bit of incentive to compete in world markets; not to beg for aid, \njust to buy and sell. It has been in our legislation since the Trade \nAct of 1974, which makes it a quarter century in place. It was renewed \nin 1984. It is now on life support. We got a 15-month extension in \n1993; a 10-month extension in 1994; 10 months in early 1996; 13 months \nin early 1997; 12 months in 1998.\n  We have responsibility in both of these matters. The Finance \nCommittee has met that responsibility. In due course, we will bring \nthis measure to the floor for what we hope will be a successful vote on \nrenewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance and a 5-year reauthorization of \nthe Generalized System of Preferences.\n  I do not want to keep the Senate any longer. I see my distinguished \ncolleague is on the floor. I thank my friend from Iowa, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, it is an agreed fact among our \ncolleagues in the Senate there is no member more steeped in history and \nerudite in its intellectual history than our distinguished senior \nSenator from New York, Mr. Moynihan. I agree with him absolutely with \nrespect to Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Act and a variety of initiatives made since that time.\n  I have to oppose the motion because I am the one who objected, of \ncourse, to this so-called sub-Sahara/CBI bill.\n  One, with respect to Smoot-Hawley, it did not cause the depression \nand World War II. I want to disabuse anybody's mind from that \nparticular suggestion. The stock market crash occurred in October 1929, \nand Smoot-Hawley was not passed until 8 months later in June of 1930.\n  At that particular time, slightly less than 1 percent of the GNP was \nin international trade. It is now up to 17 percent. At that time trade \ndid not have that big an effect on the GNP or the economy of the United \nStates itself. True, Germany, Europe, and everybody else was in a \ndepression, and we entered the depression as a result of the crash.\n  Along came Cordell Hull. I want to emphasize one concept: the \nReciprocal Trade Act of 1934; reciprocity; not foreign aid but foreign \ntrade; a thing of value for an exchange of value. We learned that in \nContracts 101 as lawyers.\n  Somehow over the past several years we have gotten into ``we have to \ndo something.'' We are the most powerful Nation militarily and \neconomically; perhaps not the richest. We do not have the largest per \ncapita income. We are down to about No. 8 or 9. We are not the richest, \nbut we are very affluent comparatively speaking.\n  The urge is there, and I understand that urge to want to help, but we \ngave at the office. Let me tell you when I gave at the office, for my \ntextile friends.\n  We have been giving and giving and giving. We had a hearing before \nthe International Trade Commission. It was the Eisenhower \nadministration at that particular time. I came to testify as the \nGovernor of South Carolina. The finding was in June of 1960. It was in \nearly March of 1960. I was chased around the room by none other than \nTom Dewey. He was a lawyer for the Japanese. They were not a concern at \nthe particular time. Ten percent of textiles consumed in America was \nbeing imported, and if we went beyond the 10 percent, it was determined \nthat it would devastate the economy, particularly the textile economy \nof the United States of America.\n  I am looking around this room, and I can tell you that over two-\nthirds--that is a 2-year-old figure; I bet it is up to 70 percent--but \ntwo-thirds of the clothing I am looking at, not 10 percent, is \nimported.\n  When I say we gave at the office again and again--I can go to Desert \nStorm, and I will do that, and how we gave Turkey a couple of billion \ndollars in increased textile imports, how we bought this crowd off, and \nevery time we have a crisis, whatever it is, we give to people who ask \nfor our help.\n  My point is, at that particular time, I left that hearing. I had a \ngood Republican friend who knew President Eisenhower. We checked in \nwith Jerry Parsons. I can still see him in the outer office. He said: \nThe Chief can see you now. We went in and saw President Eisenhower and \nhe was committed to helping the textile industry. But by June, it had \ngone the other way.\n  As a young Democratic southern Governor, I said: I am going to try \nthat fellow Kennedy. I had never been with him, but I came up in August \nand sat down with Mike Feldman. He is still alive and can verify this. \nHe was legislative assistant to John F. Kennedy. I can show my \ncolleagues the office in the old Russell Building. We sat down and \nagreed that I will write this letter as a Governor and Senator Kennedy \nwill write back because being from Massachusetts, he understood the \ndesperate nature of the textile economy at that time. We exchanged \nletters. I will have to get that letter because our revered leader of \nthat particular administration was, of course, and is still revered \nnow, the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan. He knows this more \nintimately than I, but I know this particular part of it.\n  We sat down and agreed because there was a national security \nprovision. Before the President could take executive action, there had \nto be a finding that a particular commodity was important to the \nnational security of the United States of America. We got the Secretary \nof Labor Arthur Goldberg, Secretary of Commerce Luther Hodges, \nSecretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary McNamara of Defense, and Doug \nDillon, Secretary of the Treasury. He was most interested. I sat down \nand talked with Secretary Dillon. He was fully briefed from my northern \ntextile friends.\n\n  Incidentally, the Northern Textile Association met last weekend down \nin my hometown with Karl Spilhaus. Bill Sullivan previously ran the \norganization.\n  We brought in witnesses. We had hearings. And about April 26 they \nmade a finding. Steel was the most important industry to our national \neconomy and second most important to our national security was \ntextiles. We could not send our soldiers to war in a Japanese uniform, \nand I used to add to that, and Gucci shoes.\n  Eighty-six percent of the shoes in this Chamber today are imported. \nThe shoe industry is practically gone. Textiles are about gone, and \nWashington is telling them: You have to get high-tech, high-tech, \nglobal economy, global competition, retrain--it sounds like Mao Tse-\ntung running around reeducating the people, getting them skills.\n  We are closing down our knitting mills, one in particular was the \nOneida\n\n[[Page S13004]]\n\nMill. They made T-shirts. They had 487 employees. The average age was \n47.\n  Tomorrow morning, let's say we have done it Washington's way, we have \nreeducated and trained the 487 employees, and now they are skilled \ncomputer operators. Are you going to hire a 47-year-old computer \noperator or the 21-year-old computer operator? You are not going to \ntake on those health costs; you are not going to take on those \nretirement costs.\n  The little town of Andrew, SC, is high and dry, as are many other \ntowns with so-called low unemployment, low inflation. Since NAFTA, \nSouth Carolina has lost 31,700 textile jobs. The reason I know that \nfigure is because I talked with the Northern Textile Association last \nweekend. I am briefed on this particular subject.\n  What we have in the CBI/sub-Sahara--the intent is good, to help--but \nwe cannot afford any longer to give away these critical industries \nimportant to our national security.\n  Specifically, I was with Akio Morita in Chicago in the early \neighties. He was talking about the Third World developing and the \ndeveloping countries. He said they must develop a strong manufacturing \ncapacity in order to become a nation state.\n  Later on he said ``And by the way, Senator, the world power that \nloses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.''\n  Look at the back page of the U.S. News & World Report of last week, \nand the comments our friend Mort Zuckerman. You can see we are getting \na divided society. We are losing those middle-class jobs. Henry Ford \nsaid: I want my workers to make enough to be able to buy what they are \nmaking. And our strong manufacturing economy has been drained \novernight.\n  I will bring a list of the particular items, including textiles where \nimport penetration is high. So when you get and look at the CBI, and \nyou look at the sub-Sahara, it is NAFTA without--and I don't think \nNAFTA worked at all--without the advantages of NAFTA; namely, the side \nagreements on the environment, the side agreements on labor, the \nreciprocity. There is no reciprocity. If we are going to let their \nproducts come in duty free, we should tell them to lower their tariffs.\n  So this is a bad bill, to begin with. It should not have passed, \nalmost unanimously, in that Finance Committee. They ought to look at \nthese things more thoroughly. But the point is, we have to maintain \nthese manufacturing jobs.\n  I can remember when I was a child--and I know the distinguished \nSenator from New York would remember--the last call for breakfast, Don \nMcNeil and ``Breakfast Club'' up there in Chicago.\n  I feel like this is sort of the last call tonight for my textile \nfriends. We will get into it more thoroughly because it isn't just the \ntextile people. The truth is, I didn't carry Anderson, Greenville, and \nSpartanburg Counties, which have all the textile votes. They are going \nto be voting--you watch them--for George W. Bush. They have already \nmade up their mind. They don't care about the campaign. We had them \ngoing Democratic only one time since Kennedy, and that was just \nmomentarily for Jimmy Carter. We gave Barry Goldwater more votes, in \nthe 1964 race, than he got in Arizona; percentage-wise and number-wise, \nboth.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, yes. Barry used to love to kid me about that. So I \nknow from whence I am coming. It is just that it is terrible to see \nthis thing happen all around you. And the new, jobs and all the so-\ncalled new employment is going into retailing, and they are getting \npaid next to nothing. They will not even assume the health costs and \neverything else of that kind. So it is a real issue.\n  And they always do this to me. They did NAFTA right at the end of the \nsession. Then on GATT, I had to make them come back after the election. \nNow we have another 10 days, and they want to raise it. And I have to \nmake the same motion not to proceed.\n  I do appreciate the leadership and the brilliance of my leader, \nSenator Moynihan, of our Finance Committee. I thank him for his \ncourtesy. But I am going to have to continue to object to moving to \nconsider and proceeding on this particular measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Bravissimo.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, it is my privilege, for a few moments, to take the \nplace of our distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nwho will be here shortly, and in my capacity as chairman of that \ncommittee's Subcommittee on International Trade, to speak for our side \nin support of this legislation.\n  From the standpoint of speaking for our side, this is pretty much a \nbipartisan approach that will have overwhelming support. It is all the \nmore a privilege to work for legislation that does have such broad \nbipartisan support.\n  So, Madam President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 434. When we have the opportunity, we intend to offer a managers' \namendment. And we would do that as a substitute for the House-passed \nlanguage. That substitute will include the Senate Finance Committee's \nreported bills on Africa, an expansion of the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, and \nthe reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act.\n  I want to explain the intent behind these different Finance Committee \nbills that will be grouped together in the managers' amendment.\n  Africa, as everyone knows, has undergone significant changes, as \nrecently as the last decade. Many of those changes have been enormously \npositive: an end to apartheid in South Africa, a groundswell in support \nof democracy in a number of the sub-Saharan countries, and a new \nopenness to using the power of free markets to drive economic growth, \nwith the resultant raising of living standards.\n  At the same time, there is no continent that has suffered more from \nthe ravages of war, disease, hunger, and just simple want than Africa. \nThe daily news has more often been filled with the images of violence \nand starvation than the small seeds of economic hope.\n  The question before us is, How can our great country, the United \nStates, help the transition that Africans themselves have begun?\n  There are many problems we might try to address and an equal number \nof approaches to solving those problems. I am not going to argue that \nour managers' amendment we will offer is an entire panacea; nor is it \nequal to the tasks that our African partners have before them in the \nsense that if there is going to be real change there, it has to come \nfrom within.\n  Instead, what our approach attempts to do is to take a small but very \nsignificant step towards opening markets to African trade. The intent \nis to encourage productive investment there as a means of building a \nmarket economy and doing it from the ground up.\n  It is a means of giving Africans the opportunity to guide their own \neconomic destiny rather than the economic policies of the past that \nattempted to dictate a particular model of development that was based \nupon so much government control of the economy.\n  The strongest endorsement I can offer for moving this legislation \ncomes from these African countries themselves. Every one of the sub-\nSaharan African nations eligible for the benefits under this proposal \nhas endorsed our efforts. There was a recent full-page advertisement in \nRoll Call that you may have seen recounting the number of U.S. \norganizations that support this initiative. They range from the NAACP \nto the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the National Council \nof Churches.\n  Our supporters include such notables as Coretta Scott King, Andrew \nYoung, and Robert Johnson--the head of Black Entertainment Television \nwho testified eloquently about the need to create new economic \nopportunities in Africa when he appeared before our Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  The effort to move the bill also enjoys broad bipartisan support that \nI have already alluded to and complimented our colleagues on. It goes \nbeyond bipartisanship in this body. It goes to the President himself \nbecause in his State of the Union Address, he identified this bill as \none of his top foreign policy and trade priorities. The Finance \nCommittee's ranking member, as you have already heard, Senator\n\n[[Page S13005]]\n\nMoynihan, is a cosponsor and public supporter of the Africa bill, along \nwith being a tireless advocate of trade expansion in both word and deed \nover several decades.\n  The distinguished minority leader was one of the first to recognize \nthe need for a special focus on Africa in trade terms when he called \nfor such a program as part of the Uruguay Round implementing \nlegislation that passed this body 4 years ago. And, the very fact the \nmajority leader has found time for us to debate this bill this late in \nthis session, when there is so much pressure to address other issues, \nis indicative of our majority leader's support.\n  So in summation, you can see strong bipartisan support exists for the \nmanagers' amendment, and that the managers' amendment will also include \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative.\n  The approach adopted by the Finance Committee is consistent with the \nadministration's own proposal. It is also broadly consistent with the \nproposal introduced by Senator Graham, who has also been a tireless \nadvocate on behalf of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the \nopportunity that that bill and that program provide for the beneficiary \ncountries in the Caribbean and Central America.\n  In substance, the managers' amendment on CBI adopts an approach \nsimilar to that afforded sub-Saharan Africa under the proposed bill. \nIndeed, both of those proposals build on the model established with the \npassage of the original CBI legislation, I believe, now, 15 or 16 years \nago.\n  In fact, it was 1983 that that bill was adopted. When it was adopted, \nthe region was beset with economic problems and wrenched with civil \nstrife. The goal of the original legislation was to encourage new \neconomic opportunities and a path towards both political and economic \nrenewal. It accomplished that by offering a unilateral grant of tariff \npreferences designed to encourage productive investment, economic \ngrowth, and the resultant higher standard of living.\n  The original Caribbean Basin Initiative, which we made permanent in \n1990, recognized that economic hope was essential to peace and \npolitical stability throughout the region. However, since 1990 we have \nhad the intervening negotiation of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, and that undercut the preferences initially offered to the \nCaribbean and Central American beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative.\n  So the managers' amendment we will offer is an attempt to restore \nthat margin of preference to the Caribbean producers and the economic \nopportunity the original CBI legislation was designed to create.\n  It is also an attempt to respond to the hardships the region has \nfaced due to natural disaster. That region, as we know, including both \nthe Caribbean and Central America, has been hard hit in the past 2 \nyears by a series of hurricanes that in some instances devastated much \nof the existing economic infrastructure. No one can forget the pictures \nof devastation we saw of the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and \nHonduras following Hurricane Mitch--homes, farms, factories, we saw on \ntelevision, literally washing away overnight, buried in clay.\n  Members of the Finance Committee and many of our other colleagues had \nthe opportunity to meet recently with the presidents of a number of \nCentral American countries. Those presidents indicated that the single \nmost important action we in the United States and our Government could \ntake in their interest was not foreign assistance but economic \nopportunity to compete in a growing regional market.\n  They saw this proposed legislation as a fulfillment of the promise \nextended by this Congress in that original legislation of 1983, the \npromise for a new economic relationship with the Caribbean and Central \nAmerica. We must continue to fulfill that promise as, hopefully, our \ncountry keeps its promises, and not act as a charity but as a \ncontinuation of the leadership we have shown in our continent and our \nhemisphere, leadership that has put us on the cusp of the ultimate goal \nof the 21st century version of the Monroe Doctrine, a hemisphere of \ndemocratically elected governments, a hemisphere of free markets, and a \nhemisphere with rising standards of living.\n  By moving this legislation forward, we will help these economies \ncontinue to grow and we will be investing in important markets that \nwill become more integrated with our own, a market integration that \nbenefits the United States as well.\n\n  In light of that fact, it might be worth mentioning the importance of \nthis legislation to one industry in particular, the textile industry, \nsomething the Senator from South Carolina has addressed but from a \ndifferent point of view than I. When I say textile industry, I mean \neveryone from a farmer growing cotton to the yarn spinner, the fabric \nmaker, the apparel manufacturer, producers of textile manufacturing \nequipment, as well as the wholesalers and retailers, everything from \nthe farm to the consumer. The Africa bill and the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative bills are drafted to create a win-win situation for both our \ntrading partners and for our own domestic industries.\n  The managers' amendment we will offer takes a different approach than \nthat of the House bill. Our bill is designed to create a partnership \nbetween America and industries, not to the benefit of one or the other, \nbut to the benefit of both regions. Our proposal would accomplish that \nby affording preferential tariff and also preferential quota treatment \nto apparel made from American-made fabric, and it would be American-\nmade fabric in order to qualify.\n  This does two things: First, it gives American firms an incentive to \nbuild a strong partnership with firms in both Africa and the Caribbean. \nSecondly, it helps establish a platform from which the American textile \nindustry can compete in this global market.\n  I want to refer to the industry's own analysis. That analysis shows \nthat the approach adopted by our Senate Finance Committee offers real \nbenefits to U.S. industry and to U.S. employment. It gives our industry \na fighting chance in the years to come, as textile quotas are gradually \neliminated pursuant to the World Trade Organization agreement on \ntextiles.\n  The reason I raise this point goes back to the efforts of our \ncommittee and our chairman to reestablish a bipartisan consensus on \ntrade. In my view, the textile industry and all of its related parts \nwill face significant economic adjustment as a result of the World \nTrade Organization textiles agreement. That adjustment has already \nbegun to take place.\n  What the industry found, however, based on its experience under \nNAFTA, is that partnering with Mexican firms or investing there for \njoint United States-Mexican production made our own United States firms \nvery competitive. They discovered that United States firms became \ncompetitive even in the face of fierce competition they faced from \ntextile industries in the developing world, and particularly the \ncountries of China and India.\n  The Finance Committee bills would broaden the base from which \nAmerican firms could produce for the world market. In the context of \nthe Uruguay Round, we made an implicit commitment to the textile \nindustry to allow them a period of adjustment to a new economic \nreality. I am proud to support the proposed legislation and to make \ngood on that promise by encouraging the industry to compete globally as \nwell as locally.\n  Through our managers' amendment, we intend to propose something that \nwould take two other significant steps. The first is the renewal of the \nGeneralized System of Preferences. We call that GSP for short. The GSP \nprogram has been on our statutes since 1975. GSP affords a grant of \ntariff preferences to developing countries generally, although not as \nextensive as those the proposal offers to Africa and to the Caribbean. \nGSP is generally described as a unilateral grant of preferences, and \nthat is a very accurate description.\n  What is little known is that the program has had more profound \nbenefits for U.S. trade than is captured by that fairly significant \ndescription that doesn't describe the program so well.\n  The original GSP program was instrumental in obtaining the commitment \nof continental powers like Great Britain to give up, finally, the \nhighly discriminatory tariff systems they enforced in their economic \nrelations with their former colonies. In other words, the creation of \nthe GSP was instrumental in eliminating discriminatory\n\n[[Page S13006]]\n\ntrade barriers that distorted trade and thwarted our exporters' access \nto markets throughout the entire developing world.\n  That beneficial program--GSP--has been around a while and \naccomplished a lot of good, but it has lapsed; it lapsed a few months \nago, in June. So our managers' amendment would propose its renewal.\n  The managers' amendment will also renew our Trade Adjustment \nAssistance programs. As my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of \nfree and fair trade. But I have, at the same time, consistently taken \nthe view that those who benefit from expanding trade must look out for \nthose who may be injured by the process of economic adjustment that \ntrade brings.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance programs are one part of that \ncommitment. They offer assistance to both workers and firms that have \nfaced a significant increase in import competition as they adjust to \nthese new economic conditions. They have been on the books since the \nTrade Expansion Act of 1962. And the committee has made every effort to \nensure that they are renewed to fulfill the bargain on trade policy \noriginally struck with U.S. firms and U.S. workers over 30 years ago. \nSo what we do with this reauthorization is keep our contract with these \nindustries, and if trade unfairly affects them, we will be able to help \nthem in a transition period. That is something we should do. It has \nworked well and we propose to continue it.\n  There is, however, a real urgency to their renewal at this time. As I \nhave said, they have lapsed and, unless they are renewed promptly, they \nwill fall out of the budget baseline and will, in the future, need a \nrevenue offset.\n  In the context of the current debate over trade and trade policy, I \nview these programs as a minimum downpayment on reestablishing a \nbipartisan consensus on trade matters. And so I urge our colleagues to \nsupport the motion to proceed to the bill in order to renew these \nessential programs.\n  Having discussed the intent behind each of the measures I intend to \nmove as a part of the Senate substitute, I want to add one last point. \nWe have before us in this legislation an opportunity to reestablish a \nstrong measure of bipartisan support for what we in the Finance \nCommittee view as an important trade and foreign policy initiative. So \nlet us take this step and let us move forward in a way that will \nbenefit Africa and the Caribbean--a way that will benefit much of the \nrest of the developing world--and a way that will serve our own \nnational interests as well.\n  And we propose this legislation with the U.S. national interest in \nmind, because we are cognizant of the fact that if we in the Congress \ndo not look out for the interests of the American worker, we can't \nexpect anybody else to do it. But when we can have the benefits of \nprotecting our workers and creating jobs and expanding our economy and \nstill help the rest of the world through these policies--and we have \ndone that--we should continue to do that because, as President Kennedy \nsaid, ``Trade, not aid.''\n\n  For an American populace that doesn't like foreign aid, I hope that \nthey will join us in the Congress behind these bipartisan efforts to \npromote our national interests and strengthen our world leadership \nthrough these trade policies that help us, as well as helping these \ndeveloping nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe $69 billion annual U.S. Department of Agriculture appropriations \nbill that happens to contain $8.7 billion in emergency money for \nAmerican farmers.\n  This legislation was sent from Capitol Hill to the President's desk \nlast Wednesday, October 13. Every day the President delays signing this \nbill is one more day relief money is not in the farmers' pockets at \nthis time of the lowest prices in 25 years.\n  Naturally, I know the White House is entitled to a few days to review \nthe document for signature by the President. But that process does not \nand should not take 8 days that the bill has been sitting on the \nPresident's desk, particularly considering the emergency economic \ncrisis in American agriculture.\n  Since September 30, President Clinton has been engaged in a strategy \nto confuse the public and to try to get Congress to accept tax and \nspending increases. The only conclusion I can draw is that the \nPresident has decided to use the agricultural relief bill for leverage \nin the political game we have seen with the budget this year. If that \nis true--and I hope it is not true, based on some comments made by \nSecretary Glickman; but the fact remains, the President has not signed \nthe bill containing emergency relief for farmers--then, of course, it \nis unforgivable on the part of the President, given the terrible \nsituation our farmers face.\n  Again, prices remain at 25-year lows. The package we moved through \nCongress is critical to helping farmers' cash-flow. President Clinton \nhas given speeches about helping farmers. Why isn't he taking, then, \naffirmative action and putting pen to paper to help the farmers who he \nknows have tremendous needs at a time of prices being at 25-year lows?\n  Last year, an election year, the President immediately signed the \nsupplemental spending bill that contained more than $5 billion, when \nthis crisis in agriculture started 12 months ago. The U.S. Department \nof Agriculture had those funds in the mail to farmers within 10 days. \nThe President has already lost 7 days in that process. This year, of \ncourse, is a sharp contrast with getting the bill signed and getting \nthe money to the farmers. Every day that President Clinton delays is \none more day that farmers don't have the assistance Congress passed and \nthey desperately need.\n  I happen to know that the President understands American agriculture, \nbeing the Governor of the State of Arkansas for as long as he was. I \nknow that one time, in his first couple years in office, he looked me \nin the eye at a meeting at the Blair House and he said, ``I understand \nfarming more than any other President of the United States ever has.'' \nI believe that, but he doesn't show an understanding of the crisis in \nagriculture at this particular time, as he has waited now too many days \nto sign this bill.\n  I urge the President this very evening to sign this bill so that the \nfarmers who are in crisis--which he has even given speeches on, \nrecognizing farming is in crisis--can have the help of the $2.7 billion \nprovided for in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S13006-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13006-S13009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF JUSTICE RONNIE WHITE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, for many months I had been calling for a \nfair vote on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal \ncourt. Instead, the country witnessed a party line vote as all 54 \nRepublican members of the Senate present that day voted against \nconfirming this highly qualified African-American jurist to the federal \nbench. I believe that vote to have been unprecedented--the only party \nline vote to defeat a judicial nomination I can find in our history.\n  There was brief debate on this nomination and two others the night \nbefore the vote. At that time, I attempted, as best I could through \nquestions in the limited opportunity allotted, to clarify the record of \nthis outstanding judge with respect to capital punishment appeals and \nto outline his background and qualifications.\n  I noted that Justice White had, in fact, voted to uphold the \nimposition of\n\n[[Page S13007]]\n\nthe death penalty 41 times. I observed that other members of the \nMissouri Supreme Court, including members of the Court appointed by \nRepublican governors, had similar voting records and more often than \nnot agreed with Justice White, both when he voted to uphold the death \npenalty and when he joined with a majority of that Court to reverse and \nremand such cases for resentencing or a new trial. Of the 59 capital \npunishment cases that Justice White has reviewed, he voted with the \nmajority of that Court 51 times--41 times to uphold the death penalty \nand 10 times to reverse for serious legal error.\n  As best I can determine, in only six of these 59 cases did Justice \nWhite dissent from the imposition of a death penalty, and in only three \ndid he do so with a dissent that was not joined by other members of the \ncourt. That is hardly the record that the Senate was told about Monday \nand Tuesday of the first week in October, when it was told that Justice \nWhite was an anti-death penalty judge, someone who was ``procriminal \nand activist with a slant toward criminals,'' someone with ``a serious \nbias against a willingness to impose the death penalty,'' someone who \nseeks ``at every turn'' to provide opportunities for the guilty to \n``escape punishment,'' and someone ``with a tremendous bent toward \ncriminal activity.''\n  The opposition to Justice White presented a distorted view by \nconcentrating on two lone dissents out of 59 capital punishment cases. \nMaking matters worse, the legal issues involved in those cases were not \neven discussed. Instead, the opposition was concentrated on the \ngruesome facts of the crimes.\n  I believe it was another member of the Missouri Supreme Court, one of \nthose appointed by a Republican governor of Missouri, who wrote in his \nown sole dissent in a gruesome case of kidnaping, rape, and murder of a \nteenage girl:\n\n       Occasionally, the heinousness of a crime, the seeming \n     certainty of the same result if the case is remanded and the \n     delay occasioned by a second remand tempt one to wink at \n     procedural defects. Nevertheless, the cornerstone of any \n     civilized system of justice is that the rules are applied \n     evenly to everyone no matter how despicable the crime.--State \n     v. Nunley, 923 S.W.2d 911, 927 (Mo. 1996) (Holstein, J., \n     dissenting).\n\n  Indeed, in his dissent in State v. Johnson, Justice White makes a \nsimilar point when he notes:\n\n       This is a very hard case. If Mr. Johnson was in control of \n     his faculties when he went on this murderous rampage, then he \n     assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given. But the \n     question of what Mr. Johnson's mental status was on that \n     night is not susceptible of easy answers. . . . This is an \n     excellent example of why hard cases make bad law. While I \n     share the majority's horror at this carnage, I cannot uphold \n     this as an acceptable standard of representation for a \n     defendant accused of capital murder.--State v. Johnson, 968 \n     S.W.2d 123, 138 (Mo. 1998).\n\n  Although you would never know the legal issue involved in this case \nfrom the discussion before the Senate, the appellate decision did not \nturn on the grizzly facts or abhorrence of the crimes, but difficult \nlegal questions concerning the standard by which an appellate court \nshould evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Justice \nWhite sought to apply the standard set by the United States Supreme \nCourt in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and reiterated \nin Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995). Thus, the dispute between \nJustice White and the majority was whether an appellant may succeed if \nhe shows that there was a ``reasonable probability'' of a different \nresult, or whether he is required to show that the counsel's \nunprofessional conduct was outcome-determinative and thus the ``most \nlikely'' reason why his defense was unsuccessful. Indeed, the case \nturns on an issue similar to that being currently considered by the \nUnited States Supreme Court this term. Far from creating a ``new \nground'' for appeal or urging a ``lower legal standard'' of review, \nJustice White's dissent sought to apply what he understood to be the \ncurrent legal standard to the gruesome facts of a difficult case.\n  Likewise troubling was the use by those who opposed the nomination of \nJustice White's dissent in the Kinder case, a 1996 decision. State v. \nKinder, 942 S.W.2d 313 (Mo. 1996). That case also arose from brutal \ncrimes, which were, or course, detailed for the Senate. What is \ntroubling is the characterization of the legal issue on appeal by \nJustice White's detractors. Justice White did not say that the case was \n``contaminated by racial bias'' because the trial judge ``had indicated \nthat he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties based on \nthat.'' The dissent did not turn on the political affiliation of the \njudge or his opposition to affirmative action. In fact, Justice White \nexpressly stated that the trial judge's position on affirmative action \nwas ``irrelevant to the issue of bias.''\n  Rather, the point of the dissent was that the majority opinion was \nchanging the law of Missouri by reinterpreting state law precedent and \nrestricting it in an artificially truncated way to avoid the recusal of \nthe trial judge, which Missouri law at that time required.\n  The case led to long and complicated opinions by the majority and \ndissent. The opposition to Justice White chose to characterize the case \nas if the trial judge was accused of racial bias merely for not \nfavoring affirmative action policies. In fact, the trial judge was \nfacing an election and had issued a press release less than a week \nbefore the defendant's trial. The defendant was an indigent, unemployed \nAfrican-American man. The judge's statement read, in pertinent part:\n\n       The truth is that I have noticed in recent years that the \n     Democrat party places too much emphasis on representing \n     minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to \n     work, and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . \n     . While minorities need to be represented, or [sic] course, I \n     believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis \n     and concern on the hardworking taxpayers in this country.--\n     Kinder, 942 S.W.2d at 321.\n\n  As Justice White's dissent correctly points out, the holding of the \ncase rewrote Missouri Supreme Court precedent instead of following it. \nWithout regard to the principles of stare decisis, following precedent, \nand avoiding judicial activism, the majority reversed Missouri law \n(without acknowledging that fact) to achieve a desired result. The \nmajority opinion rests on the narrow proposition that only ``judicial \nstatements'' that raise a doubt as to the judge's willingness to follow \nthe law provide a basis for disqualification, and ``distinguished'' \nthis case from controlling precedent because the evidence of racial \nbias was contained in what the majority characterized as a ``political \nstatement.'' Justice Limbaugh, who had dissented from the earlier \nMissouri Supreme Court decision on which Justice White relied, wrote \nthe majority opinion in Kinder, which stated:\n\n       To the extent the comments can be read to disparage \n     minorities, there is little point in defending them, even as \n     the political act they were intended to be. But they are a \n     political act, not a judicial one, and as such, they do not \n     necessarily have any bearing on the judge's in-court \n     treatment of minorities.--Id. The majority opinion created a \n     rule that consciously disregards political statements of a \n     judge evidencing racial bias.\n\n  In his dissent, Justice White, quoting from the earlier Missouri \nSupreme Court decision, wrote: ```[F]undamental fairness requires that \nthe trial judge be free of the appearance of prejudice against the \ndefendant as an individual and against the racial group on which the \ndefendant is a member.'' He noted that ``conduct suggesting racial bias \n`undermines the credibility of the judicial system and opens the \nintegrity of the judicial system to question.''' Kinder, 942 S.W.2d at \n341, citing State v. Smulls, 935 S.W.2d 9, 25-27 (Mo. 1986).\n  I believe that fairminded people who read and consider Justice \nWhite's dissent in Kinder will appreciate the strength of his legal \nreasoning. Certainly that was the reaction of Stuart Taylor, Jr. in his \narticle in the October 16 National Journal and of Benjamin Wittes in \nhis October 13 column in the Washington Post. Through the Kinder \ndecision, the Missouri Supreme Court has created new law that provides \nvery narrow restrictions on judges' conduct. Indeed, a Missouri \ncriminal trial judge could now apparently lead a KKK rally one night \nand spout racial hatred, epithets and calls for racial conflict, and \npreside over the criminal trial of an African-American defendant the \nnext morning--so long as he did not say anything offensive as a \n``judicial statement'' in connection with the trial.\n  Fairness and credibility are important values for all government \nactions, and especially important to the guarantee of due process that \nmakes our\n\n[[Page S13008]]\n\njustice system the best in the world. Those same qualities of fairness, \ncredibility, and integrity are essential to the Senate confirmation \nprocess.\n  It is worth noting that many of the same critics of Justice White's \nopinion in the Kinder case adopt the opposite posture and a different \nstandard when it comes to evaluating Judge Richard Paez, a nominee who \nhas been held up without a vote for 44 months. Judge Paez is roundly \ncriticized for a reference in a speech he gave in which he commented on \nthe early stages of an initiative effort that later became Proposition \n209 in California. Those who led the Republican fight against Justice \nWhite reverse themselves when it comes to opposing the Hispanic nominee \nfrom California and criticize him for much more circumspect comments \npredicting the likely reaction to that initiative in the Hispanic \ncommunity. These critics would not only disqualify Judge Paez from \nhearing a case involving Proposition 209, but would disqualify him from \nconfirmation as a federal appellate judge.\n  Justice White's detractors contend that they oppose ``judicial \nactivism,'' which they define as a judge substituting his personal will \nfor that of the legislature. However, in none of the cases on which \nthey rely is a statute implicated. Instead, in each of these cases \nJustice White appears to be following controlling precedent. In the \nKinder case, it is the majority that changed the law of Missouri. \nLikewise in the Johnson case, it was the majority that reached out to \ndistinguish that case and alter the way in which the governing legal \nstandard for review was to be applied.\n  Finally, the third case on which the opposition to Justice White \nrelies, State v. Damask, 936 S.W.2d 565 (Mo. 1996), is not concerned \nwith legislative action either. In this case, the Court upheld the \nconstitutionality of law enforcement checkpoints without warrants or \nreasonable suspicion. The majority reached out to distinguish the case \nfrom governing precedent, changed the rules under which it viewed the \ngoverning facts, and challenged the factual basis on which the lower \ncourts had based their conclusions.\n  In his dissent in Damask, Justice White relied on the authority of \nthe United States Supreme Court in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 \n(1979). See also Galberth v. U.S., 590 A.2d 990 (D.C. App. 1991). His \nruling expressly recognizes the importance of combating drug \ntrafficking and, relying on the record of the cases, concludes that the \ncheckpoints were the types of discretionary investigatory stops \nforbidden by governing precedent. Justice White worried that these \noperations had not been approved by politically accountable public \nofficials and that the courts should not substitute their judgment for \nlaw enforcement authorities and public officials who were responsible \nand accountable for designing such operations. See State v. Canton, 775 \nS.W.2d 352 (Mo. App. 1989); State v. Welch, 755 S.W.2d 624 (Mo. App. \n1988); Note, ``The Constitutionality of Drug Enforcement Checkpoints in \nMissouri,'' 63 Mo. L. Rev. 263 (1998). I wonder how we all might feel \nif instead of seizing marijuana, the armed men in camouflage fatigues \nshining flashlights into the faces of motorists in an isolated area \nlate at night were seizing firearms.\n\n  Another decision that has not been mentioned in the course of this \ndebate on Justice White's nomination is the decision of the people of \nMissouri to retain Justice White as a member of their Supreme Court. \nAlthough initially appointed, pursuant to Missouri law Justice White \nwent before the voters of Missouri in a retention election in 1996. I \nam informed that he received over 1.1 million votes and a favorable \nvote of 64.7 percent.\n  All of the cases on which the opposition to Justice White relied were \ndecided before his hearing and before he was twice reported favorably \nby a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 1998 \nand July 1999. Although Justice White was first nominated to the \nfederal bench in 1997, the Judiciary Committee did not receive negative \ncomments about him until quite recently. No law enforcement opposition \nof any kind was received by the Committee of the Senate in 1997 or \n1998.\n  This year, Justice White was renominated with significant fanfare in \nJanuary and major newspapers in the state reported on the status on the \nnomination. I began repeated calls for his consideration by February. \nThe Committee finally proceeded to reconsider and report his \nnomination, again, in July 1999. Still, the Judiciary Committee \nreceived no opposition from Missouri law enforcement.\n  The first contact the Judiciary Committee received from Missouri law \nenforcement was a strong letter of support and endorsement from the \nChief of Police of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. I \nthank Colonel Henderson for contacting the Committee and sharing his \nviews with us. I have recently read that the Missouri Police Chiefs \nAssociation, representing 465 members across the state, does not get \ninvolved in judicial nominations. I understand that policy because it \nis shared by many law enforcement organizations that I know. I also \nappreciate that when asked by a reporter recently, the president of the \nMissouri Police Chiefs Association described Justice White as ``an \nupright, fine individual'' and that he knew Justice White personally \nand really had ``a hard time seeing that he's against law enforcement'' \nand never thought of him as ``procriminal.''\n  The Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police has \nindicated on behalf of its 4,500 dedicated law enforcement officer \nmembers in Missouri, that they view Justice White's record as ``one of \na jurist whose record on the death penalty has been far more supportive \nof the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.'' They see \nhis record as having voted to reverse the death penalty ``in far fewer \ninstances than the other Justices on the Court'' and note that he \n``also voted to affirm the death penalty in 41 cases.'' The Missouri \nFraternal Order of Police expresses its regret for ``the needless \ninjury which has been inflicted on the reputation of Justice White'' \nand concludes that ``our nation has been deprived of an individual who \nsurely would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.'' I \nthank President Thomas W. Mayer and all the FOP members in Missouri for \nspeaking out on behalf of this fine judge and sharing their perspective \nwith us.\n  I certainly understand and appreciate Sheriff Kenny Jones deciding to \nwrite to fellow sheriffs about this nomination. Sheriff Jones' wife was \nkilled in the brutal rampage of James Johnson, from whose conviction \nand sentence Justice White dissented on legal grounds concerning the \nlack of competent representation the defendant received during the \ntrial. All Senators give their respect and sympathy to Sheriff Jones \nand his family.\n  I also understand the petition sent by the Missouri Sheriffs \nAssociation to the Judiciary Committee as a result of Sheriff Jones' \nletter to other Missouri sheriffs. In early October, the Judiciary \nCommittee received that petition along with a copy of Justice White's \ndissent in the Johnson case with a cover letter dated September 27. It \nis a statement of support for Sheriff Jones and shows remarkable \nrestraint. The 63 Missouri county sheriffs and 9 others who signed the \npetition ``respectfully request that consideration be given to [Justice \nWhite's dissenting opinion in Johnson] as a factor in the appointment \nto fill this position of U.S. District Judge.''\n  I want to assure the Missouri Sheriffs Association and all Senators \nthat I took their concern seriously and reconsidered the dissent in \nthat case to see whether I saw in it anything disqualifying or anything \nthat would lead me to believe that Justice White would not support \nenforcement of the law. I respect them for having contacted us and for \nthe way in which they did so. It is terribly hard to continue to honor \nthose we have loved and lost by respecting the rule of law that \nguarantees constitutional rights to those accused, tried, and convicted \nof killing innocent members of our dedicated law enforcement community.\n  Whether the nomination of Justice White or consideration of the legal \nissues considered in his opinions ``sparked strong concerns'' among \nMissouri law enforcement officers, or whether controversy about this \nnomination was otherwise generated, I am not in position to know. I do \nknow this: I respect and consider seriously the views of law \nenforcement officers. As a former State's Attorney and former\n\n[[Page S13009]]\n\nVice President of the National District Attorneys Association, I hear \noften from local prosecutors, police and sheriffs, both in Vermont and \naround the country. I work closely with local law enforcement and \nnational law enforcement organizations on a wide variety of issues. I \nknow from my days in local law enforcement that there are often \ndisagreements between police and prosecutors and with judges about \ncases. I respect that difference and understand it.\n\n  With respect to the views expressed by law enforcement \nrepresentatives on Justice Ronnie White's nomination, both for and \nagainst, I say the following: I have considered each of the letters \nproduced during the course of the Senate debate and reconsidered the \ncases to which they refer. I respectfully disagree that those decisions \npresent a basis to vote against the confirmation of Justice Ronnie \nWhite to the federal court. Far from presenting a pattern of \n``procriminal jurisprudence'' or ``tremendous bent toward criminal \nactivity,'' they are dissents well within the legal mainstream and well \nsupported by precedent and legal authority. Further, if considered in \nthe context of his body of work, achievements, and qualifications, they \npresent no basis for voting against this highly qualified and widely \nrespected nominee. I conclude, as did the Missouri State Lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police, that ``our nation has been deprived of an \nindividual who surely would have proven to be an asset to the Federal \nJudiciary.''\n  With all due respect, I do not believe that any constituency or \ninterest group, even one as important as local law enforcement, is \nentitled to a Senate veto over a judicial nomination. Each Senator is \nelected to vote his or her conscience on these judicial appointments, \nnot any special interest or party line. When Senators do not vote their \nconscience, they risk the debacle that we witnessed on October 5th, \nwhen a partisan political caucus vote resulted in a fine man and highly \nqualified nominee being rejected by all Republican Senators on a party \nline vote.\n  It is too late for the Senate to undo the harm done to Justice White. \nWhat the Senate can do now is to make sure that partisan error is not \nrepeated. The Senate should ensure that other minority and women \ncandidates receive a fair vote. We can start with the nominations of \nJudge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, which have been held up far too \nlong without Senate action. It is past time for the Senate to do the \njust thing, the honorable thing, and vote to confirm each of these \nhighly qualified nominees. Let us start the healing process. Let us \nvote to confirm Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon before this \nsession ends.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the October 21, 1999 letter \nfrom the Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                         Missouri State Lodge,\n\n                                                 October 21, 1999.\n     Sheriff Philip H. McKelvey,\n     President, National Sheriff's Association,\n     Alexandria, VA.\n       Dear Sheriff McKelvey: I am writing on behalf of the more \n     than 4,500 members of the Missouri State Fraternal Order of \n     Police to express my great consternation at your \n     organization's recent opposition to the confirmation of \n     Justice Ronnie White to the Federal bench, an opposition \n     which I sincerely hope was not simply politically motivated.\n       The record of Justice White is one of a jurist whose record \n     on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the \n     rights of victims than of the rights of criminals. While in \n     fact voting 17 times for death penalty reversals, he has \n     voted to do so in far fewer instances than the other Justices \n     on the Court. In addition, Justice White has also voted to \n     affirm the death penalty in 41 cases.\n       The Fraternal Order of Police is no stranger to fighting to \n     see that justice is served for slain law enforcement officers \n     and their families. Our organization has been at the \n     forefront of bringing to justice Munia Abu-Jamal, \n     establishing a nationwide boycott of individuals and \n     organizations which financially support the efforts of this \n     convicted cop killer. In addition, the FOP led the fight \n     against President Clinton's clemency of 16 convicted Puerto \n     Rican terrorists responsible for a wave of bombing attacks on \n     U.S. soil and the wounding of three New York City police \n     officers.\n       Unfortunately however, nothing can undo the needless injury \n     which has been inflicted on the reputation of Justice White, \n     and our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely \n     would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.\n       On behalf of the membership of the Fraternal Order of \n     Police, I would encourage you to exercise greater judgment in \n     future battles of this sort. It is a great disservice to the \n     members of your organization, and the nation as a whole, to \n     choose to do otherwise.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas W. Mayer,\n     President, Missouri State FOP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S13009-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMERCE-JUSTICE-STATE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS, I rise today to express my profound disappointment that \nthe Conference Report to the Fiscal Year 2000 Commerce, Justice, State \nand the Judiciary Appropriations bill removed language that was in the \nSenate passed bill to expand Federal jurisdiction in investigating hate \ncrimes.\n  The language inserted in the Senate passed bill would expand Federal \njurisdiction in investigating hate crimes by removing the requirement \nin Federal hate crime law that only allows federal prosecution if the \nperpetrator is interfering with a victim's federally protected right \nlike voting or attending school. It would also extend the protection of \ncurrent hate crime law to those who are victimized because of their \ngender, sexual orientation, or disability.\n  Any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by hate are \nespecially harmful. Many states, including my state of Vermont, have \nalready passed strong hate crimes laws, and I applaud them in this \nendeavor. An important principle of the amendment that was in the \nSenate-passed bill was that it allowed for Federal prosecution of hate \ncrimes without impeding the rights of states to prosecute these crimes.\n  The adoption of this amendment by the Senate was an important step \nforward in ensuring that the perpetrators of these harmful crimes are \nbrought to justice. The American public knows that Congress should pass \nthis legislation, and it is unfortunate that the conferees did not \nretain this important language.\n  Congress should pass this legislation, and I will work to ensure that \nthis legislation is enacted into law in the very near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S13009-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable credit for taxpayers owning certain commercial power takeoff \nvehicles; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nTHE FUEL TAX EQUALIZATION CREDIT FOR SUBSTANTIAL POWER TAKEOFF VEHICLES \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Fuel Tax \nEqualization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Vehicles Act. This \nbill upholds a long-held principle in the application of the Federal \nfuels excise tax, and restores this principle for certain single engine \n``dual-use'' vehicles.\n  This long-held principle is simple: fuel consumed for the purpose of \nmoving vehicles over the road is taxed, while fuel consumed for ``off-\nroad'' purposes is not taxed. The tax is designed to compensate for the \nwear and tear impacts on roads. Fuel used for a non-propulsion ``off-\nroad'' purpose has no impact on the roads. It should not be taxed as if \nit does. Mr. President, this bill is based on this principle, and it \nremedies a problem created by IRS regulations that control the \napplication of the federal fuels excise tax to ``dual-use'' vehicles.\n  Dual-use vehicles are vehicles that use fuel both to propel the \nvehicle on the road, and also to operate separate, on-board equipment. \nThe two prominent examples of dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers, \nwhich use fuel to rotate the mixing drum, and sanitation trucks, which \nuse fuel to operate the compactor. Both of these trucks move over the \nroad, but at the same time, a substantial portion of their fuel use is \nattributable to the non-propulsion function.\n  Mr. President, the current problem developed because progress in \ntechnology has outstripped the regulatory process. In the past, dual-\nuse vehicles commonly had two engines. IRS regulations, written in the \n1950s, specifically exempt the portion of fuel used by the separate \nengine that operates special equipment such as a mixing drum or a trash \ncompactor. These IRS regulations reflect the principle that fuel \nconsumed for non-propulsion purposes is not taxed.\n  Today, however, typical dual-use vehicles use only one engine. The \nsingle engine both propels the vehicle over the road and powers the \nnon-propulsion function through ``power takeoff.'' A major reason for \nthe growth of these single-engine, power takeoff vehicles is that they \nuse less fuel. And a major benefit for everyone is that they are better \nfor the environment.\n  Power takeoff was not in widespread use when the IRS regulations were \ndrafted, and the regulations deny an exemption for fuel used in single-\nengine, dual-use vehicles. The IRS defends its distinction between one-\nengine and two-engine vehicles based on possible administrative \nproblems if vehicle owners were permitted to allocate fuel between the \npropulsion and non-propulsion functions.\n  Mr. President, our bill is designed to address the administrative \nconcerns expressed by the IRS, but at the same time, restore tax \nfairness for dual-use vehicles with one engine. The bill does this by \nestablishing an annual tax credit available for taxpayers that own a \nlicensed and insured concrete mixer or sanitation truck with a \ncompactor. The amount of the credit is $250 and is a conservative \nestimate of the excise taxes actually paid, based on information \ncompiled on typical sanitation trucks and concrete mixers.\n  In sum, as a fixed income tax credit, no audit or administrative \nissue will arise about the amount of fuel used for the off-road \npurpose. At the same time, the credit provides a rough justice method \nto make sure these taxpayers are not required to pay tax on fuels that \nthey shouldn't be paying. Also, as an income tax credit, the proposal \nwould have no effect on the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I would like to stress that I believe the IRS' \ninterpretation of the law is not consistent with long-help principles \nunder the tax law, despite their administrative concerns. Quite simply, \nthe law should not condone a situation where taxpayers are required to \npay the excise tax on fuel attributable to non-propulsion functions. \nThis bill corrects an unfair tax that should have never been imposed in \nthe first place.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nJohn Breaux, in introducing the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for \nSubstantial Power Takeoff Act.\n  This bill would create a simple mechanism to reimburse owners of \nconcrete mixers and sanitation trucks for the Federal excise taxes that \nthey pay on fuels used to power the off-road function of their \nvehicles.\n  Today, IRS regulations impose the Federal fuels excise tax on \n``single engine, dual-use vehicles.'' Two prominent examples of such \nsingle-engine, dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers and sanitation \ntrucks. The IRS taxes the entire amount of fuel used in these vehicles, \ndespite the fact that a substantial portion of the fuel consumed is \nused to power an off-road function--the trash compactor of a sanitation \ntruck, or the rotating drum of the cement truck.\n  Mr. President, the Federal fuels excise tax is meant to pay for our \nNation's roads. If fuel is used for an off-road purpose, it is a well-\nestablished principle that we do not tax the fuel. In this case, fuels \nused to power the trash compactor or rotate the drum on a concrete \nmixer do not result in wear and tear on the roads and, therefore, \nshould not be taxes.\n  Contrary to this well-established principle, the IRS imposes the \nexcise tax on single engine, dual-use vehicles. The simple reason given \nby the IRS for this distinction is administrative convenience. But the \nconvenience of the IRS is no reason to overtax diesel fuel consumers.\n  Mr. President, our bill corrects the discrepancy created under IRS \nregulations, and does so without creating any administrative red tape. \nThe $250 income tax credit crafted in the bill would be easy to \nadminister. While it will not fully and precisely compensate these \ntruck owners for the taxes paid on fuel used off-road, this credit has \nbeen calculated based on industry data and using conservative \nestimates, and reduces a tax that these truck owners should not be \npaying in the first place. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Breaux and me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Cleland, Ms. Collins, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Graham, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Robb, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Roth, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Specter, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Torricelli, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1760. A bill to provide reliable officers, technology, education, \ncommunity prosecutors, and training in our neighborhoods; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   Protection Act of 1999 or Providing Reliable Officer, Technology, \n   Education, Community Prosecutors and Training in our Neighborhoods\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when we passed the 1994 crime bill and \ncreated the COPS Program, there were some skeptics. There were people \nwho thought community policing was nothing more than social work and \nthat the program would not work.\n  Do you remember what I said to the skeptics? I told them that either \nthis program was going to work and we would be geniuses or that it \nwould flop and we would be run out of town. There is an old saying that \nsuccess has a thousand fathers but failure is an orphan. Now, there are \na thousand people all claiming to be the parent of this program simply \nbecause it has worked so darn well.\n  In 1994, we set a goal of funding 100,000 police officers by the year \n2000. We met that goal last May--months ahead of schedule. As of today, \nthere have been 103,000 officers funded and 55,000 officers deployed to \nthe streets. The COPS Programs is ahead of schedule and under budget.\n  Because of COPS, the concept of community policing has become law \nenforcement's principal weapon fighting crime. Community policing has \nredefined the relationship between law enforcement and the public. But, \nmore importantly, it has reduced crime. And that is what we attempted \nto do.\n  All across the country, from Wilmington to Washington--from \nConnecticut to California, we are seeing a dramatic decline in crime. \nJust this week, the FBI released its annual crime statistics which \nshowed that once again, for the seventh year in a row, crime is down. \nIn fact, since 1994, violent crime is down 17.6 percent. And just last \nyear, violent crime was down 6.4 percent nationwide from the year \nbefore. But, we can't let that slow us down.\n  And that's why I'm here today. I am proud of our accomplishments, but \nwe cannot become complacent. We have a unique opportunity here. Some \npeople say if crime down, why put more cops on the streets? Well it's \nsimple math: more cops equals less crime. If we know one thing it is \nthis: if a crime is going to be committed and there is a cop on one \nstreet corner and not one the other, guess where the crime is going to \nbe committed? Not where the cop is, I would guess.\n  Maybe someday we will reach the point where crime is so low that we \ndon't have to take pro-active steps any longer. But, we are not there \nyet. Our children and our parents are still at great risk out there and \nit should not be that way. Nor does it have to be that way. And why \nmore cops on the street, it won't be that way.\n  That is why today, I introduced a bill to continue this program for \nthe next 5 years. It's called ``PROTECTION''--``Providing reliable \nofficers, technology, education, community prosecutors and training in \nour neighborhoods.'' This bill will put up to 50,000 more officers on \nthe street.\n  It will also allow police officers to be reimbursed for college or \ngraduate school, because we all know that overcoming crime problems \nrequires something more than just more cops. It requires cops who \nunderstand the importance of prevention and community relations. The \nlegislation also provides funding for new technology so that law \nenforcement can purchase high-tech equipment to put them on equal \nfooting with sophisticated criminals. And it provides for funding for \ncommunity prosecutors--to expand the community policing concept to \nengage the whole law enforcement community in fighting crime. It has \nall the things that law enforcement told me that they needed to do \ntheir jobs.\n  I am proud to say that this legislation has the support of all the \nmajor law enforcement organizations and that 49 of my colleagues have \ntold me that they support this legislation. Forty-five of them will \njoin me today in cosponsoring this legislation--including 5 \nRepublicans. I want to recognize my friends on the other side of the \naisle and thank them for listening to their constituents, their mayors \nand their police chiefs who said: We can not do this without your help.\n  I hope that even more will join us today. I ask the rest of my \ncolleagues--there are 50 more of you--will you be with us on this? Will \nyou listen to everyone who is asking for help? Will you listen to your \npolice chiefs and your mayors? Will you stand up and be counted among \nthose who say enough is enough--and I'm going to do something about \ncrime? I'm going to put more police officers on the street. I'm going \nto support the most effective law enforcement program of our time.\n\n[[Page S13014]]\n\n  I hope that we can put politics aside on this one and all join forces \nto support the folks who do so much for us each and every day. The \npeople who put their safety on the line so that we may be more secure. \nIt is then, that I will know that we have all put our Nation's interest \nfirst.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1760\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \n21st Century Community Policing Initiative Act. I am proud to be an \noriginal co-sponsor of this legislation, introduced by Senators Biden \nand Schumer, that I believe is crucial to our efforts to fight crime.\n  This important bill would re-authorize the successful Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS) program through the year 2005. \nBecause of the COPS program, there are over 100,000 more police \nofficers on the beat than there were before this program was \nimplemented in 1994. This represents a nearly 20 percent increase in \npolice presence nationwide.\n  By extending the COPS program, the 21st Century Community Policing \nInitiative Act will help put up to 50,000 more police on the streets \nover the next five years. It will also provide $350 million a year in \ngrants to law enforcement agencies to assist them in acquiring new \ntechnology to enhance crime fighting efforts. This means better \ncommunications systems so cops in different jurisdictions can talk to \neach other; state of the art investigative tools like DNA analysis; and \nthe means to target crime hot spots.\n  This legislation would also provide $200 million per year in grants \nfor community-wide prosecutors. This aspect of the bill would expand \nthe community policing concept to engage the whole community in \npreventing and fighting crime. The cops have been so successful in \ntheir jobs that the next step is to provide more prosecutors to help \nget criminals off the streets.\n  Mr. President, one of the best ways to fight crime is to have more \nwell-trained police officers on our streets and in our schools, and to \nprovide them with the latest equipment and technology. The COPS program \nhas helped achieve these goals, and has in turn helped to make our \ncommunities safer places for our children, families, and businesses.\n  The COPS program has been a tremendous asset to my state of North \nCarolina. As of October 20th, the COPS program had provided North \nCarolina with grants of over $135 million. From Alexander Mills to \nZebulon, North Carolina communities have received COPS funding to help \nlaw enforcement agencies hire an additional 2,602 police officers to \npatrol neighborhoods and protect our schools.\n  In August, I met with police officers and sheriffs from across North \nCarolina to learn more about how the COPS program is helping to keep \nlocal communities safe. I heard from law enforcement officers from the \nlarger cities such as Raleigh and Charlotte. I also spoke with officers \nfrom smaller, rural areas like North Wilkesboro and Randolph County. \nThe one clear message that I got from all of these officers is that the \nCOPS program is working and should be continued.\n\n  Mr. President, crime rates in big cities are generally higher than \nthey are in smaller towns. An increased police presence can help deter \ncrime in these urban areas. However, officers I met with from less \npopulated regions of North Carolina emphasized to me that even one more \ncop can make a world of difference to a community that lacks its own \nresources to hire more police officers. In these situations, the COPS \nprogram can step in and provide these communities with the additional \nhelp they need.\n  One of the most interesting and persuasive arguments to renew the \nCOPS program was also one that I heard during these conversations with \nNorth Carolina police officers. They told me that when people think of \nthe COPS program, they immediately think of more officers policing the \nstreets. However, one of the most important roles that the COPS program \nhas played is to provide funds for law enforcement agencies to work in \npartnership with education officials to solve problems of crime in and \naround schools.\n  Officers are not just placed in the schools to instill discipline. \nThey act as counselors, coaches and mentors for children. And they are \nreaching out to students by offering safe after-school activities. \nNorth Carolina officers told me that these efforts are some of the best \nkinds of crime prevention measures that we can take.\n  By connecting with at-risk youth, these school-based officers have \nbecome trusted adult authority figures that kids will run to in times \nof trouble, instead of running away from them.\n  Many police chiefs and sheriffs credit community policing and COPS \nsupport with dramatic drops in crime rates around the nation. Since the \ninception of the COPS program, violent crime in North Carolina is down \n7% and aggravated assault has fallen by 8%. According to a report \nissued by the State Bureau of Investigation, the state's murder rate \nfell 3% from 1997 to 1998. And, the country's crime rate is at its \nlowest in 25 years.\n  These statistics are encouraging, but now is not the time to \neliminate a program that has substantially contributed to declining \ncrime rates. We still have a long way to go to insuring that people are \nwalking crime-free streets and children are attending crime-free \nschools.\n  Continuation of the COPS program is one significant way that we can \ncontinue to make progress towards these goals.\n  Mr. President, during debate on the juvenile crime bill, Senator \nBiden offered an amendment that would have re-authorized the COPS \nprogram through 2005. I voted for this amendment which was endorsed by \nmany law enforcement organizations including the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. \nUnfortunately, the amendment failed by the slimmest of margins (48-50). \nHowever, I am confident that upon reconsideration of the question \nwhether it is necessary to renew the COPS program, my colleagues will \nrealize how effective and valuable the program has been, not only to \ntheir individual states, but to the nation as a whole.\n  I want to thank Senators Biden and Schumer for their efforts to re-\nauthorize the COPS program and I urge all of\n\n[[Page S13016]]\n\nmy colleagues to support the 21st Century Community Policing Initiative \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1762. A bill to amend the Watershed Protection and Flood \nPrevention Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \ncost share assistance for the rehabilitation of structural measures \nconstructed as part of water resources projects previously funded by \nthe Secretary under such act or related laws; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               SMALL WATERSHED REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have a national problem that greatly \naffects Georgia if not addressed. Since 1944, under a federal program \nadministered by the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural \nResources Conservation Service, over 10,400 small watershed dams were \nconstructed in 46 states. These dams were planned and designed with a \n50 year lifespan. The purpose of this program was to provide flood \ncontrol, water quality improvement, rural water supply assurance, fish \nand wildlife habitat protection, recreation, and irrigation.\n  Communities depend upon these watershed projects. However, many of \nthese dams have reached their life expectancy and are badly in need of \nrepair. Currently, the United States Department of Agriculture has \nneither the authority nor funds for rehabilitation of watershed \nstructures. The legislation I introduce today along with Senator \nLincoln, the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act of 1999, provides a \nneeded and critical solution to this growing crisis for rural America.\n  The state of Georgia alone has 357 small watershed dams, 69 of which \nwill reach the end of their designed lifespan within the next 10 years. \nIt is my understanding that 121 dams in Georgia need to be modified to \nmeet state dam safety laws and protect residential and commercial \ndevelopment downstream from the dams while 8 dams need repairs and \nmodifications to extend their useful life and help prevent future \nenvironmental and economic losses. Since fiscal year 1996, the state of \nGeorgia has appropriated over $4.6 million to bring these structures in \ncompliance with the Georgia Safe Dams Act. However, state and local \ncommunities do not have enough financial resources available to \nrehabilitate these watersheds dams in a timely fashion.\n  The legislation Senator Lincoln and I are introducing lays out a \nprocedure and a funding mechanism for a rehabilitation process that \nwould ultimately save these dams across the nation, including those \nlocated in Georgia. The bill authorizes $60 million a year from 2000 to \n2009 and requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a system of \nranking and approving rehabilitation requests on need and merit. \nSpecifically, the legislation calls for $5 million to be used annually \nby the Secretary to assess the true needs of the entire program in the \nfirst two years of the program's existence. Under this program, 65 \npercent would be funded by the federal government while the remaining \n35 percent would be funded locally. Recent flooding in the southeast \nfrom Hurricane Floyd and Irene make enactment of this legislation an \neven more pressing matter.\n   This bi-partisan legislation has been endorsed by Governor Roy \nBarnes of Georgia and a wide range of other Georgia state and local \nofficials and national associations.\n  I would like to thank Senator Lincoln for her leadership, and for \nworking with me on this important legislation. This bill is a Senate \ncompanion to legislation introduced by Representative Frank Lucas of \nOklahoma. We look forward to working with him on securing its \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be priinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1762\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Paul: The purpose of this correspondence is to \n     encourage your strong and active support for H.R. 728, the \n     Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendment of 1999. H.R. 728 \n     was introduced by Representative Frank D. Lucas of Oklahoma \n     and amends the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act \n     (P.L. 83-566, 16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) by adding a new section \n     to provide federal cost-share for rehabilitation of \n     structural measures that are near, at, or past their \n     evaluated life expectancy. Cost-share assistance will be \n     provided to local watershed, conservation and other districts \n     that have the legal responsibility for the safety and \n     conditions of watershed dams throughout the United States. \n     The need for funding by H.R. 728 results from the fact that \n     the United States Department of Agriculture now has neither \n     the authority nor funds for rehabilitation of watershed \n     structures.\n       To date, there have been over 10,400 watershed dams \n     constructed with the help of federal cost-share funds, \n     primarily through Public Law 83-566, the Watershed Protection \n     and Flood Prevention Act. Georgia has 351 watershed \n     structures as a result of this program. Many of these dams \n     are nearing, or are already at the end of, their design \n     lifetime--50 years--and are in need of significant \n     rehabilitation to maintain structural integrity and dam \n     safety. Twenty-two of Georgia's Soil and Water Conservation \n     Districts have primary responsibility for operating and \n     maintaining these 351 dams, and many of our districts share \n     responsibility with local governments on the remaining \n     structures. Since FY96, the state of Georgia has appropriated \n     over $4.6 million to bring these structures in compliance \n     with the Georgia Safe Dams Act.\n       These watershed structures provide over $16 million of \n     benefits each year to Georgia communities by protecting urban \n     and rural infrastructures, as well as personal property, from \n     flooding and flood damage. These dams also protect \n     irreplaceable natural resources through an effective \n     watershed approach.\n       Representative Lucas is currently seeking co-sponsors for \n     this bill in the House. Congressmen Nathan Deal and Saxby \n     Chambliss have already become co-sponsors of H.R. 728. I \n     would like to ask for your support in co-sponsoring this \n     legislation; it is important to Georgia's soil and water \n     conservation districts and the state of Georgia.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roy E. Barnes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Office of the Commissioner,\n\n                             Pickens County, GA, October 20, 1999.\n     Senator Paul Coverdell,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: I certainly appreciate and support \n     your effort to introduce the Small Watershed Rehabilitation \n     Act 1999.\n       As you know, these watershed structures are very well \n     placed in 19 sites throughout our County preventing major \n     runoff, erosion and flooding.\n       Even though our efforts to maintain them are ongoing we are \n     somewhat limited by budget and time restraints due to routine \n     County maintenance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Frank Martin,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Paulding County Board\n\n\n                                             of Commissioners,\n\n                                     Dallas, GA, October 20, 1999.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your time and effort in what you are \n     doing for Paulding County and if there is ever anything I can \n     do for you, please don't hesitate to give me a call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Roger Leggett,\n     Post II Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Paulding County\n\n\n                                       Board of Commissioners,\n\n                                     Dallas, GA, October 20, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Coverdell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: I am in total support of the \n     Watershed Dam bill you will be introducing. We have many \n     watershed dams in Paulding County that are in need of repair.\n       If you need any additional, please call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mike J.

Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: I want to formally endorse your \n     sponsorship of legislation to amend the Watershed Protection \n     and Flood Prevention Act, in order to provide financial \n     assistance to local entities working\n\n[[Page S13018]]\n\n     to rehabilitate structural measures constructed as part of a \n     covered water resource project.\n       Having federal financial assistance available to address a \n     portion of the costs for the rehabilitation of structures \n     that impound water can ensure that appropriate revenues and \n     support will be available as Cobb County works to extend the \n     service life of these structures.\n       Finally, I appreciate the effort on behalf of Congress to \n     address the safety concerns associated with the maintenance \n     of these aging structures. The protection of life and \n     property is a priority and assistance in this effort is most \n     appreciated.\n       Please know that I aggressively support this legislation \n     and your sponsorship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Byrne,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Gwinnett County,\n                               Office of the County Administrator,\n                                                 October 19, 1999.\n     Senator Paul D. Coverdell,\n     Colony Square, Atlanta, GA.\n       Senator Coverdell: I appreciate the opportunity to give \n     input on the Watershed Rehabilitation Legislation. I have \n     reviewed the draft bill, and it appears to be in our best \n     interest for this legislation to pass. It provides 65% \n     rehabilitation funding for existing soil conservation service \n     dams. This funding can also be used to extend the life of the \n     dams, correct accelerated deterioration, correct damage from \n     a catastrophic event, or upgrade the dam to meet changed land \n     use conditions in the watershed.\n       It appears that no funding is currently available for this \n     work, and since Gwinnett County has responsibility for 14 of \n     the referenced dams, we support this draft legislation. If \n     you have any questions or need additional information, please \n     feel free to call me at (770) 822-7021. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Charlotte Nash,\n     County Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Habersham County,\n\n\n                               Office of County Commissioners,\n\n                               Clarkesville, GA, October 20, 1999.\n     To: Mr. Richard Gupton.\n     Subject: Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act of 1999.\n       Dear Sir: We fully support Senator Paul Coverdell's effort \n     to obtain federal funds to up grade and maintain the \n     watershed dams in our county. These dams have provided and \n     are still providing much needed flood protection and other \n     benefits including municipal water. The cost of bringing \n     these dams up to safe dams standards far exceeds our budget. \n     Any help from the federal level is certainly a wise use of \n     tax dollars.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jerry L.

It has served the community exceptionally well \n     in its intended purpose.\n       It can't be overstated as to how important the maintenance \n     of the dam is to the integrity of the dam and the safety to \n     the community immediately downstream.\n       As with anything we do, it does cost to properly maintain \n     the dam and these costs escalate each year. It is extremely \n     important that we receive Federal financial assistance with \n     the maintenance of the dam at our reservoir.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Aldrich,\n     City Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n         Upper Chattahoochee River Soil and Water Conservation \n           District,\n                                                 October 20, 1999.\n     Re Watershed Dam Rehabilitation.\n     Mr. Richard Gupton.\n       Dear Mr. Gupton: I would like to express our strongest \n     support for Senator Coverdell's Bill to provide assistance to \n     repair the watershed dams across the county and especially \n     important to me the dams in Forsyth County.\n       I have been a supervisor in Forsyth County for over five \n     years and have seen first hand the tremendous benefits that \n     these structures have provided the citizens of Forsyth \n     County.\n       As these dams approach 40 and 50 years old the District has \n     seen the urgent need for federal assistance in performing \n     necessary repairs and upgrades to meet new regulations and \n     standards. This assistance is urgently needed to upgrade \n     these structures so they can continue to provide benefits in \n     the year to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leonard Ridings,\n     District Supervisor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Bartow County\n\n\n                                        Commissioner's Office,\n\n                                                 October 21, 1999.\n     Senator Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re Watershed Dams Legislation.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: As County Commissioner, I support \n     the legislation currently being considered on watershed dams.\n       Bartow County has seven watershed dams. This legislation, \n     if passed, would benefit many counties, like Bartow that have \n     several of these dams to maintain.\n       Thank you for your endorsement of this legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                               Clarence Brown,\n\n                                                Sole Commissioner,\n     Bartow County, GA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Watershed Coalition,\n\n                                                  October 4, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul D. Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell, Recently I have heard you might be \n     considering introducing a Small Watershed Rehabilitation Bill \n     in the Senate, much like H.R. 728 that is working its way \n     through the House of Representatives. This letter is to \n     support you in that endeavor, and offer the resources of the \n     National Watershed Coalition (NWC) in that support.\n       Our NWC represents local watershed project sponsors at the \n     national level. For many years they have been telling us that \n     our nation's small watershed structures, which provide \n     invaluable benefits to society, in some instances are in \n     vital need of rehabilitation and upgrading to meet current \n     standards. In many cases, these local sponsors, no matter how \n     much they would like to be able to accomplish these mandated \n     upgrades, simply do not have the financial capability to do \n     so, and are not likely to get that capability soon. Your own \n     state of Georgia has been a national leader in recognizing \n     this problem and assisting these local project sponsors with \n     technical and financial help. Even with Georgia's own \n     statewide rehabilitation program, more is needed. We believe \n     that since the federal government worked with these local \n     sponsors in planning and building these structures, and since \n     much of the required upgrading is as a result of changed \n     federal policies, it just makes sense that the federal \n     government assist with the rehabilitation on a cost-sharing \n     basis much as they did the original construction.\n       Within the next 10 years, 69 of Georgia's 357 watershed \n     structures will reach the end of their designed lifespan. \n     Georgia has about 130 structures that need some modification, \n     and the cost estimate is $85 million. The cost of \n     rehabilitating these structures can be expensive. Two dams \n     were recently modified in Georgia's Etowah River and Raccoon \n     Creek Watersheds at a cost of nearly $750,000 each. With \n     rehabilitation, these very worthwile structures will continue \n     to provide benefits to society for years to come. It has been \n     estimated these watershed projects provide $2.20 in benefits \n     for every $1.00 of cost. That is the kind of federal \n     investment we ought to be protecting.\n       The NWC is pleased you are considering introducing such a \n     bill, and will help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               W.R. ``Bill'' Hamm,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Watershed Coalition,\n\n                                                        Burke, VA.\n\n         National Watershed Coalition--What Is It?--Who Is It?\n\n       The National Watershed Coalition is a non-profit \n     organization consisting of national, regional, state, and \n     local associations and organizations that have joined forces \n     to advocate the use of the watershed or hydrologic unit \n     concept when assessing natural resources issues. \n     Additionally, we are pooling our resources to support and \n     strengthen USDA's Small Watershed Protection and Flood \n     Prevention Programs (PL 534 & 566) as we believe they \n     represent the best available planning and implementation \n     vehicles for water and land resource management. The \n     Coalition also supports other water resources programs \n     employing total resource based principles in planning, and \n     the rehabilitation of older projects.\n       The affairs of the Coalition are managed by a steering \n     committee made up of representatives of all participating \n     national, regional, and state organizations and associations. \n     Current steering committee membership includes: Alabama \n     Association of Conservation Districts; Arkansas Watershed \n     Coalition; Associated General Contractors of America; \n     Association of State Dam Safety Officials; Association of \n     State Floodplain Managers; Association of Texas Soil & Water \n     Conservation Districts; Interstate Council on Water Policy; \n     Iowa Watersheds; Kansas Association of Conservation \n     Districts; Land Improvement Contractors of America; Lower \n     Colorado River Authority, Texas; Mississippi Association of \n     Conservation Districts; Missouri Watershed Association; \n     National Association of Conservation Districts; National \n     Association of Flood and Stormwater Management Agencies; \n     National Association of State Conservation Agencies; New \n     Mexico Watershed Coalition; North Carolina Association of \n     Soil & Water Conservation Districts; Oklahoma Association of \n     Conservation Districts; Oklahoma Conservation Commission; \n     Pennsylvania Division of Conservation Districts; Soil & Water \n     Conservation Society; South Carolina Association of \n     Conservation Districts; South Carolina Land Resources \n     Conservation Commission; State Association of Kansas \n     Watersheds; Tennessee Association of Conservation Districts; \n     Texas Association of Watershed Sponsors; Texas State Soil & \n     Water Conservation Board; Tombigbee River Valley Water \n     Management District, Mississippi; Town Creek Water\n\n[[Page S13019]]\n\n     Management District of Lee, Pontotoc, Prentiss & Union \n     Counties, Mississippi; Virginia Association of Soil & Water \n     Conservation Districts; West Virginia Soil & Water \n     Conservation District Supervisors Association; West Virginia \n     State Soil Conservation Agency; and Wisconsin PL-566 \n     Coalition.\n\n\n                              memberships\n\n       The National Watershed Coalition includes among its \n     membership a number of supporters (local watershed sponsors \n     and individuals), who have made voluntary tax-exempt \n     contributions to support the Coalition's efforts. Funds \n     obtained through memberships are used to provide information \n     to all members, and help defray expenses of publishing the \n     newsletter, mailings and a biennial conference. Our \n     membership categories are individual, organization and \n     Steering Committee.\n\n\n                    how the steering committee works\n\n       The steering committee meets three to four times each year \n     to review problems and concerns about water resources issues \n     and the PL 534 & 566 watershed programs and related \n     authorities, and discuss recommendations on how the program \n     can be improved. Each representative takes recommendations \n     back to their own organization and follows up with their own \n     membership, committees, and contacts. There is also regular \n     communication throughout the year concerning progress made on \n     current watershed management issues.\n       There is no required membership fee to become a member of \n     the Steering Committee of the National Watershed Coalition, \n     although some organizations do make a voluntary contribution \n     in support. In addition, representatives of participating \n     organizations and associations pay their own wages and \n     expenses for attendance at committee meetings, and handle \n     their own clerical and postage expenses inhouse. Steering \n     committee members are encouraged to also be Individual \n     Members.\n       From time to time, there has been, and may be again, \n     solicitation for funds for specific purposes toward a common \n     goal; however, it is understood that solicited funds are to \n     be given entirely on a voluntary basis. The Coalition is a \n     501(c)(3) organization. Funds contributed to the Coalition \n     are tax deductible.\n       If your organization wishes to play a more active role in \n     this effort, we welcome your participation. All you need to \n     do is write to the address indicated below requesting to be a \n     part of this important effort, explaining your organization's \n     interest and support for the watershed approach and the Small \n     Watershed Programs, and providing the name, title, and \n     address of the person designated to represent your group. \n     When your organization receives its acceptance letter, you \n     will be included on the mailing list and invited to \n     participate in all steering committee meetings. We welcome \n     all interested organizations.\n       We look forward to hearing from you. The more participation \n     we have, the stronger our voice will be.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1764. A bill to make technical corrections to various antitrust \nlaws and to references to such laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      ANTITRUST TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the \nAntitrust Technical Corrections and Improvements Act of 1999 with my \ncolleague Mike DeWine. This act makes five miscellaneous technical \ncorrections to the antitrust laws. Companion legislation to this bill \nhas been introduced in the House by Representatives Hyde and Conyers.\n  One of the technical corrections repeals an outdated provision which \napplies only to the Panama Canal, one clarifies a long existing \nambiguity and expressly ensures that the Sherman Act applies to the \nDistrict of Columbia and the territories, and another repeals a \nredundant jurisdictional provision. In addition, two other provisions \ncorrect typographical errors in two antitrust statutes--the inadvertent \nmislabeling of an amendment to the Clayton Act passed last year and \nanother a punctuation error in the Year 2000 Information and Readiness \nDisclosure Act.\n  The only difference between our bill and the House companion is that \nthe House would repeal an outdated statute--the Taking Depositions in \nPublic Act--which requires that pre-trial depositions in antitrust \ncases brought by the government be taken in public. This provision was \nenacted in 1913 at a time when antitrust cases were tried under \ncompletely different procedures from today and testimony was usually \nnot taken in open court. In other words, back then antitrust trials \nwere essentially conducted ``on paper.'' This statute was virtually \nignored--and unused--until the past year. This provision was revived \nlast year when, as part of its antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, the \ngovernment deposed Bill Gates.\n  Now, of course, people need to be deposed if they possess evidence \nthat may be integral to the resolution of the case. But today the 1913 \nstatute seems both unnecessary, counter-productive and, even, \nvoyeuristic--that is, if you can have voyeurism in an antitrust \ncontext. Its need has vanished because testimony is now taken in open \ncourt in antitrust cases, as it is in any other. Indeed, requiring the \ndepositions of prominent figures such as Bill Gates and Steve Case in \ncontroversial and widely publicized cases inevitably creates a media \n``feeding frenzy'' contrary to the sound administration of justice and \na sober examination of complicated legal issues.\n  So I would support the House provision but, at this point, my belief \nis that it is more important to move the underlying measure in a timely \nmanner than to wait to develop a consensus on the deposition provision \nin the Senate. We'll work on that consensus here, or we'll work the \ndifferences out in conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I look forward to working with my colleagues to turn this bill \ninto law.\n  The summary of the bill follows:\n\nSummary of the Antitrust Technical Corrections and Improvements Act of \n                                  1999\n\n       1. Repeal of the Antitrust Provision of the Panama Canal \n     Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 31)--Section 11 of the Panama Canal Act \n     provides that no vessel owned by someone who is violating the \n     antitrust laws may pass through the Panama Canal. With the \n     return of the Canal to Panamanian sovereignty at the end of \n     1999, it is appropriate to repeal this outdated provision.\n       2. Clarification that Section 2 of the Sherman Act Applies \n     to the District and the Territories (15 U.S.C. Sec. 3)--\n     Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act are two of the central \n     provisions of the antitrust laws. Section 1 prohibits \n     combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, and \n     Section 2 prohibits monopolization. Section 3 of the Sherman \n     Act was intended to apply these provisions to the District of \n     Columbia and the various territories of the United States. \n     Unfortunately, however, section 3 is ambiguously drafted and \n     leaves it unclear whether Section 2 applies to the \n     District of Columbia and the territories. This bill \n     clarifies that both Section 1 and Section 2 apply to the \n     District and the Territories.\n       3. Repeal of Redundant Antitrust Jurisdictional Provision \n     in Section 77 at the Wilson Tariff Act--In 1955, Congress \n     modernized the jurisdictional and venue provisions relating \n     to antitrust suits by amendment Section 4 of the Clayton Act \n     (15 U.S.C. Sec. 15). At that time, it repealed the redundant \n     jurisdiction provision in Section 7 of the Sherman Act, but \n     not the corresponding provision in Section 77 of the Wilson \n     Tariff Act. It appears that this was an oversight because \n     Section 77 was never codified and has rarely been used. \n     Repealing Section 77 will not change any substantive rights \n     because Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides any potential \n     plaintiff with the same rights. Rather it simply rides the \n     law of a confusing, redundant, and little used provision.\n       4. Technical Amendment to the Curt Flood Act of 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-297)--This provision corrects an inadvertent \n     technical error in the statutory codification of the Curt \n     Flood Act of 1998, the statute which provided that major \n     league baseball players are covered under the antitrust law. \n     The Curt Flood Act was codified to a section number of the \n     Clayton Act which was already in use. The amendment corrects \n     this error by redesignating the statute as section 28 of the \n     Clayton Act. This substantive change to the statute is \n     intended.\n       5. Technical Amendment to the Year 2000 Information and \n     Readiness Disclosure Act--This provision corrects a \n     typographical error in the statute as enacted by the \n     inserting a missing period in section 5(a)(2). No substantive \n     change to the statute is intended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n\n  S. 1765. A bill to prohibit post-viability abortions; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    the late-term abortion ban bill\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Boxer and I today are \nintroducing a bill to ban abortions after a fetus is viable.\n  The bill has 3 provisions:\n  (1) It bans post-viability abortions.\n  (2) It provides an exception to the ban if, in the medical judgment \nof the attending physician, the abortion is necessary to preserve the \nlife of the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences to \nthe woman.\n  (3) It includes two civil penalties:\n  For the first offense, a fine not to exceed $10,000. For the second \noffense, revocation of a physician's medical license.\n\n[[Page S13020]]\n\n  This amendment is similar to S. 481 which we introduced in the \nprevious Congress and the amendment we offered as a substitute to the \n``partial-birth abortion bill'' when the Senate considered it. The \nmajor difference is that the bill we introduce today adds the penalty \nof revocation of the medical license for a second offense. S. 481 did \nnot include this penalty. Both S. 481 and this bill have as the penalty \nfor the first offense a $10,000 fine.\n  This bill reflects my deep belief that abortions after a fetus is \nviable should not take place except in the rarest of circumstances to \nprotect the life and health of the mother. That is the intent of this \nbill.\n  The medical community has said that there are very occasionally very \nextraordinary and tragic circumstances when a physician may determine \nthat a postviability abortion is the safest procedure for protecting a \nwoman's health. These are circumstances which most of us can never \nimagine.\n  Leading medical organizations say that post-viability abortions are \nrare and should be rare. They say that medical decisions should be made \nby doctors who must determine the best procedure. For example, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, has said:\n\n       ACOG has never supported post-viability abortions except \n     for the constitutionally protected exception of saving the \n     life or health of a woman.\n       There may be circumstances where the physician and patient \n     would reach the conclusion that this procedure [Intact \n     Dilatation and Extraction after 16 weeks of pregnancy] is the \n     most medically appropriate . . . there is a need for \n     flexibility in handling unexpected situations. . . .\n\n  The California Medical Association wrote me, ``The determination of \nthe medical need for, and effectiveness of, particular medical \nprocedures must be left to the medical profession, to be reflected in \nthe standard of care . . . The legislative process is ill-suited to \nevaluate complex medical procedures whose importance may vary with a \nparticular patient's case and with the state of scientific knowledge.''\n  Congress cannot anticipate every conceivable medical situation. Only \nthe doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's \nunique medical history and health can make this decision of how best to \nprotect the woman's health.\n  This substitute is designed to protect the fetus, to protect the \nwoman's life and health and to give the physician the latitude to make \nthe necessary medical decisions in those rarest of circumstances.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, held that \nthe woman's health must be the physician's primary concern and the \nphysician must be given the discretion he or she needs to choose the \nmost appropriate abortion method to protect the woman's life and \nhealth.\n  The Supreme Court has defined ``health of the mother.'' In Doe v. \nBolton, the Court held that the decision of whether a woman requires an \nabortion for the health of the mother is a medical judgment to ``be \nexercised in light of all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, \nfamilial, and the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the \npatient.'' In so doing, the Court further recognized a doctor's \nimportant role in determining whether an abortion is necessary.\n  I believe that the language of this bill--unlike S. 1692, Senator \nSantorum's bill and the substitute offered yesterday by Senator \nDurbin-- has a meaningful health exception for the woman and is \nconstitutional.\n  The decision to have an abortion--by the mother, the father, the \nphysician--is never an easy one. It is the most wrenching decision any \nwoman could ever have to make. It is a profoundly, impossibly difficult \ndecision in the late stages of pregnancy.\n  No physician would perform a postviability abortion without extended \nand serious consideration. Because the physician's action has \nconsequences for human life and the action should not be undertaken \nexcept in the gravest of circumstances, the substitute includes two \npenalties. It creates for the first offense a $10,000 fine; for the \nsecond offense, revocation of the physician's license.\n  I oppose post-viability abortions. They are wrong, except to save the \nmother's life and health. Late-term abortions are rare and they should \nbe rare.\n  I will vote against S. 1692, Senator Santorum's bill, because it is \nnot constitutional. It does not include adequate protections for a \nwoman's health.\n  I believe this bill is a far preferable approach. Its penalties \nrepresent grave consequences for violations. It protects the fetus \nexcept in extraordinary circumstances that could have serious adverse \nconsequences for the mother's health. It protects a woman's life and \nhealth.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in passing this bill.\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1767. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to improve Native Hawaiian education programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             native hawaiian education reauthorization act\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Akaka, that would provide for the \nreauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Education Act.\n  First enacted into law in 1988 as part of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, the Native Hawaiian Education Act provides \nsupport for the education of native Hawaiian students in furtherance of \nthe United States' trust responsibility to the native people of Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, I am sad to report that while these programs are \nbeginning to demonstrate an improved pattern of academic performance \nand achievement, we still have a way to go, as the following statistics \nwould indicate.\n  Education risk factors continue to start even before birth for many \nnative Hawaiian children, including late or no prenatal care, high \nrates of births to unmarried native Hawaiian mothers, and high rates of \nbirths to teenage parents.\n  Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their school experience \nlagging behind other students in terms of readiness factors such as \nvocabulary test scores;\n  Native Hawaiian students continue to score below national norms on \nstandardized education achievement tests at all grade levels;\n  Both public and private schools continue to show a pattern of lower \npercent ages of native Hawaiian students in the uppermost achievement \nlevels and in gifted and talented programs;\n  Native Hawaiian students continue to be over-represented among \nstudents qualifying for special education programs provided to students \nwith learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional \nimpairment, and other such disabilities;\n  Native Hawaiian continue to be under-represented in institutions of \nhigher education and among adults who have completed four or more years \nof college;\n  Native Hawaiian continue to be disproportionately represented in many \nnegative social and physical statistics indicative of special \neducational needs, as demonstrated by the fact that--\n  Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be retained in grade \nlevel and to be excessively absent in secondary school;\n  Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of drug and alcohol \nuse in the State of Hawaii; and\n  Native Hawaiian children continue to be disproportionately victimized \nby child abuse and neglect; and\n  In the 1988, National Assessment of Educational Progress, Hawaiian \nfourth graders ranked 39 among groups of students from 39 States in \nreading.\n  Mr. President, because Hawaiian students rank among the lowest groups \nof students nationally in reading, and because native Hawaiian students \nrank the lowest among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative \nthat greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early education \nand literacy in Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, there was a time in the history of Hawaii when there \nwere very high rates of literacy and integration of traditional culture \nand Western Education among native Hawaiians. These high rates were \nattributable to the Hawaiian language-based public school system \nestablished in 1840 by King Kamehameha III.\n  Mr. President, if we are to reverse the course of these downward \ntrends in\n\n[[Page S13021]]\n\neducational achievement and academic performance of native Hawaiian \nstudents, it is critical that the initiatives authorized by the Native \nHawaiian Education Act be reauthorized.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully request unanimous consent that the text \nof this measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

NATIVE HAWAIIAN EDUCATION.\n\n       Part B of title IX of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7901 et seq.) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n                  ``PART B--NATIVE HAWAIIAN EDUCATION\n\n     ``SEC. 9201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       ``This part may be cited as the `Native Hawaiian Education \n     Act'.\n\n     ``SEC. 9202. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous \n     people with a historical continuity to the original \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was \n     organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a \n     nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as \n     evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and \n     navigation.\n       ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-\n     indigenous people in Hawai`i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian \n     people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient \n     subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure \n     system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.\n       ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawai`i.\n       ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized \n     the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, \n     which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended \n     full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawai`i, and entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Kingdom of Hawai`i to govern friendship, commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally \n     recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai`i, the Kingdom \n     of Hawai`i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, \n     including United States citizens, who were assisted in their \n     efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval \n     representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. \n     Because of the participation of United States agents and \n     citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in 1993 \n     the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the \n     overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native \n     Hawaiians to self-determination through Public Law 103-150 \n     (107 Stat. 1510).\n       ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint \n     Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to \n     the United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), \n     ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of \n     Hawai`i, including the government and crown lands of the \n     former Kingdom of Hawai`i, to the United States, but mandated \n     that revenue generated from the lands be used `solely for the \n     benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for \n     educational and other public purposes'.\n       ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined \n     from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, \n     and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which \n     designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands \n     for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special \n     relationship between the United States and the Native \n     Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the \n     Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: `One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a \n     sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and \n     many of them are in poverty.'.\n       ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June \n     20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, \n     392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the \n     National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance.'.\n       ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, \n     including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments \n     to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n     Act.\n       ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union', the \n     United States also ceded to the State of Hawai`i title to the \n     public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated \n     that such lands be held by the State `in public trust' and \n     reaffirmed the special relationship that existed between the \n     United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal \n     responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of \n     the State of Hawai`i for the betterment of the conditions of \n     Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the \n     Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.\n       ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed \n     that--\n       ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       ``(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii;\n       ``(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is \n     comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; \n     and\n       ``(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United \n     States have--\n       ``(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; and\n       ``(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n     governance that has never been extinguished.\n       ``(13) The political relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and \n     reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the \n     inclusion of Native Hawaiians in--\n       ``(A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     2991 et seq.);\n       ``(B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996);\n       ``(C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.);\n       ``(D) the Native American Graves Protection and \n     Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);\n       ``(E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       ``(F) the Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(G) the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Culture and Art Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(H) the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et \n     seq.) and the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. \n     2801 et seq.); and\n       ``(I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education \n     to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native \n     Hawaiian education.

The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mobile Telecommunications \n     Sourcing Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The provision of mobile telecommunications services is \n     a matter of interstate commerce within the jurisdiction of \n     the United States Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the \n     United States Constitution. Certain aspects of mobile \n     telecommunications technologies and services do not respect, \n     and operate independently of, State and local jurisdictional \n     boundaries.\n       (2) The mobility afforded to millions of American consumers \n     by mobile telecommunications services helps to fuel the \n     American economy, facilitate the development of the \n     information superhighway and provide important safety \n     benefits.\n       (3) Users of mobile telecommunications services can \n     originate a call in one State or local jurisdiction and \n     travel through other States or local jurisdictions during the \n     course of the call. These circumstances make it more \n     difficult to track the separate segments of a particular call \n     with all of the States and local jurisdictions involved with \n     the call. In addition, expanded home calling areas, bundled \n     service offerings and other marketing advances make it \n     increasingly difficult to assign each transaction to a \n     specific taxing jurisdiction.\n       (4) State and local taxes imposed on mobile \n     telecommunications services that are not consistently based \n     on subject consumers, businesses and others engaged in \n     interstate commerce to multiple, confusing and burdensome \n     State and local taxes and result in higher costs to consumers \n     and the industry.\n       (5) State and local taxes that are not consistently based \n     can result in some telecommunications revenues inadvertently \n     escaping State and local taxation altogether, thereby \n     violating standards of tax fairness, creating inequities \n     among competitors in the telecommunications market and \n     depriving State and local governments of needed tax revenues.\n       (6) Because State and local tax laws and regulations of \n     many jurisdictions were established before the proliferation \n     of mobile telecommunications services, the application of \n     these laws to the provision of mobile telecommunications \n     services may produce conflicting or unintended tax results.\n       (7) State and local governments provide essential public \n     services, including services that Congress encourages State \n     and local governments to undertake in partnership with the \n     Federal government for the achievement of important national \n     policy goals.\n       (8) State and local governments provide services that \n     support the flow of interstate commerce, including services \n     that support the use and development of mobile \n     telecommunications services.\n       (9) State governments as sovereign entities in our Federal \n     system may require that interstate commerce conducted within \n     their borders pay its fair share of tax to support the \n     government services provided by those governments.\n       (10) Local governments as autonomous subdivisions of a \n     State government may require that interstate commerce \n     conducted within their borders pay its fair share of tax to \n     support the governmental services provided by those \n     governments.\n       (11) To balance the needs of interstate commerce and the \n     mobile telecommunications industry with the legitimate role \n     of State and local governments in our system of federalism, \n     Congress needs to establish a uniform and coherent national \n     policy regarding the taxation of mobile telecommunications \n     services through the exercise of its constitutional authority \n     to regulate interstate commerce.\n       (12) Congress also recognizes that the solution established \n     by this legislation is a necessarily practical one and must \n     provide for a system of State and local taxation of mobile \n     telecommunications services that in the absence of this \n     solution would not otherwise occur. To this extent, Congress \n     exercises its power to provide a reasonable solution to \n     otherwise insoluble problems of multi-jurisdictional \n     commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the more \nthan 9.1 million women business owners nationwide on the occasion of \nNational Business Women's Week. This week marks the celebration of the \n71st annual National Business Women's Week.\n  On this occasion, advocates for women business owners may have a \nwell-deserved sense of pride. I am pleased to be able to report that \nbetween 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned businesses increased \nby 103 percent nationwide, employment increased by 320 percent, and \nsales grew by 436 percent. Today, women business owners across the \ncountry employ more than 27.5 million people and generate in excess of \n$3.6 trillion in sales. These businesses account for 38 percent of all \nU.S. businesses.\n  In my home State of Maine, there are more than 48,200 women-owned \nbusinesses, employing 91,700 people and generating $10.2 billion in \nsales. For Maine's economy, this represents growth of more than 85.3 \npercent between 1987 and 1996.\n  Mr. President, this data demonstrates just how vital women and women-\nowned businesses are to the health of the U.S. economy. Although women-\nowned businesses have grown at an astronomical rate, we must continue \nto ensure that women have access to the knowledge and capital necessary \nto start their own businesses.\n  That is why I ask that, as we celebrate the tremendous \naccomplishments of women during National Business Women's Week, my \nfellow colleagues join me in supporting opportunities for women to \nbecome entrepreneurs.\n  As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I am proud of the \nrole the Committee and the Small Business Administration have played in \nproviding access to assistance from women entrepreneurs, because many \nof the businesses in this rapidly growing sector are small businesses. \nJust last month, the Committee reported legislation, the Women's \nBusiness Centers Sustainability Act, that would significantly increase \nfunding for the Women's Business Centers Program, which provides women \nwith long-term training and counseling in all aspects of owning and \nmanaging a business--fostering the growth of women's business ownership \nand providing a foundation of basic support to women business owners.\n\n  This program promotes the growth of women-owned businesses by \nsponsoring business training and technical counseling, access to credit \nand capital, and access to marketing opportunities, including Federal \ncontracts and export opportunities. Over the past 10 years, the program \nhas served tens of thousands of women entrepreneurs by providing them \nwith consulting, training, and financial assistance as they seek to \nstart or expand their own business. As a result, women are starting new \nfirms at twice the rate of all other business, and employ roughly one \nin every five U.S. workers. Today, the program is comprised of nearly \n70 centers in 40 States.\n  In my view, creating new opportunities for historically disadvantaged \ngroups, such as women and minorities to help provide tangible \nopportunities for economic independence must remain a top priority, and \nNational Business Women's Week is a perfect opportunity to focus \nattention on the importance of such efforts.\n  In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to the Business \nand Professional Women/USA organization, which has played a pivotal \nrole in making the celebration of National Business Women's Week \npossible.\n  Since its creation in 1928, National Business Women's Week has been \nsponsored by Business and Professional Women/USA for the purpose of \nrecognizing and honoring the achievements of working women.\n  Business and Professional Women/USA local organizations across the \ncountry, and in my state of Maine, will take this week to honor \noutstanding business women and employers of the year, and I would like \nto congratulate them and thank them for their important \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S13033-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13033-S13035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO IKUA PURDY\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this past Sunday, eight rodeo stars \nwere inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame at\n\n[[Page S13034]]\n\nthe National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center in \nOklahoma City. Included among the honorees is one of Hawaii's most \nlegendary paniolos--paniolo is Hawaiian for cowboy--the late Ikua \nPurdy. Ikua Purdy was born in 1873 at Parker Ranch, one of the largest \nand most famous ranches in the world, on the Big Island of Hawaii. As a \nboy he learned to ride and rope, working as a paniolo in the cattle \nindustry, a large and important enterprise in Hawaii at the time.\n  Ikua Purdy secured his place as a rodeo legend for his exploits in \n1908 at the World Championship Rodeo in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Purdy, along \nwith Eben ``Rawhide Ben'' Parker Low, Jack Low, and Archie Ka`aua \ntraveled from the Big Island to Cheyenne and borrowed horses to compete \nin the world roping championship. This was their first competition \noutside of Hawaii. At the conclusion of the two-day competition, Jack \nLow placed sixth, Archie Ka`aua finished third, and Ikua Purdy won the \nwon roping championship with a record time of 56 seconds--an amazing \ntime that is all the more incredible since it came after an arduous \n3,300-mile trek and accomplished with a borrowed horse.\n  Mr. President, I ask that two articles from The Honolulu Advertiser \ndetailing the remarkable achievements of Ikua Purdy be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The articles follow:\n\n              [From the Honolulu Advertiser, July 5, 1999]\n\n                    Bid Made To Give Paniolo His Due\n\n                            (By Dan Nakaso)\n\n       In 1908, three Hawaii paniolo set off for Cheyenne, Wyo., \n     where they heard the best ropers and riders in the land were \n     gathering.\n       Just to get to the World Championship Rodeo, Ikua Purdy, \n     Jack Low and Archie Ka`aua had to take a boat from the Big \n     Island to Honolulu, catch a steamship to San Francisco, then \n     hop a train to Cheyenne.\n       When they arrived 3,300 miles later, the other cowboys \n     didn't know what to make of their dark skin, floppy hats and \n     colorful clothes. And for a while it looked as if Purdy, Low \n     and Ka`aua had made their journey for nothing, because nobody \n     would loan them horses to compete.\n       But when the dust of competition settled after two days of \n     roping and riding, Low had finished sixth, Ka`aua third and \n     Purdy stood alone as the world roping champion.\n       The story became the stuff of paniolo lore. In the 101 \n     years that followed, Purdy's legend has been remembered in \n     Hawaii through paniolo songs, such as ``Hawaiian Rough \n     Riders'' and ``Walomina.'' He was among the first people \n     inducted into Hawaii's sports Hall of Fame.\n       What happened in Cheyenne has also inspired a modern-day \n     quest by a pair of California cattle ranchers to give Purdy--\n     and Hawaii's paniolo lifestyle--their rightful places in the \n     history of the American West.\n       Purdy's name on the Mainland is only now spreading in \n     cowboy circles, mostly through cattlemen Jack Roddy and Cecil \n     Jones. They're trying to get Purdy inducted into the Rodeo \n     Hall of Fame, a wing of the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and \n     Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City.\n       Later this month, the historical society that runs the \n     Rodeo Hall of Fame will send its 400 members ballots \n     containing Purdy's name.\n       If Purdy is voted in when the ballots are counted in \n     September, Roddy and Jones believe it will be just the start \n     toward recognizing Hawaii's place in cowboy and cattle \n     history.\n       ``Purdy's just the beginning,'' Roddy said. ``We need to \n     tell the whole story of Hawaii, how cattle showed up in \n     Hawaii first (even before Texas) and what Hawaii did for the \n     rest of the West. The cowboys over there view Hawaii a people \n     wearing hula skirts on beaches. They don't realize it's huge \n     cattle country.''\n       If Purdy doesn't make it into the Hall of Fame this summer \n     the historical society might not consider him again for \n     years.\n       He missed induction last year by 60 votes, a fact that \n     gnaws at Billy Bergin, a Big Island veterinarian who grew up \n     working as a paniolo.\n       Bergin established the Paniolo Preservation Society 18 \n     months ago and is pushing people in Hawaii to pay $25 to the \n     historical society so they can become voting members and get \n     Purdy inducted.\n       In just the last three months, 87 people from Hawaii have \n     joined, according to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.\n       Before the Hawaii campaign, ``no one had ever heard of Ikua \n     Purdy,'' said Judy Dearing, who coordinates the rodeo program \n     part of the Hall of Fame.\n       ``Now we have such an interest from the Hawaii folks that \n     we have a nice file an inch-and-a-half thick on Ikua.''\n       Jones vaguely remembered reading ``about some guy who came \n     to Cheyenne and showed everybody up, set some records that \n     were unbelievable and beat all the hotshots.''\n       Last year ``the nominating committee wondered how come his \n     name hadn't come up before. Unfortunately, not enough people \n     were aware of him. I said, `We need to get the word out. He's \n     long overdue.' ''\n       Purdy's descendants lean toward the humble side of life, \n     just like Ikua, and the push to elect him into the Hall of \n     Fame makes some of them uncomfortable.\n       ``Most of us feel he should be in the Hall of Fame because \n     of his merits and not by buying a vote,'' said Palmer Purdy, \n     one of Ikua's grandsons. ``Don't get me wrong, I want to see \n     him inducted. I just don't want to get him in that way. I \n     want him to be inducted because he was a competitor and he \n     was good at it and he was the best that Hawaii had to \n     offer.''\n       Ikua was born on Christmas Eve, 1873, at Mana on the Big \n     Island's Parker Ranch. He died on the Fourth of July, 1945, \n     at Ulupalakua on Maui, where he finished out his paniolo days \n     as foreman of Ulupalakua Ranch. He's buried at Ulupalakua.\n       As a boy, Palmer Purdy, now 52, never heard a word from his \n     father, William, about Ikua's victory in Cheyenne or his \n     status as a legend.\n       It wasn't until Palmer became a teenager that he got \n     curious about his dead grandfather.\n       ``All my uncles and aunties are very humble and didn't \n     openly discuss Ikua's greatness,'' Purdy said. ``They didn't \n     want to brag. But I would overhear other people talking about \n     Ikua Purdy being a famous cowboy.''\n       The more he heard how Purdy taught paniolo to train horses \n     in the ocean--not ``break'' them--and about Purdy's victories \n     in Hawaii rodeos, the more Palmer filled in the gaps.\n       ``The first thing that came to my mind was, `Wow, I missed \n     a lot growing up.' We sure would have liked to see him in \n     action. When people start writing songs about you, you put a \n     dent in people's minds. So he must have been a great, great \n     individual for that to happen.''\n\n\n                             the early days\n\n       Purdy's life is just one chapter in the history of cowboys, \n     horses and cattle in Hawaii, Bergin, Roddy and Jones said.\n       It begins in either 1792 or 1793 when British sea Capt. \n     George Vancouver brought cattle to the Big Island as a gift \n     to King Kamehameha I. Some of them died soon after, so \n     Vancouver convinced Kamehameha to impose a kapu on killing \n     cattle to give them a chance to breed.\n       The herd grew so successfully over the next three decades \n     that cattle terrorized people and overran crops and forests. \n     Rock walls in parts of urban Honolulu and other islands still \n     stand as testament to the crude efforts to gain control over \n     the bovines.\n       In 1830, Kamehameha III turned to Spanish California for \n     help. Three vaqueros came over and showed Hawaiians how to \n     ride horses that had been imported here 30 years before, and \n     how to handle cattle.\n       Hawaii had its first working cowboys by 1836--some three or \n     four decades before America. They called themselves paniolo, \n     and Island-ized version of the word Espanol, or Spanish.\n       Raising cattle soon grew into a major export industry and \n     helped Hawaiians pay off debts they had racked up by not \n     filling orders for sandalwood.\n       Among the big cattle operations was the Parker Ranch on the \n     Big Island, founded in 1848 by John Palmer Parker. Purdy was \n     one of his great-grandsons.\n       In 1907, Eben ``Rawhide Ben'' Parker Low went to Cheyenne's \n     Frontier Days and thought Hawaii's paniolo would be able to \n     hold their own in competition there. Rawhide Ben had recently \n     sold Pu`uwa`awa`a Ranch on the Big Island and financed the \n     trip to Cheyenne in 1908 for himself, his half-brother Purdy, \n     his cousin Ka'aua and his brother Jack Low.\n       ``He felt they were the top ropers in the Islands,'' said \n     Tila Spielman, Rawhide Ben's granddaughter.\n       The horses that Purdy, Low and Ka`aua borrowed were rough. \n     And on the second day of competition, Low downed his calf in \n     record time, but an asthma attack kept him from tying it up.\n       His time from the first day was still good enough for sixth \n     place. Ka`aua's time of 1 minute, 28 seconds, got him third \n     place. And Purdy was champion with an astounding 56 seconds. \n     According to some accounts, it might have even been as low as \n     52 seconds.\n       Purdy never returned to Cheyenne, or even left Hawaii \n     again.\n       He is on the verge of being immortalized in Oklahoma, but \n     the attention he is getting today is exactly the kind that \n     would have made him nervous.\n       Whenever he was asked about his accomplishments, Purdy \n     would simply say: ``Other things to talk about besides me.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Honolulu Advertiser, Oct. 18, 1999]\n\n                  Rodeo Hall of Fame Adds Isle Paniolo\n\n       A Hawaii paniolo who is remembered in song and story was \n     inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame yesterday in Oklahoma \n     City.\n       The late Ikua Purdy was one of eight people honored during \n     a ceremony at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western \n     Heritage Center.\n       Twenty of Purdy's relatives and friends made the journey \n     from Hawaii for the program. One of the ceremony's highlights \n     was the group performing the hula to a reading of Purdy's \n     life story.\n       Purdy, who was born on Christmas Eve 1873 on the Big \n     Island's Parker Ranch, learned to ride and rope on grasslands \n     and upland forests of Waimea and Mauna Kea.\n       In the 1908 world roping championship in Cheyenne, Wyo., he \n     snagged a steer in a\n\n[[Page S13035]]\n\n     record 56 seconds. Such songs as ``Hawaiian Rough Riders'' \n     and ``Waiomina'' recounted his victory. Purdy, who never \n     returned to Wyoming to defend his title, worked as a paniolo \n     until his death July 4, 1945.\n       Purdy missed induction last year by 60 votes. So Billy \n     Bergin, a Big Island veterinarian who grew up working as a \n     paniolo, established an organization that encouraged people \n     in Hawaii to join the Rodeo Hall of Fame so they could vote \n     for Purdy's induction.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Ikua Purdy went home to Hawaii and resumed his work as a \npaniolo until his death in 1945. He did not return to the mainland to \ndefend his title, in fact he never left Hawaii's shores again. But his \nvictory and legend live on in Hawaii and the annals of rodeo history. \nHis achievements are immortalized in song and hula in Hawaii, including \n``Hawaiian Rough Riders'' and ``Waiomina.''\n  Yet, during his lifetime, Ikua Purdy avoided drawing attention to his \nroping mastery and world record performance. I am pleased to join Ikua \nPurdy's family and friends in honoring the legacy and talent of one of \nHawaii's and America's greatest cowboys. This weekend's well-deserved \ninduction into the Rodeo Hall of Fame enshrines a sporting feat that \ncontinues to amaze rodeo fans and highlights the long, proud history of \nHawaii's paniolos.\n  This well-deserved honor for a paniolo whose talents were matched \nonly by his humility and quiet dignity follows on the heels of renewed \ninterest and appreciation of Hawaii's illustrious paniolo traditions.\n  The Hawaiian cowboy played an important role in the economic and \ncultural development of Hawaii and helped to establish the islands as a \nmajor cattle exporter to California, the Americas, and the Pacific Rim \nfor over a century. Paniolo history is frequently overlooked in Hawaii \nand is largely unknown beyond our shores. Yet, this is an important \npart of Hawaii's history and of American history. Indeed, Hawaii's \nworking cowboys preceded the emergence of their compatriots in the \nAmerican West.\n  Paniolo came from Spain, Portugal, Mexico, California, and throughout \nSouth America to work Hawaii's ranches. They brought their languages \nand culture, including the guitar and ukulele. As they shared their \nculture, married and raised families, they embraced the Native Hawaiian \nculture and customs. In many ways, this sharing and blending of \ncultures is the foundation for the diverse and rich heritage the people \nof Hawaii enjoy today.\n  The paniolo experience is part of the distinct historical narrative \nof our nation's history. It illustrates how differences have developed \ninto shared values and community. By illuminating the many currents and \nbranches of our history and society, we acquire a better understanding \nand appreciation of our national landscape.\n  The rediscovery of paniolo history was further encouraged when \nGovernor Ben Cayetano declared 1998 the ``Year of the Paniolo'' in \nHawaii. An excellent documentary film by Edgy Lee, ``Paniolo O Hawaii--\nCowboys of the Far West,'' that premiered at the Smithsonian captures \nthe essence of the Hawaiian cowboy and highlights the economic and \ncultural significance of the paniolo in the islands. I encourage all \nstudents and enthusiasts of the American West and cowboy lore to learn \nabout the Hawaiian paniolo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/21/senate-section/article/S13035-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMERICANS OF ARABIC HERITAGE OF THE LEHIGH VALLEY, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.
