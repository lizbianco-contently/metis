Help them to claim Your \npromise through Jeremiah; ``Call on me and I will show you great and \nmighty things which you do not know''.--Jeremiah 33:3. Enable the \nSenators to humble themselves and confess their need for Your \ninspiration. Endow them with wisdom to see clearly Your solutions to \nthe perplexities we face. The bigger the problems, the more of Your \npower is available. Make the Senators positive, courageous problem \nsolvers.

Mr. President, if Senators have statements they would like \nto make or legislation they would like to introduce, we will have a \ntime for doing that today. I have talked to a number of Senators this \nmorning, including my counterpart on the Democratic side, Senator \nDaschle, and everybody seems to be in good spirits and ready to go to \nwork. We do have a lot of legislation that is pending, that has been \nreported out of committees and we hope to move to very quickly. We have \na number of bills in conference that we hope to have started right away \nto move toward getting a conference report. I believe the Federal \nAviation Administration conferees will meet, in fact, on Thursday to \nbegin to do some work there. This week we have scheduled action on the \nbankruptcy reform bill. We spent a lot of time at the end of the \nsession last year on that bill--in fact, I think it was over a week. We \nwent through over 100 amendments. We have narrowed the list down to a \nrelatively small number. I visited with Senator Daschle about this \nlegislation, and we will have some decision, some announcements we will \nmake later on today about exactly how to proceed on bankruptcy reform.\n  In addition to that, we will have legislation that will be pending \nafter today under rule XIV with regard to the situation of Elian \nGonzalez, the young boy from Cuba. The legislation advocated by Senator \nMack, Senator Torricelli, Senator Graham, and others would grant \ncitizenship to this young boy and therefore have the matter of his \nsituation determined by a custody court proceeding rather than \nImmigration. When that would come up will depend on a number of other \nthings, but it could be available as early as Wednesday or it could be \nacted on instead next week.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session. I am sure many Senators will be in the Chamber to make \nstatements and introduce bills. We will be taking legislative action on \nTuesday and Wednesday, with the potential of a number of votes \noccurring Tuesday afternoon and/or Wednesday. On Thursday, we will have \na conference retreat for Republicans at the Library of Congress so we \nwill not be in session during the day. As a reminder, the State of the \nUnion Address will be that night, Thursday, January 27, at 9 p.m., and \ntherefore the Senate will convene at 8:40 p.m. in order to proceed to \nthe\n\n[[Page S2]]\n\nHouse of Representatives for that Address.\n  Finally, for the remainder of this week, I hope we will look at \nexactly when we will take up the nuclear waste legislation. I presume \nthat some action will be taken either late this week or early next week \nwhich will guarantee a vote.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' attention and say again I look forward to \nworking with Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  In order to confirm that the Senate is prepared to begin business in \nthe second session of the 106th Congress, I now suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

It is good to be back and \nsee so many friendly faces.\n\n  The majority leader and I had a good conversation earlier today and \ndiscussed a number of matters to be addressed in the early days of this \nsession of Congress. I look forward to working with him and with our \ncolleagues as we begin this second session of the 106th Congress.\n  I might inquire, has the majority leader finished? I didn't want to \ninterrupt.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, if he wishes to make a statement at this time that \nwould be fine, but we need to establish a quorum so we can notify the \nPresident that the Senate is ready to work.\n  The Senator can make his statement now or we can establish a quorum.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

I believe he will be here momentarily \nto deliver his remarks. I call on other Senators who have been prepared \nto make remarks. I believe Senator Mack and perhaps several others \nwould like to make remarks before the Senate concludes business today. \nI am glad we have established a quorum and are now ready to proceed.\n  I again remind Senators we will be in session on Tuesday and \nWednesday of this week. They should expect votes possibly during the \nday on Tuesday and possibly several votes on Wednesday.\n  It is our hope at this time that we can reach an agreement on how to \nproceed on the bankruptcy bill and we will be able to get an agreement \non that and complete that bill which was carried over from the first \nsession of this 106th Congress, and hopefully we could finish it by \nWednesday night. There has been an indication, I believe on both sides \nof the aisle, we hope we could do that. So that would be our desire.\n  With regard to the matter of the young boy from Cuba, Elian Gonzalez, \nagain what happens there will depend on events. Senator Mack will \nsurely speak to that when he arrives in the Chamber.\n  Then at some point next week we will initiate proceedings on the \nnuclear waste bill also.\n  Those would be the first three issues we have pending before us. We \nwill confer with the Democratic leadership and work on the bills that \nwill be considered after that.\n  Mr. President, since Senator Daschle has not arrived just  yet, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill granting \nElian Gonzalez American citizenship.\n  What it means is that the most important decision in this young boy's \nlife will not be made by a political bureaucracy--but by a family \ncourt.\n  Mr. President, neither the President of the United States, his \nAttorney General, nor the dictator ruling Cuba is qualified to decide \nthe fate of this little boy. The United States is a country of laws, \nand we zealously believe in the rule of law. Elian deserves access to \nthe legal protections of our family courts. These courts are in the \nbusiness of considering family cases day after day. And they would \nconsider ``what is in the boy's best interest.'' Today, the only \nconcern of the INS is ``who speaks for the boy,'' not about his future.\n  The primary purpose of this legislation is to ensure Elian has access \nto America's family courts: a court that will consider the choice that \nhis mother made when she gave her life for freedom.\n  Mr. President, we will continue this debate sometime later in the \nweek and make no mistake, I believe that Elian should remain here in \nthe United States where he can live in freedom. But it is not my \npurpose to make that decision; that is the function of a family court.\n  This bill is intended to allow a family court to settle this dispute \nbased upon the best interests of Elian Gonzalez.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me again welcome our colleagues back. \nI had the opportunity this morning to discuss the schedule and the many \nmutual matters of concern with the majority leader. Let me again \nwelcome back our staff and express heartfelt appreciation for the great \njob that so many of our people have done over the last couple of months \nwhile we have been gone. I welcome our colleagues back not only to a \nnew session but a new year, a new century, and a new millennium.\n  As we begin this new year, Americans have every reason to be proud \nand optimistic. In the last decade of the last century, we saw freedom \nand democracy triumph around the globe. We saw Eastern Europe abandon \ncommunism and the Soviet Union disintegrate. We saw Nelson Mandela walk \nout of prison and into history as the first democratically elected \nPresident of the new South Africa.\n  Here at home we restored strength to America's economy. We started \nthe last decade with the biggest budget deficits in our Nation's \nhistory, and we ended it with the biggest budget surplus. We have seen \nmore than 20 million new jobs created in the last 7 years. Today we \nhave the lowest unemployment in 40 years, and the lowest unemployment \never among African Americans and Hispanics. Americans are working \nagain.\n  Finally, after 20 years, real wages for America's families are \ngrowing again. Family incomes are up, and inflation is virtually \nnonexistent.\n  We also made progress in the last decade on the many social problems \nthat some people thought were intractable. Since 1993, we have seen a \n48-percent decrease in the welfare rolls, the largest decline in our \nNation's history. We put 100,000 new police officers on the street, and \ntoday the violent crime rate is the lowest it has been in a generation. \nWe enacted the single largest investment in children's health since \n1965 and the largest increases in higher education since the GI bill. \nToday our Nation is prospering, and we are at peace.\n  The question facing us as we begin this new session of Congress, this \nfirst session of the 21st century, is: How do we keep America moving in \nthe right direction? How do we provide the leadership that will help \ncontinue the global march toward freedom and democracy?\n  Here at home, how do we keep our economy growing? How do we help \nordinary Americans provide for their families and prepare for their \nfuture? How do we widen the circle of opportunity to include those who \nhave been left out up until now?\n  There are many, frankly, who believe we will not answer those \nquestions this year. They look at how little we accomplished last year \nand the fact that this is a Presidential year and conclude that little \nor nothing will happen between now and November. It does not have to be \nthat way.\n  A month ago, a lot of people thought the Y2K bug might cause all \nkinds of chaos. Instead, almost nothing happened. When it comes to us, \nwhen it comes to this Congress, people expect nothing to happen this \nyear. Why not surprise them? We have extraordinary opportunities to do \nsignificant work this year, and we should work together to seize those \nopportunities.\n  Let's not worry about who gets the credit. Let's worry about getting \nthe job done.\n  If the best minds in this country could work together to kill the Y2K \nbug, surely the best minds in the Senate can work  together this year \nto protect Social Security, to modernize Medicare, and to pass a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We can work together to improve our \nchildren's schools. Working together, surely we can find new ways to \nhelp ordinary working families earn more and keep more of what they \nearn.\n\n  There are all kinds of reasons for inaction, but there is not one \ngood excuse. Henry Ford once said, ``You can't build a reputation on \nwhat you are going to do.''\n  You cannot construct much of an argument for governing either just \ntalking about what you are going to do. Eventually, one has to act.\n  I believe there are essentially three challenges facing us this year. \nIf we meet these challenges, I believe, frankly, that it will be good \nfor both of our parties next November. Good policy, as they say, is \ngood politics.\n  More importantly, if we meet these challenges, it will be good for \nAmerica, for our economy, for our families, and certainly for our \nfuture.\n  Our first challenge is to maintain our fiscal discipline. Later this \nweek, we expect new estimates from CBO and OMB about how large the \nsurplus might be in the year 2010. We do not know today what their \npredictions will be, but we do know today that the best first use of \nwhatever surplus we have is to protect Social Security and strengthen \nMedicare.\n  Now--when our economy is strong, when we have a surplus, when we \nstill have time on our side--is the time to prepare for the baby \nboomers' retirement by extending the life of the Social Security trust \nfund. Now is the time to modernize Medicare and add the prescription \ndrug benefit so people do not have to choose between filling \nprescriptions and paying utility bills. That is an essential part of \nmaintaining fiscal discipline.\n  Maintaining fiscal discipline also means paying down our $5 trillion \nnational debt. Mr. President, $2,200 is how much our national debt will \ncost every family in America this year. Think what a family could do \nwith that much money.\n  My colleagues and I support tax cuts that help working families with \nreal, pressing needs such as child care and paying for college and \ncaring for sick and aging relatives. We support eliminating the \nmarriage penalty tax for couples who pay a marriage penalty. We support \ntax cuts that help small businesses grow and make it easier to keep \nfamily businesses in families.\n  We want to work with our friends on the other side of the aisle to \npass responsible, targeted tax cuts this year, but we all know what the \nbest tax cut is. The best tax cut for America's families and America's \nbusinesses is to pay down the Federal debt.\n  This year, because of the progress we have made since 1993 in \neliminating the deficit and reducing the debt, the average American \nfamily will save $2,000 on\n\n[[Page S4]]\n\ntheir mortgage, $200 on their car loan, and $200 more on student loans.\n  The American people made it clear last year they do not want a tax \ncut that is so big it wrecks the economy. They do not want a tax cut \nthat is going to explode in a few years and add to our debt. They do \nnot want a tax cut that disproportionately rewards the people at the \nvery top at the expense of everyone else. What they want is for us to \nmaintain our commitment to fiscal discipline and to Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Our second challenge is to expand our economic recovery, not just \nsustain it, but to broaden and deepen it to include more families and \nmore communities.\n  These are extraordinarily good times for many Americans, but too many \nfamilies in this country are still struggling to afford even the \nbasics. Too many children go to bed hungry. Too many Americans still \nlive on the outskirts of hope. The people who have been left out of \nthis recovery include some of the hardest working, most decent people \nyou would ever want to meet.\n\n  They include working mothers who get up before it is light and take \nthree buses to get to their jobs at nursing homes. They include former \nfactory workers who lost their economic footing when the plant closed, \nwho work now at jobs that pay one-third as much, with no benefits.\n  They include farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the \ncountry who work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, who are out there right \nnow in the bitter cold and snow, not even making back their production \ncosts, earning less than their parents and grandparents earned in the \nGreat Depression.\n  Throughout our history, from our earliest days as a nation, Americans \nhave always strived to do better. We did not stop when we cured polio. \nWe said: Now let's cure cancer.\n  Next week, we will become the first Americans ever to achieve 107 \nconsecutive months of economic expansion. Surely we will not be the \nfirst Americans to say: This is all we can do. We have reached the end \nof our possibilities.\n  Let us together expand this recovery.\n  Our third challenge this year is to finish what we left unfinished \nlast year. We need to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights that lets \nmedical professionals, not HMO bureaucrats, make medical decisions. \nSenator Lott and I discussed that just this morning. I do hope there is \na real possibility for compromise and ultimately for the successful \ncompletion of our work on a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We need to increase the number of Americans with private health \ncoverage. We need to help communities repair schools that are falling \ndown and expand schools that are filled beyond capacity.\n  We also need to help communities hire qualified teachers and keep the \ngood teachers who are already in the classroom. It is the only way we \ncan fill the 2.2 million teacher vacancies we know will exist within \nthe next 10 years.\n  We need to keep the crime rates moving in the right direction by \nmaking it harder for kids and criminals to get guns, keeping our \ncommitment to put another 50,000 new police officers on the beat by the \nyear 2005, and giving law enforcement the resources they need to combat \nhate crimes.\n  We need to keep crime rates moving in the right direction by cracking \ndown on scam artists who target the elderly and by filling the \nvacancies on the Federal bench this year--no more excuses, no more \ndelays.\n  Also this year, we need to make it easier for parents who work full \ntime to raise their families out of poverty by raising the minimum wage \n$1 an hour and expanding the earned-income tax credit.\n  We need to pass meaningful, comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  Finally, we need to continue opening up new markets for American \ngoods and services by passing the Africa trade/Caribbean Basin free \ntrade initiative this year.\n  So those three challenges ought to be ones we all share:\n  No. 1, maintain our fiscal discipline, protect Social Security and \nMedicare, and pay down the debt;\n  No. 2, expand the recovery to families and communities that have not \nyet benefited from it; and\n  No. 3, finish what we left unfinished last year.\n  In the weeks since we were together, I was fortunate to be able to \nspend a wonderful holiday with my family. I got to spend a lot of time \nin South Dakota. I talked with some remarkable people--from business \nand education leaders who are working together in Sioux Falls to try to \nkeep up with the demand for high-tech workers, to family farmers and \nranchers who are working practically around the clock to scratch out a \nliving.\n  I talked to a farm wife who gets up at 4:30 in the morning and drives \nover 90 miles to get to Howard, SD, to work at the PMB plant there, as \nthey wrap every Pokemon card that is distributed in the United States--\nright there in Howard, SD--only to drive another 90 miles back getting \nhome, sometime after 7:30 at night, to do it all over again the next \nday.\n  That work ethic is representative of the work ethic all across South \nDakota and the upper Midwest.\n  I had the privilege of traveling with Senators Akaka, Dodd, and Harry \nReid to one of the most amazing, and troubled, regions of the world: \nIndia and Pakistan. We went to promote trade and understanding, but we \nalso went to encourage both India and Pakistan to defuse the tensions \nbetween their nations and to step back from their increasingly tense \nnuclear arms race. I am hopeful we made some progress on both matters.\n  Being in those two nations reminded me again of how fortunate we \nAmericans are. We talked to Tibetan refugees who fled Tibet over the \n19,000-foot Himalayan Mountains, suffering the worst maladies in \nhealth, recognizing that 40 percent of them might have to deal with \nserious frostbite on their feet and hands by the time they arrived in \nNepal--only to do it because they wanted to be free, only to do it \nbecause they, too, wanted to experience at least some element of \ndemocracy.\n  There is so much we as beneficiaries of democracy take for granted. I \ndo not mean simply our material wealth and consumer comforts; I mean \nour most precious possession of all, our freedom. You recognize that \nevery time you travel abroad, whether it is Pakistan, Nepal, India, or \nany other country.\n  India, the world's largest democracy, is now celebrating the 53rd \nanniversary of its independence this year and the 50th anniversary of \nits Constitution. Perhaps because democracy is still relatively young \nin India, perhaps because of the high price they paid for their \nliberty, the people I spoke with in India seemed very much aware of how \nrare and how fragile democracy is.\n  In Pakistan, we visited a country where a democratically elected \ngovernment had only a few months before been toppled and replaced by a \nmilitary ruler--another reminder of how privileged we are to live in \nthe world's oldest and most secure democracy.\n  I am encouraged by my discussions with General Musharraf and very \nhopeful they can restore economic progress, restore democratic \ninstitutions, and can find a way with which to begin resolving the \nregional conflict that is so prevalent in all the conversations we had \nwith leaders in both countries, India and Pakistan.\n  Democracies are not perpetual motion machines. As the great poet \nlaureate Archibald MacLeish wrote:\n\n       America is never finished. America is always becoming.\n\n  Every American has a responsibility to make our democracy work. But \nwe who have been granted the privilege of serving in this body have a \nunique responsibility. The Congress is no ordinary institution. This is \nwhere Americans come to solve our common problems and shape our \nnational destiny. This is also where younger democracies of the world \nturn for guidance and where people and nations not yet free look for \nhope. That was so evident in our conversations with people in all the \ncountries we visited on this too brief a visit to the subcontinent a \ncouple of weeks ago.\n  Are we going to live up to our responsibility to make this \ninstitution work, as we know it can? Are we going to meet the \nchallenges before us and pass measures that will make a real difference \nin people's lives or are we simply going to pass time until the next \nelection?\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\n  As we begin this new session of Congress, let us resolve together to \nsurprise everyone and do what needs to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the Department of Defense \nconducted its most recent flight test of our National Missile Defense \nsystem. A great deal has been said and written about this test in the \nlast few days--much of it erroneous--and I think it is important that \nwe draw the correct conclusions about what this test does and does not \nmean.\n  The test conducted last week was one of a series of 18 scheduled \nflight tests of the National Missile Defense system, and only the \nsecond to actually attempt to intercept a strategic ballistic missile \nby colliding with it in space. The first test this past October was \nprimarily a test of the vehicle that actually hits the target missile. \nLast week's test was significantly more complicated and involved \nadditional, newly developed elements of the National Missile Defense \nsystem, such as the ground-based radar and the Battle Management \nCommand, Control and Communications system. In fact, a senior Defense \nDepartment official told reporters before the test that the battle \nmanagement system is: ``the most difficult and sophisticated part of \nthis entire program.''\n  The latest test began with the launch of an intercontinental \nballistic missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. After \nits rocket engine burned out, the target missile deployed both a mock \nwarhead and a balloon decoy intended to try to fool the interceptor \nmissile. The missile was tracked by satellites and by the National \nMissile Defense system's ground-based radar at Kwajalein Atoll in the \nSouth Pacific, and the interceptor missile was launched to meet the \ntarget. It sighted the target missile and then closed on it.\n  While the interceptor did not hit the target warhead, it appeared \nthat all of the systems tested functioned properly until the final six \nseconds of these, when the infrared sensors on the interceptor vehicle \ndid not operate correctly--as they had in the October test.\n  While the failure to hit the target is disappointing, it is hardly \njustification for all the negative comments I have heard about last \nweek's test. It's important to remember that a test program involves \nthe testing of weapon systems to see if they perform as they were \ndesigned. The purpose of this test program is to uncover problems and \ncorrect them. If it were possible to take a design straight from the \ndrawing board to the field, we wouldn't need testing programs. We test \nbecause we expect to find problems and try to solve them.\n  What's remarkable about the National Missile Defense testing is not \nthat the intercept vehicle missed on the second test but that it \nsucceeded on the first one. Many newly introduced elements had to work \nright on this most recent test even to achieve a near miss, and the \nreally significant news on this test is that all of the new elements \nwhich added complexity to the challenge seemed to have performed very \nwell; the only thing that apparently didn't work properly was the one \nelement which was already proven to work in the October flight.\n  Some of the critics of missile defense have said this test was a \nmajor setback for the program. It was not. In fact, it demonstrated \nsignificant progress in the development of a workable and reliable \nNational Missile Defense capability.\n  The October flight was primarily a test of the intercept vehicle and \nits ability to identify a target in space, discriminate between the \nwarhead and a decoy, and collide with the warhead. It did exactly what \nit was designed to do, but critics of the program claimed that had the \ndecoy not attracted the intercept vehicle's attention, it never would \nhave detected the warhead. They argued that the system can not work \nwhen there are decoys, and only did work because there was a decoy.\n  As ridiculous as that sounds, it has been echoed by those who have \nlong opposed missile defense in any form. An editorial in the New York \nTimes claimed that the October success was ``lucky'' and occurred \n``almost by accident.'' Now wait a minute and think about this. When \ntwo objects--each about the size of a chair, launched 4300 miles apart \nand traveling at a combined speed of 15,000 miles an hour--collide in \nthe vastness of space 140 miles above the Earth's surface, that's not \nan accident. That's a demonstration of some very capable technology and \nengineering.\n  Clearly, for some, no amount of evidence will be convincing. But \nrepeating something that's wrong doesn't make it right.\n  Predictably, some are urging the National Missile Defense program be \nslowed down or even shelved in the wake of last week's test. For some \ncritics, delay or cancellation is always the right course of action \nwhen it comes to missile defense. Others suggest abandoning this \nprogram for another approach using different basing modes, but that \nwill only delay the National Missile Defense deployment we need now. \nStill others believe the administration's assessment of technological \nreadiness should be delayed in order to remove the decision from \npresidential politics. This, too, would be a mistake.\n  We have a National Missile Defense program because we have a growing \nvulnerability to the threat of ballistic missile attack. That threat \nwill not wait for us to conduct a test program with perfect results, \nsomething that has never happened with any weapon system. Delay in \ndeploying a defense against these missiles only serves the interests of \nour adversaries.\n  This threat is growing. We must all remember that this program is not \njust an academic exercise. The Senate passed the National Missile \nDefense Act last spring; in September the Intelligence Community \nreleased a new National Intelligence Estimate of the ballistic missile \nthreat which, according to its unclassified summary, judges that some \nrogue states may have ICBMs much sooner than previously thought, and \nthat those missiles will be more sophisticated than previously \nestimated. In just the past few weeks, British authorities intercepted \ncomponents bound for Libya for missiles with three times the range of \nTripoli's current arsenal. According to news reports from last week, \nthe Director of Central Intelligence cannot rule out that Iran may \nalready be able to build a nuclear weapon. And this past weekend, North \nKorea said it was reconsidering its declaration to refrain from any \nmore long-range missile tests, though of course a moratorium on flight \ntesting, however long, does not mean that North Korea isn't making \nprogress on its missile development programs.\n  While the threat continues to intensify, we've already had too much \ndelay in deploying a missile defense system. In fact, we are behind \ntoday precisely because those who counsel delay have long had their \nway, not because of any inherent problems with the technology. What's \nrequired now is that we stay the course we set for ourselves when we \npassed the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. That act makes it the \npolicy of the United States to deploy a National Missile Defense system \nas soon as technologically possible. With the successful test in \nOctober and last week's test incorporating additional elements of the \nNational Missile Defense system, the talented men and women of our \narmed forces and industry have demonstrated that this system is \ntechnologically possible. The test program is in its early stages and \nmuch can and will be done to refine the system between now and the \nstart of missile production. But there is no question that this \ntechnology is not just within our reach but is actually in our grasp \nnow.\n  I congratulate the Defense Department for the extraordinary technical \naccomplishments it has achieved so far, and urge it to continue to work \nto improve this important program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I start my principal subject, I \nwill take a couple minutes to commend the Democratic leader for his \nearlier comments.\n  We are all ready to go to work, and tomorrow we start with the Budget\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\nCommittee. We are to hear from Chairman Greenspan from the Federal \nReserve, and we are going to be talking about where we go from here in \nterms of the economy.\n  Based on what I hear in the various Presidential campaigns, it looks \nas though we are going to be discussing paying down the debt to some \ndegree. The question is, to what degree? Where is it that we ought to \nbe focusing the use of the significant balances, the surpluses we are \ngoing to see? I hope, consistent with Senator Daschle's comments, we \nwill not be looking at tax cuts as a principal direction. To paraphrase \nWill Rogers, I never met anyone who didn't want to pay less taxes. But \nthe fact is, our economy is moving at the pace it is for very specific \nreasons--encouraging investment, curbing our spending, and in many \ncases curbing it where it hurts but is necessary to get through this \ntransitory period where we went from a debit balance to a credit \nbalance. Looking at our surpluses and wondering about the debates, I \ncontemplate where we are going to be spending these surpluses. I think \nthe way to continue this prosperity, the way to make sure that America \ngoes into this new century with as much energy as it can have, is to be \nlooking at paying down the debt, paying it down as fully as we can, \ntaking care of the essential programs that we know are needed by our \nconstituents across the country.\n\n  The last thing I think people want to see is random tax cuts that \nbenefit the wealthy to an unusually high degree, while those struggling \nto make a living are concerned about interest costs for mortgages, \ntheir schooling, and various other things that are an important part of \nbasic life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S6-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE TRAGIC FIRE AT SETON HALL \n                               UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 244, \nwhich I introduced earlier today with Senator Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 244) expressing sympathy for the \n     victims of the tragic fire at Seton Hall University in South \n     Orange, New Jersey, on January 19, 2000.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, tragedy struck in New Jersey last \nweek. It was obviously of enough significant interest that it was \nportrayed across the country. Three students who were 18 years old lost \ntheir lives in a dormitory fire, and several others were seriously \ninjured. We are still waiting, with hope and prayer, to hear that they \nare going to be able to recover. This is virtually in my neighborhood \nback home. I know Seton Hall University well. I know the president and \nthe archbishop of the diocese; we are very good friends.\n  Everybody wanted to reach out and do something. The first of the \nthree funerals was held today. It is a sad day. It raises a question \nabout what we should expect in a dormitory. Hindsight won't do us much \ngood in this instance. The building they were in was built a long time \nago. The tragic fire took place last Wednesday. The fire started inside \na six-story residence hall. It took the lives of 3 students and injured \n62 others, including at least 58 students, 2 police officers, and 2 \nfirefighters.\n  Mr. President, we don't have to tell anybody that nothing is as \npainful as a senseless accident--which perhaps we can avoid seeing in \nthe future--that takes the lives of young people. Anyone who is a \nparent or relative of an 18-year-old would be seriously grieved by what \nhappened.\n  I know I speak for all of us in the Senate in extending our \nsympathies to the families of the three students who died in the fire. \nThey are Frank Caltabilota of West Long Branch, NJ; John Giunta of \nVineland, NJ; and Aaron Karol of Green Brook, NJ, whose funeral was the \nfirst one this morning.\n  We also extend our support and prayers to the families of the \nstudents and the others who were injured. We are tremendously grateful \nto the firefighters and the other people who worked so hard to prevent \nthe loss of more lives.\n  It is still too early to know what caused this fire, but we must make \nsure, once the cause is known, that Federal, State, and local \njurisdictions take whatever steps are necessary to prevent this from \nhappening again. Students have a fundamental right to pursue an \neducation in a safe, secure environment. Parents have a right to know \ntheir children are protected from harm while on school property.\n  Seton Hall University is holding a memorial service tomorrow for the \nvictims of the fire. The enormity of this tragedy, however, extends far \nbeyond the confines of Seton Hall University's campus. At the very \nleast, the investigation of this catastrophe should sharpen our focus \non fire prevention at campuses across the country and should mark this \nfire, Lord willing, as the last one of its kind.\n  I have introduced this resolution, which should pass the Senate \ntoday, expressing the sympathy of the entire Senate to the families of \nthe victims and the Seton Hall community.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 244) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 244\n\n       Whereas at approximately 4:30 a.m. on January 19, 2000, a \n     fire broke out in the commons area on the third floor of \n     Boland Hall, a six story residence hall housing 600 students \n     at Seton Hall University, and this fire took the lives of \n     three students--Frank S. Caltabilota of West Long Branch, New \n     Jersey, John N. Giunta of Vineland, New Jersey and Aaron C. \n     Karol of Green Brook, New Jersey, and, in addition, 58 \n     persons were injured, including 54 students, two South Orange \n     firefighters and two South Orange police officers;\n       Whereas numerous Seton Hall students risked their own lives \n     as the fire broke out to save the lives of their fellow \n     dormitory residents;\n       Whereas firefighters, paramedics, police officers and other \n     emergency personnel from the surrounding communities worked \n     bravely into the early morning darkness to reduce casualties \n     and extinguish the fire;\n       Whereas the entire Seton Hall University community has \n     banded together in grief to remember the fallen students, and \n     numerous people outside the university recognize the enormity \n     of this tragedy and the need to do everything possible to \n     keep it from happening again since every student should be \n     able to pursue an education in a safe, secure environment:\n       Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its sympathy to the families and friends of \n     Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C.

SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PAC DECISION\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to inform the Senate \nthat today the U.S. Supreme Court, in\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\nthe case of Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, upheld \ncontribution limits in the campaign finance system of the United \nStates.\n  This was a victory for our democracy. It was a victory for the voters \nbecause, essentially, what the Court said is that elections in the \nUnited States are about votes, not about money. They affirmed the core \nholding of Buckley v. Valeo that reasonable contribution limits in \nFederal campaigns--and today, by extension, in State elections--are \nconstitutionally permissible. I was very pleased with this decision.\n  Several months ago, I organized an amicus curiae brief, which was \nsubmitted to the Supreme Court in this case, and advocated the position \nthe Court adopted today--that contribution limits are, in fact, \npermissible under the Constitution of the United States.\n  Again, this is a victory for those who would like to see elections be \ncontests of ideas rather than clashes of special interests, amplified \nby huge amounts of money. Today is a victory for voters who, by their \ndecreasing numbers, show their disenchantment with the political \nsystem. They feel the system is not about ideas or candidates' \npositions, but really about the candidates' treasure chests. This \nfeeling is a corrosive force that undermines democracy in this country. \nWell, today, the Supreme Court held the line and declared that we can \nimpose reasonable limits on campaign contributions.\n  As Justice Souter said in his opinion, this is a situation in which \nthe perception of corruption is as powerful as the reality of \ncorruption. If voters perceive that the system is not benefiting them, \nbut benefitting a special few who contribute, they will lose faith in \nthe system. That loss of faith will ultimately disrupt our ability to \nconduct a democratic government here in the United States.\n  The decision today also indicates that we have both the opportunity \nand, I argue, the obligation to move forward on broader campaign \nfinance reform. Today, the court said that, in fact, we can limit \ndirect contributions of hard dollars to campaigns. By extension, they \ngive us, I hope, the impetus to go ahead and extend these limits to \nsoft money, because we all recognize that soft money is dominating the \npolitical scene today. As we speak, an avalanche of soft money is \nentering into our political system as part of the Presidential campaign \nand various federal and state campaigns for office. Soft money \ncontributions were 75 percent higher in 1999 than in the same period in \n1997. We can do something about this. The Supreme Court has confirmed \nour ability to legislate, and we should move very quickly and very \nforcefully to adopt, I believe, a total ban on soft money--but at the \nminimum to impose limits on soft money.\n  If we don't do that, again we will undermine the faith and the trust \nof the people of this country in our electoral system. They trust and \nhave faith that we are a nation ruled by votes and not by the size of \npolitical contributions.\n  We have lots of work to do, and we should begin immediately. I sense, \nas many do, that one of the reasons we have been stalling on campaign \nfinance reform in this body is because some people were able to offer \nup an easy excuse, that we should wait to see if contribution limits \nare going to be upheld by the Court as constitutional.\n  The Supreme Court has now decided. They have spoken in a very strong \nvoice today, by a vote of 6 to 3, and declared that reasonable limits \non contributions are constitutionally appropriate. As a result, I \nbelieve we should take their decision Nixon v. Shrink Missouri \nGovernment PAC case and build on it by limiting soft money and other \nforms of indirect contributions.\n  Let me quote from Justice Souter:\n\n       . . . there is little reason to doubt that sometimes large \n     contributions will work actual corruption of our political \n     system, and no reason to question the existence of a \n     corresponding suspicion among voters.\n\n  Today's decision is an anecdote to that suspicion, but the real cure \nwill come when we adopt comprehensive campaign finance reform by \noutlawing soft money and placing other reasonable restrictions on the \nelectoral process.\n  Today the Court discharged their responsibility. Now it is time to \ntake up ours. The Supreme Court declared that we can act. We should \nact. I hope this decision will be a source of energy for us this \nCongress, so that we can work together on a bipartisan basis for \nadoption of reasonable and sensible campaign finance reform.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before Senator Reed leaves the floor, I \nwish to commend my colleague from Rhode Island for all of his \nleadership on this issue. I was proud to join him as one Member of this \nbody on the brief. He has consistently talked about the need to drain \nthe swamp that has become America's system of financing campaigns. I \nshare his view.\n  I note also Senator Hollings is here as well. Senator Hollings I \nthink is absolutely right as well in saying that we probably ought to \nhave a constitutional amendment to ensure we have comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform. But the good news is that the Supreme Court \ntoday opened a window for meaningful reform opportunities and \nmeaningful reform legislation.\n  I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for all of his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S7-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7-S8]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief this afternoon. I note \nSenator Hollings is here and also Senator Grams.\n  I come to the floor because last fall I indicated that I would come \nto the floor of the Senate again and again until this body passed \nbipartisan legislation to make sure the Nation's older people secure \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare. We have had some very \nexciting developments on this issue in recent days. I think all the \nwork that has been put in by so many parties is beginning to pay off.\n  I think the reason there is such intense interest in this issue is \nthat while Medicare provides important health insurance coverage for \nolder people, its coverage still today has many gaps. In particular, it \ndoesn't cover prescription medicine.\n  There is not anyone I know today--Democrat or Republican--who would \nargue that if we are going to redesign Medicare now, we would leave \nprescription drugs out. Quite the contrary. Virtually everyone who has \nstudied this issue believes prescription drug coverage is absolutely \ncritical because today's medicines are key to keeping older people \nwell. The drugs of the future are going to help lower blood pressure \nand cholesterol.\n  I cited on the floor of the Senate the important anticoagulant \nmedicines. If you spend perhaps $1,000 or $1,500 in a year, you can \nprevent stroke. If an older person suffers a stroke as a result of not \nhaving access to those medicines, they could incur expenses of $100,000 \nor more. So the need is intense.\n  This is an issue that must be addressed in a bipartisan way. For many \nmonths now, there has been a bipartisan effort in the Senate. Senator \nSnowe and I have teamed up on legislation which we believe, using \nmarketplace principles, addresses many of the concerns Senators on both \nsides of the aisle have had. It doesn't contain price controls or a \nsort of one-size-fits-all approach.\n  We would allow for a tobacco tax to finance the program. We don't \nrequire one. We say that it would be possible to finance the program \nusing the general fund. But 54 Members of the Senate, a majority of the \nSenate, voted for the Snowe-Wyden funding plan for prescription drug \ncoverage for older people. We now have a majority of the Senate in a \nrecorded vote saying they would be willing to pay the dollars needed \nfor a good prescription drug benefit for older people.\n  Our approach in the Snowe-Wyden legislation focuses on making these \ndrugs accessible and affordable. Right now Medicare, of course, doesn't \ncover prescriptions. But just as importantly, older people, when they \ncan afford their medicine, and go to a drugstore are, in effect, having \nto subsidize the big buyers--the HMOs and the health plans that can \nnegotiate discounts.\n  In effect, the older people are getting shellacked twice when it \ncomes to this issue of prescription drugs. They get no coverage. They \nhave to subsidize the benefits, in effect, of those who have real \nbargaining power--those who are on the health plans.\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n  I would like to wrap up with a couple of minutes on an issue that I \nknow is important to South Carolina and in Minnesota, as well as my \nhome State of Oregon. That is the plight of rural older people. There \nhas been some discussion of this prescription drug issue, of course, on \nthe floor of the Senate, but never before has there been a focus on the \nspecial needs of older people in rural communities.\n\n  In my State--and I know in the States of Senator Hollings and Senator \nGrams as well--if you live in a rural community, you have fewer \nphysicians available to write medications. You have fewer pharmacies so \nthat medication is not accessible. You have to drive longer distances \nin order to get your medicine.\n  We found, according to the Oregon Health Sciences University's Office \nof Rural Health, that a conservative number of seniors in rural Oregon \nwho live in poverty is 16,500. I can tell you, having gone through many \nof those rural communities during the break, that there is a special \nneed for coverage for prescription drugs for older people in rural \ncommunities.\n  I will wrap up by reading a few of the accounts older people from \nrural Oregon have sent me about the problems they are having in \naffording their medicine. An elderly couple, for example, in Baker City \ndepending solely on Social Security takes prescription drugs for \nchronic back ailments. After they purchase their monthly medication, \nthey have only $200 for that month left over to pay for their \nnecessities.\n  They wrote me, and I am going to quote: ``. . .  that is not living, \nthat is existing.''\n  I think all of us know you cannot live on $200 a month. Yet that is \nwhat an older couple in Baker City, OR, are faced with after they \nfinish paying for their prescription medicine.\n  In Clatsop County, after an older couple paid for their supplemental \ncoverage, they had to spent $450 a month on their prescription \nmedicine. They fear their supplemental insurance premium is going to go \nup again this year. That is always the case. They are then going to \nhave to stop taking their medication altogether.\n  In Coos County, a 75-year-old female resident is getting by on a \nfixed income of about $800 a month. Every single month she is spending \nmore than 25 percent of her monthly income on prescription medicine.\n  One older woman in that county lives on Social Security and doesn't \nhave any prescription drug coverage at all. She is now at the point \nwhere she cannot afford spending the necessary $200 a month for her \nmedications.\n  Before I came to Congress, I tried to specialize in the gerontology \nfield. As sure as night follows day, when we have a vulnerable older \nwoman who cannot, in a cold Oregon winter, afford to take her \nmedications, she is going to get much sicker. Very often she will end \nup in the hospital needing extensive medical services that are \navailable under what is called Part A of the Medicare program, the \ninstitutional program.\n  We ask: Can we afford to cover prescription drug medicine? That \nexample I just gave of the older woman in Coos County makes it very \nclear this country cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs for \nolder people under Medicare. If older folks do not get these \nmedications, they are going to get sick and the medical bills will be \nfar higher.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record many other \ncases from rural Oregon.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Rural Case Studies\n\n       A 75-year-old hearing impaired woman from Coquille living \n     on Social Security does not have any prescription drug \n     coverage. She cannot afford spending the necessary $200 a \n     month for her medications.\n       Deschutes County: An 83-year-old woman from Sisters and her \n     79-year-old husband are currently taking 12 prescription \n     drugs to treat diabetes, osteoarthritis and hypertension. \n     Their sole source of income is Social Security, and they \n     incur a cost of $400 a month for these medications, which \n     represents 25% of their income.\n       Lincoln County: An 81-year-old widow from Toledo currently \n     takes eight prescription drugs daily for glaucoma, angina and \n     high blood pressure. Social Security is her only income, and \n     her Medicare supplemental insurance policy does not cover the \n     medication. If she doesn't use her eye drops she will go \n     blind, and if she cuts down the dosage on her other \n     medication, due to expense, she is in danger of having a \n     stroke or a heart attack.\n       Linn County: A 78-year-old woman living in Lebanon suffers \n     from hypertension. She is presently taking six prescription \n     drugs: Atenolol, Ziac, Zestril, Cimetidine, Quinidine and \n     Xanax. She spends an average of $236.92 a month on these \n     drugs. This figure does not count her considerable expense on \n     over-the-counter medication and vitamins.\n       A retired couple from Lebanon live on a combined Social \n     Security income of $990 a month. They suffer from arthritis, \n     high blood pressure and osteoporosis. Because of the \n     increasing financial strain, they can no longer afford their \n     medications.\n       Umatilla County: An elderly couple from Pendleton lives on \n     a combined fixed income of $1,269 a month from Social \n     Security and relies solely on Medicare for their health \n     insurance. The 76-year-old husband has Parkinson's disease \n     and glaucoma, while his 73-year-old wife, who suffers from \n     heart problems, has skipped her medication at times when she \n     couldn't afford it. Without any drug coverage, they \n     collectively spend $800 a month--63% of their income--on \n     their 14 prescriptions.\n       A 74-year-old man who takes six prescription drugs a month \n     cannot survive on his Social Security and Medicare benefits. \n     His niece must help him pay the $500 month for his \n     prescriptions.\n       A retired teacher from Pendleton is taking eight \n     medications for chronic back pain. She spends $200 a month on \n     her prescription drugs.\n       Wasco County: An elderly couple from The Dalles depends on \n     their combined monthly Social Security income of $1,263 and \n     profits from the sale of their family farm to survive. Even \n     though they have supplemental insurance, health care costs \n     are still high. In addition to considerable medical expenses \n     for eyeglasses, hearing aids and other health care needs, \n     they spend over $250 a month on prescription drugs to treat \n     asthma and high blood pressure.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will come to the floor of this Senate \nagain and again and again these next few months to urge bipartisan \naction on this issue. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach. \nCertainly, our colleagues will have other good ideas. There are a \nvariety of ways this issue can be addressed in a bipartisan way. I am \npleased our approach garnered 54 votes when it came to actually paying \nfor it.\n  I intend, with Senator Snowe, to continue to urge older people to \nsend in copies of their prescription drug bills to each Member in the \nSenate in Washington, DC, so we can read their personal accounts into \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S8-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8-S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SEATTLE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the World Trade Conference in Seattle \nwas violence run amok. But it was a good reminder of the trauma that \nbrought about our nation's high standard of living. Labor rights were \nobtained only after the murder of workers at Hay Market Square in \nChicago. Environmental protection was obtained only after poisoned \ndeaths at Love Canal. Safety laws were obtained only after poisoned \nfood, poisoned drugs, and babies burned in their cribs. It took the \ntrauma of class actions to make America aware of tobacco's injury, and \nit took President Teddy Roosevelt to hem in the robber barons with \nantitrust laws. The excesses of the free market--of free trade--can \nonly be controlled by government. The peaceful demonstrators in Seattle \nwere demonstrating against government's failure to control.\n  The threat of ``free trade'' was America's first lesson. The \nfledgling colony had just won its freedom when the mother country \ncounselled ``free trade''. It was Riccardo's famous doctrine of \n``comparative advantage''. Britain would trade with us what it produced \nbest--the United States would trade back what it produced best. \nAlexander Hamilton, in his famous booklet ``Reports on Manufacturers,'' \ntold the Brits to ``bug off.'' ``We are not going to remain your \ncolony, exporting our timber, iron, and agriculture--and importing the \nfinished products from England.'' The second bill (the first was for \nthe U.S. Seal) to pass the national Congress on July 4, 1789 was \n``protectionist''--a tariff bill of 50 percent over sixty-some \narticles. Later, when it was suggested that we import the steel for the \ntranscontinental railroad, Abraham Lincoln said, ``No'', and a high \ntariff was imposed on steel. In the Depression, Roosevelt saved the \nfamily farm with subsidies and protective quotas. And it\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nwas President Eisenhower who placed quotas on oil. World War II was won \nin the main by the United States' industrial and agricultural might--\nmight built with protectionism.\n  After World War II the United States had the world's only industry. \nThe task was to build a free market--to defeat communism with \ncapitalism. The government--not the free market--instituted the \nMarshall Plan; sent money, equipment and expertise abroad for Europe \nand the Pacific Rim to rebuild. Today, our problem is that the Marshall \nPlan worked. The vanquished of World War II have become victors in \nproduction, in market share, in the global competition. Today, Japan \nproduces more than the United States--and has the largest balance of \ntrade; the United States the largest deficit in trade. We have tried \nand tried to open markets by setting the example, pleading ``free \ntrade,'' giving away market share, giving away our technology, giving \naway our production. But nations, like the United States in the early \ndays, are determined to build their industrial strength, and today \ncontrolled capitalism governs trade. Technology is obtained; market \nshare is seized; production is transferred with controlled capitalism. \nTrade is not free, not controlled.\n  The fall of the Wall has presented us with a new threat. Four billion \nworkers have been liberated from communism and oppression. They are \nready to work regardless of pay, safety or the environment. It's a \ngiven in manufacture that labor costs represent 30 percent of volume \nand you can save as much as 20 percent of volume by moving your \nproduction to a low wage country. Technology now can be transferred on \na computer chip to any place in the world--and finance it by satellite. \nA corporation with $500 million in sales can retain its executive \noffice and sales force in-country, but move its production to a low \nwage country and make $100 million before taxes. Or it can continue to \nwork its own employees and go bankrupt. The rush is for production \noffshore--downsize onshore--and keep crying ``free trade.''\n  These corporations and our competitors have been spoiled. At all the \ntrade conferences they have come to expect the Special Trade \nRepresentative to arrive bearing gifts. They know the United States \ndoesn't enforce its trade laws. They know the President and the \nCongress are controlled by corporate money. They have come to expect \nthe United States to come crying ``fair trade'', but giving away the \nstore. President Clinton's invitation to Seattle was like an invite to \na birthday party. But rather than bearing gifts, the demonstrators \ncaused the President to call for labor rights and environmental  \nprotection. The competition was so spoiled they took the United States' \nposition at Seattle as an invasion of their sovereignty.\n\n  The security of the United States is like a three legged stool. The \none leg of the Nation's values is admired the world around. The second \nleg of military power is unquestioned. But the third leg of economic \nstrength has been fractured. For 50 years we have been losing \nproduction, technology and market share. Today, this threatens a loss \nof the middle class, the weakening of our democracy--the loss of our \nsecurity as a nation. When Henry Ford started the assembly line he \nwanted to be sure that his workers could make enough to buy the car \nthey were producing. thus began the strong middle class in America. The \nlabor movement brought health care and other benefits so that the \nworker could buy a home, pay for health care, send their kids to \ncollege and afford a vacation trip. The WTO puts this social contract \nin jeopardy. It's one-size-fits-all capitalism only dumbs down \nAmerica's standard of living.\n  For years the United States has had and continues to have the most \nproductive industrial worker in the world. But we have less and less of \nthem each year. The cold war policy of free trade sacrificed our \nelectronics, textiles, shoes, steel, hand tools, shipbuilding, etc. \nJack Welch of General Electric has just instituted an affirmative \naction plan to export GE's jobs to Mexico. Now, with NAFTA, the rest of \nour manufacturing is headed South. Worse, the internet doesn't provide \nenough jobs to build a nation--and it doesn't export. Microsoft, rated \nthe No. 1 industry in America, has only 22,000 jobs in the United \nStates compared to General Motors with 250,000. As Akio Morita \ncautioned years ago, ``That world power that loses its manufacturing \ncapacity will cease to be a world power.'' The United States becomes \nweaker each day.\n  The time has come to break with the failed trade policies of the past \nand instead pursue a policy that zealously promotes the national \ninterest while at the same time remains true to our core values of \npromoting both economic growth and social justice. This will only be \naccomplished by recognizing that the WTO system is a relic of a bygone \nera. The WTO system was an instrument of the cold war. It served as an \nadjunct in the much larger strategic struggle between East and West. It \nrequired the U.S. to sustain concessions necessary to maintain the \ncohesion of the Western alliance. For all the talk about opening \nmarkets, WTO and its predecessor, the GATT, have proven to be abysmal \nfailures. In 1979, Ambassador Robert Strauss proclaimed that the Tokyo \nround will open new markets for U.S. companies, yet from the Tokyo \nround to the Uruguay round, the U.S. racked up over a trillion dollars \nworth of trade deficits. In 1994, President Clinton proclaimed that the \nUruguay round would crack open markets. Since that time the U.S. \ncontinued with record trade deficits and last year recorded its first \n$300 billion deficit. In each successive round, the U.S. agreed to \nasymmetrical market opening commitments. Each time we concluded a \nround, the trade deficit widened. Perhaps the WTO system's biggest \nfailure is its claim that it is raising living standards. The argument \nmade in Seattle was that market forces alone would raise living \nstandards--an argument we rejected in our own country at the turn of \nthe century.\n  The reality is that unfettered free trade has unleashed a race to the \nbottom as nations in the developing world engage in a vicious \ncompetition to attract foreign investment. For example, in his book \n``One World Ready or Not, Bill Greider vividly describes this race to \nthe bottom, ``The toy industry--much like textiles and garments, shoes, \nelectronics assembly and other low-wage sectors--existed (and thrived) \nby exploiting a crude ladder of desperate competition among the poorest \nnations. Its factories regularly hopped to new locations where wages \nwere even lower, where the governments would be even more tolerant of \nabusive practices.''\n  We must rebuild. Get real! No more of this ``setting the example.'' \nNo more crying, ``free trade,'' ``fair trade,'' ``level the playing \nfield.'' No more of this harassing others to be like us. Our job is to \ncompete; to protect labor, protect our environment, protect our \nproduction--to protect the United States' standard of living. The free \nmarket won't do this. Only government will. Protection is the \nfundamental of government. We have the Army to protect us from without, \nthe FBI to protect us from within. We have Social Security to protect \nus from the ravages of old age, Medicare and Medicaid to protect us \nfrom ill health. We have EPA to protect the environment, FDA to protect \nour food and drugs, the FCC to protect communications, the FAA to \nprotect air travel, the Consumer Protection Agency to provide safe \nproducts, and the Federal Trade Commission to protect us from the \nrestraint of trade. Don't be misled by the cry of ``globalization.'' \nThis is the chant of our corporate fifth column. Silicon Valley is not \nthe answer. This is the crowd that government gave the Internet; that \ngovernment trained at Illinois and Stanford; that government subsidized \nwith sematech; and now the billionaires all want to eliminate the \nestate tax, eliminate capital gains, eliminate state tort laws, \neliminate the immigration laws, eliminate taxes on the Internet, \neliminate the antitrust laws--just eliminate the government. Let's stop \nrunning against government. We are the government. Our task is to make \ngovernment work. Our responsibility, is to keep America strong.\n\n  We must organize to do battle. The first order of business is to \neliminate the Special Trade Representative who looks to desert and \nrepresent some country against us. Next, merge and downsize the 28 \ndepartments and agencies that now deal with trade into a Department of \nTrade and Commerce.\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nThen organize Congress' handling of trade issues. Our competition \npresents a solid front. Any trade measure to protect America's jobs is \nimmediately opposed by Japan's 100 consultants and law firms, by \nAmerica's big banks, the Trilateral Commission, the Business \nRoundtable, the National Manufacturers Association, the United States \nChamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe consultants and campuses financed by corporate America, the \nretailers, the newspaper editorialists financed by the retailers, the \nbusiness lobbyists, and most of the 60,000 lawyers in Washington. Trade \nbills today are passed in Congress by multinational corporations \njoining with the foreigners and, thereupon, the President garners the \nvotes with local pork. The common good is ignored.\n  Once organized, we must repeal the tax laws that subsidize the export \nof American jobs. Then abolish the International Trade Commission that \nhabitually cancels the findings of injury by the International Trade \nAdministration. Remove the Executive veto of trade findings so that an \nindustry fighting for relief can count on it when upheld by the courts. \nIn short, enforce our trade laws now on the books. This will stabilize \ndomestic production. This will restore trust in government.\n  The symbol of the Seattle ministerial was not the black hooded \nhoodlums intent on causing mayhem. Instead, they were Boeing machinists \nwho led the large labor marches that snaked through the streets of \nSeattle. Boeing, an export powerhouse, was supposed to stand out as a \nshining example of the open trading system. But Boeing is experiencing \nthe loss of jobs to government-financed Airbus; to China where the \nprice of admission into the Chinese market is an agreement to shift \nproduction from the United States to factories in mainland China. The \nmachinists did not join the mayhem. They trust the government to act in \ntheir interest--to act in the United States' interest. For this to \nhappen, as Lincoln said, ``The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate \nto the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and \nwe must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think \nanew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall \nsave our country.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight at the very beginning of the second \nsession of the 106th Congress, I rise to talk about legislation that I \nintroduced earlier today--on a vitally important issue: protection of \nthe Social Security and Medicare surplus.\n  My legislation reassures the American people that Congress and the \nAdministration will not spend a penny of their Social Security and \nMedicare money and it creates a mechanism to enforce our commitment to \nprotecting these surpluses.\n  This ``look-back'' enforcement mechanism is simple and \nstraightforward. It basically says if Congress and the Administration \nindeed spend any of the Social Security and Medicare surplus in the \nprevious fiscal year, an automatic reduction in Government \ndiscretionary spending, including congressional Members' pay, will be \ntriggered. The money will be returned to the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds. It would work similarly to the sequester of \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings, but applies to spending of Social Security and \nMedicare surplus funds. I stress the sequester could not cut any \nMedicare or other entitlement programs.\n  Unlike similar legislation I introduced last year, this bill adds the \nMedicare surplus into the protection. The Medicare part A surplus will \nbe about $20 billion this year. This surplus should also be preserved \nfor senior's medical expenses only, not for any general Government \nspending.\n  My legislation would in effect prevent anyone, whether it is the \nCongress or the administration, from raiding the Social Security and \nMedicare surplus.\n  I believe this is a crucial step to truly protect the Social Security \nand Medicare surplus and save it exclusively for Americans' retirement \nand medical needs, not for tax relief, and not for government spending.\n  Let me explain why we need this legislation.\n  First and foremost, the American people do not understand why budget \nrules do not protect the Social Security and Medicare surplus. I have \ntraveled intensively throughout Minnesota during this congressional \nrecess. Everywhere I went, Minnesotans told me that the Federal \nGovernment's practice of so-called ``borrowing'' from the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds must be stopped, and Americans' \nretirement funds must be secured.\n  They are very worried that the retirement funds will not be there for \nthem, and they are concerned that the Government will not be able to \nreturn the over $750 billion already ``borrowed'' and spent by the \nGovernment. They want me to take every measure possible to protect \ntheir retirement security and their future health care needs.\n  Last December, the Congressional Budget Office's end of the session \nsummary estimated that Congress spent $17 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus and exceeded the spending caps by $7 billion in budget \nauthority and $17 billion in outlays.\n  In addition, Congress spent every penny of the $14 billion non-Social \nSecurity surplus which we promised to return to working Americans as \ntax relief.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also reported that increased revenue \nwould present a more favorable picture. On Wednesday, the CBO is \nexpected to issue its new estimates and it appears likely that \nAmericans' tax overpayments will enable us to avoid spending any of the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  However, my concerns are, first, the CBO December estimate gives the \ngeneral public the impression that we failed to keep our promise to \nprotect the Social Security surplus and that we are now covering it up \nwith budgetary smoke and mirrors.\n  Second, as a result, we have to use additional tax overpayments to \nfund the increased government spending, even if the new CBO estimate \nshows we did not spend the Social Security surplus.\n  Already, lawmakers are talking about how to spend the rest of the \nnon-Social Security surplus in an Supplemental emergency early this \nyear.\n  Because of this propensity to spend, I believe the look-back proposal \nis essential to protect us now and in the future from the temptation to \nspend ``just a little'' the Social Security and Medicare surpluses.\n  Further, I have argued repeatedly before the Senate that economic \nforecasting is more of an art than a science. Many uncertainties, \nrisks, and factors are involved. We have a budget of over $1.8 trillion \nbased on a variety of assumptions, estimates, forecasts and \nprojections, with people using both Congressional Budget Office numbers \nand Office of Management and Budget. It is highly likely that there are \nerrors in this budget. If the error occurs in Social Security spending, \nwe must have a mechanism to correct it.\n  Another compelling reason for this legislation is that we are facing \neven more severe budget constraints and spending pressures this year \nbecause according to the CBO, the discretionary budget authority for \nfiscal year 2001 is about $542 billion, which is $18 billion less than \nthe amount appropriated for 2000.\n  What's worse, $23 billion out of the $542 billion cap has already \nbeen appropriated as advance funding in the 2000 appropriations bills. \nPresident Clinton has already talked about breaking the caps which he \nagreed to, by the way, in 1997.\n  Although we may have more on-budget surplus this year, which is \nsupposed to be returned to the taxpayers in the form of tax relief and \ndebt reduction, there is no guarantee Congress and the administration \nwill not touch the Social Security and Medicare surplus.\n  Since we all have agreed that saving Social Security should be our \ntop priority and have committed to not spending the Social Security \nsurplus for Government programs, we must do everything we can to \nprevent the Government from spending the Social Security and Medicare \nsurpluses. We need to find a better way to keep our promise to the \nAmerican people.\n  Senators on my side of the aisle have made a number of attempts to \ncreate a\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nlockbox to lock in every penny of the Social Security surplus \nexclusively for Americans' retirement. Unfortunately, opposition by the \nother side has blocked the establishment of this safe lockbox. Some \nopposed because Medicare was not included. My proposal does protect \nMedicare.\n  The ``look-back'' mechanism in my legislation is our best option. It \nwill force the Government to live up to our pledge that not a penny of \nthe Social Security and Medicare surpluses will be spent to fund either \nlast year's or this year's appropriations.\n  If our spending plans do pass and we would again, unintentionally \nwind up spending Social Security, we must be able to keep our \ncommitment to the American people, by scaling back other spending to \nsave Social Security. Without this mechanism Congress and the President \nmay spend some of the Social Security surplus by using inaccurate \nestimates.\n  The remedy in my bill is a simple one and it should be passed early \nbefore we face a problem, so we cannot play the blame game if a re-\nestimate shows spending of Social Security or Medicare surpluses.\n  In an era of budget surplus, extra prudence and effort is needed to \nkeep ourselves from spending more than we can afford. On principle, we \nmust do everything we can to ensure Washington will not touch any \nSocial Security money.\n  Protecting the Social Security and Medicare surpluses from funding \ngovernment operations is the last defense of fiscal discipline. I \ncannot emphasize how vitally important this line of defense is for both \npolitical parties because if we lose this defense, our credibility and \naccountability with the American people will be gone.\n  I strongly believe we should continue to stress our promise to the \nAmerican people. We must make protection of the Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses our top priority and ensure that not a penny of \nAmericans' retirement needs is used for Government spending.\n  Again, I believe this can be easily achieved by passing my ``look-\nback'' legislation which will allow us to enforce that commitment.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SCHEUERMANN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am reminded each time I look to the sky of \nthe reach Americans have made to the heavens. I am extremely proud that \nevery manned spaceflight since the Apollo program has been powered by \nengines tested at a facility in my home State of Mississippi, the John \nC. Stennis Space Center. There, a dedicated group of professionals \nlabors largely unheralded to ensure the performance and safety of the \nengines that propel our astronauts into space. Although I have known \nmany of these outstanding Mississippians in my years in Congress, I \nonly recently had the opportunity to work closely with one of these \nprofessionals. The leadership at NASA decided to offer a legislative \nfellowship to Congress to one of NASA Stennis' rising stars, Mr. \nPatrick Scheuermann.\n  Patrick arrived on Capitol Hill in January, 1999, at the beginning of \na very busy opening session of the 106th Congress. Although many \nthought other proceedings that opened the 106th would supercede a \nlegislative agenda, the Senate professional and personal staffs ensured \nthat, in the background, the business of Congress stayed in motion. \nPatrick cut his teeth in the difficult staff preparations for the \nlegislative cycle that would take place around the issues that \ndominated the Senate floor. An effort was underway at NASA to \nreinvigorate manned space flight and to reduce the cost of getting to \nspace. Patrick was assigned to research and report on these initiatives \nand to keep my legislative staff briefed on their status through the \nAuthorization and Appropriations process.\n  Patrick approached his assignment with the interest of someone who \nnot only enjoys what he does, but with the infectious enthusiasm that \nbrings others onboard as well. My staff quickly became knowledgeable of \nthe many NASA programs that together form our Nation's efforts to reach \nspace. I found more and more space related meetings on the calendar. As \nthe Session progressed, the Senate led the charge to complete the first \nNASA Authorization Bill in many years. One hundred million dollars was \nadded to the NASA budget to develop third generation reusable launch \nvehicle technology, a program known as Spaceliner 100. Patrick's \nability to explain the facets of NASA's programs to legislative \nstaffers and his vigilance as changes developed ensured the ultimate \nsuccess of these endeavors. His detailed understanding of Stennis Space \nCenter's capabilities and assets also proved to be of great value in \nassessing the facility's potential for commercial activities.\n  Patrick has a long history with the Space Program. After earning his \nBachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of \nNew Orleans, he made his first foray into the world of Rocket Science \nas a contract test engineer, testing Space Shuttle Main Engines at the \nStennis Space Center. This brought him across the ``Great Divide'' that \nis the Pearl River and firmly onto Mississippi soil where the NASA \nhierarchy recognized and recruited the talented young engineer. \nAlthough our neighbors across the Pearl claim Patrick as a native son, \nMississippians have adopted him for his hard work and strength of \ncharacter. He also made the grade through his success in attracting one \nof Greater Picayune's finest, Miss Sarah Melissa Lee to be his bride. \nTogether they have added to Mississippi's fame through their beautiful \nchildren, Chandler and Christina. Although I am sorry to lose the \ntalent and expertise that Patrick brought to my staff, I am pleased \nthat his return to the Stennis Space Center foretells many more years \nof innovation and success at this vital national treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S12-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER JOHN DI MENTO, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Lieutenant Commander John Di \nMento, upon his departure from my staff. Lieutenant Commander Di Mento \nwas selected as a Navy Fellow to work in my office because of his \nprofessional reputation and his knowledge of the Navy Oceanography \nprogram and the military presence in my home state. Not a Mississippian \nby birth, he earned the respect of Mississippians during his long \nservice in the state from 1990 through 1996, and through his impressive \ndisplay of good judgement when he married the former Chenaey Bourgeois \nof Bay Saint Louis. Together they have added to Mississippi's fame \nthrough their beautiful daughter, Colby.\n  Lieutenant Commander Di Mento entered the United States Naval Academy \nin 1983 and was commissioned as an Ensign upon graduation in 1987. He \nearned a Master's Degree in Oceanography and began his career as a \nNaval Oceanographer as the Executive Officer of Oceanographic Unit \nThree, surveying over 100,000 miles of the ocean floor in a year \ndeployed. He returned from sea and reported to the Naval Oceanographic \nOffice in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi. He worked extensively in ocean \nmodeling and remote sensing, and flew aerial oceanographic surveys with \nOceanographic Development Squadron Eight, in the process earning his \nNaval Aviation Observer wings. Later assigned as Oceanographer on USS \nKearsarge, Lieutenant Commander Di Mento qualified as a Surface Warfare \nOfficer. He was commended for his performance during Operation Noble \nObelisk, where he was responsible for the processing, care, and \nmovement of over 2,500 refugees rescued by Kearsarge from the civil war \nin Sierra Leone from embarkation through debarkation.\n  Ashore, Lieutenant Commander Di Mento served briefly on the staff of \nthe Oceanographer of the Navy at the U.S. Naval Observatory. He later \nserved two years as Flag Aide and Executive Assistant for Rear Admiral \nPaul Gaffney, II, Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command \nfollowing a year as Flag Aide to his predecessor, Rear Admiral John \nChubb. His only other tour ashore found him navigating the sometimes \ntreacherous waters here on Capitol Hill.\n  Lieutenant Commander Di Mento quickly became a valued member of my \nstaff where he led several legislative initiatives that enormously \nbenefitted the Department of Defense, the Navy, and the State of \nMississippi. He provided a great deal of research and analysis while \nthe Senate initiated broad reform of military pay and benefits. His \nwork led to the most significant piece of legislation for service \nmembers since 1981. The leadership, integrity, and limitless energy \nthat defined his naval career served him well in his term as a \nLegislative Fellow.\n  Lieutenant Commander Di Mento's many awards and decorations include \nthe Meritorious Service Medal, Navy Commendation Medal, Navy \nAchievement Medal, and various unit and service awards. Lieutenant \nCommander Di Mento will be missed on the staff, but his return to the \nNaval Service is a benefit to our great Nation. He has great things \nahead of him. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I \nwish Lieutenant Commander Di Mento, ``Fair Winds and Following Seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S12-3", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12-S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH ADDRESS AT THE LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last spring I joined my colleagues in \nhonoring President Lyndon Baines Johnson when we hung a portrait of our \nformer president on the one blank wall left in the President's Room in \nour nation's capitol. As I noted at that time, I could think of no \nother president or American who was as deserving of this honor as LBJ.\n  As the Senate Majority Leader and President, LBJ was a man of immense \nskill, dedication and compassion. He is remembered by most Americans as \na great leader whose strength of personality helped him preside over an \nextremely productive Senate that expanded Social Security, created the \nInterstate Highway system, and passed one of the most important civil \nrights laws of the 20th Century. Less well known, however, is LBJ's \ntremendous ability to compromise. He truly believed in the message of \nhis favorite Bible verse: ``Come, let us reason together.'' Our nation \nand our government needs more men and women who share this powerful \nbelief.\n  Today, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues and all \nAmericans another aspect of LBJ's legacy that too often has been \noverlooked--his work to bring justice to disen-\n\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nfranchised ethnic minorities and to improve the lot of the large number \nof Americans suffering in unimaginable poverty. John Kenneth Galbraith, \nthe noted economist and former presidential aide, recently highlighted \nLBJ's accomplishments in this area in an important speech at the LBJ \nlibrary in Austin, Texas.\n  As Professor Galbraith noted, historians often view LBJ's \nadministration in terms of its involvement in the Vietnam War. While we \nshould never underestimate the impact that war had on our country, \nhistorians are remiss to view LBJ through this narrow prism. Those who \ndo fail to acknowledge his meaningful and lasting accomplishments in \nexpanding civil rights, protecting voting rights, and fighting poverty. \nThese victories have forever changed the face of America for the \nbetter.\n  Professor Galbraith's speech is based on his personal and \nprofessional relationship with LBJ. It is a testament to LBJ's \nleadership and a tribute to the sometimes overlooked legacy of the \nGreat Society. This speech is an important step towards setting the \nhistorical record straight and establishing a legacy of LBJ's \nAdministration that is historically accurate as well as comprehensive.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Professor Galbraith's speech be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Lyndon Johnson: History Reconsidered\n\n                      (By John Kenneth Galbraith)\n\n       The task of the historian is never finished. As first \n     written, history responds to the dramatic, tragic or \n     otherwise seemingly dominant events of the time. Only in \n     later, more careful, more detached and, one trusts, \n     professionally more competent view does the deeper truth \n     emerge. Were it otherwise, historians would not be needed; \n     history would not have to be reconsidered and rewritten. It \n     is with such reconsideration I am here concerned--with an \n     historical view in need of substantial modification. I am \n     seeking the needed historical reappraisal of Lyndon Baines \n     Johnson, a revision and correction of a history with which I \n     was myself associated, had a modest role, and one to which I \n     have contributed. I here offer a more thoughtful, I trust \n     more informed, view of Lyndon Johnson, and notably as \n     President of the United States. First, a word of personal \n     history.\n       Lyndon Johnson was my age, or I his--he was born August 27, \n     1908, I a month and a half later. We were both of an amply \n     celebrated rural origin, and both had our early education in \n     country schools, rural-oriented colleges. Johnson arrived in \n     Washington as a congressional aide in 1931, I for a markedly \n     less impressive sojourn in 1934. We were both interested in \n     agriculture; I had a minor role with the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Administration--the Triple A--which continued as I \n     went on that year to Harvard. Johnson a year later became the \n     Texas director of the National Youth Administration. Two \n     years after that he was elected to the House of \n     Representatives.\n       At some time during these years we became acquainted; we \n     were brought more closely together by the two great human \n     rights advocates from Alabama, Virginia and Clifford Durr, to \n     whom we were both devoted, Johnson and I were proudly New \n     Dealers, fully committed to FDR who had our unstinting \n     support. Our friendship, if not close, lasted for nearly a \n     lifetime, to be ended by an unforgiving event central in the \n     appraisal of Lyndon Johnson and the correction of which I \n     here seek. That correction places him next only to Franklin \n     D. Roosevelt as a force for a civilized and civilizing social \n     policy essential for human well-being and for the peaceful \n     co-existence between the economically favored (or financially \n     fortunate) and the poor. History has settled on the great \n     contribution of the New Deal. Much needs yet to be said of \n     the achievements of the Johnson years, still sadly blotted \n     from memory by foreign and military policy and action. Next \n     only to Roosevelt, and in some respects more so, Lyndon \n     Johnson was the most effective advocate of human social \n     change in the United States in this century.\n       This was not a matter on which he left one in any doubt. On \n     the day after John F. Kennedy's assassination, I was in \n     Washington at the White House working on the sudden and \n     compelling array of funeral tasks. I was called by L.B.J. to \n     his vice-presidential, now his presidential, offices in the \n     Old State Department building. (I offer this revision of the \n     history on the 36th anniversary of L.B.J.'s first full day in \n     office.) We discussed a range of domestic problems and the \n     needed action. He spoke in Johnson language and emphasis of \n     his strong commitment. Knowing perhaps that nothing would \n     more assure my belief, he asked me to do a draft of the \n     speech he would shortly make to the Congress. The eventual \n     speech, which relied rather more heavily on Theodore Sorensen \n     and on L.B.J. himself, made clear his intention.\n       For Roosevelt it was the New Deal. Kennedy had given \n     currency to the phrase the New Frontier. For Johnson it would \n     be the Great Society--possibly a less compelling title. \n     Nonetheless, the action so taken has become part of our \n     everyday life and acceptance. But not in the history. The New \n     Deal is large in public memory; so, if somewhat less, is the \n     New Frontier. Much less is made of the Good Society and the \n     years of Lyndon Johnson. What was then greatly needed, even \n     urgent and wonderfully accomplished, lies in the historical \n     backwater. That we must recognize and retrieve.\n       The first and most important step taken by Lyndon Johnson \n     was simply to make all Americans full citizens and full \n     participants in the democratic process. This, in the Kennedy \n     years, had become an issue of major importance. In June of \n     1963, a few months before his death, Kennedy had called for \n     enabling legislation. His position, and especially that of \n     his immediate and strongly committed subordinates, was not in \n     doubt. But the decisive civil rights legislative action \n     remained for Lyndon Johnson. A further and major step was the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965, this at the beginning of Johnson's \n     own new term and more than one hundred years after \n     emancipation.\n       In the New Deal years ethnic equality was only on the \n     public conscience; in the Kennedy presidency it was strongly \n     urged by Martin Luther King and many others. From buses to \n     lunch counters to  restrooms to public accommodations, \n     agitation had focused attention on the issue and brought \n     some action. It was with Lyndon Johnson, however, that \n     citizenship for all Americans in all its aspects became a \n     reality. Not only were black citizens (as I choose to say) \n     rewarded; distracting agitation and conflict came largely \n     to an end. Not alone civil rights but civility in behavior \n     to the peace and benefit of all. All were rewarded by the \n     new peace. This we owe to the Johnson presidency. There \n     was much more.\n       Related to ethnic difference but going far beyond was the \n     continued existence of a mass poverty--of life at or below \n     the margin of survival. This also, a neglected point, means \n     denial not alone of the basic enjoyments of life but also the \n     denial of liberty. Nothing so limits the freedom of the \n     individual as the total absence of money. This, as too often \n     with the commonplace, we take for granted, ignore. This too \n     Lyndon Johnson recognized and addressed.\n       The problem of massive urban poverty and the more diverse \n     affliction in rural America, especially in the mountain \n     valleys down from New England to the Deep South, was a \n     continuing fact. There were (as there are still) two lines of \n     thought on how this should be addressed. One was to insure \n     everyone a basic income by public action. This a rich country \n     could afford; to this all the industrially advanced countries \n     are in some measure committed. The other course is to counter \n     poverty by specific remedial action designed to minimize its \n     more specific adverse effects and, most importantly, to \n     provide the mental and physical means for escape. The main \n     effort of the Johnson years was of the second order; the \n     basic steps in this effort continue to this day--money for \n     deprived educational communities, for education in general. \n     Head Start, food for needful children at the beginning of the \n     school day, food stamps for the old and hungry, the Jobs \n     Corps and major initiatives in education . . . including the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act sending funds to local \n     school districts along with support to higher education and \n     those pursuing it. And major help for those previously denied \n     health care and life itself from lack of money. This list of \n     humane accomplishments could be extended. The emphasis was \n     not alone on what the Federal government should do but also \n     on helping individuals and communities to help themselves.\n       The New Deal initiatives were more centralized, more \n     visible and more dramatic; those of the Johnson years were \n     less visible but not less important for aiding human \n     survival. What Johnson initiated is now accepted even by the \n     wonderfully adverse orators of our present age.\n       The work for civilized well-being is not complete. I have \n     long believed that we should accept, as we do only \n     reluctantly and partially now, a minimum income for all \n     Americans. This, to repeat, a rich country can afford. It \n     requires that we eliminate the welfare stigma and other \n     adverse attitudes. Some who are favored by a basic income \n     will not work; so with many who are now favored by a higher \n     income. Leisure is an evil thing for the poor; it is \n     rewarding for the affluent, sometimes even for professors. \n     Accordingly, our social effort must continue. But let there \n     be no doubt; in the years of Lyndon Johnson both ethnic \n     minorities and the poor became citizens of the republic, the \n     first by legal action, the second by still imperfect but \n     highly relevant remedial legislation.\n       Nor did this happen because of newly recognized need. It \n     happened because Lyndon Johnson was the most effective \n     political activist of our time. It is easy to advocate the \n     right action; it is something else and much more to obtain \n     it. Lyndon Johnson was not content with citing the need, \n     recommending the legislation. He was content only as he \n     obtained (and on occasion forced) the requisite action. No \n     President in our time has had such a commanding role as \n     regards the Congress, the result of both solid experience and \n     strong personality. Johnson's authority was based on \n     knowledge--he had a clear and comprehensive view of what he \n     urged. But\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n     there was more. Individuals at all levels in Congress and in \n     the Executive knew him. He was a good friend, had an engaging \n     personality and a compelling range of speech. No one went to \n     see him without returning to tell of some prescient \n     observation by Lyndon Johnson, some amusing or slightly off-\n     color metaphor.\n       Liking Johnson, politicians and other leaders aligned with \n     him. All wanted the association preserved, so they did as \n     Johnson commanded. We speak much of the power of personality; \n     in Lyndon Johnson it was evident, effective and had its own \n     distinctive style. Long before he became President, this was \n     well recognized in the Congress. Asked after the 1960 \n     Convention why he had chosen Lyndon Johnson as Vice-\n     President, John F. Kennedy gave several reasons. The last and \n     perhaps the decisive reason: ``It wouldn't be worthwhile \n     being President if Lyndon were Majority Leader.'' When \n     President, Lyndon Johnson was effectively both. Kennedy, as \n     I've said on other occasions, used less power than he had as \n     President; Johnson used more.\n       I summarize: on civil rights and on poverty, the two truly \n     urgent issues of the time, we had with Johnson one of the \n     greatest changes of our time. I turn now to the historical \n     correction which, along with others of my political faith, I \n     need to make.\n       My association, even friendship, with Lyndon Johnson came \n     to an end with the Vietnam war. We had intensely discussed \n     it: Johnson's case was not unpersuasive. ``Ken, you have no \n     idea what the generals would be doing were I not here.'' And \n     this, I must add, I did not know. Next year the Harvard \n     University Press will publish ``American Tragedy: Kennedy, \n     Johnson and the Origins of the Vietnam War'' by David Kaiser. \n     It makes full, intelligent, even exhaustive use of newly \n     declassified documents--all are now available except for some \n     continuing and perhaps well-considered reticence by the CIA. \n     Kaiser tells in extensive and, to this day, alarming detail \n     of the military pressure on Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. \n     The generals and their civilian acolytes took over, were even \n     eager for a war. Nuclear weapons were freely proposed. One \n     reads with relief and gratitude of the Presidential \n     resistance, that of Kennedy in particular but also that of \n     L.B.J. The widening military intervention was relentlessly \n     pressed. And so the war and the deaths.\n       Knowing that part of the world from presence and \n     experience, I knew that Communism was irrelevant in a \n     primitive village and jungle economy--as Marx would have been \n     the first to agree. There was also the irrelevance of our \n     military establishment in the densely covered countryside \n     that characterized much of Vietnam. The military forces of \n     the Viet Cong would have been swept aside in a few days in \n     Normandy. Here they could retreat conveniently and safely to \n     the jungle, or even to the water-laden reaches of the Delta. \n     Accordingly, I joined with others in opposition to this cruel \n     and hopeless effort and to sending our youth, still under \n     draft, to serve and die. In the political campaign of 1968, I \n     was accorded a measure of leadership. I do not regret my \n     effort against this error. One must, however, regret the way \n     in which we allowed the Vietnam war to become the totally \n     defining event of those years and likewise of the history. In \n     the Johnson years it was the Vietnam war and nothing else. \n     And so in the history it remains. Those of us who were \n     involved allowed that response; at the time, perhaps it was \n     inevitable. But certainly we have done far too little to \n     correct the history since.\n       The needed correction is clear. In the Johnson years two \n     major flaws in the American community and its polity were \n     addressed. What was called the American democracy became in \n     reality a democracy. All Americans became citizens. There was \n     a long step toward peaceful coexistence between ethnic \n     groups. And for the first time we had a clear recognition of \n     the presence of deep, unforgiving poverty in this generally \n     affluent land. The danger to domestic peace and harmony was \n     recognized. Poverty, economic deprivation, is still with us. \n     Income inequality is great and still growing. But recognition \n     of this together with the belief that something can and must \n     be done--that there can be remedial action--goes back to the \n     Johnson years. And so does the range of action for the young, \n     the poor, the ill and the old without which all would be much \n     worse.\n       Three Presidents in our lifetime have seen the social need \n     of their citizenry from their particular position in life. \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt, as I've elsewhere said, saw the people \n     of the United States as a tenantry stretching out from Hyde \n     Park. For them and their depression hardship he had a \n     landlord's responsibility. From Irish Boston, John F. Kennedy \n     saw a great minority still seeking to escape--and his family \n     had escaped--the trials and oppressions of a once beleaguered \n     community. (It helped that it had become a political force.) \n     Johnson's identification was with a larger, less easily \n     identified, politically less powerful community--the widely \n     distributed urban and rural poor. What Kennedy and his family \n     had escaped, Johnson had experienced at first hand. (His \n     personal encounter with rural privation was never \n     understated.) The basic motivation of all three Presidents \n     was the same: the sense of responsibility for a larger, less \n     fortunate community within the range of actual observation \n     and experience.\n       There is a final, greatly needed revision. We must accord \n     much more emphasis to the dangerous, even insane military \n     pressures to which Kennedy and Johnson were subject. We \n     should note that these were especially strong in 1965, the \n     time when Johnson's mind and effort were sharply focused on \n     poverty and civil rights and the requisite legislation.\n       When we think of Vietnam, we must think much more of the \n     generals (and associated civilians) who pressed powerfully \n     for the war, for the risks of a greater war and for an \n     opening for nuclear weapons. That, in the full light of \n     history, there were presidential errors here cannot be \n     doubted. We must, however, be grateful for what was resisted.\n       Thus the historical revision I seek, we must all seek. The \n     initiatives of Lyndon Johnson on civil rights, voting rights \n     and on economic and social deprivation and the responding \n     role of the state must no longer be enshrouded by that war. \n     Those of us who helped make the war central to the public \n     attitude and politics of the time have a special \n     responsibility here. That responsibility I would like to \n     think I have partly assumed on this favored evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOLD ON H.R. 2260\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

A bill for the relief of Guy Taylor; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, \nlegislation that would provide lawful permanent residence status to Guy \nTaylor, a Canadian national who was orphaned at age 16. Guy is now 18.\n  Guy Taylor was born in Canada but spent the first half of his life in \nthe United States attending school and living with his mother. Guy's \nfather died before he was born. In the summer of 1998, his mother died \nof a drug overdose. This left him without any other family except for \nhis extensive family in Southern California.\n  Upon his mother's death, Guy's grandmother, Oleta Hansen, flew to \nCanada to secure her daughter's body and bring her grandchild back to \nthe United States.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) allowed Guy to \ntemporarily enter the United States by granting him a one-year \nhumanitarian parole. Once the parole expired, the INS extended for one \nmore year. This is a very rare act on the INS' part.\n  Initially, Guy had sought to obtain permanent resident status by \nbeing declared a dependent of a United States court. However, the \nOrange County, California Social Services referee declined to name Guy \na court dependent because he was considered to be under the \nguardianship of his grandmother.\n  Because the INS has declared Guy too old to be a dependent of his \ngrandmother, Guy is unable to obtain permanent residence in the United \nStates. Immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor \nchildren under the age of twenty-one without their parents.\n  Guy's dream is to join the United States Army. Although Guy's Army \nrecruiter said he has successfully tested and is qualified for \nenlistment, without permanent resident status, Guy will be unable to \njoin.\n  Today Guy, a first-year college student and a young man willing to \nfight for his adopted country, faces deportation.\n  News about this young man's imminent deportation has shaken the \ncommunity in southern California. More than 1,000 of Guy's friends and \nneighbors have signed a petition calling for legislation on his behalf.\n  I hope you support this bill so that we can help Guy rebuild his life \nand continue to contribute to his community in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the bill and a \nrecent news article depicting the compelling circumstances of Guy \nTaylor's life be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR GUY TAYLOR.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Guy \n     Taylor shall be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or \n     for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such \n     Act or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Guy Taylor enters the United \n     States before the filing deadline specified in subsection \n     (c), he shall be considered to have entered and remained \n     lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be eligible for \n     adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Guy Taylor, \n     the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal \n     year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of the alien's birth \n     under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that \n     are made available to natives of the country of the alien's \n     birth under section 202(e) of such Act.\n\n            One Last Hope for Teenager Who Deserves a Break\n\n                            (By Mike Downey)\n\n       The calls and letters came in regularly for a while.\n       ``So what became of Guy Taylor?'' ``Whatever happened to \n     that poor kid from Orange County they were trying to kick out \n     of the country?'' It was a story that amazed people, confused \n     people. How could an orphan be ordered to leave his \n     grandparents in the United States and be required to live \n     where he has no family at all?\n       Eventually, though, everyone forgot Guy and got on with \n     their own lives. The news crews were gone, because nothing \n     was new. No politician came through for Guy in the nick of \n     time, here in a land where campaign speeches preach family \n     values. No loophole in the law was located. No judge found it \n     in his heart to cite extenuating circumstances for a boy who \n     had done nothing wrong.\n       Guy Taylor could have a country without a home, but no home \n     without a country.\n       He was born in Canada. He was 16 when his mother died. (The \n     father's identify is unknown.) He celebrated his 17th \n     birthday and high school graduation in Garden Grove, where he \n     came to live with his grandparents. The law said they could \n     be Guy's guardians but not legally adopt him. A judge refused \n     in July to make him a ward of the court, because he was too \n     old.\n       Unable to establish permanent residence and gain a green \n     card, Guy, who turned 18 a few weeks ago, faces expulsion \n     from the United States.\n       ``What will you do?'' he is asked.\n       ``I try not to think about it,'' he says.\n       Actually, it is unfair to say that Guy Taylor has been \n     forgotten by all. Not long ago, for example, a United Parcel \n     Service deliveryman was making his rounds in downtown Los \n     Angeles when he spotted Carl Shusterman.\n       ``Hey, aren't you the lawyer who represented that nice kid \n     they were trying to deport to Canada?'' the UPS guy inquired.\n       ``Yes, that's me,'' Shusterman said.\n       ``Whatever happened to him?''\n       Susterman still hears this question here and there. This \n     case isn't typical of the immigration cases he usually \n     handles. It touched a nerve.\n       Guy's mother died in Canada from a drug overdose. His \n     grandmother was 17 when she gave birth there. Here's where it \n     gets complicated: To adopt a grandson, the law stipulates she \n     needed to be a U.S. citizen before giving birth (which she \n     was), needed to live in the U.S. for 10 years before giving \n     birth (which she did), but five of those 10 years had to \n     follow her 14th birthday (which they didn't).\n       The family has tried everything it can think of, including \n     petitions and appeals to politicians, to keep Guy here.\n       ``Show him your Native American card,'' Shusterman tells \n     him in his law office.\n       Guy slides a laminated badge across a conference table. \n     Issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of \n     Indian affairs, it identifies Guy Douglas Taylor as \n     officially being of ``\\1/32\\nd Choctaw'' heritage.\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\n       Since exemptions are given to Native Americans in \n     immigration matters, Guy's grandmother, Oleta Hansen, who has \n     some Choctaw blood in her, figured it was worth a try. That's \n     how desperate she and her husband, Charles, are to keep their \n     grandson from being sent away. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite \n     enough Choctaw blood.\n       The best--perhaps last--chance for Guy could be Sen. Dianne \n     Feinstein, who could introduce a private bill to Congress on \n     the boy's behalf. Her office has been receptive, Shusterman \n     says. And such a bill is not without precedent. Earlier this \n     year, Rep. Bill McCollum (R.-Fla.) proposed one on behalf of \n     Robert Anthony Broley, a 32-year-old felon deported to Canada \n     after serving four years in a Florida prison on 13 counts, \n     including forgery and theft.\n       Shusterman does not believe it a coincidence that Broley's \n     father is the Republican Party treasurer in McCollum's home \n     district.\n       ``How about a young guy right here,'' Shusterman says of \n     the boy by his side, ``who's been in no trouble at all?''\n       So here sits Guy, in need of a holiday miracle.\n       A temporary visa was extended one last time, to next \n     summer. He takes classes at Cypress College and wants to join \n     the U.S. Army, but can't without a green card.\n       ``He's a good boy who does his schoolwork and his chores,'' \n     his grandmother says. ``We're all he has left I was born \n     here. My husband was born here. We want our grandson here \n     with us.''\n       They were with him at lunch Tuesday, when that same UPS \n     driver happened by.\n       ``Remember that nice kid you asked me about?'' Shusterman \n     said. ``This is him.''\n  By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2002. A bill for the relief of Tony Lara; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Tony Lara, \na remarkable young man from El Salvador who has lived in the United \nStates since he was 10 years old.\n  Tony's story is particularly compelling. In less than twenty years of \nthis young man's life, Tony has faced one tragic setback after another. \nHowever, through his optimism, intelligence, and hard work, he has \nbravely confronted challenges that most would view as insurmountable. \nIn spite of enormous odds, Tony has become a high school graduate, a \nCalifornia State Wrestling Champion and an inspiration to his \ncommunity.\n  An unfortunate chapter in Tony's story is that he faces deportation \nand separation from his younger sister because at age nineteen, Tony is \nan orphan. Immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor \nchildren under the age of twenty-one without their parents.\n  Ten years ago, Tony Lara and his younger sister Olga were brought to \nthe United States by their parents who were fleeing the civil war in El \nSalvador. That same year, Tony's mother was deported back to El \nSalvador. She tragically died in a drowning accident while trying to \nreenter the United States. Tony's father turned to drugs, abandoned his \nchildren and was eventually deported in 1994. He has not heard from him \nsince. At age 11, Tony became a surrogate father to his younger sister.\n  Tony and his sister were taken in by an uncle who had neglected to \ncare for them. Eventually, Tony's neighbors, Philip and Linda Bracken, \ninvited the children to live with them. The Brackens later adopted \nOlga, who now has permanent residency in this country. The couple \nlacked the resources, however, to adopt Tony and at age 16, Tony was \nleft without a home.\n  Unfortunately, the adults to which Tony turned for advice counseled \nagainst turning himself in to the Department of Children Services. They \nfeared he could be deported and would never see his sister again. Tony \ncould not bear losing the only family he had left; thus he remained on \nhis own.\n  In 1996, Tony met his high school's wrestling coach, Terrence Fisher. \nMr. Fisher knew little about Tony's circumstances, but he noticed his \nslight build and extreme sadness. When the coach had discovered Tony \nwas homeless and hungry, he invited him to live with his family. Mr. \nFisher also invited Tony to try out for the school's wrestling team. \nAlthough he had never wrestled before, Tony was truly a natural.\n  By his senior year, Tony had worked hard and captured the California \nstate wresting championship for his age group and weight class. He had \nalso excelled socially and academically. After Tony graduated from high \nschool, he continued to win wrestling championships and has become a \nrole model in his community. He is continuing his education by studying \nbusiness at West Valley Occupational Center.\n  Tony has been featured on two television programs. In 1998, he was \nfeatured on an NBC news program called ``Beating the Odds,'' which was \nabout young people of great achievement who have overcome enormous \nobstacles. Last year, Tony was featured on a Univision hour-long \nspecial program, which also spoke to Tony's special circumstances.\n  I can think of no one more deserving of permanent residency in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached bill be \nentered into the record with this statement.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the bill and a \nletter from Terrence Fisher, high school coach, which illustrates the \ncompelling nature of young man's circumstance, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2002\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR TONY LARA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Tony Lara \n     shall be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence upon filing an application for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act \n     or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Tony Lara enters the United \n     States before the filing deadline specified in subsection \n     (c), he shall be considered to have entered and remained \n     lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be eligible for \n     adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Guy Taylor, \n     the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal \n     year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of the alien's birth \n     under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that \n     are made available to natives of the country of the alien's \n     birth under section 202(e) of such Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Terrence Fisher,\n\n                               Northridge, CA, September 12, 1999.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am a United States citizen and \n     reside with my wife and children in Northridge, California. \n     For the past nine years, I have taught music and coached \n     wrestling, football, and track at El Camino High School in \n     Woodland Hills, California. I write to ask your help in \n     sponsoring a private bill to grant Gerardo (``Tony'') Lara \n     permanent residency.\n       Tony is a nineteen year old national of El Salvador who has \n     resided in this country since 1990, and against all odds, has \n     become a high school graduate and California State Wrestling \n     Champion. In 1990, Tony and his sister Olga were brought to \n     the United States by their parents who were fleeing civil \n     war. Tony and Olga were then ten and four years old, \n     respectively.\n       The same year, Tony's mother was deported back to El \n     Salvador. When she again fled civil war in her country and \n     tried to reenter the United States, she died in a drowning \n     accident. Tony's father turned to drugs, effectively \n     abondoning Tony and Olga in the United States. From 1991 on, \n     Tony became a surrogate father to his baby sister.\n       Between 1990 and 1996, Tony somehow managed to survive and \n     care for his sister. Tony's father was jailed repeatedly for \n     drugs and in 1994 was finally deported. Tony and Olga were \n     given free housing in their uncle's rented apartment, but the \n     uncle was almost never home. Eventually Tony's neighbors, \n     Philip and Linda Bracken, invited Olga to live with them. \n     Olga's relationship with the Brackens became increasingly \n     close, and they eventually adopted Olga. Because of the \n     adoption, Olga now has permanent residency in this country. \n     The Brackets lacked the resources to adopt Tony along with \n     his sister.\n       Tony was left on his own. When he had money, he would eat \n     at fast food restaurants. When he did not have money, he \n     would ask his friends for food. Sadly, all adults whom Tony \n     sought help from about\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\n     his situation told him that if he turned himself in to the \n     Department of Children Services, he could be deported and \n     would never see his sister again. Tony could not bear losing \n     the only family he had left, and thus remained on his own.\n       I met Tony in 1996 when he was a student at El Camino Real \n     High School. Tony was a tiny kid, just the size to qualify as \n     a wrestler in the 105-pound division. Though Tony had no \n     wrestling experience, I invited him to try out for the \n     school's wrestling team. Tony had never wrestled before but \n     was a natural. By his senior year, he captured the California \n     state championship for his age group and weight class. I've \n     never coached anyone who works as hard as has Tony.\n       I initially knew little of Tony's background, but noticed \n     his extreme sadness. When I asked Tony why he was so sad, he \n     confided in me that he was homeless and hungry. I then \n     invited Tony to live with my family. Tony shares a bedroom \n     with my son. Since moving in with our family, Tony has \n     prospered both socially and academically. I am sure that is \n     because for the first time since he was ten, he has had the \n     loving support of a family and adequate food and shelter. \n     Tony graduated high school and continues to win \n     championships. He is continuing his education by studying \n     business at West Valley Occupational Center.\n       Tony has no legal immigration status. His inability to \n     secure permanent residency cannot be attributed to any lack \n     of effort on Tony's part. Tony has a list of forty \n     professionals (lawyers, teachers and guidance counselors) he \n     sought legal advice from. Time and time again, he was told \n     that if the authorities knew of his immigration status or the \n     fact that had no parents in the United States, he would be \n     separated forever from his baby sister. The tragedy is that \n     we now know that had Tony become a ward of the court before \n     age 16, he could have filed a special immigrant visa petition \n     and obtained legal status. And had suspension of deportation \n     not been eliminated in the 1996 immigration law, Tony would \n     easily have qualified for suspension of deportation.\n       I am asking for your assistance in sponsoring a private \n     bill on Tony's behalf. I am told that the enactment of a \n     private bill is extremely rare and a real longshot. But \n     Tony's whole life has been a longshot, and I believe that he \n     will overcome the difficulties of securing permanent \n     residency just as he has overcome all the many other \n     obstacles in his life.\n       In a time where anti-immigrant sentiments still run high in \n     California, it is important to remember that it was not \n     Tony's choice that his parents fled to the United States \n     during a time of civil war, and it was not his choice that \n     his mother drown in a river or that his father turn to drugs. \n     It was Tony's choice to overcome these tragedies, to care for \n     his baby sister, and to succeed as a high school graduate and \n     a state wrestling champion. To recognize these achievements, \n     Tony was featured in an NBC news program called ``Beating the \n     Odds.''\n       The United States would undoubtedly benefit from the \n     contributions that Tony will make as a permanent resident in \n     this country, and I can think of no young man more deserving \n     of our country's support. It is hard to imagine Tony now \n     returning to El Salvador. He would suffer not only extreme \n     poverty (Tony has a weak command of Spanish and no ability to \n     write in Spanish) but extreme emotional distress from losing \n     the family support he has finally found at my home. Most \n     importantly, Tony would suffer the loss of contact with his \n     U.S. citizen sister, now age 12. Our family would also suffer \n     if separated from Tony, as he has truly become a member of \n     our family and the community in which we work and live.\n       I look forward to meeting with you further to discuss my \n     request for your assistance. I am joined in asking for your \n     support from the people listed on the attached pages. I thank \n     you in advance for you consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Terrence Fischer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Johnson (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, and \n        Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2003. A bill to restore health care coverage to retired members of \nthe uniformed services; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n          keep our promise to america's military retirees act\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Paul \nCoverdell and Senator John McCain today in introducing the Keep Our \nPromise to America's Military Retirees Act. This legislation honors our \nnation's commitment to the men and women who served in the military by \nupholding the promise of health care coverage in return for their \nselfless dedication.\n  Last year, the Senate began to address critical recruitment and \nretention problems currently facing our nation's armed services. The \npay table adjustments and retirement reform enacted in the fiscal year \n2000 Department of Defense Authorization bill were both long overdue \nimprovements for our active duty military personnel. However, these \nimprovements do not solve our country's difficulty in recruiting and \nkeeping the best and the brightest in the military. In order to \nmaintain a strong military for now and in the future, our country must \nshow that it will honor its commitment to military retirees and \nveterans as well.\n  For years, men and women who joined the military were promised \nlifetime health care coverage for themselves and their dependents. \nPrior to June 7, 1956, no statutory health care plan existed for \nmilitary personnel. Even when the Civilian Health and Medical Program \nfor the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) was enacted that year, the health \ncare coverage was dependent upon the space available at military \ntreatment facilities. Post-Cold War downsizing, base closures, and the \nreduction of health care services at military bases have limited the \nhealth care options available to military retirees.\n  In my home state of South Dakota, I have heard from many military \nretirees who are forced to drive hundreds of miles to receive care. As \na final disgrace, military retirees are currently kicked off the \nmilitary's Tricare health care system when they turn 65. This is a slap \nin the face to those men and women who have sacrificed their livelihood \nto keep our country safe from threats at home and abroad.\n  The Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act restores \nadequate health care coverage to all military retirees. For those \nretirees who entered the armed services before June 7, 1956, when \nCHAMPUS was created, my legislation will honor the promise of health \ncare coverage for life. This will be accomplished by allowing military \nretirees to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \n(FEHBP), with the United States paying 100 percent of the costs. \nMilitary retirees who joined the armed services after space-available \ncare was enacted into law in 1956 will be allowed to enroll in FEHBP or \ncontinue to participate in Tricare--even after they turn 65. These \nmilitary retirees who choose to enroll in FEHBP will pay the same \npremiums and fees as all other federal employees in the program.\n  The Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act has been \nendorsed by the National Military and Veterans Alliance and its member \norganizations. Companion legislation in the House of Representatives \nalready has over 220 bipartisan cosponsors thanks to unprecedented \ngrassroots support by military retirees nationwide.\n  A promise made should be a promise kept. We owe it to our country's \nmilitary retirees to provide them with the health care they were \npromised. These men and women stood ready to answer the call to defend \nour rights, anytime and anywhere. It is now our duty to answer their \ncalls for better health care.\n  We also owe it to ourselves to help attract and keep qualified men \nand women in our military by showing potential recruits and active duty \npersonnel that our country honors its commitment to those who serve it. \nWe have a long way to go, but I will continue to work to make sure our \ncountry's active duty personnel, military retirees, and veterans \nreceive the benefits they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objecton, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Our Promise to \n     America's Military Retirees Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of \n     the uniformed services who entered service prior to June 7, \n     1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years or by \n     reason of a service-connected disability.\n       (2) Recruiters for the uniformed services are agents of the \n     United States government and employed recruiting tactics that \n     allowed members who entered the uniformed services prior to \n     June 7, 1956, to believe they would be entitled to fully-paid \n     lifetime health care upon retirement.\n       (3) Statutes enacted in 1956 entitled those who entered \n     service on or after June 7, 1956, and retired after serving a \n     minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected \n     disability, to medical and dental care in any facility of the \n     uniformed services, subject to\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\n     the availability of space and facilities and the capabilities \n     of the medical and dental staff.\n       (4) After 4 rounds of base closures between 1988 and 1995 \n     and further drawdowns of remaining military medical treatment \n     facilities, access to ``space available'' health care in a \n     military medical treatment facility is virtually nonexistent \n     for many military retirees.\n       (5) The military health care benefit of ``space available'' \n     services and Medicare is no longer a fair and equitable \n     benefit as compared to benefits for other retired Federal \n     employees.\n       (6) The failure to provide adequate health care upon \n     retirement is preventing the retired members of the uniformed \n     services from recommending, without reservation, that young \n     men and women make a career of any military service.\n       (7) The United States should establish health care that is \n     fully paid by the sponsoring agency under the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits program for members who entered \n     active duty on or prior to June 7, 1956, and who subsequently \n     earned retirement.\n       (8) The United States should reestablish adequate health \n     care for all retired members of the uniformed services that \n     is at least equivalent to that provided to other retired \n     Federal employees by extending to such retired members of the \n     uniformed services the option of coverage under the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits program, the Civilian Health and \n     Medical Program of the uniformed services, or the TRICARE \n     Program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again address \nthe issue of the interstate movement of municipal solid waste. This is \nan issue that I have been working on for over five years, Mr. \nPresident. In 1994, I proposed legislation (S. 2126) that would have \nauthorized localities to impose reasonable limits on imports of \nmunicipal solid waste from other states. That legislation did not pass, \nand even though most communities now negotiate compensation from \nlandfills that imports waste, they negotiate with no real authority to \npower. In 1997, I re-introduced that bill (S. 448). In 1999 during the \n106th Congress, and working with Senator Warner, I introduced new \nlanguage that I had hoped would spur discussion and perhaps some \ncreative approaches to solving this problem.\n  I have tried, as have many other Members including Senators Warner, \nBaucus, Coats, Specter, Voinovich, Bayh, Conrad, Santorum, of course \nSenator Chafee, to come to grips with this issue in some reasonable \nway. We have all tried to come up with legislation that would provide \nstates and localities with some method of refusing the detritus from \nother states when it becomes an imposition, or a hazard. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee did have a hearing last summer \non this issue, but unfortunately no mark up was held after that \nhearing. All of our efforts, singly and in concert, have had little \neffect.\n  As of today Virginia remains the second largest importer of waste in \nthe US, with the level of waste imported increasing from approximately \n2.8 million tons in 1997 to 4.6 million tons in 1998. The figures for \n1999 are not in yet but we can safely assume that they are higher \nstill. On May 29th 1996, Mayor Giuliani and Governor George Pataki \nannounced that in December of 2001 the Fresh Kills landfill will close. \nFresh Kills remains the point of disposal for much of New York City's \nwaste. Let me quote from a 1997 report prepared by the Congressional \nResearch Service on this looming closure.\n\n       How the city will replace Fresh Kill's capacity is unclear. \n     At present, there are few options other than an expanded \n     recycling program and out-of-state disposal. A 1996 report \n     for the city's Department of Sanitation concluded that, given \n     current disposal sites, the city would consume virtually all \n     of the available disposal capacity located within a 365-mile \n     radius.\n\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\n\n  New York City and the state of New York have done virtually nothing \nsince that time to increase in-state capacity. I would pose this \nquestion to each Senator. Envision the largest city in your state with \na solid waste disposal problem of this magnitude, can you imagine your \nstate government, and the mayor of that city simply ignoring the \nproblem and failing to do anything about it? Admittedly, we have some \ntussles in Virginia, but when we have a problem, we try our level best \nto solve it ourselves, before we ask the rest of the Union to carry the \nweight.\n  This session it is critical that we get something done on this issue. \nBecause when Fresh Kills closes we can expect a lot of additional waste \nto come our way. Each additional 1 million tons of waste that comes to \nVirginia will result in 40,000 additional tractor trailer trips on \nVirginia highways, if the trucks observe the legal weight limit. If \nthey don't, we will have fewer, but more dangerous trucks.\n  Mr. President, a principle of public health protection embodied in \nthe most basic practices of solid waste disposal is that waste should \nmove as quickly as possible from point of origin to point of disposal. \nMoving waste over 300 miles through the most congested portion of this \ncountry makes no sense, but it will continue unless we move to stop it. \nTherefore, Mr. President, I urge that the Environment and Public Works \ncommittee move to mark up a bill that will help those of us in \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Connecticut, New \nHampshire, Maine, and other unwary states to cope with, and put \nreasonable restrictions on waste coming into our states.\n  I have proposed an alternative option, but if that can't or won't be \ntaken up by the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am ready to \nsupport any and all legislation aimed at empowering states to have some \ncontrol over waste imports. To that end I ask that I be added as a co-\nsponsor to both the Specter and Voinovich bills. I will be willing to \nsupport any other legislation that serves my stated purpose.\n  In 104th Congress we came very close to passing an interstate waste \nbill. Senator Smith of New Hampshire worked tirelessly on that bill, \nand was integral to its passage in the Senate. I hope as chairman, he \nwill take up this issue once again, and move a bill through committee \nfor consideration by the full Senate.\n  We were sent here to tackle complex issues and solve problems. We \nneed to work together, and start now, so that an interstate waste bill \nwill be one of the accomplishments of this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S43-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING BROTHER RONALD GIANNONE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a true \nchampion of humanity. A man whose whole life has been a gift of service \nwithout material reward. A man whose work has as much meaning for the \npoor and disenfranchised in Sudan as it does for the poor and \ndisenfranchised in his Wilmington community. A man whose faith in the \nhuman spirit abounds. A man that I proudly call my friend, the \nExecutive Director of Delaware's Ministry of Caring, Brother Ronald \nGiannone.\n  This week, business and community leaders and hundreds of Brother \nRonald's closest friends from across the State of Delaware will gather \nto celebrate his fiftieth birthday. This Golden Birthday bash \nprincipally is to thank him fifty-times over for his countless years of \nservice to our community. We will salute him because of who Brother \nRonald is, what he represents and how much he means to improving the \nquality of life in my home State.\n  Let me be specific. Brother Ronald is the kind of guy who when asked \nby a man or a woman down on his or her luck, ``Can you spare a dime?'' \nresponds with a meal, a place to stay and a rigorous routine of \ntraining and education to help keep that man or woman from the throes \nof homelessness and despair. He is hope to the hopeless, an oasis of \nstrength and inspiration for all those who benefit from his generosity.\n  For these reasons, Brother Ronald is a true Delaware treasure, but \nstill there is so much more. Brother Ronald is an exemplary \nadministrator. There is, quite simply, no other organization like his \nMinistry of Caring. His 32 full-time facilities address every need of \nan individual or family who finds themselves homeless, destitute and/or \nin transition. He clothes, he shelters, he feeds, he takes care of \nchildren, he helps develop skills, he finds jobs, he provides medical \ncare, he cares. He teaches those who need his assistance all the things \nthey must do to be self-sufficient. And for those who seek to provide \nreal change, he exemplifies just what it takes to make real differences \nin one life.\n  Still, it does not stop there. Brother Ronald understands that while \nhe feeds someone in the Emmanuel Dining Room, someone else is starving \nin Sudan. Consequently, his work and Ministry extend far beyond \nAmerican borders and into the lives of people throughout the world. Few \npeople could have such grand vision and still focus so directly on \nthose suffering in their own hometown. Such is the case with Brother \nRonald.\n  Though I could say much more about this outstanding American, I will \nadd only this. In the words of my hero, my dad, Joseph R. Biden, Sr., \n``it is a lucky man that wakes up each morning, puts his feet on the \nfloor, goes to work and believes that it matters.'' Even luckier is the \nman that does these things, and inspires everyone around him to believe \nthe same. Happy 50th Birthday, Brother Ronald.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S43-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S43-S44]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BUNDESTAG/BUNDESRAT STAFF EXCHANGE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States \nCongress and the German Bundestag and Bundesrat have conducted an \nannual exchange program for staff members from both countries. The \nprogram gives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn \nabout each other's political institutions and convey Members' views on \nissues of mutual concern.\n  A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be selected \nto visit Germany April 7 to April 22 of this year. During the two week \nexchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, \nBundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous \npolitical, business, academic, and media agencies. Cultural activities \nand a weekend visit in a Bundestag Member's district will complete the \nschedule.\n  A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United \nStates for three weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings \nhere in Washington and visit the districts of Congressional Members.\n  The Congress-Bundestag Staff Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, \nand is one of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private \ninstitutions in the United States and Germany to foster better \nunderstanding of the politics and policies of both countries.\n  The U.S. delegation should consist of experienced and accomplished \nHill staff who can contribute to the success of the exchange on both \nsides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag reciprocates by sending senior \nstaff professionals to the United States.\n  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. \nApplicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, \nalthough such a background can be helpful. The composite U.S. \ndelegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual \nconcern in Germany and the United States such as, but not limited to, \ntrade, security, the environment, immigration, economic development, \nhealth care, and other social policy issues.\n  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to help plan and \nimplement the program for the Bundestag staff delegation when they \nvisit the United States. Participants are expected to assist in \nplanning topical meetings in Washington, and are encouraged to host one \nor two Bundestag staffers in their Member's district in July, or to \narrange for such a visit to another Member's district.\n  Participants are selected by a committee composed of personnel from \nthe Bureau of Education and Culture Exchanges of the U.S. Department of \nState and past participants of the exchange.\n  Senators and Representatives who would like a member of their staff \nto apply for participation in this year's program should direct them to \nsubmit a resume and cover letter in which they state why they believe \nthey are qualified, the contributions they can make to a successful \nprogram and some assurances of their ability to participate during the \ntime stated. Applications may be sent to Connie Veillette\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\nin Congressman Regula's office, 2309 Rayburn House Building by noon on \nFriday, March 3.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S44-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S44]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF ADMIRAL ELMO R. ZUMWALT, JR.\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a titan in \nour nation's naval history. Early this year, during our recess, Admiral \nElmo R. Zumwalt, Jr. passed away. Admiral Zumwalt led a disciplined, \ndedicated, and directed life and career as a leader and, sometimes, as \nan iconoclast.\n  Mr. President, Admiral Zumwalt's meteoric rise through the ranks \nbegan at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated in just three \nyears, yet ranked seventh in his class. Following his graduation from \nthe academy, Zumwalt began a lengthy career on a number of surface \nwarships.\n  Among those ships was the U.S.S. Wisconsin, one of four Iowa-class \nbattleships, the largest battleships ever built by the Navy. The four \nvessels, the Wisconsin, the Iowa, the New Jersey and the Missouri, \nserved gallantly in every significant United States conflict from World \nWar II to the Persian Gulf War. Future Admiral Zumwalt, the Wisconsin's \nnavigator when the Korean War broke out, extolled her ``versatility, \nmaneuverability, strength, and power.'' Unbeknownst to him, this would \nnot be the last time that he would leave his indelible mark on the \ngreat state of Wisconsin.\n  Following his service in the war, Zumwalt shuttled between the \nPentagon and the sea. He excelled in both arenas, but in entirely \ndifferent ways.\n  In 1970, President Nixon appointed Zumwalt the youngest Chief of \nNaval Operations in our history. As CNO, Admiral Zumwalt tackled some \nof the most divisive and challenging issues not just to hit the Navy, \nbut society at large. And we're still trying to conquer some of them.\n  Admiral Zumwalt crusaded for a fair and equal Navy. He fought to \npromote equality for minorities and women at a time of considerable \nracial strife in our country and at a time of deeply entrenched \ninstitutional racism and sexism in the Navy. He pushed so hard against \nthe establishment that he almost lost his job. But thanks to the \nsupport of some like-minded reformers, including our esteemed \ncolleague, the late John Chafee, who was then the Secretary of the \nNavy, Zumwalt prevailed and instituted a host of personnel reforms.\n  Mr. President, Admiral Zumwalt's efforts to promote equality \naddressed, in part, an issue that we are tackling anew. Many in \nCongress and in the Defense Department seem to think that recruitment \nand retention can be improved simply by increasing pay and benefits. \nThey could learn much from Admiral Zumwalt, who understood the \nimportance not only of boosting pay, but also of changing the service \nto reflect the wants and needs of service members.\n  We should follow Admiral Zumwalt's example and take a broader view \nwhen we look to improve the lives of our military personnel.\n  Mr. President, in his later years, Admiral Zumwalt dedicated himself \nto assisting Vietnam War era veterans who had been exposed to Agent \nOrange. He played an instrumental role in getting Agent Orange-exposed \nveterans with cancer a service-connected illness designation. I had the \nhonor of meeting with him to discuss his efforts to increase research \nfunding for Agent Orange related illnesses and to explore options for \ninternational cooperation in that research.\n  Admiral Elmo Zumwalt was a great naval leader, a visionary and a \ncourageous challenger of the conventional wisdom. We will not see the \nlikes of him again. We mourn his passing and salute his \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S44-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S44]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, this morning the Supreme Court issued \nthe most significant ruling in the area of campaign finance and \nelection law since the 1976 landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo. I am \nhappy to report the Court reaffirmed the core holding\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\nof Buckley: The public's elected representatives have the \nconstitutional power to limit contributions to political campaigns in \norder to protect the integrity of the political process from corruption \nor the appearance of corruption.\n  It is most fitting that this ruling came down this morning as the \nSenate prepares to return from its long recess. As you know, Mr. \nPresident, one of the most important unfinished pieces of business on \nour agenda is campaign finance reform and the McCain-Feingold bill. The \nHouse passed a reform bill last year by a wide bipartisan margin, and \nnow today's Court decision leaves no doubt that a soft money ban, which \nis the core provision of that bill and of our bill in the Senate, is \nconstitutional. Today's decision has dispatched one of the most \npersistent and most erroneous arguments against reform. The Court did \nit by a decisive vote of 6-3. We, as a legislative body, must step up \nand do what is right, what is constitutional, and what is demanded by \nthe public and pass a ban on soft money.\n  I will take a minute to discuss this important Supreme Court decision \nand its implications for our work in this body. The case is Nixon v. \nShrink Missouri Government PAC. It was an appeal of the decision of the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down contribution limits \nenacted by the Missouri Legislature to cover State elections. Those \nlimits were modeled on the Federal limit--$1,000 per candidate per \nelection in a statewide election, somewhat lower for candidates for the \nState legislature. The State statute includes an inflation adjustment \nso that the limit for statewide races had become $1,075 per election by \nthe time this challenge was filed.\n  The Missouri limits were upheld by the district court, but they were \nstruck down by the court of appeals. The court of appeals held that the \nState had not provided adequate evidence of actual or apparent \ncorruption stemming from large contributions to justify the \nrestrictions. It also suggested that the limits were too low and \ntherefore unconstitutional because inflation has eroded the value of a \n$1,000 contribution since 1974, when the Congress chose that limit for \nFederal elections.\n  Today the Supreme Court squarely and decisively rejected the court of \nappeals analysis. It did so by a 6-3 vote. I might note that it did so \nby a 4-3 vote of Justices appointed by Republican Presidents. The Court \nheld that there was more than adequate evidence of actual or apparent \ncorruption on which the State legislature could base its judgment that \ncontributions should be limited. The Court noted that the Buckley \ndecision itself provides that evidence. It said:\n\n       Buckley demonstrates that the dangers of large, corporate \n     contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are \n     corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. The opinion noted \n     that the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 \n     election demonstrate that the problem of corruption is not an \n     illusory one.\n\n  In essence, the Court today rejected the notion that legislatures \nmust amass conclusive evidence of actual corruption in order to justify \ncontribution limits and that each State or Federal legislature must \nreinvent the wheel each time it passes a new limit. The Court \nconcluded:\n\n       [T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large \n     contributions will work actual corruption of our political \n     system, and no reason to question the existence of a \n     corresponding suspicion among voters.\n\n  The Court thus found, as advocates for reform have argued for years, \nthat it is reasonable for Congress to conclude that large contributions \nare corrupting our system. The question has been asked not too long ago \nin this Chamber, where is the corruption? Today Justice Souter has \nprovided the answer: It is in the big money.\n  The Court also rejected the argument that because the passage of time \nhas eroded the value of a $1,000 contribution, somehow that limit is \nnow unconstitutionally low, even though it was acceptable in 1974. We \nhave heard this argument time and again on the floor of the Senate. It \nhas been rejected by the Supreme Court. The Court specifically held \nthat Buckley did not establish a constitutional minimum. Instead, the \nrelevant question in Buckley was ``whether the contribution limitation \nwas so radical in effect as to render political association \nineffective, drive the sound of a candidate's voice below the level of \nnotice, and render contributions pointless.''\n  The Court concluded:\n\n       Such being the test, the issue in later cases cannot be \n     truncated to a narrow question about the power of the dollar \n     but must go to the power to mount a campaign with all the \n     dollars likely to be forthcoming. As Judge Gibson, the \n     dissenting judge in the court of appeals, put it, ``the \n     dictates of the first amendment are not mere functions of the \n     Consumer Price Index.''\n\n  I have quoted the decision at some length because I think it is \ncrucial that my colleagues hear and understand the very clear and very \ndirect statements of the Supreme Court on questions that were not only \nat issue in this case but that we have been debating in this body over \nthe past few years. No longer can my colleagues come to this floor and \nsay they would love to support a ban on soft money but it would violate \nthe first amendment for Congress to outlaw unlimited corporate and \nlabor contributions to political parties. This favorite figleaf \nclutched by opponents of reform was snatched away today by the Supreme \nCourt. That emperor now has no clothes.\n\n  Just as 126 legal scholars said over 2 years ago when they wrote to \nus, today's decision confirms that Congress may constitutionally outlaw \nsoft money in this country. Justice Breyer's concurrence today, joined \nby Justice Ginsburg, says that explicitly. He writes:\n\n       Buckley's holding seems to leave the political branches \n     broad authority to enact laws regulating contributions that \n     take the form of soft money.\n\n  We have more than adequate evidence of at least the appearance of \ncorruption in these unlimited contributions. Furthermore, if Congress \ncan limit individual contributions and ban corporate and labor \ncontributions in connection with Federal elections, surely it can \neliminate the soft money loophole through which corporations, unions, \nand wealthy individuals evade those limits. The constitutionality of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill to ban soft money is simply no longer an open \nquestion. The support of the American people for taking such a step is \nnot in doubt either.\n  What is in doubt is the courage and will of the Senate to do what has \nto be done. Now that we are back in session, and with the encouragement \nof the Supreme Court of the United States, we must act. The reason we \nmust act was made very clear by the Supreme Court today. The survival \nof our democracy depends on our citizens having confidence that their \nelected officials will vote in accordance with the public interest \nrather than the interest of their contributors. The appearance of \ncorruption inherent in unlimited contributions calls that confidence \ninto grave question. As the Court said in its opinion today:\n\n       Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the \n     cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could \n     jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in \n     democratic governance. Democracy works only if people have \n     faith in those who govern. That faith is bound to be \n     shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in \n     activities which arouse suspicions of ``malfeasance and \n     corruption.''\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read and digest the opinion of the \nCourt in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC. The Court has done \nits duty and spoken in a clear voice. Now we must do ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/24/senate-section/article/S45-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S45]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11:30 A.M.
