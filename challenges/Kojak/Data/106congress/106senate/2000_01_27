Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much \nprosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or so few \nexternal threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity--\nand, therefore, such a profound obligation--to build the more perfect \nunion of our founders? dreams.\n  We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest \neconomic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in \n30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-\nAmerican and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-\nback budget surpluses in 42 years.\n  Next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic \ngrowth in our entire history.\n  We have built a new economy.\n  Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American \nspirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen \nbirths down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent. \nWelfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years.\n  My fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has \never been.\n  As always, the credit belongs to the American people.\n  My gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have \nworked with us to put progress above partisanship.\n  Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be \nmuch to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our nation was gripped by \neconomic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a \nbest-selling book asked: ``America: What went wrong?'' In the best \ntraditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things right. We \nrestored the vital center, replacing outdated ideologies with a new \nvision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, \nresponsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.\n  We reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new \nideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility, and give our \npeople the tools to solve their own problems.\n  With the smallest federal workforce in 40 years, we turned record \ndeficits into record surpluses, and doubled our investment in \neducation. We cut crime: with 100,000 community police and the Brady \nLaw, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals.\n  We ended welfare as we knew it--requiring work while protecting \nhealth care and nutrition for children, and investing more in child \ncare, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We \nhave helped parents to succeed at work and at home--with family leave, \nwhich 20 million Americans have used to care for a newborn child or a \nsick loved one. We have engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen \nservice through AmeriCorps--while also helping them earn their way \nthrough college.\n  In 1992, we had a roadmap. Today, we have results. More important, \nAmerican again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not \nlet our renewed confidence grow into complacency. We will be judged by \nthe dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we \nwill be held to a high standard, indeed. Because our chance to do good \nis so great.\n  My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st \nCentury. Now, we must shape a 21st-Century American revolution--of \nopportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be, as we were in \nthe beginning, a new nation.\n  At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, ``the one \ncharacteristic more essential than any other is foresight . . . It \nshould be the growing nation with a future which takes the long look \nahead.'' Tonight let us take our look long ahead--and set great goals \nfor our nation.\n  To 21st Century America, let us pledge that: Every child will begin \nschool ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will \nbe able to succeed at home and at work--and no child will be raised in \npoverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will \nassure quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans. We will make \nAmerica the safest big country on Earth. We will bring prosperity to \nevery American community. We will reverse the course of climate change \nand leave a cleaner, safer planet. America will lead the world toward \nshared peace and prosperity, and the far frontiers of science and \ntechnology. And we will become at last what our founders pledged us to \nbe so long ago--one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and \njustice for all.\n\n  These are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach \nthem all this year. Not even in this decade. But we will reach them. \nLet us remember that the first American revolution was not won with a \nsingle shot. The continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson \nof our history--and the lesson of the last seven years--is that great \ngoals are reached step by step: always building on our progress, always \ngaining ground.\n  Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. For too \nlong this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing \nnational priorities. Let's begin with them.\n  I ask you again to pass a real patient's bill of rights. Pass common-\nsense gun-safety legislation. Pass campaign finance reform. Vote on \nlong overdue judicial nominations and other important appointees. And, \nagain, I ask you to raise the minimum wage.\n  Two years ago, as we reached our first balanced budget, I asked that \nwe meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our \nfiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are \ndoing something that would have seemed unimaginable seven years ago: We \nare actually paying down the national debt. If we stay on this path, we \ncan pay down the debt entirely in 13 years and make America debt-free \nfor the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835.\n  In 1993, we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit \nReduction Act, winning passage in both houses by just one vote. Your \nformer colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort. \nHe is here tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well.\n  Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt \nreduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make \nto every American--Social Security and Medicare. I ask you tonight to \nwork with me to make a bipartisan down payment on Social Security \nreform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the \nSocial Security Trust Fund to ensure that it is strong and sound for \nthe next 50 years.\n  But this is just the start of our journey. Now we must take the right \nsteps toward reaching our great goals.\n\n\n              opportunity and responsibility in education\n\n  First and foremost, we need a 21st Century revolution in education, \nguided by our faith that every child can learn. Because education is \nmore than ever the key to our children's future, we must make sure all \nour children have that key. That means quality preschool and \nafterschool, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and college \nopportunities for all our children.\n  For seven years, we have worked hard to improve our schools, with \nopportunity and responsibility: Investing more, but demanding more in \nreturn.\n  Reading, math, and college entrance scores are up. And some of the \nmost impressive gains are in schools in poor neighborhoods.\n  All successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher \nstandards, more accountability, so all children can reach those \nstandards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It \nholds states and school districts accountable for progress, and rewards \nthem for results. Each year, the national government invests more than \n$15 billion in our schools. It's time to support what works and stop \nsupporting what doesn't.\n  As we demand more than ever from our schools, we should invest more \nthan ever in our schools.\n  Let's double our investments to help states and districts turn around \ntheir worst-performing schools--or shut them down.\n  Let's double our investment in afterschool and summer school \nprograms--boosting achievement, and keeping children off the street and \nout of trouble. If we do, we can give every child in every failing \nschool in America the chance to meet high standards.\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\n  Since 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and \nimproved its quality. Tonight, I ask for another $1 billion to Head \nStart, the largest increase in the program's history.\n  We know that children learn best in smaller classes with good \nteachers. For two years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to \nhire 100,000 new, qualified teachers, to lower class sizes in the early \ngrades. This year, I ask you to make it three in a row.\n  And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I \npropose a new teacher quality initiative--to recruit more talented \npeople into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and \ngive all teachers the training they need.\n  We know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I \nbecame President, there was just one independent public charter school \nin all America. Today there are 1,700. I ask you to help us meet our \ngoal of 3,000 by next year.\n  We know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet. We're \ngetting there. In 1994, only three percent of our classrooms were \nconnected. Today, with the help of the Vice President's E-rate program, \nmore than half of them are; and 90 percent of our schools have at least \none connection to the Internet.\n  But we can't finish the job when a third of all schools are in \nserious disrepair, many with walls and wires too old for the Internet. \nTonight, I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate, urgent \nrepairs. And again, to help build or modernize 6,000 schools, to get \nstudents out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms.\n  We should double our bipartisan GEAR UP program to mentor 1.4 million \ndisadvantaged young people for college. And let's offer these students \na chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students \nuse to boost their test scores.\n  To make the American Dream achievable for all, we must make college \naffordable for all. For seven years, on a bipartisan basis, we have \ntaken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more-affordable \nstudent loans, education IRAs, and our HOPE scholarships, which have \nalready benefited 5 million young people. 67 percent of high school \ngraduates now go on to college, up almost 10 percent since 1993. Yet \nmillions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need \nhelp.\n  I propose a landmark $30-billion college opportunity tax cut--a \nmiddle-class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs. \nWe've already made two years of college affordable for all. Now let's \nmake four years of college affordable for all.\n  If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward making \nsure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to \nsucceed.\n\n\n               rewarding work and strengthening families\n\n  We need a 21st Century revolution to reward work and strengthen \nfamilies--by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at \nthe most important work of all--raising their children. That means \nmaking sure that every family has health care and the support to care \nfor aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that \nno child grows up in poverty.\n  From my first days as President, we have worked to give families \nbetter access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program--CHIP--so that workers who don't have health \ncare coverage through their employers at least can get it for their \nchildren. So far, we've enrolled 2 million children, and we're well on \nour way to our goal of 5 million.\n  But there are still more than 40 million Americans without health \ninsurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we \nfollow Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low income parents \neligible for the insurance that covers their kids. Together with our \nchildren's initiative, we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured \nin America.\n  Again, I ask you to let people between 55 and 65--the fastest growing \ngroup of uninsured--buy into Medicare. And let's give them a tax credit \nto make that choice an affordable one.\n  When the Baby Boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for \ntwice as many of our citizens--and yet it is far from ready to do so. \nMy generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our \nburden. We must strengthen and modernize Medicare now.\n  My budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make \nit more efficient and competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion \nof our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025; and, at long \nlast, to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage \nfor prescription drugs.\n  Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one \ncreating a Medicare program today would even consider excluding \ncoverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors \nnow lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their \nlives. Millions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most \npay the highest prices for them.\n  In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending \nto all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.\n  Record numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved \nones at home. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term \ncare. Frankly, that wasn't enough. This year, let's triple it to \n$3,000--and this year, let's pass it.\n  And we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health \ncare. I want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down \nthe barriers to the decent treatment of mental illness: Tipper Gore.\n  Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in \nhealth care in the 35 years since the creation of Medicare--a big step \ntoward assuring health care for all Americans, young and old.\n  We must also make investments that reward work and support families. \nNothing does that better than the Earned Income Tax Credit, the EITC. \nThe `E' in `EITC' is about earning; working; taking responsibility and \nbeing rewarded for it. In my first Address to you, I asked Congress to \ngreatly expand this tax credit; and you did. As a result, in 1998 \nalone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way \nout of poverty and toward the middle class--double the number in 1993.\n\n  Tonight, I propose another major expansion. We should reduce the \nmarriage penalty for the EITC, making sure it rewards marriage just as \nit rewards work. And we should expand the tax credit for families with \nmore than two children to provide up to $1,100 more in tax relief.\n  We can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay \nfor equal work. The female unemployment rate is the lowest in 46 years. \nYet women still earn only about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We \nmust do better by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay \nlaws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, far away from many low-\nincome families. In the past two years, I have proposed and Congress \nhas approved 110,000 new housing vouchers--rent subsidies to help \nworking families live closer to the workplace. This year, let us more \nthan double that number. If we want people to go to work, they have to \nbe able to get to work.\n  Many working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child \ncare. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about two \nmillion children. My child care initiative, along with funds already \nsecured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and \nmore affordable for another 400,000 children.\n  For hard-pressed middle-income families, we should also expand the \nchild care tax credit. And we should take the next big step. We should \nmake that tax credit refundable for low-income families. For those \nmaking under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child-\ncare costs. We all say we're pro-work and pro-family. Passing this \nproposal would prove it.\n  Tens of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard \nas they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few \ncan make use of IRAs and 401-K retirement plans. We should to more to \nhelp working families save and accumulate wealth. That's the idea \nbehind so-called Individual Development Accounts. Let's take that idea \nto a new level, with Retirement savings Accounts that enable\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nevery low- and moderate-income family in America to save for \nretirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. \nI propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for \ndollar, every year they save. And to give a major new tax credit for \nany small business that provides a meaningful pension to its workers.\n  Nearly one in three American children grows up in a home without a \nfather. These children are five times more likely to live in poverty \nthan children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and \nsupporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all children \nout of poverty.\n  We have doubled child support collections since 1992, and I am \nproposing tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. \nBut we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their \nchildren--and need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, \ngot that help. How he has a good job and he supports his son Ricardo. \nMy budget will help 40,000 fathers make the choices Carlos did. And I \nthank him for being here.\n  If there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is \nin our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Thanks \nto overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved \nfoster care, supported those who leave it when they turn eighteen, and \ndramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive \nhomes. I thank you for that. Of course, I am especially grateful to the \nperson who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked \ntirelessly for children and families for thirty years now: my wife, \nHillary.\n\n  If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward empowering \nparents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is \nraised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, \neducation and support for working families--and still offer tax cuts to \nhelp pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents and \nreduce the marriage penalty--without forsaking the path of fiscal \ndiscipline that got us here. Indeed, we must make these investments and \ntax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and \nextends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the \nnational debt.\n\n\n                        responsibility and crime\n\n  Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years--the longest \ndecline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on \ncommunity police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. \nBut nobody believes America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: \nlet's make America the safest big country in the world.\n  Last fall, Congress supported my plan to hire--in addition to the \n100,000 community police we have already funded--50,000 more, \nconcentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support.\n  Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered common-sense \ngun safety legislation to require Brady background checks at gun shows, \nchild safety locks for all new handguns, and a ban on the importation \nof large-capacity ammunition clips. With courage--and a tie-breaking \nvote by the Vice President--the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood \nup for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House \nfailed to follow suit.\n  We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. \nDaniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at \nColumbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. \nLike all parents who lost their children his father Tom has borne \nunimaginable grief. Somehow Tom has found the strength to honor his son \nby transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a \nleave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I \npray that his courage and wisdom will move this Congress to make \ncommon-sense gun safety legislation the very next order of business. \nTom, thank you for being here tonight.\n  We must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the \nbooks. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took \noffice. But again, we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and \nlocal gun prosecutors, and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun \ntraffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give law enforcement the \ntools to trace every gun--and every bullet--used in a crime in America.\n  Listen to this: the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in \nthe United States is nine times higher than in the other 25 \nindustrialized nations--combined. Technologies now exist that could \nlead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask \nCongress to fund research in Smart Gun technology. I also call on \nresponsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns \nand other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and keep our \nchildren safe.\n  Every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media \non their children. I thank the entertainment industry for accepting my \nchallenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and \nInternet games. But the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and \nconfusing to be really useful to parents. Therefore, I now ask the \nindustry to accept the First Lady's challenge--to develop a single, \nvoluntary rating system for all children's entertainment, one that is \neasier for parents to understand and enforce.\n  If we take all these steps, we will be well on our way to making \nAmerica the safest big country in the world.\n\n\n                          opening new markets\n\n  To keep our historic economic expansion going, we need a 21st Century \nrevolution to open new markets, start new businesses, and hire new \nworkers right here in America--in our inner cities, poor rural areas, \nand on Indian reservations.\n  Our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. Over the \nlast six months, I have traveled to many of them--joined by many of \nyou, and many far-sighted business people--to shine a spotlight on the \nenormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi \nDelta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Everywhere I've \ngone, I've met talented people eager for opportunity, and able to work. \nLet's put them to work.\n  For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right \nthing to do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to \nit? I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in \nAmerica's new markets that they now have to invest in foreign markets. \nTonight, I propose a large New Markets Tax Credit and other incentives \nto spur $22 billion in private-sector capital--to create new businesses \nand new investments in inner cities and rural areas.\n  Empowerment Zones have been creating these opportunities for five \nyears now. We should also increase incentives to invest in them and \ncreate more of them.\n  This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is an American \nissue. Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you \njoined me and the Reverend Jesse Jackson in your home state of \nIllinois, and committed to working toward our common goal, by combining \nthe best ideas from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I look \nforward to working with you.\n  We must maintain our commitment to community development banks and \nkeep the community reinvestment act strong so all Americans have access \nto the capital they need to buy homes and build businesses.\n  We need to make special efforts to address the areas with the highest \nrates of poverty. My budget includes a special $110 million initiative \nto promote economic development in the Mississippi Delta; and $1 \nbillion to increase economic opportunity, health care, education and \nlaw enforcement for Native American communities. In this new century, \nwe should honor our historic responsibility to empower the first \nAmericans. I thank leaders and members from both parties who have \nalready expressed an interest in working with us on these efforts.\n  There's another part of our American community in trouble today--our \nfamily farmers. When I signed the Farm Bill in 1996, I said there was a \ngreat danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, \ndroughts, floods, and historically low prices have made times very bad \nfor our farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety \nnet, invest in land conservation, and create new markets by expanding \nour program for bio-based fuels and products.\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\n  Today, opportunity for all requires something new: having access to a \ncomputer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the \ndigital divide between those who have these tools and those who don't.\n  Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but \nit's just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained \nto teach 21st Century skills and creates technology centers in 1,000 \ncommunities to serve adults. This spring, I will invite high-tech \nleaders to join me on another New Markets tour--to close the digital \ndivide and open opportunity for all our people. I thank the high-tech \ncompanies that are already doing so much in this area--and I hope the \nnew tax incentives. I have proposed will encourage others to join us.\n  If we take these steps, we will go a long way toward our goal of \nbringing opportunity to every community.\n\n\n                 global change and american leadership\n\n  To realize the full possibilities of the new economy, we must reach \nbeyond our own borders, to shape the revolution that is tearing down \nbarriers and building new networks among nations and individuals, \neconomies and cultures: globalization.\n  It is the central reality of our time. Change this profound is both \nliberating and threatening. But there is no turning back. And our open, \ncreative society stands to benefit more than any other--if we \nunderstand, and act on, the new realities of interdependence. We must \nbe at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and \npartner. We cannot build our future without helping others to build \ntheirs.\n  First, we must forge a new consensus on trade. Those of us who \nbelieve passionately in the power of open trade must ensure that it \nlifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating \nabusive child labor or a race to the bottom on the environment and \nworker protection. Still, open markets and rules-based trade are the \nbest engines we know for raising living standards, reducing global \npoverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of \nideas. There is only one direction for America on trade: we must go \nforward.\n  And we must make developing economies our partners in prosperity--\nwhich is why I ask Congress to finalize our groundbreaking African and \nCaribbean Basin trade initiatives.\n  Globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to \nbring the world together around democracy, freedom, and peace, and to \noppose those who would tear it apart.\n  Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to \nshape the 21st Century world.\n  First, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia \nand China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both \nare being held back from reaching their full potential: Russia by the \nlegacy of communism, economic turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war \nin Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the \nexpense of freedom.\n  But think how much has changed in the past decade: thousands of \nformer Soviet nuclear weapons eliminated; Russian soldiers serving with \nours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the \nfirst time in a thousand years. And in China, an economy more open to \nthe world than ever before. No one can know for sure what direction \nthese great countries will choose. But we must do everything in our \npower to increase the chance they will choose wisely, to be \nconstructive members of the global community.\n\n  That is why we must support those Russians struggling for a \ndemocratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear \narsenals; and help Russia safeguard weapons and materials that remain.\n  That is why Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to \nbring China into the WTO, by passing Permanent Normal Trade Relations \nas soon as possible this year. Our markets are already open to China. \nThis agreement will open China's markets to us. And it will advance the \ncause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China.\n  A second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that \npose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. America \ncannot prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our \ninterests are at stake and we can make a difference, we must be \npeacemakers.\n  We should be proud of America's role in bringing the Middle East \ncloser than ever to a comprehensive peace; building peace in Northern \nIreland; working for peace in East Timor and Africa; promoting \nreconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus; working to \ndefuse crises between India and Pakistan; defending human rights and \nreligious freedom.\n  And we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and \nthose of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo--\nenabling a million innocent people to return to their homes.\n  When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosova, Captain John \nCherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when \nanother American plane went down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of \nenemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our armed \nforces' skill and bravery, we prevailed without losing a single \nAmerican in combat. Captain Cherrey, we honor you, and promise to \nfinish the job you began.\n  A third challenge is to keep the inexorable march of technology from \ngiving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to \nundermine our defenses. The same advances that have shrunk cell phones \nto fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier \nto conceal and easier to use.\n  We must meet this threat: by making effective agreements to restrain \nnuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow and \nlethal technology to Iran; preventing Iraq from threatening its \nneighbors; increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological \nattack; protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and \ncriminals; and developing a system to defend against new threats--while \nworking to preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.\n  I hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to \nbuild a consensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  A fourth challenge is to ensure that the stability of our planet is \nnot threatened by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept \na world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new \neconomy, while the rest live on the bare edge of survival. We must do \nour part, with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of \nfreedom.\n  From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people won the right to choose their \nleaders in 1999 than in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. We must \nstand by democracies--like Colombia, fighting narco-traffickers for its \npeople's lives, and our children's lives. I have proposed a strong two-\nyear package to help Colombia win this fight; and I ask for your \nsupport. And I will propose tough new legislation to go after what drug \nbarons value most--their money.\n  In a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, \nwe must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the \npoorest countries so they can invest in education, health and economic \ngrowth--as the Pope and other religious leaders have urged. Last year, \nCongress made a down payment on America's share. And I ask for your \ncontinued support.\n  And America must help more nations break the bonds of disease. Last \nyear in Africa, AIDS killed ten times as many people as war did. My \nbudget invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other \ninfectious killers. Today, I propose a tax credit to speed the \ndevelopment of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB and AIDS. I ask \nthe private sector and our partners around the world to join us in \nembracing this cause. Together, we can save millions of lives.\n  Our final challenge is the most important: to pass a national \nsecurity budget that keeps our military the best trained and best \nequipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st Century \nweapons; raises salaries for our service men and women; protects our \nveterans; fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war; \nand makes good on our commitment to pay our UN dues and arrears. I ask \nyou to pass this budget and I thank you for the extraordinary support \nyou have given--Republicans and Democrats\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\nalike--to our men and women in uniform. I especially want to thank \nSecretary Cohen for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to our \nnational security--and Janet Cohen, I thank you for tirelessly \ntraveling the world to show our support for the troops.\n  If we meet all these challenges, America can lead the world toward \npeace and freedom in an era of globalization.\n\n\n            responsibility, opportunity, and the environment\n\n  I am grateful for the opportunities the Vice President and I have had \nto work hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the \nnotion that you can't expand the economy while protecting the \nenvironment. As our economy has grown, we have rid more than 500 \nneighborhoods of toxic waste and ensured cleaner air and water for \nmillions of families. In the past three months alone, we have acted to \npreserve more than 40 million acres of roadless lands in our National \nForests and created three new National Monuments.\n  But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must grow \nas well. Tonight, I propose creating a permanent conservation fund to \nrestore wildlife, protect coastlines, and save natural treasures from \nCalifornia redwoods to the Everglades. This Lands Legacy endowment \nrepresents by far the most enduring investment in land preservation \never proposed.\n\n  Last year, the Vice President launched a new effort to help make \ncommunities more livable--so children will grow up next to parks, not \nparking lots, and parents can be home with their children instead of \nstuck in traffic. Tonight, we propose new funding for advanced transit \nsystems--for saving precious open spaces--for helping major cities \naround the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their \nquality of life.\n  The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global \nwarming. Scientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade of \nthe entire millennium. If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse \ngases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, \ncoastal areas will be flooded, economies disrupted.\n  Many people in the United States and around the world still believe \nwe can't cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth. \nIn the Industrial Age that may have been true. In the digital economy, \nit isn't. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions \nand provide even more growth. For example, just last week, automakers \nunveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon--the fruits of a unique \nresearch partnership between government and industry. Before you know \nit, efficient production of biofuels will give us the equivalent of \nhundreds of miles from a gallon of gas.\n  To speed innovations in environmental technologies, I propose giving \nmajor tax incentives to businesses for the production of clean energy--\nand to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the \nnext generation of super-efficient cars when they hit the showroom \nfloor. I also call on the auto industry to use available technologies \nto make all new cars more fuel efficient right away. And on Congress to \nmake more of our clean-energy technologies available to the developing \nworld--creating cleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home.\n\n\n      THE OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n  In the new century, innovations in science and technology will be the \nkey not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous \nimprovements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy.\n  Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the \nentire human genome--the very blueprint of life. It is important for \nall Americans to recognize that your tax dollars have fueled this \nresearch--and that this and other wise investments in science are \nleading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent \ndisease.\n  For example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's \nDisease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer--and they are designing \nprecision therapies that will block the harmful effects of these faulty \ngenes for good. Researchers are already using this new technique to \ntarget and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able \nto use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. Scientists are \nalso working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see \nand microchips that would directly stimulate damaged spinal cords and \nallow people who are now paralyzed to stand up and walk.\n  Science and engineering innovations are also propelling our \nremarkable prosperity. Information technology alone now accounts for a \nthird of our economic growth, with jobs that pay almost 80 percent \nabove the private sector average. Again, we should keep in mind: \ngovernment-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet, \nand communications satellites into being. Soon researchers will bring \nus devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can \nspeak; materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the \nweight; and molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power \nof today's fastest supercomputers.\n\n  To accelerate the march of discovery across all disciplines of \nscience and technology, my budget includes an unprecedented $3 billion \nincrease in the 21st Century Research Fund, the largest increase in \ncivilian research in a generation.\n  These new breakthroughs must be used in ways that reflect our most \ncherished values. First and foremost, we must safeguard our citizens' \nprivacy. Last year, we proposed rules to protect every citizen's \nmedical records. This year, we will finalize those rules. We have also \ntaken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card \nstatements and other financial records. Soon I will send legislation to \nthe Congress to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any \ngenetic discrimination by employers or insurers.\n  These steps will allow America to lead toward the far frontiers of \nscience and technology--enhancing our health, environment, and economy \nin ways we cannot even imagine today.\n\n\n                               community\n\n  At a time when science, technology and the forces of globalization \nare bringing so many changes into our lives, it is more important than \never that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities \nand in our national communities.\n  No tie binds different people together like citizen service. There is \na new spirit of service in America, a movement we have supported with \nAmeriCorps, an expanded Peace Corps, and unprecedented new partnerships \nwith businesses, foundations, and community groups. Partnerships to \nenlist 12,000 companies in moving 650,000 of our fellow citizens from \nwelfare to work. To battle drug abuse and AIDS. To teach young people \nto read. To Save America's Treasures. To strengthen the arts. To fight \nteen pregnancy. To prevent youth violence. To promote racial healing.\n  We can do even more to help Americans help each other. We should help \nfaith-based organizations do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and \nhelp young people get back on the right track with initiatives like \nSecond Chance Homes to help unwed teen mothers. We should support \nAmericans who tithe and contribute to charities, but don't earn enough \nto claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight, I propose new tax incentives \nto allow low- and middle-income citizens to get that deduction.\n  We should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the \nAmerican community--investing more to teach them civics and English. \nAnd since everyone in our community counts, we must make sure everyone \nis counted in this year's census.\n  Within ten years there will be no majority race in our largest state, \nCalifornia. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority \nrace in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be \nour greatest strength. Just look around this chamber. We have members \nfrom virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And \nAmerica is stronger for it. But as we have seen, these differences all \ntoo often spark hatred and division, even here at home.\n  We have seen a man dragged to death in Texas simply because he was \nblack. A young man murdered in Wyoming simply because he was gay. In \nthe last year alone, we've seen the shootings of African Americans, \nAsian Americans, and Jewish children simply because of\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nwho they were. This is not the American way. We must draw the line. \nWithout delay, we must pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act. And we should reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n\n  No American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, \ngetting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Tonight, I propose \nthe largest ever investment to enforce America's civil rights laws. \nProtections in law must be protections in fact.\n  Last February, I created the White House Office of One America to \npromote racial reconiliation. That's what Hank Aaron, has done all his \nlife. From his days as baseball's all-time homerun king to his recent \nacts of healing, he has always brought Americans together. We're \npleased he's with us tonight.\n  This fall, at the White House, one of America's leading scientists \nsaid something we should all remember. He said all human beings, \ngenetically, are 99.9 percent the same. So modern science affirms what \nancient faith has always taught: the most important fact of life is our \ncommon humanity.\n  Therefore, we must do more than tolerate diversity--we must honor it \nand celebrate it.\n  My fellow Americans, each time I prepare for the State of the Union, \nI approach it with great hope and expectations for our nation. But \ntonight is special--because we stand on the mountaintop of a new \nmillennium. Behind us we see the great expanse of American achievement; \nbefore us, even grander frontiers of possibility.\n  We should be filled with gratitude and humility for our prosperity \nand progress; with awe and joy at what lies ahead; and with absolute \ndetermination to make the most of it.\n  When the framers finished crafting our Constitution, Benjamin \nFranklin stood in Independence Hall and reflected on a painting of the \nsun, low on the horizon. He said, ``I have often wondered whether that \nsun was rising or setting.'' Today, Franklin said, ``I have the \nhappiness to know it is a rising sun.'' Well, today, because each \ngeneration of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, \nlighting those frontiers of possibility, we still bask in the warmth of \nMr. Franklin's rising sun.\n  After 224 years, the American Revolution continues. We remain a new \nnation. As long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be \nforever young. That is our destiny. And this is our moment.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/27/senate-section/article/S113-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 8:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has agreed to \nthe following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax to elementary and secondary school teachers \nwho provide classroom materials; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Teacher Tax Credit Relief Act, 2000\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Teacher Tax \nCredit Relief Act of 2000. The act would provide an annual tax credit \nof up to $100 for teachers' un-reimbursed classroom expenditures that \nare qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that ``an educated citizenry is essential \nfor the preservation of democracy.'' It falls to our teachers--through \ntheir hard work and lifetime of commitment to young people--to \ninculcate the academic values and analytical skills that make good \ncitizenship possible.\n  In my discussions with teachers--public and private--I have been \namazed to learn that many use their own money to cover the cost of \nclassroom materials that are not supplied by their schools or school \ndistricts. These expenditures enhance our childrens' education but are \npaid for out-of-pocket.\n  In fact, in 1996, according to a study by the National Education \nAssociation, the average K-12 teacher spent $408 annually on classroom \nmaterials needed for education but not supplied by the schools. These \nmaterials include everything from books, workbooks, erasers, paper, \npens, equipment related to classroom instruction, and professional \nenrichment programs.\n  Under current law, a tax deduction is allowed for such expenses, but \nonly if the teacher itemizes, and only if the expenses exceed two \npercent of the teacher's AGI. Of course, a deduction just reduces \ntaxable income. A credit would give teachers relief dollar-for-dollar \nspent, up to the $100 annual limit.\n  On a modest income, teachers provide an incalculable service to our \ncountry. Surely, we should not expect them to pay for school supplies \nout of their salary, when they have already committed their lives to \nthe education of our young.\n  A similar provision enacted by the Arizona legislature in 1995 has \nbeen extremely well-received by teachers. The provision was recently \nupheld as constitutional by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n  Please join me in supporting this bill. Our teachers deserve to be at \nleast partially reimbursed for financial sacrifices they make to \neducate our nation's children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2013. A bill to restore health care equity for Medicare-eligible \nuniformed services retirees, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n\n\nHonoring Health Care Commitments to Servicemembers Past and Present Act \n                                of 2000\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last November, I spoke on the floor \nof the Senate about the severe deficiencies in our nation's military \nhealth care delivery system. We, as a nation, face a very critical \nchallenge in determining how best to reconfigure the military health \ncare delivery system so that it can continue to meet its military \nreadiness and peace-time obligations during this period of ongoing \nchange in our base and force structure.\n  This is a challenge that has concerned me for some time. As I have \nbeen working on this matter and deciding how best to proceed, I have \nmet with, and heard from, many military family members, veterans, and \nmilitary retirees from around the country. And, in that process, I have \nbeen inundated with suggestions for reform. During every meeting and in \nevery letter, I have heard from retired service men and women about so \nmany problems with all aspects of the military medical care system--\nincluding long waiting periods, access to the right kind of\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\ncare, access to needed pharmaceutical drugs, and especially the \n``broken promise'' of free lifetime health care for military retirees \nand their spouses. I have also personally heard such concerns \nrepeatedly expressed as I have traveled extensively throughout the \nUnited States over the past several months.\n  I have found that a primary concern among military retirees and their \nfamilies is the ``broken promise'' of lifetime medical care. In this \nvein, retiree health care is a readiness issue. Today's service members \nare acutely aware of retirees' disenfranchisement from military health \ncare coverage, and exit surveys cite this issue with increasing \nfrequency as one of the factors in members' decisions to leave the \nservice. In fact, a recent General Accounting Office study found that \npoor ``access to medical and dental care in retirement'' was among the \ntop five elements of dissatisfaction among active duty officers in \nretention-critical specialties.\n  Failure to keep health care commitments is hurting service recruiting \nefforts, as well. Traditionally, retirees have been the services' most \neffective recruiters, and their children and those of family friends \nhave been more likely to serve. Unfortunately, increasing numbers of \nretirees who have seen the government renege on its ``lifetime health \ncare'' promises have become more reluctant to recommend service careers \nto their family members and friends. Restoring retirees' confidence in \ntheir health care coverage could go a long way in restoring this \ninvaluable recruiting resource.\n  Certainly, the high cost of providing quality health care has \ncontributed to Congress' failure to implement meaningful reform in the \npast. Yet, even though Congress has increased the President's defense \nbudget requests in recent years to attempt to meet the military's \nfuture needs, it simultaneously has squandered billions each year on \nprojects the military did not request and does not need. Last year \nalone, Congress appropriated over $6 billion for wasteful, unrequested, \nand low-priority projects that would have no positive effect on \npreparing our military for future challenges, and would address this \nmilitary health care quandary.\n\n  Congress also continues to refuse to close military bases that are \nnot essential to our security, permitting politics to outweigh military \nreadiness, at a cost to the taxpayer of nearly $7 billion each year. If \nCongress would allow the Pentagon to privatize or consolidate depot and \nbase maintenance activities, savings of $2 billion each year could be \nachieved. In addition, Congress refuses to eliminate anti-competitive \n``Buy American'' restrictions, which could save almost $5.5 billion \nannually on defense contracts. These common sense reforms together \nwould free up nearly $20 billion per year, which could be used to begin \ncorrecting our readiness shortfalls and, significantly, provide a \nquality health care delivery system for our older military retirees, \nonce and for all.\n  I must add that there are other wasteful funding efforts that are \nparticularly disgraceful. While Congress wastes taxpayer money on \nobsolete infrastructure, unneeded weapon systems, and projects that \nhave no meaningful value to our Armed Forces, it simultaneously refuses \nto adequately pay the nearly 12,000 enlisted military personnel who are \nforced to subsist on food stamps. We must work to improve our treatment \nof all the honored military personnel serving our nation.\n\n\n                  initial steps on the road to reform\n\n  Last October, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the other \nJoint Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nthe state of the military. During that hearing, they universally \ndeclared the year 2000 to be the year of military health care reform.\n  The rush to implement military health care reform, as evidenced by a \nplethora of well-intentioned legislation introduced by Congress and to \nbe proposed by the Administration, and the evaluation of current health \ncare delivery pilot projects must be balanced with the need to provide \nuninterrupted critical health care to the over-65 military retirees and \ntheir families, as well as, recognize the need to provide free health \ncare to those Medicare eligible retirees who entered military service \nbefore June 7, 1956. Their concern about losing even the minimal health \ncare they received from the time of retirement until age 65 increases \ndramatically as they turn 65. If this is to be the year of military \nhealth care, a key part of this effort must entail reassuring these \nolder retirees that the Department of Defense will no longer deny or \nignore their legitimate health care needs. By doing so, Congress also \nwill be taking an essential step in reassuring today's servicemembers \nthat the government does, in fact, keep its recruiting and retention \npromises concerning health care and other career service benefits.\n  The legislation that I am proposing is the next step in my effort to \nlead Congress down the road to meaningful reform of our nation's \nmilitary health care delivery system. This measure adopts positive \nideas already based in other legislation, but offers an essential \nelement that other plans do not--that is, choice. My legislation would \noffer the military retiree and his family a choice of several health \ncare delivery plans. Having the choice to decide which health care \nplan works well is important for two reasons: to ensure control of \noverall health care reform costs and to reflect the reality that each \nretiree's needs can be very different.\n\n  Some military retirees live near military installations and could use \nmilitary health care if they had access to it. Others who live far from \ninstallations might be satisfied, for example, with the addition of a \nrelatively low-cost prescription drug benefit. Still others, however, \nmight desperately need full-coverage insurance such as the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The plan would accommodate \nthese different requirements. This health care reform plan also would \nbe portable and less dependent on any specific military hospital \nsystem, particularly if further rounds of base closures occur.\n\n\n                     Specific Elements of the Plan\n\n  For Medicare-eligible military retirees, this legislation authorizes \nthe following options:\n  Option 1: Establishes a nationwide mail-order pharmacy service and \ncommunity-based pharmacy network to serve the prescription drug needs \nof over-age 65 military retired members, their spouses and survivors of \nthe military community; this provision would expand the Base \nRealignment and Closure (mail-order and TRICARE retail) pharmacy \nbenefit nationwide to all Medicare-eligible uniformed services \nbeneficiaries beginning October 1, 2000.\n  Option 2: Allows Medicare-eligible retirees to enroll in the Medicare \nsubvention benefit and expands TRICARE Senior Prime nationwide \nbeginning October 1, 2000.\n  Option 3: Allows Medicare-eligible retirees to enroll in the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and would expand FEHBP \nbenefits worldwide effective with the fall 2000 open enrollment period \nand coverge beginning January 1, 2001.\n  This legislation includes a critical ``Sense of the Senate'' \ninstruction: That urgent priority should be given to the enactment of \nlegislation (such as S. 2003/H.R. 2966) that provides health care \ncoverage at no cost for Medicare-eligible military retirees who first \nentered the service before June 7, 1956, and their dependents. Such \nlegislation also should have priority consideration by the Senate \ncommittee with jurisdiction over the bill and the measure should \nreceive expedited consideration by the full Senate, immediately after \nit has been reported out of committee to the Senate.\n  This legislation proposes to make essential improvements to the \nmilitary health delivery system for active duty servicemembers and \ntheir families, including:\n  Elimination of copayments and deductibles for all active duty family \nmembers enrolled in TRICARE Prime; this is a great quality of life \nimprovement for our military personnel and their families, especially \nour enlisted families; and\n  Extension of TRICARE Prime Remote coverage free of charge to the \nfamilies of 80,000 active duty members living more than 50 miles from a \nmilitary medical treatment facility (i.e., recruiters, ROTC \ninstructors, reserve center and National Guard active duty personnel, \nand others similarly situated), who are unable to participate in \nTRICARE Prime.\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\n  This measure proposes other significant administrative improvements \nto the military medical delivery system, including:\n  Promotes efficiency in the military health care system by combining \nthe various uniformed services health care delivery systems for \nMedicare-eligibles under a common delivery program, TRICARE Senior \nPrime, just as the same systems for younger beneficiaries have been \ncombined under TRICARE Prime;\n  Establishes an account within the Treasury called the Uniformed \nServices Retirees Health Care Account that helps fund the added cost of \nthis new benefit for age-65 uniformed services retirees; under this \nconcept, savings from efficiencies (such as moving to electronic vs. \npaper claims processing) could be devoted to fulfilling health care \nobligations to older retirees;\n  Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into contracts with \nprivate industry for the purpose of recovering overpayments to civilian \nhealth care providers under TRICARE program; these services may include \naudits and other services deemed necessary by the Secretary of Defense;\n  Directs the Secretary of Defense to enhance and simplify the TRICARE \nhealth program through administrative efficiencies and the use of the \nInternet relating to marketing, beneficiary enrollment, beneficiary and \nprovider education, claims processing, scheduling of appointments and \nother services, as deemed appropriate by the Secretary, to enhance the \nmilitary health delivery system; and\n  Directs the Secretary of Defense to design and issue a national \nenrollment card for the TRICARE health program that shall serve as an \nenrollment card for participation in the TRICARE program nationwide; \nthe enrollment card is designed to facilitate the ready portability of \nbenefits under TRICARE nationwide.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The federal government must not fail our nation's military retirees, \ntheir families, and survivors in ensuring the continuation of adequate \nhealth care coverage in their late years. I believe the steps I have \noutlined today, which have earned the overwhelming endorsement of The \nMilitary Coalition and The Military And Veterans' Alliance, \nrepresenting 9 million members, start us down the road to comprehensive \nreform of the military health care system. Such an effort has not been \nseen in decades, and would fulfill our obligation to our military \nretirees and bolster retention and readiness among today's \nservicemembers.\n  Mr. President, I concur with the Joint Chiefs that this truly is the \nyear of military health care reform. The success of the legislation \nthat I am introducing today will depend significantly on Congress' \nability to produce real military health care reform and provide the \nnecessary resources in a timely manner. In addition, it will be \nimportant that the Pentagon, private industry, and the military \nretirees and active duty servicemembers who utilize the system can work \ntogether and galvanize support for a solid military health care system \nfor the long term.\n  Mr. President, I ask that letters from The Military Coalition, The \nMilitary And Veterans Alliance, the Air Force Association (AFA), the \nNational Association For Uniformed Services (NAUS), and Colonel George \n``Bud'' Day, USAF, Ret. (a Medal of Honor recipient and who is very \nactive in military and veterans' issues) in support of this \ncomprehensive military health care reform plan be placed in the Record, \nimmediately following my remarks. In addition, I ask that the bill be \nprinted in the Record as well as the letters from the military and \nveterans' associations.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                S. 2013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Military Coalition (TMC), a \n     consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and \n     veterans associations representing more than five million \n     current and former members of the uniformed services, plus \n     their families and survivors, applauds your leadership in \n     introducing comprehensive legislation aimed at correcting \n     serious inequities in the military health care benefit.\n       The Coalition believes enactment of such comprehensive \n     health care equity legislation is essential, not only to keep \n     commitments to long-serving members who sacrificed so much, \n     but also to rebuild the readiness of the current force. In \n     this regard, broken health care promises have undermined one \n     of the services' most potent recruiting resources--the \n     enthusiasm of retired members to recommend service careers \n     for their children and grandchildren and those of their \n     friends and neighbors. The broken promises also hurt current \n     force retention, as survey responses indicate that \n     reenlistment-eligible members are increasingly aware of how \n     poorly their predecessors are being treated.\n       We are grateful to you for introducing legislation that \n     would keep promises to those who have already served and \n     improve health care delivery to those currently in uniform. \n     You legislation would accomplish TMC's longstanding health \n     care equity goals by authorizing Medicare-eligibles an option \n     to choose between coverage under TRICARE Senior Prime or \n     TRICARE Senior Prime Remote, FEHBP-65, or DoD mail-order and \n     retail pharmacy programs,. Members who first entered service \n     before June 7, 1956 would be authorized to enroll themselves \n     and their family members in DoD managed health care programs \n     without any fees or copays. Active duty family members would \n     be fully covered by Tricare Prime, without any copays, \n     regardless of their duty location.\n       What you have proposed is the honorable thing to do, both \n     to ensure retired members receive long-promised and badly \n     needed health coverage in their senior years and to improve \n     quality of life and retention among current and future active \n     duty personnel. The Military Coalition looks forward to \n     working with you and your staff in seeking to bring these \n     important health care improvements to legislative reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition.\n       Air Force Association.\n       Air Force Sergeants Association.\n       Army Aviation Assn. of America.\n       Assn. of Military Surgeons of the United States.\n       Assn. of the US Army.\n       Commissioned Officers Assn. of the US Public Health \n     Service, Inc.\n       CWO & WO Assn.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Military and Veterans \n     Alliance representing over 3.5 million military retirees and \n     other veterans strongly supports your legislation, ``Honoring \n     Health Care Commitments to Service Members Past and Present \n     Act of 2000.''\n       The bill reflects your longstanding interest in improving \n     military health care and it offers superb options for the \n     entire military family, retirees, active duty, their families \n     and survivors. With the closure and realignment of over 100 \n     domestic military bases since 1988, hundreds of thousands of \n     military beneficiaries have been left with no Department of \n     Defense sponsored health care. This bill will repair the \n     broken health care promise to the nation's warriors and will \n     reassure those considering a military career that the nation \n     will honor its promises made to those who have served to keep \n     our country free.\n       We applaud your leadership in introducing this \n     comprehensive legislation, which would include Medicare \n     eligible retirees who desperately need medical care and are \n     the only Federal employees who lose their DoD sponsored \n     health care at age 65. The options offered are critical to \n     military beneficiaries and include priority access to \n     military treatment facilities and TRICARE Senior Prime \n     networks, expansion of the Base Realignment and Closure \n     pharmacy benefit, allows enrollment in the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program and establishes an accrual account \n     for military health care as is done for other Federal \n     retirees.\n       With additional base closings being recommended, each \n     option in this legislation is essential. One size will not \n     fit all beneficiaries and they need the maximum number of \n     options to meet the varying needs of active duty, retirees, \n     their families and survivors whatever their location or \n     medical condition.\n       The nation does not have a surplus until all obligations \n     are met.

I am confident your \n     legislative actions on this bill will have a long-term, \n     positive affect on the morale, welfare and retention of those \n     who now serve on active duty and will keep faith with those \n     now retired.\n       While I know other Members of the Senate are planning to \n     introduce similar legislation, your very comprehensive bill \n     has set a high standard for others to follow. I also am \n     pleased to see that the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) will make \n     military health care reform their number one personnel-\n     related issue this year. The majority of the concerns raised \n     by the JCS are pointedly addressed in your legislation.\n       We want to work with you to get this bill enacted into law. \n     Please let us know how we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas J. McKee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                           Uniformed Services,\n\n                                Springfield, VA, January 25, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Association for Uniformed \n     Services and The Society of Military Widows with membership \n     encompassing all grades, ranks, family members and survivors \n     of all seven uniformed services strongly support your \n     legislation, ``Honoring Health Care Commitments to Service \n     Members Past and Present Act of 2000.''\n       We applaud your leadership in introducing this most \n     comprehensive legislation which will improve access to health \n     care for every\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\n     category of military member, active duty, retired, family \n     member and survivor.\n       This bill will repair the broken health care promise to the \n     nation's warriors and will reassure those considering a \n     military career that the nation will honor its promises made \n     to those who have served to keep our country free. This \n     legislation includes Medicare eligible retirees who \n     desperately need medical care and are the only Federal \n     employees who lose their DoD sponsored health care at age 65. \n     The options offered are critical to military beneficiaries \n     and include priority access to military treatment facilities \n     and TRICARE Senior Prime networks, expansion of the Base \n     Realignment and Closure pharmacy benefit, allows enrollment \n     in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and \n     establishes an accrual account for military health care as is \n     done for other Federal retirees.\n       Each option in this legislation is essential. Beneficiaries \n     need the maximum number of choices to meet the varying needs \n     of active duty, retirees, their families and survivors \n     whatever their location or medical condition.\n       This bill reflects your longstanding commitment to a strong \n     national defense and the men and women who make that defense \n     possible. It also will meet a major obligation of the \n     Government and we thank you for introducing it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Richard D. Murray,\n\n                                        Major General, USAF (Ret),\n     President, NAUS and Administrator, SMW.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Monday, January 24, 2000.\n     Chris Paul,\n     c/o John S. McCain III.\n       I am delighted that Senator John McCain has signed on to \n     H.R. 2966. This is a giant step toward repairing the breach \n     of contract by this Administration.\n       Furthermore, the McCain bill goes further to improve the \n     health care delivery system for active duty servicemembers \n     and their families and also repairs the ``broken promise'' \n     for military retirees and their families.\n                                          Col.
