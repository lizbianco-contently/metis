Mr. President, this morning I want to talk about export \ncontrols. We all brag and are enthused about what is going on in the \nhigh-tech industry in America. There are stories we can tell of friends \nwho have made huge amounts of money in the new economy.\n  It is truly unbelievable and remarkable what we can do today. This \nlittle thing I carry in my pocket has all my addresses and phone \nnumbers. It has in it a dictionary. It has in it a calculator. It has \nin it the Old and New Testaments. It is unbelievable what is in this \nlittle, tiny thing I carry around in my pocket. With the flick of my \nhand, I can get anything I want out of this.\n  While we are talking a good game in Washington, we are not doing a \ngood job to support this strong economy and to make sure the high-tech \nindustry is allowed to continue.\n  We need to pass the Export Administration Act. We have not passed it. \nAs a result--and it will happen if we do not pass a law--this industry \nis going to go someplace else with the jobs. The Bureau of Export \nAdministration and the Defense Department are still conducting their \nbusiness as if we were in the cold war. The cold war is over, and we \nhave to really understand the economic and political world has changed \ndramatically.\n  Last year, Senators Gramm, Enzi, and Johnson, together with the \nleader, Senator Lott, agreed to move forward the Export Administration \nAct before the end of 1999. Each one of those Senators has lived up to \nwhat they said they would do. They have tried to move the bill forward. \nThe chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm, has worked very \nhard to move this legislation forward. Senators Enzi and Johnson have \nworked hard. The\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\nmajority leader has tried to move this legislation forward.\n  Frankly, the majority is unable to join together to allow us to move \nthis bill forward. It was on the floor for an hour or so 2 weeks ago. I \nrepeat, it is not for lack of trying by Senators Gramm, Enzi, and \nJohnson. They all worked in good faith and have tried to accommodate \neveryone.\n  When the bill passed out of the Banking Committee, it had the full \nsupport of the committee, while still protecting our national security. \nI am afraid, due to the serious disagreements within the majority, this \nbill will not come to the floor anytime soon. That is really too bad.\n  I have the greatest respect and admiration for the ability of Senator \nGramm of Texas to legislate. He has done many things from the time he \nwas in the House to his time in the Senate. I hope he can use some of \nthe experience and wisdom he has to move this forward. The majority \nmust move this bill. I do not believe we are living up to what is \nnecessary for this burgeoning economy if we do not move this \nlegislation.\n  A couple days ago, I met with members of the high-tech industry. They \nvoiced concerns about the need to update our export policies. They said \nit was one of their two or three top concerns and, frankly, a few \nMembers of the majority are stopping our Nation's progress in this \narea.\n  As with many issues, I often hear Congress will best serve the public \nand industry by doing nothing at all. That is simply not true. This is \none of the areas in which we can be of great help to the high-tech \ncommunity, in export controls. It is essential. There are currently a \nnumber of U.S. products that cannot compete with our foreign \ncompetitors due to export control limitations, not because of national \nsecurity interests but because of the slow review process in Congress. \nWe are trying to change that. That is what I am talking about.\n  In June of 1999 and January of this year, with the urging of the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, myself, and others, the \nadministration agreed to ease the level of controls which are referred \nto as MTOPS--million theoretical operations per second. MTOPS. We, as \nwell as those in the computer industry, were elated by the news.\n  However, as it stands now, there is a 6-month congressional review \nperiod for raising the level of MTOPS. The Banking Committee bill \nreduces the time from 180 days to 60 days. This is a step in the right \ndirection. But I, along with Senator Bennett of Utah, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Murray, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Boxer, believe a further reduction is \nnecessary; that is, to 30 days. There is an amendment pending, if this \nbill ever comes back up, to change it to 30 days. I am confident it \nwill be adopted overwhelmingly.\n  The reality of the situation is, by limiting American companies to \nthis degree, we are not only losing short-term market share but we are \nallowing foreign companies to make more money and, in turn, create \nbetter products in the future, to which we will never catch up. This \ncould lead to the eventual loss of our Nation's lead, and it is an \nabsolute lead in computer technology, which has propelled the United \nStates to the good economic standing we are experiencing today. The \nissue of updating our export controls is critical to our Nation's \neconomy and the success of our high-tech industry.\n\n  I urge the majority to move this bill forward, to allow the amendment \nprocess, and let's get on with it. The cold war is over. People must \nunderstand the cold war is over. If American companies can make more \nmoney overseas, they will simply invest more money into research and \ndevelopment there, and that is wrong.\n  I extend my appreciation to my friend from Colorado for allowing me \nto proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1620-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to proceed in morning \nbusiness for about 10 minutes. I would like to add my comments to those \nof my colleagues who spoke yesterday who were concerned about the \nrising cost of fuel. Many of my friends and colleagues have spoken to \nthe issue of our rising dependency on foreign oil. This morning, I \nwould like to take a little different perspective and talk a little bit \nabout how the crisis affects the backbone of American commerce, which \nis the backbone of the American trucking industry.\n  Over 95 percent of all commercial manufactured goods and agricultural \nproducts are shipped by truck at some point. Mr. President, 9.6 million \npeople have jobs directly or indirectly related to trucking. In \naddition, trucking contributes over 5 percent of America's gross \ndomestic product which is the equivalent of $272 billion in the economy \nevery single year. Over 6.7 billion tons of goods are shipped in this \nNation every year. Those are staggering numbers. I use them to \nemphasize the impact that trucks have in America.\n  I know the trucking life myself. I started driving when I was 21, \nwhen I got out of the service. I put myself through college by driving \nan 18-wheeler. Last year, I decided to renew my commercial driver's \nlicense in the State of Colorado and I attended a truck-driving school \nto do that. I have a small tractor trailer so I know firsthand the \nimpact of the increase of fuel. Paying the bill for 200 gallons of fuel \nin a truck is not like filling up the family car, and these long-line \ntrucks, by the way, fill up every day.\n  Last week, while the Senate was in recess, I spent the week making \ndeliveries in a truck along Colorado's Front Range. I did it so I could \nsee and hear firsthand what truckers, as well as shippers and other \nrelated businesses, are going through. At diners, gas stations, and \ndelivery points, they told me from their perspective it is much worse \nthan anyone in Washington may imagine.\n  While I was driving, I met a man named Wesley White from Oregon who \nsaid he was on his last run. He couldn't afford to continue fueling his \ntruck. He had been a policeman for over 20 years and at the end of his \npolice service he retired, took his pension, and bought a truck with \nthe intent of going into business for himself. But, this time around \nwhen he gets home he is going to park the truck for good. Without the \nincome from delivering goods, he is not going to be able to make his \ntruck payments. He will lose the business of the truck and he will also \nlose his pension which he used to buy the truck.\n  Wesly is not alone. Three times in the last 2 months, hundreds of \ntruckers from all over the United States have come to Washington to ask \nfor help. I attended the first rally in February, and I went to another \none yesterday. One thing I did learn, when these people come to \nWashington, they are not here to complain about profit margins or stock \nprices. They are here because their very livelihood is on the line.\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, I never met a trucker who wanted a \nhandout. They want a job, a fair shake, and fairness from Congress. One \ntrucker I met at the last rally I went to had a wife and two small \nchildren. The four of them were actually living in the sleeper of the \ntruck because the increased price of diesel fuel did not leave them \nenough money at the end of the month to even pay house rent.\n  Unfortunately, this administration has ignored the plight of these \nhard-working Americans. The administration has got us into this mess by \nthe total lack of any energy policy. They stand in the way of domestic \noil production, they refuse to release Federal fuel stockpiles to drive \nthe cost of fuel down, and they continually lock up public lands so we \ncannot explore for\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nnew resources. Now faced with skyrocketing diesel prices, they still do \nnothing of substance, instead they are hoping the OPEC oil ministers \nwill reverse their strategy to limit production and increase fuel \nprices.\n\n  We fought the gulf war, as you and I know, and this is how we get \nrepaid. In fact, in a rather strange twist of fate we are now also \ndependent on Iraqi oil.\n  Instead of increasing our own resources, the Secretary recently went \nto the Middle East, hat in hand, to beg for fuel. Now administration \nofficials are coming before Congress to propose we study alternative \nenergy resources. I have news for them. Trucks don't run on solar and \nthey don't run on wind; they run on diesel. Everything we buy, eat or \nwear is delivered on a truck. If they stop rolling, very simply this \nNation also comes to a stop.\n  Even if OPEC increases production, the effect on the American \nconsumers will be months away, we need immediate relief. In that \ncontext, I recently introduced S. 2161 entitled ``The American \nTransportation Recovery and Highway Trust Fund Protection Act of \n2000.'' This bill would temporarily suspend the Federal excise tax on \ndiesel fuel for 1 year, or until the price of crude oil is reduced to \nthe December 31, 1999, level. It would replace lost revenues with \nmoneys from the budget surplus in the general fund while protecting the \nhighway trust fund. The bill has bipartisan support, with 12 \ncosponsors. Even at that, we know it is only a short-term solution.\n  The real problem is our dependency on foreign oil. All the \nnegotiations this administration is doing to get OPEC to open its \nspigots is not more than a Band-Aid approach to the problem that will \ncontinually revisit us as long as we are dependent on foreign oil. The \nadministration has known this and the danger to our national security \nsince 1994. Senator Murkowski spoke to that yesterday.\n  It is unfortunate we, as a global superpower, are reduced to begging. \nMore forceful actions are needed and must be taken to expose the \nseverity of the problem and to address it now and in months to come. We \ncannot simply stand by and do nothing.\n  We can do better. We should be opening new oil fields. We should be \ndoing better incentive work to keep the stripper wells from closing, \nand certainly we should renew our efforts in oil shale and other \nrenewable fuels that can be turned into gasoline oil. Most of all, we \nhave to untether ourselves from Mideast oil.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a number of my Republican colleagues have \nspoken on the floor about the absence of an energy policy on the part \nof the Clinton-Gore administration. I believe that description is only \nhalf right. It is true the Clinton-Gore administration has no express \nenergy policy that would lead or even contribute to U.S. energy \nindependence. But the Clinton-Gore administration, on the other hand, \ndoes have a very significant implicit energy policy. Under that policy, \nit discourages or prohibits exploration for either oil or natural gas \nover extensive and increasingly large areas of our country.\n  Under that implicit energy policy, it proposes to reduce the amount \nof hydroelectric power we have and, in fact, to treat hydroelectric \npower as though it were not renewable.\n  Under that implicit energy policy, it has given us an increasing \ndependence each year on foreign sources for petroleum products, now at \n55 or 56 percent, and inevitably directed at 65 percent or two-thirds \nof that oil. Implicitly, it has given us an energy policy that resulted \nlast month in the largest single trade deficit in the history of the \nUnited States, due, in major part, to imports of petroleum products and \na trade deficit that will inevitably continue to increase.\n  So suddenly we do have a short-term explicit energy policy. It is to \nsend the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America, hat in \nhand, to countries in Latin America, in Southwest Asia, and now most \nrecently into Nigeria, to plead with these countries to lower the cost \nof the oil they send to us. This is a total abdication of the \nappropriate policy of an administration interested in the trade balance \nof the United States and in energy independence for the United States.\n  Mr. President, what is the answer to this question? Obviously, in the \nshort term our hands are relatively tied. We do, however, have one \noption in front of us which we can engage immediately that will provide \nat least modest relief to the American people during the course of this \nenergy crisis, and that is the elimination--whether permanent or \ntemporary--of the 4.3-cent motor vehicle fuel tax that was imposed by \nthe President and the Congress in 1993. I am convinced we should follow \nthat course of action. It is urgent for everyone. It is overwhelmingly \nurgent for the airlines of the United States that operate in a highly \ncompetitive atmosphere. They are being brutally punished, along with \ntheir passengers, with the increased airfare caused by that tax.\n\n  This is an option the Congress could and should take up and pass with \nextreme promptness. However, in the long run, the more important \nsolution is a longer-term solution. That solution lies on two sides: \nthe supply of energy for the people of the United States to use and the \nway in which we use that energy with appropriate conservation measures.\n  From the point of view of supply, when we deal with petroleum alone, \nwe should change policies which have discouraged production in the \nUnited States--policies of regulation and taxation and hostility that \nhave closed down existing sources of supply in various parts of the \nUnited States.\n  We should very seriously consider and move toward the creation of new \nsources of supply rather than cutting them off and prohibiting them, \nwhether they are in the North Slope of Alaska or in various parts of \nthe lower 48 States of the United States. We need to do this in order \nto have any leverage with the rest of the world with respect to the \nprices it charges us for petroleum supplies. This policy should apply \nnot only to petroleum but to natural gas as well.\n  Second, I am convinced we should continue to encourage and should \nencourage even more the production of at least supplements to our \npetroleum supply that are totally within the control of the United \nStates and that are renewable in nature. Ethanol perhaps ranks as No. 1 \non this particular list. It can be produced by American grain. It adds \nto our supply, and it is, of course, completely within our own control, \nand it enriches the people who provide these agricultural commodities.\n  Next, from the point of view of conservation, I point out the utter \nand insane folly of proposing to remove dams from the Snake River that \nproduce renewable and environmentally benign electric power. If those \ndams are removed, as many in the administration wish to do, we will end \nup putting 700,000 trucks on the roads of the northwestern part of the \nUnited States each and every year more than are on those roads at the \npresent time--major trucks that carry grain and other products for \nexport. The idea that we should be using all of that additional amount \nof diesel and gasoline fuel is simply, in my view, beyond reasonable \nconsideration.\n  Finally, I believe we have to aim at the way in which we as Americans \nuse power, and particularly motor vehicle fuels. Last July, for the \nfirst time in several years, this body was asked once again by me and \nby other Senators to go back to the successes of the 1970s and to \nreestablish a Government program to improve the energy efficiency of \nour automobiles and small trucks, the so-called CAFE standards. In the \n1970s, this was one of the most successful programs--the single most \nsuccessful governmental program--in history. We came close to doubling \nthe average mileage of our passenger automobiles during that period of \ntime. This crisis would not be a crisis; it would be an unmitigated \ndisaster had those who perceived it not established and implemented \nthose policies of the 1970s. But in the early 1980s, we abandoned that \npolicy, and we have abandoned it ever since.\n  We have even gone so far in this body and in the other body to \nprohibit any study of increasing CAFE standards, as far as small trucks \nare concerned, and even automobiles at any time in the immediate \nfuture. When we voted on that proposition last July, 40 Members of this \nbody--not a majority but a very substantial minority--voted in favor of \nit before there was a crisis. Now the\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\ncrisis is upon us. Now we have people wondering why it is our small \ntrucks and SUVs are so energy inefficient. People are being punished by \nthe lack of foresight of this administration and having the cost of \noperating those vehicles increase exponentially, and it is often not \naffordable.\n  I am convinced that in addition to providing a greater degree of \nsupply from sources within the United States we must, once again, focus \non making our use of that energy and particularly making petroleum \nenergy more efficient. The best way we can do that is by going back to \nthe CAFE standard regime we had a generation ago in the United States \nand doing what is technologically quite feasible to do by increasing \nanywhere from 20 to 50 percent the efficiency of the engines that use \npetroleum products. That would be a true energy policy--an energy \npolicy both for the short term and the long term, a policy which is \ntotally and completely lacking in the Clinton-Gore administration at \nthe present time.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join many of my colleagues \nin expressing my deepest concern about the problem concerning energy \nand the cost of energy to many working Americans, and certainly to my \nconstituents in the State of Maine.\n  We have been plagued by a significant surge in increases at the \npump--certainly during the wintertime in the State of Maine concerning \noil prices, home heating oil prices that more than doubled within a 1-\nmonth period, not to mention the gasoline prices we are seeing and the \ntremendous spike in those prices, as well. And, even according to the \nDepartment of Energy's own information, we will not expect an abatement \nof those prices by the end of the year. In fact, we can expect to have \ncontinuously high prices in terms of gasoline.\n  We know that the OPEC countries are going to be meeting on Monday, 4 \ndays from now. We hope the administration and the Congress sends an \nunequivocal message that they rethink their unconscionable policy of \nkeeping a very low level of production when it comes to petroleum \nproducts.\n  We know that a year ago in October they made a decision to limit \nproduction when it came to oil. The administration was well aware of \nthe fact that the OPEC cartel had made a deliberate and concerted \ndecision to limit the production of oil. Even last fall, the Department \nof Energy's own report indicated that we could expect a 40-percent rise \nin home heating oil prices, and if it was a severe winter, a 30-percent \nrise in home heating oil prices. That was more than a 70-percent \nincrease projected by the Department of Energy with respect to home \nheating oil prices. That was anticipated by our own Department of \nEnergy last October.\n  In fact, my constituents in the State of Maine faced a 100-percent \nincrease in home heating oil prices--a 100-percent increase. Yet we had \nsilence from the administration--silence when the OPEC cartel made this \ndecision to limit the production of oil without any apparent reason, \nand without any rationale.\n  Then the Department of Energy anticipated we could have up toward a \n70-percent increase in home heating oil prices. In fact, we face a 100-\npercent increase. Yet there was a deafening silence from the \nadministration when it came to the types of policies that could \nmitigate the burden the surging prices imposed on working Americans.\n  Here we are today anticipating what might or might not happen on \nMonday, the kinds of decisions made by the OPEC cartel. I hope the \nadministration is working very hard to send a strong message that the \nOPEC cartel should reconsider its policy. Its policy is all the more \nshocking when we consider the men and women all across this country who \ndefended the freedom of democracy for countries such as Kuwait and \nSaudi Arabia, that the United States lost 147 American lives, 458 were \nwounded, and 23 were taken prisoner in the struggle during the Persian \nGulf war.\n  I think it is entirely appropriate for Congress and the \nadministration to press OPEC in terms of the kind of decision they \nshould be making on Monday. The administration also should consider \npredicating foreign assistance to some of these foreign countries that \nare part of the decisionmaking of the OPEC cartel, such as Mexico, whom \nwe bailed out 5 years ago when it came to the peso crisis to the tune \nof $13.5 billion. We were prepared to bail them out up to the tune of \n$20 billion to ease the economic hardship imposed on their people. It \nis no different now.\n  Or Indonesia and Nigeria, for whom the President is proposing $256 \nmillion in economic assistance because these are countries in \ntransition. Again, our assistance should be predicated on their \ncooperation.\n  Those are the kinds of issues we must confront. In the short term, we \nhave to deal with the reality of what is happening at the gas pump. I \nhope Congress will give consideration to recommendations that will be \nmade by many who have been working on this issue to suspend the 4.3-\ncent gas tax which many Members opposed back in 1993 because we didn't \nthink this was a hardship we should impose on the American people.\n  Beyond that, if the price of gasoline is going to surge upwards of \n$2--which it is already doing in California--we should clearly suspend \nall of the taxes on diesel and gasoline because it is that important to \nour economy and to Americans in all parts of the country, not just in \none region; it will be in all regions.\n  When the Department of Energy says it would undoubtedly be too late \nto deflect domestic gasoline prices on their way to record nominal \nlevels and may be too little to reduce prices much by the end of the \nyear 2000, clearly we have something to be concerned about.\n  No one really knows even if OPEC will make a positive decision on \nMonday. I am concerned about the decision they will make on Monday or \nif they decide to have other meetings.\n  What does that all mean if this does not translate into lower prices \nat the gas pump this summer? We clearly will have problems. I know my \nState will have problems. It is a tourist State. We rely on tourism. It \nis the second biggest industry in the State of Maine.\n  I think we have to be prepared. I hope we do fashion a policy that is \ncontingent upon what the price might be, irrespective of the decision \nmade by OPEC. That is a decision the administration is not prepared to \nmake, and they are not even prepared to take a step forward in any \ndirection. The President announced last week: We will do a reserve in \nthe Northeast but we need to do an environmental impact study; it needs \nlegislation from Congress.\n  Senator Dodd introduced legislation in which many joined because we \nthink it is a prudent policy to set up a reserve in the Northeast to \nmitigate the impact of high price increases or an interruption in oil \nsupply. What is so difficult about that? The President can't even take \nthat step. He says there are a lot of contingencies involved. In \neffect, we don't have anything from this administration to address this \nproblem. We don't have an energy policy.\n\n  Congress is going to have to take the concerted steps necessary to \naddress these problems in the short term to be sure these are short-\nterm solutions. We also have to look at the long term. I did support \nthe CAFE standard issue that Senator Gorton addressed today as well. \nObviously, the costs have been significant to this country in terms of \ntransportation. We need to get better fuel efficiency with respect to \nautomobiles and minivans.\n  We also should look at providing some incentives for the marginal \nproducers in this country, the small producers, about which Senator \nHutchison has also talked, as well. Congress will have to take the lead \nbecause it is clear that this administration is not intending to in any \nrespect. Beyond anticipating we will have this problem this year, the \nadministration has been virtually silent. I hope they make the message \nvery clear to the OPEC countries about how important their decision \nwill be on Monday.\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\n  Beyond that, we also have to be prepared for any contingencies in the \nfuture that these prices might not decline in the short term or for the \nreminder of this year. Frankly, it is not just my word, it is the word \nof the Department of Energy.\n  Again, I hope we will be taking actions in the next few days \nirrespective of what the decision might be from the OPEC nations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, as has the \nSenator from Maine, to speak about the energy crisis our country finds \nitself in. Let me use those words again: energy crisis.\n  A week and a half ago, Senator Snowe was before my subcommittee \ntestifying on some key legislation she has introduced. The Senator from \nMaine recognizes the phenomenal impact high energy costs have on her \nState. Whether it is home heating or the transportation systems that \ndrive her industries, she has recognized it clearly and early on \nannounced to this administration there was a problem coming and \nencouraged them to change their policy. Yet they have done nothing.\n  As I listened to the Senator from Maine this morning, she spoke very \nclearly about what this country needs to do. I strongly support the \nwords she has stated for the Record.\n  When the Clinton-Gore administration came to town in 1993, it \nannounced its intent to drastically alter the way the Nation used \nenergy, especially fossil fuels. Remember, briefly, the President and \nthe Vice President determined that through the use of a broad-based Btu \ntax, they would drive us away from our most abundant and economical \nfuels to a renewable solar wind or biomass system. The objective has \nremained a hallmark of this administration's energy policy. That is all \nthey have wanted to talk about until now.\n  Their policy now is to send the Secretary of Energy abroad with a tin \ncup, begging at the wells of foreign energy producers, asking them to \nplease turn on their tap. We will know next Monday whether the begging \nof Bill Richardson and the energy policy of this administration has \nworked.\n  President Clinton promised early when he came to town that the tax he \nproposed, $72 billion over 5 years, was going to be fair, it was going \nto be healthful, it was going to force down dependency on foreign oil, \nand do the right things for consumers. In fact, it would have unfairly \npunished energy-intensive States such as mine, Western States where \ntransportation needs and movements spread across broad expanses in \nagricultural States such as mine. The American Petroleum Insurance \nInstitute and the National Association of Manufacturers predicted the \ntax would hurt exports, reduce GDP in this country by $38 billion, and \ndestroy some 700,000 jobs. Yet the administration wouldn't listen. They \ndrove on, pushing the tax issue.\n\n  Clinton and Gore claimed the tax was needed to balance the budget and \nfund large new spending programs to offset the negative impact of the \ntax. They also claimed the use of crude oil imports would fall \ndramatically, by 400,000 barrels a day.\n  At that time, DOE's own projections predicted the tax would shave oil \nimport growth by less than one-tenth after 10 years. DOE predicted by \nthe year 2000, Americans would depend on foreign oil for three-fifths \nof their total crude oil requirements.\n  The American Petroleum Institute testified before the Energy \nCommittee on which I sit. It said:\n\n       . . . even if imports were to fall by the full 400,000 \n     barrels a day claimed by the administration, the cost of $34 \n     billion in lost GDP is excessive relative to other \n     alternatives for improving energy security. Using the \n     administration's optimistic predictions, the cost of the Btu \n     tax works out to be about $230 a barrel.\n\n  That is right, $230 a barrel. In the end, Congress refused. Thank \ngoodness we listened to the experts. We didn't listen to the politics \nof the Clinton-Gore administration, and we said no. Hopefully, in the \nnext few days we will also reverse something that was largely a \nClinton-Gore initiative and that was the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax \nthat our consumers are now paying.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration's obsession with the use of fossil \nfuel reduction has actually put us in the position we find ourselves \ntoday. What does our President say? On March 7 of this year, he said:\n\n       Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop to $10 \n     or $12 again because that . . . takes our mind off the \n     business of . . . alternative fuels, energy conservation, \n     reducing the impact of all of this on global warming.\n\n  Mr. President, we should not take our minds off energy conservation. \nThat is good policy. We should not take our minds off alternative \nfuels, that is also good policy. But saying you are going to tax \nhydrocarbons out of existence and now finding this Nation pushing \nitself into an inflationary mode, finding our costs going up \ndramatically because of your policies, it was wrongheaded then and it \nis wrongheaded now. And we know it.\n  What has happened since 1993? Domestic oil production is down 17 \npercent. Domestic crude oil consumption is up 14 percent. Dependence on \nforeign oil sources of crude oil has risen to 56 percent of our total \ncrude requirements.\n  In 1973, during the Arab oil embargo, our dependence on foreign crude \nwas 36 percent of our crude oil requirement.\n  Iraq is our fastest growing source for U.S. crude imports, about \n700,000 barrels a day. I have one thing to say to the President: Shame \non you. Shame on you for the absence of policy and the clear knowledge \nthat you had, that all of us had, that this kind of dependency would \nultimately result if we did not push and we did not drive toward a more \neffective domestic policy to increase production and find all the other \neffective conservation uses we could find.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration, while making much of the increase in \nefficiency, greater use of renewables from biomass, and other things, \nignores the very fundamental fact that a large part of our energy use \ncannot be addressed by these measures. Sure, it is an important part of \nthe blend but a very small percentage of what is absolutely and \nnecessarily needed.\n\n  Of course, those of us who come from agriculture recognize the \nimportance of crude oil feed stocks to the chemical industry and the \nproducts they produce, which results in the high quality of agriculture \nproduction in our country. The administration fails to encourage \ndomestic oil production and the production of coal and natural gas that \nnow leads us to this point.\n  The administration has refused to acknowledge the vast reserves of \noil and gas offshore, in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain overthrust area. \nOf course, we, the consumers, are now paying the price.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration recently announced a ban on future \nexploration on most of the Federal Outer Continental Shelf until the \nyear 2012. Can you imagine that? Here we are, increasingly dependent on \nforeign sources, and the President turns his back on some of the \nlargest reserves left in this country to be explored by some of the \nfinest technology in environmentally sensitive ways that we now know, \nto bring oil into production in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  In 1996, the administration resorted to the use of the Antiquities \nAct to lock up 23 billion tons of mineable low-sulfur, high-quality \ncoal in Utah. The story goes on and on.\n  I would argue the Clinton-Gore administration has acted in other ways \ndesigned to force us away from the use of all of these resources that \nare so abundant and so available to us and wise for us to use. At the \npresent rate, we are now demonstrating our unwillingness to produce at \nthe local, national level. We will be 56-percent dependent, moving into \n60-percent dependent in very short order.\n  The U.S. Forest Service has issued road construction policies that \nare designed to restrict the energy industry's ability to explore for \noil and gas on Forest Service lands.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has vetoed legislation that would \nhave opened the coastal plain of the remote Alaska National Wildlife \nReserve denying the Nation access to an estimated 16 billion barrels of \ndomestic crude oil.\n  The administration has ignored a report prepared by the National \nPetroleum Council, requested by the Energy Secretary, explaining how \nthe Nation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas \nresources from\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\nabout 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 trillion cubic \nfeet per year over the next 10 to 12 years.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has shown little interest in solving \nour domestic energy problems until now as foreign oil producers have \nforced crude oil prices to over $30 per barrel and gasoline prices to \nalmost $2 per gallon--double prices of only little more than a year \nago.\n  I would argue that the Clinton-Gore administration has acted in other \nways designed to force us away from the use of readily available, \nrelatively inexpensive fossil fuels. It has chosen especially to vilify \nand deny the use of our most abundant national energy resource--coal. \nMy distinguished friend from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd spoke \neloquently yesterday on this subject and I want to add a few thoughts \nto his.\n  The U.S. has the world's largest demonstrated coal reserve base and \naccounts for more than 90 percent of our total fossil energy reserves.\n  At present rates of recovery and use, U.S. reserves will last more \nthan 270 years.\n  Coal is used to generate over 56 percent of our electricity supply--\nand about 88 percent of the Midwest's electricity needs.\n  Coal use for electric power has risen more than 250 percent since \n1970 while sulfur dioxide emissions have decreased to 21 percent below \n1970 levels and introduction of new cleaner coal combustion \ntechnologies will continue to push emissions of all types down.\n  Electricity from hydro represents about 10 to 12 percent of our \nelectricity needs.\n  Nuclear powerplants meet about 20 percent of our total electricity \ndemand.\n  Yet the Clinton-Gore administration takes a dim view of these sources \nand has taken steps to reduce their use.\n  In November 1999 the Environmental Protection Agency sued several \ncoal burning utilities claiming they made major modifications to their \nfacilities without applying for New Source Review permits. Utilities \nmaintain that the modifications fall within the ``routine maintenance'' \nexception to the new source rule, and that EPA had routinely approved \nsuch actions in the past.\n  EPA is discussing the notion that new source review should include \n``voluntary'' regulation of CO2--which is not a poisonous \ngas and which is not regulated by any part of the Clear Air Act.\n  EPA recently changed the toxics release inventory to require electric \nutilities to report chemical release data. The level at which reporting \nis required for Mercury was lowered by an order of magnitude. In making \nthese changes EPA presented no studies or supporting rationale for why \nnearby communities should suddenly be concerned about such releases. \nNevertheless, the reports will be widely published thereby placing \nutilities at the top of the list of ``dirty'' facilities.\n  In 1993, EPA concluded that coal combustion wastes (fly ash, bottom \nash, slag waste, and other combustion products) from electric utility \ngeneration do not warrant hazardous waste regulation. EPA appears now \nto be prepared to reverse an EPA staff decision that coal combustion \nwastes do not warrant regulation as ``hazardous.''\n  In 1998, EPA issued revised Nitrogen Oxides New Source Performance \nStandards for all new and existing utility and industrial boilers. It \nbased its standard on a single, very expensive control system \nregardless of boiler and fuel type.\n  Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has talked openly about ``tearing \ndown dams'' in the West to restore habitat for fish, ignoring the power \nand transportation benefits they provide. And, the administration is \nimposing new, often impossible criteria that must be met before federal \nlicenses can be reissued. Many existing hydro projects will seek \nrelicensing over the next several decades.\n  Finally, the Clinton-Gore administration continues to threaten veto \nof legislation designed to create a permanent nuclear waste storage \nfacility and which fulfills a longstanding promise by the federal \ngovernment to create such a facility. Without a federal storage \nfacility, U.S. nuclear generating stations, which are running out of \non-site storage capacity may be forced to shut down their operations.\n  There are too many more examples of the Clinton-Gore administration's \nfailure to produce a coherent, balanced national energy plan. It almost \nseems they are trying to create crisis after crisis in the hope that a \nmagical solution will rise from the chaos--fat chance. Solving these \nproblems requires tough choices and I suggest that we begin now by \npursuing a number of short to long term objectives.\n  We should work with our Western Hemisphere neighbors to help them \nincrease their crude oil production.\n  We should provide relief to consumers by cutting taxes on fuels \nderived from crude oil, such as the 4.3-cents a gallon tax and the 24-\ncent a gallon tax on highway diesel fuel and taxes on fuels for air, \nrail and barge transportation.\n  We need to step away from punitive, command and control environmental \nregulations and move toward performance based regulatory concepts that \noffer the regulated community opportunities to find flexible approaches \nto reducing emissions of legally regulated contaminants.\n  Finally, we need to face up to the fact that we are part of the \nproblem. Our unwillingness to develop our own abundant oil, gas and \ncoal resources dooms us to greater dependence on foreign sources, \nespecially for crude oil. We must make the conscious choice to \ncarefully find and develop our resources while protecting our \nenvironment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1624-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1624-S1625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CROP INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2251, the Risk \nManagement for the 21st Century Act regarding crop insurance reform, I \nam an original co-sponsor of this important legislation and I thank my \ncolleagues Senators Bob Kerrey and Pat Roberts for their leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Crop insurance reform has been a major, bipartisan legislative effort \nfor farm state Senators. Reforming crop insurance is vital to America's \nagricultural producers and to the rural economies in all of our ag-\nproducing states. We need to pass this legislation today.\n  The need for crop insurance reform has been a common denominator in \nmy conversations with all of Nebraska's agricultural producers and \nagribusinesses, as I am sure it has for my colleagues as they have \nspoken with ag-producers across the country.\n  Every commodity organization and farm group that I've spoken with has \nurged Congress to reform and improve America's crop insurance programs.\n  Why is crop insurance important? By increasing and expanding private \ncrop insurance coverage, ag producers can make long-term market \ndecisions without being devastated by short-term economic downturns.\n  If we can assist in making crop insurance--an important risk \nmanagement tool--more affordable and expansive, we will help producers \nweather the bad times.\n  S. 2251 makes a number of important changes to the crop insurance \nsystem that will benefit America's ag producers.\n  This bill establishes a new premium assistance formula to encourage \nproducers to increase their crop insurance coverage by making higher \nlevels of coverage more affordable, and increases the level of coverage \nfarmers can purchase.\n  It will ease actual ``production history'' rules so that farmer's \ninsurance coverage is less likely to be artificially depressed by \nsuccessive years of bad weather.\n  This legislation will reduce the potential for insurance fraud and \nabuse with strong program compliance provisions.\n  It includes new pilot projects for livestock insurance, specialty \ncrops, and coverage reinsured through futures markets.\n  By passing the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act we can help \neliminate some of the uncertainty and instability in farm operations, \nthus allowing farmers to plan for the long-term.\n  Additionally, this legislation should help Congress and the American \ntaxpayers reduce the need for disaster-assistance packages for our ag \nproducers, and the costs associated with him.\n  If we can help provide farmers with the management tools they need to \nplan for their future, there will be less of a need to rely on future \nemergency supplemental appropriations bills when bad times strike.\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\n  I again thank Senators Roberts and Kerrey and their staffs for their \ndiligence in spearheading crop insurance reform, and acknowledge Senate \nAgriculture Chairman Lugar for his leadership in getting this bill out \nof the Agriculture Committee and onto the floor of the Senate for a \nvote.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I sat through several days \nof discussion on education policy as we marked up the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee.\n  Just last week, I went home and visited schools across Washington \nState and met with administrators, teachers, parents, and students.\n  The discussions we had here in Congress and the discussions I had in \nthose classrooms could not have been more different. No wonder so many \neducators and parents are frustrated with Congress. Too often, what \nthey hear from Congress has nothing to do with the real challenges they \nare facing.\n  While some of my colleagues were pushing their agenda of block grants \nand vouchers here in Washington, DC, the teachers I met with in \nWashington State were concerned about their ability to teach the basics \nand maintain discipline in their classrooms.\n  While these same colleagues of mine sought to diminish \naccountability, the parents I met with want us to insist that we have \nthe highest possible academic standards in safe and modern classrooms.\n  While these same colleagues of mine were figuring out ways to shift \nresources away from meeting specific needs, the students I met with \nwere wondering when there would be enough fully qualified teachers in \ntheir classrooms to help them get the individual attention they need to \nsucceed.\n  Those parents, teachers, and students were shocked when I told them \nthat my amendment to guarantee money for smaller class sizes was \nrejected by members of the Education Committee. It just does not make \nsense to them.\n  I wish that when we discussed ESEA, we had a few of those teachers \nsitting in the room with us. And whenever the discussion drifted to \nthings that are far from the realities in today's classrooms, I wish \nthose teachers were here to stand up and bring the discussion back to \nthe real challenges our students face, day-in and day-out.\n  Today, too many teachers see overcrowded classrooms, children who \narrive with basic needs unmet, jammed hallways, and tougher curriculum \nrequirements.\n  Today, too many parents see teachers who are overworked--teachers who \nspend so much time on discipline it is hard for them to give every \nchild the time and attention they need.\n  Today, too many students feel their needs are lost and their \neducation is not a priority. All of us want to make sure that schools \nare safe centers of learning.\n  To reach their potential, our kids need real help now. They need the \ncommon sense solutions that we know can help them succeed.\n  It is simple. We know what works in education. We know what it takes \nto help children reach their potential. It is not a great mystery. \nThese are the things that years of research have shown us are \neffective. They are the things that parents, teachers, and community \nleaders know make a difference. To show how simple this is, I have \nlisted those ingredients we know work.\n  I am proud that Democrats are focusing on results with a commonsense \nagenda. We know that if we want children to succeed in school, they \nneed a highly-motivated, fully-qualified teacher. We know they need a \nsafe and modern classroom. We know they need a small, uncrowded class \nin which to learn. We know they need a focus on the basics. We know \nthey need high standards and discipline. We know they need support from \nfamily and adults. We know they need resources for the classroom.\n  These are the commonsense policies that serve America's children--the \npolicies that improve education and get results.\n  But unfortunately, this Congress is ignoring these proven approaches. \nThey are ignoring what works. They do not want money to be targeted to \nthese essential ingredients. They do not want us to focus on making \nsure that every school has guaranteed resources in each of these areas.\n  Many of us want to use these key ingredients to make the best schools \npossible. We want to guarantee that every school has the resources it \nneeds. We want to change our schools--for the better--so we can get the \nresults parents, students, and teachers are demanding.\n  Some have proposed block grants as the cure-all for education. Today, \nour nation's education policy guarantees that specific resources will \nbe targeted to meeting specific needs. That is how responsible \nbudgeting is done. That is how we ensure accountability.\n  But this Congress is working toward eliminating those guarantees. \nThey do not want money to be guaranteed for reducing class sizes or for \ntechnology training for teachers or for modernizing schools. They want \nto eliminate all of those guarantees, create a pot of money, and give \nit to the States.\n  One teacher asked me: ``Are there any studies that show that giving \nall the money to States in block grants actually improves education?''\n  Of course not. In fact, 35 years ago the American people made the \nnational Government a partner in education because they realized that \nState and local governments cannot do it all on their own.\n  Public schools are one of the foundations upon which our democracy is \nbuilt, and we need to do a better job of helping them perform at the \nhighest levels.\n  Most disconcerting about these proposals for block grants is they are \nsimply a blank check policy that will diminish the guarantee that \neducation resources go to the students who need them most. Money that \ncurrently goes to hiring and training teachers and helping students \nwith special needs--under these proposals could be used ``for any \neducation purposes''--anything from building a new lockerroom to \nredecorating office space.\n  In response to many who want a better education, some have proposed \nvouchers. What will that do? Without a doubt, it will drain scarce \ndollars away from public schools where 90 percent of America's children \nare trying to learn. Vouchers plans shift taxpayer dollars away from \npublic schools to private and religious schools.\n  One parent in Washington told me last week: ``I don't want you to \ngive me a few hundred dollars to send my kid to another school. I want \nyou to make my school work better.''\n  The real question, and the one we are failing to answer, is: How can \nwe work in partnership with states, educators, and parents to make sure \nthat every student gets the things they need to reach their potential?\n  Many of my colleagues are asking the wrong question. they ask: How \ncan the Federal Government's role in education be eliminated? They are \ntalking about process, when we should be focusing on results.\n  This Congress should be asking: How can the Federal Government \nsupport local schools? How can we meet our national education \npriorities, like making sure every child can read, write, and use a \ncomputer?\n  And how can we help school districts do the things that are hardest \nfor them to do, like hiring new teachers and building new schools?\n  I am afraid some of my colleagues aren't looking for ways to answer \nthese questions. I am afraid they just want to gut our national \neducation partnership.\n  In this country, we already have local control over education. State \nand\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\nlocal school districts set the curriculum. They hire the staff. States \nset standards and certify teachers. States and localities raise and \nspend 93 percent of all education funding. A lack of local control is \nnot the problem. It is a lack of sufficient support and resources.\n  States, school districts, parents, and teachers are demanding that \nwe, at the Federal level, work in partnership to ensure our kids get a \ngood education. What matters to parents is that their kids get the best \neducation possible. Parents don't care how the workload is divided. \nThey care about results. And Democrats are focused on results.\n  One of the problems with block grants is that--in the budgeting \nprocess--they always end up getting cut because those dollars are not \nlonger tired to a specific need. With block grants, our kids end up \nwith fewer educational resources than they had before. In fact, we are \nalready seeing a move underway to give our students fewer resources.\n  The Republican budget plan passed out of the House could jeopardize \nour ability to meet the needs in America's schools. Their plan could \njeopardize our ability to keep hiring new teachers to make classrooms \nless crowded. They could jeopardize our ability to provide afterschool \nprograms, to ensure safe and drug-free schools, to modernize old \nschools, and to build new ones.\n  Their plan could result in having $2.6 billion less for education \nthan the President has requested. We shouldn't be shortchanging \nAmerica's students, but I am concerned that is what the House \nRepublican budget plan would do.\n  In fact, according the Congressional Budget Office, the Republican \nbudget plan doesn't even keep up with inflation for key domestic \ninvestments, like education.\n  Parents, teachers and students in my home State--and across the \ncountry--are asking for help in education.\n  They want us to work in partnership with them to help their children \nreach their potential.\n  They want us to support the commonsense solutions that produce real \nresults for our students.\n  And when they hear Members of this Congress talking about things that \nreally don't make a difference in the classroom, they get pretty \nfrustrated.\n  After meeting with and listening to so many frustrated parents and \neducators, I have come to the floor today to carry their message.\n  They want us to: Focus on what works. They want us to support the \nthings that make a difference for children in the classroom. And they \nwant us to work together in partnership with State and local educators \nto help children learn to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\n  I urge my colleagues to hear these calls loud and clear, to respond \nby bringing the debate here in Congress back to the realities that \nteachers, students and parents see in their classrooms every day across \nthis country, and to pass a budget that follows our recipe for success \nby investing in the resources that every student needs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1626-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1626-S1627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the pending amendment, which, as \nI understand, is the Wellstone amendment, a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution commending the many farmers--the thousands of farmers and \ntheir families--who came to Washington over the last few days to rally \nin support of what I would call a sensible, sane, rational, and \ncompassionate farm program that would support our farm families \nthroughout this country.\n  We had farmers from every State. In fact, I listened to one farmer \nfrom Alaska who was here, a dairy farmer. So the rally actually was a \nnational rally, one that encompassed all parts of our country.\n  What I heard, in talking to these farm families from across America, \nwas a plaintive cry for us to have a farm policy in America that \nrecognizes the essential worth, the essential importance, of having a \nstructure of agriculture based upon family farming--widely dispersed, \nbroadly based--rather than having a vertical structure characterized by \nconglomerates and huge vertical integrators that does not respond to \nthe needs of local areas.\n  What these farm families were expressing was a frustration, a \nfrustration borne out of their life experiences in knowing that what \nthey have done and what their parents and grandparents before them had \ndone in agriculture, knowing that this had benefited not only our \nNation but had benefited the areas in which they lived. Because we had \na lot of farm families in rural areas, we had prosperous small towns \nand communities. We had businesses in those communities. We had good \nschools and churches. We had a sense of community in rural America. Out \nof this structure in rural America came the sons and daughters who went \non to colleges--land grant colleges, many of them--and who then became \nsome of the great leaders of our country.\n  I need not remind those in this body of some of the great leaders in \nour own Senate who came from rural America, small towns and \ncommunities, farm families. I just saw our distinguished former \nmajority and minority leader, Senator Dole, come across the floor. He \ncomes from Russell, KS. You can't find a much smaller town than that. \nHe has dedicated his life to public service. He is a great friend of \nmine and was a great leader in the Senate. I wonder how many more \nleaders we will get in this country coming from small towns and rural \nAmerica when all these small towns have dried up, when there are no \nmore opportunities there.\n  I think what I heard at this rally was this frustration. The farm \nfamilies know what they have contributed to the well-being of our \ncountry and our communities. Yet now they are being decimated. They see \ntheir neighbors, one by one, being driven off the farm because of the \neconomic structure we have in America. In 1998, two Iowa State \nUniversity economists reported that as many as one-third of Iowa \nfarmers would face serious financial problems if the farm economy did \nnot improve. They would either restructure their operations or go out \nof business entirely. That was one out of three estimated in 1998.\n  Earlier this year, an updated study by the same economists concluded \nthat as many as half of all Iowa farmers are classified as financially \nweak or severely stressed; that is, every other farmer in the State of \nIowa is in real trouble.\n  A couple of farm families spoke to me when I was at the rally on the \nMall in response to something I had heard, saying that their churches, \nwhich used to be packed on Sunday morning--all the pews were filled--\nare now half empty, that they can't even afford to pay their own \nminister any longer. They have a circuit rider who rides to three or \nfour churches a week. So they lack that kind of pastoral counseling \nupon which families have come to rely. Indeed, we are seeing a \nwholesale selling out of our farm and ranch families and our rural \ncommunities. The stakes are very high.\n  I heard this great frustration from all of these farm families. Their \nquestion to us is: What are you going to do? Is this just some \ninevitable, invisible hand that is doing this, or are the laws of our \ncountry structured so they discriminate unfairly against family \nfarmers? I think the latter is true. There is no invisible handwriting \nthat farm families are a relic of the past, that our farmers have to \nget bigger and bigger and bigger, that our small towns have to dry up. \nI think it is because of policies we set in the Congress. I think those \npolicies have to change.\n  The farm bill we have now, the so-called Freedom to Farm bill, has \nbeen a wreck. There is only one good part of it, and that is planting \nflexibility. That is all. The rest of it has been a wreck. The Federal \nGovernment has sent out over $15 billion in emergency money in the past \n2 years. That is not counting what we sent out under the regular farm \nbill itself. Of course, that money was needed by the bankers, by the \nchemical and fertilizer dealers, by the repair shops, by the fuel \ndealers, by the landlords. A lot of that money went out not to save the \nfarmer but to save\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\nthe very people about whom I speak: the bankers, chemical and \nfertilizer dealers, repair shops, and the landlords. In fact, a lot of \nthat money went to farmers who didn't even plant a crop last year. Tell \nme if that makes sense.\n\n  The bailout packages we have had over the last couple of years have \nbeen bailouts for the Freedom to Farm bill and not for our farmers. \nThat was a record amount of money we sent out last year. What did it \nget us? Is the farm economy any healthier? No.\n  USDA tells us if we don't pass an emergency package again this year, \nnet farm income is going to fall by 17 percent compared to last year. \nTell me what farmer can afford to take another 17-percent cut. That is \nnet farming; that is not gross. That is what they used to clothe and \nfeed their families and buy some new equipment, pay the mortgage, and \nhopefully set aside a little bit for the children to go to college.\n  So it looks as if we will have to come up with another emergency \npackage again this year. That is not a farm program. That is not a farm \nbill. That is lurching from one emergency to the next. Again, our \nfarmers are the victims.\n  I was hopeful that this year we could have some hearings and a debate \non the Freedom to Farm bill to see what changes we could make in it to \nget to a rational system of farm supports, a farm program combining \nconservation, storage payments, better loan rates, some shorter term \nset-aside programs, so we would have a balanced package, the prices at \nthe farmgate would be higher, so the farmers could get their money from \nthe marketplace and not from a Government paycheck. That is the debate \nwe need. Yet that debate is not going to happen this year. We are not \ngoing to have the hearings, and we will not have the debate.\n  Quite frankly, the frustration felt by most of these farm families is \ngoing to continue to fester and grow. I think we will see even more \nfrustration in rural America because we lack the will and, quite \nfrankly, we lack the leadership to redress the failed Freedom to Farm \nbill.\n  I compliment the Senator from Minnesota for his sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I believe the farm families who took money out of their own \npockets, which they could ill afford to do--they got on buses; they \ncame here and endured rain and cold weather, slogging around in mud and \nwater to make their case known to Congress, exercising their first \namendment rights to petition their Government--did what is in the best \ntradition of America. I hope their voices and the frustration we heard \nwill not go unheeded. I hope we can understand that we have an \nobligation in this body and in the other body to address the plight of \nwhat is happening in rural America today.\n  I come from a small town of 150 people. I remember growing up as a \nchild when we had an elevator, we had a grocery store, a hardware \nstore, and a small implement dealer. They are all gone now. They are \nall gone. I am not saying we have to save every town of 150 people. But \nit is not only those towns. It is those towns of 2,000, 3,000, or 5,000 \npeople that are also going under, because I believe we don't have an \nadequate farm program that will enable our farmers to get a better \nprice in the marketplace.\n  Again, I support this resolution. I commend the farmers who came \nhere. I hope and trust we can hear their plea and do something about \nchanging the failed Freedom to Farm bill.\n  I also wish to say I hope after this vote at 11 o'clock we can have a \nresounding vote in support of the crop insurance bill that is before \nus. We need to fix the Crop Insurance Program.\n  I commend Senator Roberts from Kansas and Senator Kerrey from \nNebraska for their leadership in this area.\n  The Crop Insurance Program needs to be changed. We put $6 billion in \nthe budget last year for that. I believe it will be a very strong part \nof helping farmers get through some of these tough times that we have \nright now. It is not the answer to all of the problems in the farm \ncommunities, but it is a part of it.\n  Hopefully, with this modified crop insurance bill, we can go to \nconference with the House right away and get it to the President by \nMay. I will for my part do everything I can with the conferees on our \nside to expedite the conference. There are not that many differences \nbetween the House and the Senate bill--a few, but nothing we can't work \nout in a timely manner.\n  I hope we can get this crop insurance bill through. I hope we can get \na resounding vote for it, and at least send some hope to our family \nfarmers that at least in the area of crop insurance and revenue \ninsurance coverage we are going to pay some attention.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Two minutes for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Congress \namendment. It thanks the people who came here for the rally for rural \nAmerica. It makes it clear that the Congress has heard their plea and \nthat we will respond with a clear and strong message to alleviate the \nagricultural price crisis, to ensure competitive markets, to invest in \nrural education and health care, and to ensure a safe and secure food \nsupply for all.\n  The crop insurance bill is a good bill. I thank my colleagues for the \nwork. I want to make sure with this amendment we are clear this is just \nthe first step. We need to do much more. We hear the people who came. \nWe commend them for coming. Many of them came by bus from Minnesota and \nmany other States. We are committed to taking some important action \nthat will make a positive difference.\n  That is what this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is all about. When \ncolleagues vote for this, I think it is a strong vote. We will come \nback with specific proposals which will be a part of what I think this \namendment calls for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for his amendment. On our side of the aisle, we are hopeful \nthat Members will vote for the amendment.\n  I simply add, we do hear loudly and clearly the voices of those who \nparticipated in the rally for rural America. This very day, the Senate \nwill take action, we believe, to at least answer a part of the problem \nof a strong safety net for the income of farmers in our country. \nIndeed, $6 billion of taxpayer resources will be devoted, given Budget \nCommittee action, to the safety net for our producers in the event we \ntake timely action. I stress the timely aspect of that.\n  As all Senators note, we have tried very hard, working with the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, with the cooperation of \nSenator Wellstone, concerning those who have pioneered this effort--\nSenator Roberts, Senator Kerrey, and others--to bring about something I \nhope will be almost unanimous.\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very hopeful that this bill can, at \nlong last, make crop insurance work for all regions of our nation. It \nincludes creative provisions to bring new producers under its \nprotections, and to bring new crops under its protections. The \ncompromise worked out yesterday protects what the Midwest wanted while \nreaching out to other regions and producers.\n  Historic participation in New England has been very low--this bill \nhelps address this issue. Crop insurance will give our producers one \nmore tool to help manage risk--risks from ice storms, droughts, flood, \nhail and other natural disasters.\n  I want to thank Senators Roberts and Kerrey for their leadership and \nwillingness to include our region, so that we can all now vote together \nfor this effort.\n  Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Harkin were faced with a very \ndifficult challenge--leadership of the Agriculture Committee, as I well \nknow, can be a very difficult balancing act. Also the Democratic leader \nand his staff--Zabrae Valentine--were extremely helpful in delicate \nnegotiations.\n  Bev Paul with Senator Kerrey, Mark Halveson with Senator Harkin, Dave \nJohnson, Keith Luse, Michael Knipe and Andy Morton with Chairman Lugar, \nput in very long hours in this massive effort. Ken Ackerman, of USDA, \nprovided excellent technical advice in this complex area. Senator \nConrad and his staff Scott Carlson put a huge amount of effort into \nthis.\n  I am grateful that the Leahy, Torricelli, Schumer, Rockefeller, Reed, \nand Kennedy amendment was included in the managers' package.\n  The Senate has spoken in a united voice on this amendment and it is \ncrucial that it be included in any conference report.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Risk Management for \nthe 21st Century Act. This bill contains some welcome new tools to help \nmanage risk on the farm. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a very \ngood bill. Virginia farmers will have more risk management tools \navailable to them than ever before, and these tools will be able to \ncover more crops than ever before, making the crop insurance system \nmore equitable and more available.\n  In particular, I thank the members of the Agriculture committee for \ntheir hard work on this bill. I know that the discussions have been \ncontentious, and that different regions of the country view risk \nmanagement in entirely different ways. I for one am thankful that the \nnecessary compromises were made to bring this bill forward for a vote. \nIt is gratifying to know that on the important issues, and this is a \nvery important issue, that we can still work together and do what is \nnecessary to improve the lives of the people we represent.\n  So, I say thank you Chairman Lugar, and Senators Kerrey, Roberts, \nGraham, Lincoln, Leahy and Mack, the rest of the committee, and all of \nyour staffs. You have done the hard work. The country, our food supply, \nand our farmers will all benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today as one of the proud co-sponsors \nof S. 2251, ``The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act.''\n  This bill offers much-needed changes in the area of risk management \nfor farmers and ranchers. Managing risk in agriculture has become \nperhaps the most important aspect of the business. Agricultural \nproducers who are able to effectively manage their risk are able to \nsustain and increase profit. An effective crop insurance program will \nprovide farmers and ranchers possibilities for economic sustainability \nin the future and help them out of the current financial crisis.\n  The federal government can help facilitate a program to unite the \nproducer and the private insurance company. The control must be put \nultimately in the hands of the agricultural producer. Although he \ncannot control risk, an effective management plan will help him to \nmanage the effects of risks, such as weather, prices and natural \ndisasters.\n  This bill addresses the inadequacies of the current crop insurance \nprogram. The problems and inconsistencies with the current program make \nit both unaffordable and confusing to agricultural producers. Costly \npremiums are the biggest problem. In years of depressed market prices, \ncrop insurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for \nfarmers.\n  This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide \nthe highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of \nbuy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the unaffordable premiums. It also \nallows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized.\n  Another important provision in this bill is a pilot program to reward \nproducers for risk management activities.\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\n It will allow producers to elect to receive a risk management payment \nor a crop insurance subsidy. The risk management payments will be given \nto those producers that utilize any two of several activities, \nincluding using futures or options, utilizing cash forwards, attending \na risk management class, using Agricultural Trade Options or FFARRM \naccounts or reducing farm financial risk. This bill also takes into \naccount lack of production histories for beginning farmers or those who \nhave added land or use crop rotation. This will make it possible for \nthose producers to get a foot in the door and receive affordable crop \ninsurance.\n  Many times, especially in Montana, multi-year disasters occur. This \nbill helps producers that take a blow several years in a row, which \nreduces their Annual Production History (APH). If a producer has \nsuffered a natural disaster during at least 3 of the preceding 5 years \nand their APH was reduced by at least 25 percent they may exclude one \nyear of APH for every five years experience. During this time, the \nproducer's APH may increase without limit back up to the level before \nthe multi-year disaster began.\n  Specialty crops such as canola or dry beans, are another important \naddition to this bill. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) is now \nauthorized to spend up to $20 million each fiscal year to create \npartnerships for developing and implementing specialty crop risk \nmanagement options. Additionally, the Non-Insured Assistance Program \n(NAP) area trigger has been removed. The Secretary now has the \nauthority to provide assistance for specialty crops without any \nrequirement of an area loss. Before, producers were penalized in the \ncase of a disaster for planting alternative crops if their neighbors \ncontinued to plant traditional commodities. I would like to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Baucus, for his hard work on getting the provisions \nfor specialty crops in this bill.\n  This bill will ultimately put more control in the hands of active \nproducers by including four active producers on the Federal Crop \nInsurance Commission (FCIC) Board. The board would also include nine \nprivate insurance industry experts the Under Secretary for Farm and \nForeign Agricultural Services, the Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment, and the Chief Economist of USDA. In addition, it mandates \nthat the Board Chairperson be one of the non-governmental members. \nThese are important steps to ensure that the new program is run for the \nproducers by the producers.\n  This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance \nprogram into a risk management program, designed to help the producer \nin the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for \nfarmers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to \nproduce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable \nmargin.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senators Roberts and \nKerrey, as well as Senator Lugar on this important piece of \nlegislation. I believe this bill will pave the way for massive crop \ninsurance reform and help agricultural producers out of this economic \ncrisis.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to speak briefly in support of this legislation, S. 2251, \nthe Risk Management for the 21st century Act. Clearly, this bill \nrepresents a good compromise between the major risk management \nproposals that have been discussed here in the Senate in recent months. \nI command my colleagues--specifically Senator Lugar, Senator Kerrey, \nand Senator Roberts--for producing legislation which enjoys broad \nsupport in the agricultural community and is unquestionably needed \nduring these times of crisis on the family farm.\n  As we all know, these are not the best of times for farming. Like \ntheir counterparts in other natural resources industries, farmers by \nand large have not equitably shared in the remarkable prosperity we \nhave seen in recent years. Most farmers are faced with another year of \nlow commodity prices on the Horizon. I know that for wheat growers in \nOregon, this is the third year of historic low prices. At the same \ntime, the rising costs of production--fueled by energy price spikes, an \nextremely tight labor market, and incredibly burdensome regulations and \ngovernment mandates--continue to squeeze the farmer's bottom line. We \nneed to work together to ease this price pressure on farmers and we \nneed to act quickly. Opening up trade, relieving estate tax burdens, \nseriously reviewing some of the labor and environment regulations that \nseek to make farmers felons--these are just a few of the issues we need \nto address to turn around the fortunes of America's farmers. The \ndevelopment of more practical risk management tools is another. That is \nexactly the promise S. 2251 offers us today--not a fix-all, but a \nsignificant and necessary step on the road to farm recovery.\n  S. 2251 improves the federal crop insurance system in several key \nways. First, it makes higher levels of coverage more affordable. By \nraising premium subsidies, we will offer farmers the chance to help \nthemselves today and avoid an expensive federal bailout tomorrow. \nSecond, this bill will make crop insurance more effective for farmers \nexperiencing successive years of disaster, by changing the way \nproduction history is calculated. In Oregon, we are blessed that we \nhave not had widespread and recurring natural disasters, such as my \ncolleagues have described in the Dakotas. However, we have had recent \nrecurring flood problems in certain areas of my State--the Tillamook \nBay area and the Harney County Lakes Basin, for example. This bill will \naddress some of the problems producers have had in getting a fair \naccounting of their production. Finally, and perhaps most significantly \nfor Oregon, this bill has a number of provisions designed to assist \nspecialty crop producers. My State has a number of specialty crops--\nfrom nursery products in the Willamette Valley to tree fruits in the \nColumbia Gorge and southern Oregon to potato and onion growers in the \neast. With $20 million annually set aside for specialty crop risk \nmanagement pilot projects, this bill represents a substantial effort to \nmake federal crop insurance relevant to producers of nonprogram \ncommodities. I believe this attention to the needs of specialty crop \nproducers is an overdue but welcome change.\n  Once again, I commend my colleagues for their work on this \nlegislation and for their willingness to listen to concerns and \nsuggestions from those of us not on the Agriculture Committee. Much \nwork remains to be done before I think we can say that we have truly \nkept our promise to farmers under Freedom to Farm, but his is an \nimportant step in that direction. I look forward to voting in favor of \nthis bill, and I hope that we will have before us in relatively short \norder a conference agreement as well. It is vital we get this \nlegislation passed and take advantage of the budget authority we have \nprovided for this purpose.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for H.R. 2559, \nthe ``Federal Crop Insurance Act''. Today the Senate will approve a $6 \nbillion crop insurance reform bill designed to increase premium \nsubsidies for farmers who buy more comprehensive coverage and expand \nthe availability of crop insurance for specialty crops. The reforms in \nthis legislation will enable farmers in Rhode Island and across the \ncountry to obtain more crop insurance coverage and reduce income losses \ndue to natural disasters.\n  I and my colleagues from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic opposed last \nyear's farm disaster bill because it did not provide adequate relief to \nfarmers in our region who were hit by the terrible drought conditions \nof 1999. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nfound that four states in the Northeast, including Rhode Island, New \nJersey, Maryland, and Delaware, experienced the driest growing season \nin their histories. From April through July, Rhode Island was the \ndriest it has been in 105 years of record-keeping by NOAA's National \nClimatic Data Center.\n  Unfortunately, forecasters at the National Weather Service are \npredicting continued drought conditions this year, because we are \nstarting out with a deficit of rainfall and, even with the snowstorms \nof January, winter precipitation was 3.5 inches below normal for our \nregion.\n  The prospect of another long dry summer makes this crop insurance \nreform bill all the more important. I know that people may not always\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\nthink of the Northeast when they think of farming. But in my small \nstate alone there are about 700 farms. Farmers in Rhode Island grow \nvegetables, turf, nursery stock, cranberries, strawberries, and \npotatoes. My state is also home to many orchards and dairy farms. Many \nof our crops are not insurable under the current federal crop insurance \nprogram, and that's why I strongly support the significant investment \nin research and development of new specialty crop policies provided by \nthis bill.\n  I also support provisions in the bill to remove the ``area trigger'' \nfor the Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). I believe \nbroader NAP eligibility is one of the most effective ways to assist \nfarmers in the eastern United States who face severe production losses \ndue to drought, floods, or other disasters.\n  Currently, NAP crops are eligible for assistance when: (1) expected \n``Area Yield'' for the crop is reduced by more than 35 percent because \nof natural disaster; and 2) individual crop losses are in excess of 50% \nof the individual's approved yield, or the producer is prevented from \nplanting more than 35 percent of the acreage intended for the eligible \ncrop.\n  These criteria have proven to be unworkable in many eastern states, \nboth in terms of program accessibility and timeliness of payments. For \nindividual growers of specialty crops, typically grown on small \nacreage, a loss of as little as 20% can be devastating, especially \ngiven the high per-acre value of these crops. Moreover, the process of \nverifying area yield reductions is cumbersome and exceedingly time-\nconsuming, resulting in waiting periods of several months or, in some \ncases, more than a year for payment.\n  Giving the Secretary of Agriculture broader discretion over delivery \nof NAP program funds will streamline the approval process and make \ndirect assistance available to thousands of farmers whose substantial \nlosses do not meet NAP criteria under the current area trigger. I am \npleased that removal of this trigger is among the many valuable reforms \nin the bill before us today.\n  Finally, I was proud to join several of my Senate colleagues from the \nNortheast to offer an amendment to provide $60 million for expanded \neducation and outreach for farmers in states with low levels of crop \ninsurance participation, as well as research and development of new \ncrop insurance policies for currently uninsured crops in these states. \nOur amendment would also set aside $66 million for farmers in \nunderserved states to participate in the bill's proposed risk \nmanagement pilot project which allows farmers to choose between \ntraditional crop insurance and a direct payment for adopting new risk \nmanagement practices such as farm diversification, futures contracts \nand options, creation of conservation buffers, soil erosion control, \nand irrigation management. While offering increased income to farmers \nfor whom crop insurance has not worked well, the pilot will test \nwhether incentive payments can encourage producers to adopt new risk \nmanagement strategies that are good for the environment. I thank the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture for making this \namendment part of the overall package we will vote on today, and I urge \nthe Senate conferees to ensure that this important provision remains in \nthe bill after conference with the House. Otherwise, I will likely \noppose the conference report when it comes before the Senate. Together \nwith the substantial new funding for research and development of \nspecialty crop insurance policies, this amendment will ensure that we \nhave a farm policy that is truly national in scope.\n  With the passage of this legislation we will give farmers the tools \nthey need to manage their risk more effectively, and possibly reduce \nthe need for Congress to pass massive farm disaster packages year after \nyear. At the same time, we recognize the contribution and needs of \nfarmers in every region of the country, who not only feed the world but \npreserve a way of life that makes our nation stronger and protects our \nprecious open spaces from the encroachment of development and urban \nsprawl.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Crop Insurance Act.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to express my personal thanks and \ndeep appreciation for adoption of an amendment to the Senate's crop \ninsurance bill which would authorize crop insurance coverage for the \n2001 and future rice crops for losses due to drought and saltwater \nintrusion.\n  The rice language was included in the Chairman's floor amendment \nwhich the Senate approved yesterday.\n  I want to thank Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin sincerely for \nagreeing to the amendment. My sincere appreciation also goes to Senator \nKerrey and to Senator Roberts for accepting the provision.\n  Senator Landrieu, Senator Lincoln and I have been working together \nfor several weeks to help our rice growers who have been experiencing a \nprolonged drought. It has been my privilege to work with Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Lincoln in addressing the absence of rice crop \ninsurance coverage for the drought and saltwater intrusion perils.\n  Currently, the rice crop insurance policy does not include coverage \nfor losses due to drought and saltwater intrusion. A meeting about the \ncurrent policy and how to address the absence of coverage was held with \nour staff, grower representatives and USDA's Risk Management Agency. \nThe willingness to meet and the attention given to the situation at the \nmeeting and subsequent to it by Mr. Ken Ackerman, the RMA's \nAdministrator, and his staff are also sincerely appreciated.\n  To ensure that drought and saltwater intrusion coverage are provided \nin time for the 2001 rice crop and prior to the USDA policy change \ndeadline, legislation was prepared which is now in the Senate's crop \ninsurance bill. In order for a crop insurance policy change to become \neffective, it must be adopted by November 30, which is USDA's annual \ndeadline for such changes.\n  With the rice crop insurance language being only in the Senate bill, \nit is my hope that it will be retained in conference with the House. I \ntake this opportunity to urge the Senate's conferees to keep the rice \ncrop insurance provision in the final conference bill.\n  Insurance coverage for rice crop losses due to drought and saltwater \nintrusion is an important risk management tool for rice growers to have \navailable to them. Again, I express deep personal appreciation for the \nSenate approving inclusion of the bill language which Senator Landrieu, \nSenator Lincoln and I have worked on, which we strongly support and \nwhich we submitted for the Senate's consideration.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                          noncontiguous units\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have heard from many Maine potato \nfarmers that one barrier to their using the crop insurance program is \nthe inability to insure the crops of a farm that may consist of several \nnon-contiguous units under one policy. Therefore, I was pleased to see \nthat The Risk Management for the Twenty-first Century Act authorizes \npilot programs to allow farmers to receive premium discounts for using \nwhole farm units or single crop units of insurance and to cross State \nand county boundaries to form insurable units. This provision has the \npotential to significantly help farmers in Maine and I appreciate your \nefforts to ensure its inclusion in the crop insurance bill. I hope, \ntoo, that you will make every effort to retain this provision in the \nbill that emerges form conference.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. A major purpose of this bill is to make crop insurance \nmore available to our Nation's farmers. I understand the importance of \nthe provision you cite to farmers in your State and will work hard to \nsee that is retained.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Again, I appreciate the assistance of my good friends, \nSenators Lugar and Roberts, who chair the Agriculture Committee and \nSubcommittee on Production and Price Competitiveness, respectively. A \npilot program that could allow farmers to combine noncontiguous units \nunder one policy and to receive premium discounts could be extremely \nbeneficial to my State. I hope that we can strongly encourage the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to give Maine every consideration as a \nlocation for such a pilot program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The pilot programs authorized in this bill are a tool to \nfind new ways to improve crop insurance for farmers. I agree that the \nUSDA should give every consideration to including farmers in Maine in \nsuch a\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\npilot program. I would also commend the Senator from Maine's efforts to \nwork with us in crafting a bill that address the concerns of farmers in \nher state.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I agree that Maine appears to be an excellent candidate \nfor such a pilot program. I thank the Senator for bringing this \nimportant matter to our attention.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, first, I commend the bipartisan efforts \nof the Agriculture Committee. In S. 2251 the committee has produced a \nbill which will deliver much needed expansion and improvement of the \nfederal crop insurance program. Additionally, I appreciate Senators \nRoberts and Kerrey for accepting a proposal I put forward that will \nestablish a commission to examine reform issues over the long term.\n  Missouri farmers are hurting. Prices for cotton, soybeans, corn, \nrice, and almost all commodities dropped so low last year that \nUniversity of Missouri economists predicted grain farmers could face \nprices almost as low as those seen in 1986. The Senate responded to the \ncrisis strongly by supporting a disaster assistance package worth about \n$9 billion in 1999. The Senate now has the opportunity to assist \nfarmers by helping them protect their losses that are due to bad \nweather and market fluctuations. Our farmers need more affordable crop \ninsurance, to obtain higher levels of coverage and revenue protection.\n  Missourians, like farmers in many other sates, are diversifying their \nagricultural production and increasingly focusing on specialty crops. \nS. 2251 also provides a realistic basis for expanding and improving \ninsurance for specialty crops.\n  As good as this bill is, I offered, and Senators Roberts and Kerrey \ngraciously accepted, a provision that would establish a commission to \nreview the effect of the changes made in traditional crop insurance and \nthe addition of a pilot project for alternative risk programs. The \nFederal Crop Insurance Improvement Commission will report to Congress \nin 2 years with its findings. The Commission strengthens the public-\nprivate partnership that farmers rely on to deliver crop insurance by \nbringing together Government officials, economists, farm interests, and \ninsurers to review various proposals. As we review farm policies down \nthe road, I want to have the input of those that are actually out there \n``in the field.''\n  Again I thank my Senate colleagues from Kansas and Nebraska for \nbringing this important issue to the Senate floor. I want farm families \nto be able to encourage their children to continue the traditions of \nfamily farming and agri-business. The crop insurance reform detailed in \nS. 2251 puts us one step closer to that goal.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend the managers of this bill and \nall those who worked hard to forge this agreement to help address the \ncontinuing crisis facing American farmers. However, I regret that I \ncannot vote for this legislation, S. 2251, the Risk Management for the \n21st Century Act.\n  Over the last 2 years, the Congress was forced to spend more than $15 \nbillion of taxpayer dollars in emergency disaster assistance to \nfarmers. Proponents of this bill claim that if S. 2251 is enacted, the \nneed to pass ad hoc emergency farm relief would be avoided. However, \neven with passage of this bill, these same proponents are not willing \nto voice their opposition to further emergency spending should Congress \nbe forced to consider additional relief measures for farmers.\n  This bill, at a cost of $6 billion, is more of an expanded federal \nsubsidy for crop coverage, rather than thorough and necessary reform of \nthe larger problems stemming from our nation's farm policies. It has \nbecome clear that the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill failed to alleviate the \nheavy reliance by the farming community on federally subsidized \nprograms and financial assistance. However, instead of turning back the \nclock and increasing subsidies, we should be working for responsible \nreform of farm policies. That is why I voted in favor of Senator \nWellstone's amendment which calls for broader reform.\n  Even with the expanded coverage and more affordable insurance \npremiums for farmers called for in this bill, Congress does not have \nthe assurance that other problems, such as fluctuations in the market \nor limited trade opportunities, will not create additional burdens on \nfarmers requiring another costly congressional budgetary response.\n  Mr. President, this bill also includes provisions that appear \ncapricious and unnecessarily bureaucratic. Five new regional centers \nwill be established at a price tag of $30 million, and new pilot \nprograms are authorized to develop and market risk management tools. I \nsupport efforts to evaluate innovative risk management options or to \nensure that farmers understand changes to insurance coverage and \noptions. But why should we spend taxpayer money on new information \ncenters when this information is already available and accessible \nthrough local USDA offices? And, the private sector is in no way \nprohibited from exploring opportunities to develop and market new \nproducts to manage risk.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the fundamental principle of this bill, \nthat farmers need to have risk management tools to allow them to \nprepare for, and deal with, crop losses and disaster-related problems. \nHowever, I am not convinced that this bill will do much more than \nincrease taxpayer burdens and only partially solve a much bigger \nproblem facing our nation's farmers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be placed in \nthe Record immediately following passage of S. 2251.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the staff of Senator Roberts, \nparticularly Mike Seyfert; Senator Kerrey's staff, Bev Paul; Senator \nHarkin's staff, Mark Halverson and Stephanie Mercier; Senator \nGrassley's staff, Mark Reisinger; my own staff, Andy Morton, Michael \nKnipe, Chimene Dupler, Bob Sturm, Dave Johnson, Keith Luse, and Terri \nNintemann; Senator Cochran's staff, Hunt Shipman; and Senator Daschle's \nstaff, Zabrae Valentine, who made very instrumental contributions to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman for his \nleadership and work with all of us on the Agriculture Committee and in \nthe Senate as a whole to bring this bill along to this point. It is a \ngood bill and it will provide a lot of needed help to our nation's \nfarmers and rural economy. I also want to thank and congratulate my \ncolleagues, especially Senator Kerrey and Senator Roberts, for their \nfine efforts. I too express my gratitude for the hard work and \ndedication of all the staff as mentioned by Chairman Lugar, who have \ncontributed to crafting this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Lugar, the chairman \nof the Committee on Agriculture, and Senator Roberts, on the bipartisan \nwork that was done on this legislation. While it didn't get a 100-\npercent vote, I think they should be commended for keeping their \ncommitment made last fall to get crop insurance to the floor. Senator \nLugar, in his usual way, has worked very hard to bring all divergent \nviews together. I thank the Senator for this important legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe majority leader. Senator Lugar, in the committee as well as on the \nfloor, demonstrated once again why he is admired on both sides of the \naisle as a leader in agriculture. This was not easy for him, beginning \nlast year. He maneuvered the committee and brought the Senate to a \npoint where we successfully completed our work.\n  I congratulate the Senator, and especially I congratulate Senators \nRoberts, Kerrey, Conrad, and others who had a role to play in bringing \nthe Senate to this point. Our thanks to all Senators for their \ncooperation. I am grateful for the opportunity to have completed this \nwork.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me add, thanks, too, to Senator Kerrey \nand others involved on the Democratic side of the aisle. It was truly a \nbipartisan effort. I think they should be congratulated. I hope when it \ncomes out of conference it will have 100-percent support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1642-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1642-S1644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SENATOR TED STEVENS--ALASKAN OF THE CENTURY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to comment at this time about one of \nthe most effective and respected Senators in this Chamber. He can be \nferocious in trying to get his work done, but he always winds up doing \nit with a smile on his face. He quite often acts as a typical trial \nlawyer making his case against the opposing counsel or pleading his \ncase to the jury. Of course, we enjoy referring to him sometimes as the \n``Tasmanian devil.'' When he comes to the Senate floor wearing his \nTasmanian devil tie, look out; he is ready to do the people's business \nin quick order.\n  For more than 30 years, the Alaskan of the Year Committee has named \nan Alaskan of the year who has significantly affected the character and \nthe development of the 49th State. Thus, it is no surprise that in 1974 \nSenator Stevens, along with the newspaper publisher, was named \n``Alaskan of the Year.'' Recently, the Alaskan of the Year Committee \nset out to name the Alaskan of the Century.\n  I inquired of the Senator from Alaska, which century? The past \ncentury for past favors or the present century for expected ones? With \nthe usual sense of humor, he deferred to maybe the past century.\n  Mr. President, 88 names of great Alaskans appeared on the first \nballot. The second ballot contained 12; the third ballot contained 3. \nOn the final ballot, Alaska's senior Senator, who has served so well in \nthis body, Ted Stevens, was named ``Alaskan of the Century.''\n  What a great honor. On Saturday night, in Anchorage, AK, surrounded \nby family and friends, this great honor, Alaskan of the Century, will \nbe conferred on Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens has had a role in \nevery significant event in Alaska for the last half century, whether it \nbe as a youth working for Alaskan statehood or his mastery in crafting \nand shepherding through Congress the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct, landmark legislation for which there is no other precedent.\n\n  It would take all day to list the great many things Senator Stevens \nhas accomplished during his 31 years serving in the Senate, and even \nlonger to list all of his friends. Mr. President, not only is Ted \nStevens a great Senator and a great Alaskan, he is, above all, a loyal \nfriend to all who know him. Even in the heat of battle, when it gets \ntough around here, in the next minute or the next hour, he is lovingly \ntrying to do something to help his previous opponent, whether it be in \nthe leadership of his own party or across the aisle in the other party.\n  His 6 children and 10 grandchildren, and his wife, Catherine, who is \nspecial in her own way, know for sure that Senator Ted Stevens, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, senior Senator for the 49th \nState, is indeed worthy of the honor he will receive this week as \nAlaskan of the Century.\n  His service in the military, his service in that State, his service \nof bringing that State into the Union, his service as a Senator, and \nhis service as chairman of the Appropriations Committee is truly \nunique. I offer my personal congratulations. I know I speak for all of \nmy colleagues in applauding Ted Stevens.\n  I don't know how in the world we would even pick a Mississippian of \nthe century. There have been so many great ones in this past century, \nbut in Alaska, it is obvious: The man for that job and for that honor \nis Ted Stevens. Thank you, Ted, for what you do for your country and \nfor your State. We are proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say with enthusiasm how completely \nthis Senator agrees with the statement made by the majority leader. Ted \nStevens is one who is admired, I say even loved, by colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. We have worked with him; we have admired his work; \nwe have seen on so many occasions he has effectively led not only the \nAppropriations Committee but the Senate itself in bringing together the \nkind of consensus, the\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\nkind of compromises, for successful legislative action.\n  We all joke about his temperament. We sometimes say it is hard to \nunderstand how a guy from so cold a State could be so hot under the \ncollar. I have to say, as Senator Lott has noted, he is quick to \nrespond and quick to find ways with which to overcome his frustrations, \nas we all face them and deal with them on both sides of the aisle.\n  Alaskans have every right to be proud. They have every reason to \nnominate and name this individual as Alaskan of the Year. Indeed, he is \nan Alaskan of the Century. We are proud to work with him, proud to call \nhim a colleague, proud in this case to call him our chairman, and proud \nof the fact that Alaskans recognize him for the unique talents and the \nunique dedication and the unique leadership that he provides not only \nhis State as an Alaskan, but his country as a Senator. I congratulate \nhim on this special occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank both leaders for their kind \ncomments about the honor I will receive on Saturday at home. I have \nbeen humbled and confused by the decision of those who voted. Having \nbeen in our State now for over the last half of the last century, I \nhave known a great many great people who have contributed to our State \nduring the period of the century. For instance, I refer to my first \nsenior partner, E.B. Collins, of Fairbanks, AK, who came to Alaska \nbefore the turn of the last century and was a gold miner in Nome. When \nhe was unsuccessful, he walked from Nome to Fairbanks. That is a good \n1,500 miles. He read law in an attorney's office, became an attorney, \nand by 1913 he was named the Speaker of the first territorial House of \nRepresentatives. I worked with him and he gave me great advice in the \nfirst days when I went to the State.\n  There are so many others who have been so effective and have done so \nmuch for the State that I find it hard to accept the honor.\n  I intend to make a speech, of course, about that when I get home on \nSaturday, and point out the number of people who have done the work for \nwhich I get credit. Many of them are right here in this room.\n  We have been, really, very successful in trying to defend the \nproposition that once Alaska became a State, it should be an equal \namong equals in our National Government. It has taken many hours on the \nfloor to ask for and receive the support of the Senate to defend the \nproposition that a new State is entitled to the same benefits, the same \nprerogatives, as those States that were in the Union ahead of it. I am \nbut the third Senator who has ever served the State of Alaska. My \ncolleague is the fifth. We are unique in the sense we are still a young \nState. Our State has been a member of the Union only 9 years longer \nthan I have been in the Senate.\n  It is a distinguished privilege to be here. I am certain this award \nis being given to me because I am a Member of the Senate and because I \nam alive and others are not. But I do respect those who made the \njudgment. I question it, but I respect them, and I do thank my \ncolleagues for what they have done today recognizing that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take the opportunity, as the \njunior Senator from Alaska, to make a few comments relative to the \ndesignation by Alaskans of Senator Ted Stevens, Alaskan of the Century. \nFor years we have been proclaiming the Alaskan of the Year. This is an \nextraordinary designation to honor an extraordinary individual.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1980, as a freshman with virtually \nno experience in the legislative process, I had an opportunity to have \nan extended discussion with Senator Stevens. He suggested the best \nposition for the State of Alaska would be for him to give up his \nposition, his longstanding seniority on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, so I could serve on that committee, and he vacated \nthat spot. He could be not only the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee but senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and could be chairman if he so chose. But he chose to leave \nthat committee and make an opening available to me. Now I have the \nhonor of serving in that capacity. But it was a sacrifice for him. It \nwas a sacrifice he made on the basis of what was good for Alaska that \nhe pursued the appropriations process, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on which he served and continues to serve, as well as the \nCommerce Committee.\n  I might add, with his seniority he has the option of serving as \nchairman of those committees, as well as of the Rules Committee, I \nbelieve. So he is really in an extraordinary position of seniority \nwithin this body. As a consequence of that, the contribution he has \nmade, it is quite fitting Alaskans have selected him the State's Man of \nthe Century. I do not believe there is a more deserving individual in \nour State. That is evidenced by the support Senator Stevens has \nreceived in this nomination.\n  I am going back to Alaska tomorrow, along with our House colleague, \nRepresentative Don Young, to acclaim, if you will, the recognition of \nSenator Stevens and his wife Catherine in receiving this award.\n  He has been a central figure in our young State's history. It has \nbeen a time of unparalleled changes in the 49th State. The remarkable \nthing is that Ted, while he has become a figure of national prominence, \nhas not lost his interest and relationship with Alaskans. When we \nbecame a State in 1959, we had a lot of catching up to do. Senator \nStevens has been very active in ensuring that Alaska catch up. The rest \nof the States have been around 100, 150 years, some of them 200 years, \nbut ours has not.\n  While Ted currently ranks sixth in the Senate in overall seniority, \nsecond among Republicans--and is just one of 109 Senators who have \nserved in this body for more than 24 years--he still can be found \nmeeting every Alaskan Close-Up student group, talking with residents \nabout health concerns and meeting villagers about their rural \nsanitation needs.\n  In his 36-year legislative career--four years in the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives and now in his 32nd year in the U.S. Senate, Ted has \nplayed the largest single role in seeing Alaska, a territory of just \n210,000 people 41 years ago, grow into a vibrant, modern state that has \nmore than tripled in population.\n  In the state's House he crafted legislation to help the state recover \nfrom the devastating 1964 Good Friday earthquake. As majority leader in \nthe state's House and Speaker pro tempore, he helped Fairbanks \nresidents recover from the massive flooding they faced in 1967. And in \n1989-90 he and I worked together to help craft federal legislation to \nhelp Alaska recover from the aftereffects of the 1989 wreck of the \nExxon Valdez oil tanker in Prince William Sound.\n  His encyclopedic knowledge of Federal-Alaska State relations is \nlegendary in Washington. In the Senate, which has lost much of its \ninstitutional memory in the past decade, Ted is able to offer insights \non everything from passage of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act in 1974, to \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. He can talk about \npassage of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation Act of 1978--a law now \njustly named after him--to passage of the Alaska Lands Act in 1980. \nThose four laws are the keys to shaping the direction of Alaska as we \nenter the 21st century. His recollection of events is so  extraordinary \nnot only because he helped draft the Alaska Statehood Act, while \nserving as a legislative counsel at the Department of the Interior \nstarting in 1956, but because he served as chief counsel and solicitor \nfor the Interior Department in Alaska in 1960--helping to get the young \nState off and running after Statehood in 1959.\n\n  I won't take this Chamber's time to talk about the Senator's early \nlife, or even his impressive military career, where he served as a \nFlying Tiger in the U.S. Air Force in China during World War II--\nservice that helped form his comprehensive knowledge of the military, \nwhich has been such a help to him in shaping our Nation's Armed Forces \nbudgets over the past two decades from his post on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I do want to speak a bit about what it has been like working with \nSenator Stevens. While we have disagreed on only a handful of issues \nover the past\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\n20 years, Ted Stevens has truly given of his time and shared his great \nknowledge and expertise to help me to represent the citizens of our \nState. He has selflessly given guidance and counsel to help our \ndelegation reach a common accord on what is best for Alaskans. And I \ncan't personally thank him enough for his many kindness. We have truly \nworked together to help our small State, one that sports just three \nelectoral votes, have a voice in the direction of our Nation. It has \nnot always been easy.\n  We have had to battle those who have no knowledge of what life is \ntruly like in Alaska, whether we are trying to save our timber industry \nin Southeast Alaska, or trying to protect our rights to access our \nnatural resources--Alaska's main means of supporting our citizens and \nour State government. We are working together to win the right to \nproduce oil, without environmental damage, from North America's last \ngreat storehouse of energy--the Arctic coastal plain.\n  While Ted served eight years as assistant Republican leader (whip) \nhandling key national issues, especially defense matters, he has been \nwilling to put aside personal ambition for the good of his State. Many \nforget that Ted sacrificed his seniority on the Commerce Committee to \nmove to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee during the key fight \nover the Alaska lands act. He then moved back to Commerce to represent \nAlaska fishermen--proof positive that Ted always puts Alaska first. \nDuring his years on the Appropriations Committee, he has battled hard \nto make sure Alaska receives its fair share of Federal funding--money \nneeded to help Alaska provide basic services to its citizens--piped \nwater and sanitary sewers, roads and schools that Americans elsewhere \ntake for granted.\n  Today I, join with all Alaskans, to thank him for his skill, drive, \nand dedication and congratulate him on the honor he will justly receive \nthis weekend. I also offer him a heart-felt wish for many, many more \nyears of service to the State and the Nation. Nancy joins me in \ncongratulations to both Ted and Catherine on this honor. It's been a \ngreat privilege working with you my friend.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \ncongratulate my friend and colleague, Ted Stevens, on being named \nAlaskan of the Century. From his efforts to achieve Alaskan statehood \nto his work on behalf of the State of Alaska, Ted Stevens has dedicated \nhis life to public service and proven his leadership both in his home \nstate and in the United States Senate. I know of no one more deserving \nof this honor. I am proud to have the opportunity to know and work with \nhim and I extend him my heartfelt congratulations on this momentous \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1644-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, hardly a day goes by that we do not hear \nof another tragic shooting across America. The latest news from Texas \nis still sketchy, but the results are horrible: Four people who \napparently were injured by gunfire in a church and the assailant taking \nhis own life with a gun. It is a constant reminder. Only 2 or 3 weeks \nago, a Michigan first grader took a loaded handgun to school and killed \nhis little classmate. That is America today, a nation of some 300 \nmillion weapons.\n  On Capitol Hill, the debate over guns and their future really gets \npretty heated and inflammatory on both sides, and the parties are at \nit. Frankly, as I travel across the State of Illinois and I talk with \npeople from other States, I believe the families in this country get \nit. They understand what this is all about. They appreciate what we can \nand cannot do to make things better.\n  They do not believe for a second that we can pass a law that will end \ngun violence in America. That is beyond us. I wish we could. I do \nbelieve there are things we can do to make America a safer place.\n  Some want to argue between the possibilities of increased enforcement \nof current laws and closing loopholes which allow people to get guns \nwho should not have them. That is a false choice. This Senator wants \nboth. The people who misuse guns should be prosecuted and imprisoned, \nno questions asked. By the same token, we should do everything in our \npower to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, people with a history \nof violent mental illness, and children. I think we need both--zero \ntolerance and zero loopholes. I do not think it is a choice. We need \nboth. If we go after both in an aggressive bipartisan approach, we can \nstart to see the numbers come down on gun violence; we can have a \nlittle more peace of mind about our kids going to school and coming \nhome safe and sound at the end of the day.\n  Last year, we had a bill on the floor of the Senate after the \nColumbine massacre which focused on two major points: If you buy a gun \nat a gun store in America, they do a background check. They will figure \nout whether or not you can legally own a gun. That is the Brady law. \nThe Brady law has been successful.\n  It is hard to believe, but true, that people with a history of \ncommitting crimes and felonies, people who have outstanding arrest \nwarrants--not very bright, I might add--show up at gun stores trying to \nbuy guns. We do not want that to happen. We want to stop them.\n  There is a role there for the Federal Government in having this law. \nThere is a bigger role for State and local law enforcement in making \nsure those people who have outstanding arrest warrants, for example, \nare prosecuted. That is what happens when you go to a gun store.\n  We also know in America one can buy guns at gun shows. There is a \nloophole there: There is no background check. If you happen to have a \nproblem under the law--let's say a felony record or perhaps a history \nof mental illness or you are too young--you do not go to the gun store \nwhere they enforce the law, you go to the gun show where they do not. \nThat is the loophole we want to close. That was in the law that was \npassed last year in the Senate. The vote was 49-49, incidentally. Vice \nPresident Gore cast the deciding vote. We sent the bill over to the \nHouse where it has languished for almost a year. Nothing has happened.\n\n  The second thing that was in that law, which I think most Americans \nwould agree is common sense, was: Is\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\nthere a way for those who own guns to store them safely? The answer is \nobviously yes. It involves trigger locks. You may have heard that Smith \n& Wesson, the largest handgun manufacturer in the United States, \nsuggested they will start selling trigger locks automatically with \ntheir handguns. It is common sense they will give to the gun owner the \nwherewithal to make their gun childproof.\n  Some people say: It is the middle of the night and a burglar comes to \nthe door; I am fumbling around trying to find the key--you can decide \nwhat you do at night. When you go off to work and leave the gun behind \nwith children in the house or when other kids visit, don't you want to \nlock it up so a kid cannot get his hands on it and shoot himself or a \nplaymate?\n  That is what trigger locks are all about. That was the second major \npart of the bill that passed the Senate last year and still languishes \nin the House of Representatives.\n  What is so radical about those two suggestions: That a gun show will \ntry to find out whether or not you are legally eligible to own a gun \nbefore they sell it to you; that if you are going to sell a gun in \nAmerica, it is with a trigger lock so it can be safer?\n  It is time for us to cool down the political rhetoric around here--\nand let me be the first to volunteer because I feel very strongly about \nthis--and try to see if maybe there is some common ground. If the \npeople on one side want more enforcement, such as Operation Exile, \nwhich is working in some cities across America, I will support it, I \nwill vote for it.\n  I want more enforcement, too. In fact, I am going to offer an \namendment in the Budget Committee which is going to say to my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans: Let's put some money into this. \nLet's show that we believe in enforcement and prosecution on a \nbipartisan basis. This is not a partisan issue. I do not want criminals \nroaming the streets, gang bangers shooting up the streets of Chicago or \nmy hometown of Springfield. I am ready to push for more prosecution and \nenforcement, without question. Let's put the money into more ATF agents \nand more prosecutors to get that job done.\n  I will concede to the other side that prosecution and enforcement are \nimportant. Let's do it. This Democrat will stand with Republicans to \nget that done.\n  I ask in return that Republican Senators take a look at what we \npassed last year. Some, including the Presiding Officer, voted for it, \nand I am very proud that he did. We need more. We need to have Senators \non both sides of the aisle to come forward and say, yes, trigger locks \nmake sense; let's make them part of America's landscape to protect \nchildren; and those who will also say that gun shows should not be \nexempt from the basic laws of this country.\n  There are other things we can talk about in terms of sensible, \ncommonsense gun control. I do not know if we will get them accomplished \nthis year, but certainly I hope that before the first anniversary of \nthe Columbine tragedy, this Congress will end its gridlock on the gun \ncontrol issue. The people of this country expect more. They do not want \nto see this historic Chamber grind to a halt because of a special \ninterest group in this town. They want to see goodwill on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n\n  I will say this: If we fail, if we do nothing, if another day, \nanother week, and another month go by with the tragic headlines we see \nso often about killings in churches and schools and day-care centers, \nif that happens, the American people will be justifiably angry in this \nelection. They should hold all candidates accountable.\n  Members of the House of Representatives, Members of the Senate, and \nthe two men who are likely to be the leading candidates for President \nof the United States--all of us, I should say--should be held \naccountable to answer the basic question: When you had the chance \nserving in the U.S. Congress, what did you do? Did you try to do \nanything to make this country safer, to make certain that when I walk \nout on the streets of my town or send my little boy or girl to school, \nI have a little more peace of mind?\n  We have the ability; we have the opportunity. The question is whether \nwe can summon the political will. One cannot turn on the television in \nthis town, and probably in others, without seeing ads from one special \ninterest group or the other that wants to get us tangled up in some \ntheoretical debate about the second amendment and the future of gun \ncontrol.\n  I hope this Congress, and particularly this Senate, can get beyond \nthe theory into the reality. The reality is: Over 40 percent of \nAmericans own guns; there are over 300 million guns now in our Nation \nof some 275 million people; and even the gun owners believe intensely \nin sensible and responsible gun control. They believe guns should be \nstored safely, that those who own them should know how to use them, and \nthey should be kept out of the hands of the wrong people. That is a \nconsensus among gun owners, not to mention those who do not own guns \nwho feel even more strongly about the same issues.\n  I hope this Congress, which tends to lurch back and forth from minor \nbut somewhat important issues, will focus on a major and very important \nissue: Making America a safer place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1645-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1645-S1651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ANWR\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto address an issue that is very close to Alaska, Senator Stevens, our \nRepresentative Young, and myself. It represents the myth associated \nwith ANWR and the realization that Alaska has been producing almost 25 \npercent of the total crude oil that has been produced in this Nation \nfor the last 23 years or thereabouts.\n  I have here a map of Alaska that shows the pipeline and gives you a \ndimension of the magnitude of this particular area of our State. It is \nnecessary that you recognize, as we address the disposition of allowing \nexploration in ANWR, that this was established as a responsibility that \nonly Congress could address in releasing this particular area for \nexploration.\n  I am going to give you an opportunity to view a map of Alaska. Alaska \nis a pretty big piece of real estate. On a map, if you overlayed Alaska \non the United States, it would extend from Canada to Mexico and from \nFlorida to California. We have the Aleutian Islands that go out almost \n2,000 miles. The breadth of the State from the pipeline alone at \nPrudhoe Bay to where the pipeline ends at Valdez is 800 miles. It is a \nbig piece of real estate.\n  Until a few years ago, we had four time zones in the State alone. \nWhen Senator Stevens or I go back to the State, we just begin our \ntravel. We have a very small segment of the State that has a road \nsystem. This entire western area is without any roads, with the \nexception of a few miles in Nome and Kotzebue, and the villages.\n  We are not connected to the continental United States, as you can \nsee. Our neighbor to the right, Canada, constitutes a barrier--a \nforeign country; a good friend--from the rest of the United States. We \nhave our southeastern part where our State capital is in Juneau, \nroughly 700 miles from our largest city, Anchorage. Our second largest \ncity, Fairbanks, is 400 miles to the north of Anchorage.\n  I go into this detail because it is important, as we look at the \nissue of ANWR, to keep it in perspective. I am going to refer to the \nchart behind me because I think it represents an appropriate \ncomparison.\n  Let me advise my colleagues of a couple facts.\n  One, ANWR is going to be in the budget. We are going to be addressing \nthe budget in the coming weeks. It is going to be in there at an \nanticipated revenue forecast of about $1.5 billion to the Federal \nTreasury. You can evaluate the pros and cons of that. It is also going \nto be in the Republican package that we are preparing to try to do \nsomething meaningful about the energy crisis in this country, which the \ncurrent administration has not done.\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\n They have no energy policy, as evidenced by their inability to address \nwhat they are going to do with hydro.\n  Some want to tear the dams down. What are they going to do with the \nelectric industry? Obviously, Carol Browner wants to close half a dozen \ncoal-fired plants, with no indication where we are going to pick up the \nalternative. Our nuclear situation is such that we cannot address what \nwe are going to do with our nuclear waste, yet the nuclear industry \ncontributes 20 percent of our energy in this country.\n  If you look at gas, you may assume, as some do, that all we have to \ndo is plug into it. If you read the National Petroleum Council report \non gas, you have to recognize a harsh reality: We are using about 20 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas a day. In another 10 to 15 years, we will be \nusing 31 trillion cubic feet a day. We do not have the infrastructure \nto deliver the anticipated demand. It just isn't there. It is going to \nrequire over $1 trillion--the industry figures $1.5 trillion--in the \nnext decade, and that is only if we have access to areas where we are \nlikely to find gas.\n\n  Much of the overthrust belt--which is the Rocky Mountains--65 percent \nof that has been removed from exploration. So where do we go? We go \noffshore; we go to Louisiana; we go to Texas; we go, to some extent, to \nColorado and Wyoming, but we do not have an aggressive plan.\n  But we have an opportunity, in my State of Alaska--a significant \nopportunity--and that is ANWR.\n  What is the significance of ANWR? ANWR is shown on this map in this \nlittle tight corner, over here by the Canadian border. It looks small \non this map, but it is in proportion.\n  There are those who say: Good heavens, you are going to jeopardize \nthis area for exploration.\n  What we, as Alaskans, have not been able to portray--because the \nmedia will not pick up on it, and people are evidently not interested \nenough to recognize the proportion here--this is ANWR. This is 19 \nmillion acres, as shown by this little spot up here. It is as big as \nthe State of South Carolina, a pretty big hunk of real estate. What \nhave we done with this?\n  In 1980, we made some permanent designations. We created the refuge, \nthe arctic refuge: 9.5 million acres in perpetuity. We went up and \ncreated a wilderness: 8 million acres in this area that is shown on the \nmap marked with the slices.\n  But we left for Congress's dictate 1.5 million acres, so-called 1002 \nareas, up here. The reason we left it is, Congress was concerned there \nmight be major deposits of hydrocarbons in this area, just like there \nwere in Prudhoe Bay.\n  Let's look at Prudhoe Bay for a moment because there is an \ninteresting parallel here. Prudhoe Bay is where the oil development is \ntoday. Let's look at Prudhoe Bay today and let's look at the \ntraditional oil development and a picture that is an actual scene \nshowing Prudhoe Bay and the animal activity that surrounds the area.\n  I show you a picture taken some years ago, but it represents the \nheart of Prudhoe Bay. There you see the pipeline. You see the oil \nderricks, and you see the caribou.\n  There is a degree of compatibility there. The reason it is there, \nobviously, is nobody is shooting these animals; nobody is running them \ndown. There are no snow machines. It is summertime. There is no threat. \nThey feel very much at home.\n  These are nomadic herds that move in and out, but there is a \ncompatibility. We have seen a tremendous growth in this western arctic \nherd since we developed this area. The reason we have seen that is \nthere are no guns allowed in the area. These animals are protected. \nThey prosper, as they should. To suggest somehow they are in jeopardy \ndefies reality. When we started oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay, there were \n3,000 or 4,000 caribou in this herd. There are over 18,000 today. That \nis just a fact associated with experience that we have already had. \nPrudhoe Bay's technology is 30 years old. We can do a better job if we \nare allowed in here.\n\n  What is the footprint going to be if we indeed are allowed to open up \nANWR? The footprint is estimated by the industry to be 2,000 acres out \nof all of ANWR's 19 million acres. That is what we are looking at. We \nare keeping the refuge, we are keeping the wilderness, and we are \nmaking a determination.\n  What does it look like when they are drilling in the area? This is \nwhat we would like to communicate to the American people. It is a \npretty tough environment. There it is. We have a well under \nconstruction. This is not in ANWR because there is no entry or activity \nallowed. It is a typical scene in the Arctic in Prudhoe Bay. This is an \nice road. They don't allow anything on the tundra in the summertime, \nbut the ice roads stay there about 9 months of the year because you are \nway above the Arctic Circle, nearly 400 miles. It is a harsh \nenvironment.\n  That is a typical rig. When the disposition of this is made one way \nor the other, what is going to be left? Well, let's look at it in the \nsummertime. Same site, summertime activity is gone; ice road is gone. \nThere you have it, Mr. President: the tundra, a spigot; that's it.\n  I always think of my good friend, Senator Mark Hatfield. Mark \nHatfield, it is safe to say, was a pacifist. He said: I will vote for \nANWR any day of the year rather than send our troops in danger in the \nMideast to keep oil flowing from neighbors we cannot count on.\n  All right. Where are we? This is an extraordinary chart. This marks \nfrom where our increasing oil exports are coming. Ironically, they are \ncoming from Iraq. Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day from \nIraq. This year we are importing 700,000 barrels a day. How many people \nremember 1990 and 1991? Do you know what happened over there? We fought \na war. We fought a war to keep Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait. \nWhat did that cost us? That cost us 147 American lives. We had 448 \nwounded. We had 23 taken prisoner. That is a cost.\n  We had another cost. What has it cost the taxpayers of this country \nsince that war was over? What has it cost us in the last 10 years, from \n1991 until today, to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in, enforcing the no-\nfly zone, enforcing, if you will, the embargoes, putting the fleet over \nthere? We added it up. It is $10 billion. That is what it has cost the \nAmerican taxpayer: 147 lives, 448 wounded, 23 prisoners, $10 billion.\n  Where are we getting our oil now? The fastest increasing imports are \nfrom our old buddy, Saddam Hussein. Isn't that ironic?\n  Look at the national security interests of this country. We are today \n56-percent dependent on imports. When we fought this war, we were 47- \nto 49-percent dependent. I think the President will recall, in 1973, we \nhad an energy crisis in the country. We called it the Arab oil embargo. \nWe had gasoline lines around the block in this Nation. People were \ninconvenienced. So Congress acted. At that time we were 37-percent \ndependent on imported oil. Congress set up the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and said we would never approach 50 percent. We are going to \ntake action. We never got 100 days supply of oil in SPR. We got a 56-\nday supply. That is what it is now.\n  Now there are proposals we should take oil out of SPR for the \nnational crisis that we have on oil prices. That is very dangerous \nbecause if you take it out of SPR, you still need more imported into \nthe country. And your good neighbors, the Saudis and the Mexicans, know \nit; the Venezuelans, you have less leverage. If we are ever going to \ntake anything out of SPR, we should have a certification from the \nSecretary of Defense that it does not jeopardize our national security \nbecause you can only pull about 4 million barrels a day out of SPR.\n\n  The point is--and it is a very important one--go very slow with the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve because after that, you don't have a \nbackup. So here we are, depending on Saddam Hussein today. I find it \ninexcusable. This administration has no energy policy. They hope this \nwon't be an issue in the campaign. They hope the issue will go away, \nand they hope the Secretary of Energy is going to be successful in his \nefforts to go around with that tin cup and try and get more production.\n  Let's see what he has done so far. He went over to Saudi Arabia about \n10 days ago and said: We have an emergency in this country. They said: \nWell, we will have a meeting on March 27. We will address greater oil \nproduction then. He said: No, you don't understand; we have an \nemergency now. We fought a war over here. We kept Saddam Hussein out of \nKuwait. They said:\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n I'm sorry. We are going to have a meeting on March 27, and we will \naddress it then.\n  He got stiffed by the Saudis. So he went to Mexico and said: We need \nmore production. The Mexicans said: Well, we appreciate that. We would \nlike to help you, but you have been buying oil at $11, $12, $13 a \nbarrel. Our economy went in the bucket. Where were you? The Secretary \nsaid: Well, we bailed you out of the tesobonos. We had a tremendous \nrefinancing commitment for Mexico. They said: Sorry. We got stiffed.\n  So where did the Secretary go next? Well, he went over to some of the \nother countries. Nigeria, you might get a little out of Nigeria. I \ndon't know.\n  Here is the superpower of the world, a Nation that is the most \nproductive and has become the most dependent on imported oil. Make no \nmistake about it, we have to conserve. We have to have alternative \nenergy. We have to develop the technology, but we have to be realistic. \nIf somebody drove here, somebody came in on an airplane, they are going \nback the same way. We don't have the technology now for hydrogen. Fuel \ncells won't do it. Four percent of our energy is alternative. I wish it \nwere more. Some of you came in here in a sports vehicle. Gasoline, at \n$1.70 a gallon, is going to shoot a pretty good hole in a $100 bill \nwhen you fill up that 40-gallon tank. What are we doing about it? We \nare hoping the problem will go away.\n  It is not going to go away. It is going to get worse. We are going to \nbe held hostage again and again. So our alternative is greater \nproduction in the U.S. Keep the jobs at home, keep the dollars at home, \nand for heaven's sake, why can't we do it? We have the technology; we \nhave the know-how.\n  We have a very active, extreme environmental community that is \nopposed to any resource development on public land, whether it be \ngrazing, whether it be timber--timber, of course, is renewable--whether \nit be mining, whether it be oil and gas.\n  This administration doesn't have a policy. They want to tear down the \ndams. They won't do anything about nuclear. Nuclear is 20 percent of \nour energy in this country. They don't have a policy.\n  We are trying to do something about it. I am chairman of the \nRepublican Energy Task Force. We have a legislative package, short-\nterm, interim, and long-term. We are proposing to do away with the \ngasoline tax and not jeopardize the highway trust fund. It can be done. \nIf gasoline gets up to $2 a gallon, or thereabouts, I am of the opinion \nthat we ought to do away with all of the tax. That is a little over 18 \ncents a gallon.\n  We have a positive approach. We are going to stimulate development \nand on public land and on offshore areas. We are going to stimulate \ndevelopment of our agricultural potential in ethanol. My good friend, \nSenator Grassley, has been a proponent of that for some time. We need \nall the domestic sources of energy we can get--the sooner the better--\nto get off this kick of paying tribute to Saddam Hussein.\n  Do not be misled. We have an opportunity to open up an area. We can \ndo it safely. We have the technology.\n  I am going to counter some of the myths that are associated with \nANWR.\n  Some ask: What do you want to open this area for because all of this \nArctic coast is available? It is not available. That is truly a myth. \nWith the exception of the area between the Colville and the Ganning \nRivers, which is owned by the State of Alaska--this little area in \nhere--more than 1,000 miles of the Arctic coastline is closed. That is \njust the harsh fact.\n  What you have over here is a rather interesting piece of real estate \nbecause it happens to be an old naval petroleum reserve, now called the \nPetroleum Reserve Alaska.\n  For heaven's sake, if you can't initiate exploration of a petroleum \nreserve that was designated in the 1900s or thereabouts, where can you? \nWhat an irony. There have been a few leases here. There is some \nproduction in there. But where the independents wanted to lease, the \nDepartment of Interior wouldn't put up the area for lease. As a \nconsequence, that is an unrealistic statement. It is not factual \nbecause this is the Coastal Plain that borders clear around to here, \nand a very small portion is open. That happens to be State land. The \nFederal lands are not open. The Department of Interior won't issue a \npermit. They won't put up a proposed bid. That is just the fact.\n  Let's move a little further.\n  The State of Alaska will get 90 percent of the royalties.\n  That is not true. The royalties are split 50-50, just like they are \nin Oklahoma or Louisiana or any other State.\n  Somebody said Alaska's indigenous people are against all oil \nexploration in the Coastal Plain. That is very inaccurate. There are \nInupiaq people in one Eskimo village called Katiovik that sits right \nhere.\n  I have another chart that shows you a greater portion of where this \nlittle village is. It is the only community within ANWR. They strongly \nsupport onshore exploration for oil and gas. That is in their backyard.\n  Let me give you another example. We have a group called the Gwich'in \nnear the Canadian border who are opposed to opening ANWR.\n  It is kind of interesting. I am going to ask that this be printed in \nthe Record. The Gwich'in at one time offered to lease all of their land \nof 1.799 million acres to the oil industry for exploration. The only \nproblem is the oil industry didn't find any interest there. So they \ndidn't opt to purchase the leases. Maybe they should have. Since that \ntime, the Gwich'in, for the most part, have been funded by the national \nenvironmental groups and the Sierra Club.\n  It is kind of interesting that one of the prominent members' names, \nSarah James, is on the lease. They are free to choose. But, by the same \ntoken, the reality of what they were prepared to do at one time is kind \nof inconsistent with what they have chosen to do now.\n  This is a copy of the lease that I ask unanimous consent to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                    Native Village of Venetie,\n\n                                                   March 21, 1984.\n     To whom it may concern:\n       This letter is authorization for Donald R. Wright, as our \n     consultant, to negotiate with any interested persons or \n     company for the purpose of oil or gas exploration and \n     production on the Venetie Indian Reservation, Alaska; subject \n     to final approval by the Native Village of Venetie Tribal \n     Government Council.\n         Edward Frank, First Chief; Allen Tritt, Second Chief; \n           Virginia Henry, Secretary; Gideon James, Treasurer; \n           Lincoln Trill, Robert Frank, Sr., Lawrence Roberts, \n           Sarah James, Calvin Tritt, Council Members.\n\n                       Native Village of Venetie\n\n\n               request for proposals for oil & gas leases\n\n       The Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government hereby \n     gives formal notice of intention to offer lands for \n     competitive oil and gas lease. This request for proposals \n     involves any or all of the lands and waters of the Venetie \n     Indian Reservation, U.S. Survey No. 5220, Alaska, which \n     aggregates 1,799,927.63 acres, more or less, and is located \n     in the Barrow and Fairbanks Recording Districts, State of \n     Alaska. These lands are bordered by the Yukon River to the \n     South, the Christian River to the East, the Chandalar River \n     to the West and are approximately 100 miles west of the \n     Canadian border on the southern slope of the Brooks Range and \n     about 110 miles East of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. \n     Communities in the vicinity of the proposed sale include \n     Arctic Village, Christian and Venetie. Bidders awarded leases \n     at the sale will acquire the right to explore for, develop \n     and produce the oil and gas that may be discovered within the \n     leased area upon specific terms and provisions established by \n     negotiation, which terms and provisions will conform to the \n     current Federal oil and gas lease where applicable.\n     Bidding Method\n       The bidding method will be cash bonus bidding for a minimum \n     parcel size of one-quarter of a township, or nine (9) \n     sections, which is 5,760 acres, more or less, and a minimum \n     annual rent of $2.00 per acre. There shall be a minimum fixed \n     royalty of twenty percentum (20%).\n     Length of Lease\n       All leases will have an initial primary term of five (5) \n     years.\n     Other Terms of Sale\n       Any bidder who obtains a lease from the Native Village of \n     Venetie Tribal Government as a result of this sale will be \n     responsible for the construction of access roads and capital \n     improvements as may be required. All operations on leased \n     lands will be subject to prior approval by the Native Village \n     of Venetie Tribal Government as required by the lease. \n     Surface entry will be restricted only as necessary to protect \n     the holders of surface interests or as necessary to protect \n     identified surface resource values.\n       Prior to the commencement of lease operations, an oil and \n     gas lease bond for a minimum amount of $10,000.00 per \n     operation is\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n     required. This bonding provision does not affect the Tribal \n     Government's authority to require such additional unusual \n     risk bonds as may be necessary.\n     Bidding procedure\n       Proposals must be received by 12:00 p.m. sixty (60) days \n     from the date of this Request for Proposals, at the office of \n     the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, Attention, \n     Mr. Don Wright, S.R. Box 10402, 1314 Haldiver Way, Fairbanks, \n     Alaska 99701, telephone (907) 479-4271.\n     Additional information\n       A more detailed map of reservation lands and additional \n     information on the proposed leases are available to the \n     bidders and the public by contacting Mr. Don Wright at the \n     office identified above.\n       Dated this 2nd day of April, 1984.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this lease is from the native village \nof Venetie. It has the signatures of Sarah James and a number of \nothers. It is dated April 2, 1984, and it specifically states that the \nacreage offered under the lease is 1,799,927.65 acres, U.S. Survey \n5220.\n  That is where we are relative to the issue of some of the folks who \nfeel that this is not in their interest, but by a long shot that is not \nall the people.\n  I point this out not to condemn the attitude of my constituents but \njust to point out a reality that at one time they were willing to sell \ntheir interest in leasing this land for oil and gas, and now, to a \nlarge degree, their public relations efforts are funded by the Sierra \nClub and others.\n  I will submit at a later time the specific financial contributions \nthat are paid to the Gwich'in by the various environmental \norganizations.\n  What is happening in Alaska is a molding of our State into the image \nthat much of America's environmental community would like to see \nestablished as opposed to the reality associated with the population of \nour State, some 700,000, and the fact that we are the new kids on the \nblock. We have been a State for 41 years. We don't own our own land.\n  Here is the land ownership in Alaska, unlike Illinois or California \nor any other State. We have 368 million acres in our State.\n  What is it made up of? Let's look at private land ownership in our \nState: 5 million acres; less than 2 percent. Why is that? Because the \nFederal Government owns it. OK? We have 51 million acres of national \nparkland; 76 million acres of Fish and Wildlife land; 23 million acres \nof U.S. Forest Service; and 57 million acres of wilderness forever \nlocked up.\n  How much is enough? Where is the balance?\n  This is the Bureau of Land Management alone controls 65 million \nacres. The State has 104 million acres in State land. The State is so \nlucky. It must have had a fortune teller. This little piece of land \nright here is what funds our State, the land it had when it became a \nState.\n  The Natives finally gave land to residents of Alaska. The Natives got \n43 million acres. But the Federal Government owns our State. That is \njust the reality.\n  Some say we need to save ANWR for our grandchildren. We need to know \nif oil is there. If there isn't, it is not going to be developed. You \nhave to find a lot of oil in Alaska before drilling. Otherwise you \ncan't afford to drill it. If they cannot produce 5,000 barrels a day, \nthe cost is not economical.\n  Prudhoe Bay came in. It is 30-year-old technology. It is a pretty big \nfootprint. We went from there to Endicott. Endicott is up in this area.\n  The significance is that when it came on it was the tenth largest \nproducing field in the United States. It came in at a little over \n100,000 barrels a day. Today, it is the seventh largest producing \nfield. The footprint is 56 acres because it is all directional drilling \nfrom one spot. It makes sense in Alaska, but the costs are high. We \ncould do a better job if we had an opportunity over here.\n  As a consequence of whether we need this oil now or later, we had \nbetter find out whether it is there or not. They can only do that \nthrough exploration. Then they can make a decision.\n  As a consequence of this, we run into one other argument, which \nreally bewilders me because it is so unrealistic. They say, well, the \nCoastal Plain may only have a 200-day supply of oil, and that is not \nworth developing.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about it. First of all, Prudhoe Bay was \nsupposed to have 9 billion barrels of oil. It has been producing now \nfor 23 years. We have had a total of 12 billion barrels from Prudhoe \nBay in the last 23 years. We were supposed to get 10 billion barrels. \nIt is still producing at a million barrels a day. It is good for \nanother 10 years with the technology that we have.\n  When you say this only has a 200, do you know what you are implying? \nAn unrealistic argument because you are saying the rest of our domestic \noil production would stop. That is totally unrealistic. A two-hundred-\nday supply, but that is assuming the rest of the oil is produced \ndomestically in this country is going to stop. First of all, it is not \ngoing to stop; is it? That is an argument so full of holes that it \ndefies imagination.\n  Let me show you what happens when we bring oil on line from Alaska \nand what it does to our imports because I think it states in no \nuncertain terms the reality associated with the opportunity we have \nnow.\n  Let's recognize what has happened here. This body passed ANWR 5 years \nago, in 1995.\n  The President vetoed it. Had he not vetoed it, today we would have \nhad a lease sale and we would know what the prospects for a major \ndiscovery were. We might be within a very short time of production.\n  Somebody says opening ANWR will not have any impact. Wrong. Here is \nthe proof. This chart identifies our imports in 1975, 1976, 1977, and \n1978. They were going up dramatically, 6 or 7 million barrels a day. We \ndeveloped Prudhoe Bay in 1976, the current field we have. We can see \nwhen it came online and production increased, imports dropped \ndramatically, it was a major contribution. It was 2 million barrels a \nday, 25 percent of our total domestic production.\n  To open up Prudhoe Bay, it took this Senate meeting in this Chamber \nwith a tied vote. Vice President Spiro Agnew broke the tie. That is why \nwe have Prudhoe Bay today. That is why we have production of 20 to 25 \npercent of our crude oil. That is reality.\n  Don't be misled by the myths. We are not going to destroy the Coastal \nPlain. We are not going to destroy the caribou. We are only going to \nallow activity in the wintertime when the caribou come through and \ncalve. As the picture demonstrates, caribou are healthy for the most \npart. Do not suggest we cannot address our concern over the migratory \nPorcupine caribou herd; we can do it if given the opportunity.\n  Somebody says ANWR oil will be exported and not reduce our \ndependency. I have received a letter from BP that says they are \ncurtailing their small amount of exported oil.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               BP Amoco Corp.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2000.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I would like to respond to your inquiry \n     regarding BP Amoco's plans concerning Alaska North Slope oil \n     exports. Pending completion of contracts due at the end of \n     April, at this time we do not have subsequent plans to \n     export.\n       We applaud the Administration and the Congress for its \n     wisdom to permit the market to work and to remove an \n     historical penalty imposed on Alaska North Slope oil. The \n     West Coast is part of the global crude market. The ultimate \n     destination of Alaskan crude has no effect on either West \n     Coast supply or gasoline prices. Once our acquisition of ARCO \n     is complete, we would expect to run all of our Alaska crude \n     through ARCO's excellent West Coast refining and marketing \n     network.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Larry D. Burton,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That situation may be resolved by the takeover by \nPhillips of ARCO. BP did not have on the west coast any refineries. \nARCO did.\n  To make a long story short, with BP acquiring ARCO refineries, there \nwill not be a surplus on the west coast. I think the amount varied. \nThere were up to 60,000 barrels a day at one time. I have been assured \nas a consequence of the change, the purchase by Phillips of ARCO, that \nthe little oil that was exported will be terminated simply because it \nwill be utilized by BP in their refinery.\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\n  Some say any development in Alaska would be environmentally damaging. \nPeople might not like oil fields, but Prudhoe Bay is the best oil field \nin the world. We can do a better job if we can get into ANWR; there is \nno question about it.\n  They say the Coastal Plain is unspoiled. Let me say something about \nthe Coastal Plain. It is not unspoiled. In one sense, there is an \nEskimo village there. Those people live there. There are a couple of \nradar sites that are, and for all practical purposes have been \nabandoned. This section of the State is pretty remote. One cannot find \nanything much more remote than this particular area of our State. It is \nprobably one of the better areas if one were looking for less of an \nimpact on mankind and animal-kind.\n  Some ask what will happen to the birds. Most of the birds are near \nthe lakes. Birds come in, they migrate. The issue isn't that there are \nno birds in ANWR, because there are.\n  Some ask about the polar bears. They den on the ice; they do not come \nashore. A few do. Do you know what we have done to save the polar bear? \nWe don't allow the white man to shoot the polar bear in our State. You \ncan't shoot them. That is the greatest threat they have. The native \npeople can keep them for subsistence. A white man can go to Canada or \nRussia and take a polar bear. So that is a bogus argument. We are \nprotecting the polar bear. To suggest a little exploration is going to \nthreaten the polar bear is a specious argument.\n  This is what the press and the public do not digest. I guess we have \na hard time communicating that reality.\n  Here is another picture of our friends taking a walk. Three bears are \nwalking on top of the pipeline. Why are they walking on the pipeline? \nBecause it is easier than walking in the snow. They don't get their \nfeet cold or damp. It is just easier.\n  The predictions that were associated with developing Prudhoe Bay have \nnot come true. They said: You are putting a fence across Alaska; the \ncaribou and the moose will never cross it. When you put a hotline in \npermafrost, it will sink to China.\n  These things never happened. That pipeline is one of the construction \nwonders of the world. It has been bombed, shot at, dynamited, not to \nmention having withstood earthquakes. We had a bad accident with a ship \ncalled the Exxon Valdez. It was the fault of the crew. We had a 10-and-\na-half-wide channel, and they ran on to a rock because they were \ndrinking coffee and not paying attention. That is a harsh reality of \nthat. Then they took on a little alcohol and everything was lost.\n  The public ought to understand reality. I would love to debate some \nof the extreme environmentalists because they don't know what they are \ntalking about, but they won't give me the courtesy or the chance. They \nrefuse to let me participate in any of their gatherings. We have a \nletter that gives an idea of the extent to which some of the \nenvironmentalists go to generate public opinion. They are entitled to \nthat, but by the same token, we are entitled to communicate some of the \ntactics.\n  In a letter from the Sierra Club, Friday, January 2000, called ``The \nNew Millennium Action Special Edition,'' it says:\n  This February 5th, the Sierra Club, together with the Alaska \nWilderness League, the Wilderness Society, the National Audubon \nSociety, is hosting another National Arctic Wilderness Week in \nWashington. Supporters from grass roots are key in protecting \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and its fragile Coastal Plain. This \ngathering will help arm you with the skills and knowledge you need to \nbuild support in your community.\n\n  They give hands-on training. They will provide you with opportunities \nfor training. You will learn how to intensify your skills in lobbying, \nmessage development, meetings, communications and legislative advocacy. \nAll are worthwhile and appropriate.\n  It says further: We've got you covered.\n  That is the last paragraph: ``We know your time is valuable so we \ndon't ask you to cover all your expenses for the trip.''\n  A trip from where? A trip from Alaska, that's where. It is expensive, \nabout a $1,000 to get here from Alaska. It also says that you need to \npay a $40 registration fee, but if you don't have it, some scholarships \nare available. Where does that money come from? The Wilderness Society \nand the Sierra Club of course:\n\n       We'll pay for your travel to Washington, DC, your hotel, \n     two in a room, a continental breakfast each morning and \n     several dinners. Unfortunately, space is limited so hurry up. \n     To find out if you are eligible phone the Sierra Club.\n\n  I don't know any development groups that have that kind of money to \ndo that kind of lobbying. Nevertheless, that is reality. It is fair \ngame. Just make sure the public knows about it. Many of these people \nhave never been to ANWR. That is what bothers me. I have been there. I \ntake a group of Senators up there every year so they can see for \nthemselves and make their own evaluation as they represent their State.\n  One of the things I will conclude with: If you are from the Northeast \ncorridor and you are sick and tired of high prices for heating oil, you \nhaven't seen anything yet. The Northeast corridor is just getting \nstarted. And here is why.\n\n  This is the harsh reality of where we are today. Our crude production \nis represented by this gray line. It is roughly 6 million barrels a day \ndomestically, this is down from 7.5 million. So our crude production is \ndropping. It is dropping significantly. The crude oil production is \ndropping and the petroleum demand is going up. What is happening here \nis the crude oil production has dropped about 17 percent, and the \npetroleum demand, which is the black line, has gone up 14 percent. So \nwe have a shortfall. So we have to make up the difference.\n  We have had the heating oil crisis in the Northeast corridor. There \nwas an assumption we would have a cold winter. We didn't. There was an \nassumption we would have storage. A funny thing is, 20 percent of the \ncrude oil storage in the Northeast corridor has been eliminated because \nit did not meet legitimate environmental concerns, as well as 15 \npercent of the heating oil storage. These are old tanks that didn't \nmeet specs and were not rebuilt.\n  We have lost 37 refineries in this country in the last decade. Why? \nThe refinery business is not too attractive for a lot of reasons. You \nhave Superfund exposures, you have EPA requirements, you have a \nsituation where the return on investment is questionable. Many of the \nmajors have gone out of the refining business because of the \nconsequences associated with that.\n  So you have a situation now where the Northeast corridor better look \nout for their high electric bills. This winter it was high heating oil \nbills, but it is going to be electric bills this summer. Only 3 percent \nof the Nation's electricity comes from oil-fired generating plants, but \nthat is not true in the Northeast corridor. It is nearly one-third. New \nEngland relies on fuel oil for about a third of its power generation. \nJust a small handful of those plants will be setting the electric \nprices in the region during the periods of high demand. This is going \nto cost Northeast residents millions of dollars. So what do they want \nus to do about it? Do they want us to import more oil, or do they want \nus to relieve our dependence by producing safely and domestically?\n  The arguments I get from all of the Northeast groups: You can't open \nANWR. You cannot do it safely. They are breathing the fire of the \nradical environmental movement that wants three things: They want a \ncause, they want dollars, and they want membership. They sell America \nshort--especially America's ingenuity and our technical ability. The \nfact is, we can produce energy here at home. They will not debate me. \nThey refuse, they absolutely refuse.\n  So this is what is going to happen in the Northeast corridor. I hope \nthe newspapers and their editorial writers start figuring this out \nbecause it is going to happen. Remember when you heard it first.\n  Electricity establishes a rate structure from a uniform price. Under \nthat method, the central dispatchers first tap generation offering to \nsell electricity at the lowest price. But as the demand goes up, air-\nconditioning use goes up, and you are going to see the more costly \ngenerating powerplants come on line. Those are the ones that are oil \nfired.\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\n  The power purchasers pay all bidders the price charged by the last \npowerplant called into service. In many cases, the final unit will be \nan old, oil-fired plant which will charge a rate higher because of the \nhigher oil prices. All other non-oil-burning plants will reap a \nwindfall profit because they will be paid as if burning oil. That is \nthe way the process works. I hope somebody can take heed of what I am \ntelling you. New England relies on 30 percent fuel oil for its own \npower generators.\n  What do they want us to do? They say: Alternative energy. Fine. Let's \ndo it. What are we going to do? Four percent is what we produce \ncurrently.\n  Let's spend more on development. We are. We do not have the hydrogen \ntechnology yet.\n  In the meantime, we have an opportunity for domestic relief, and I \nimplore those people up there to seize that opportunity. It is as if \nthey are born with their eyes closed, and they keep them closed to the \nreality that we can open these areas safely. They say: The Senator from \nAlaska comes to the floor and his motivation is selfish.\n\n  Sure, I represent my State. Sure, this is in my State. But my State \ndoesn't consume it. Sure, we get half the revenue, just like Oklahoma \nor any other area. But this is domestic energy for domestic jobs paying \ndomestic taxes and providing for the national energy security of this \nNation.\n  Some of these other folks would rather have us import it from Saddam \nHussein. That is where it is coming from, 700,000 barrels a day, from a \ncountry where we lost 147 servicemen fighting a war.\n  So we are going to be facing higher prices. Non-oil-burning plants \nare going to reap a huge windfall. New England is going to take it and \nthey are going to scream and ask why we are not doing something about \nit. It has been estimated an oil plant that offered electricity at $37 \na megawatt hour for power 1 year ago is probably going to be seeking a \nprice of $75 or more because they are going to have to buy oil on the \nopen market. Remember, oil has gone from $10 to over $30. That is \nsignificant.\n  There are a couple of other factors a lot of people overlook. There \nis an inflation factor. They figure every time oil goes up $10, it \ncontributes about \\1/2\\ percent to inflation. We have seen the truckers \ncome to Washington. They came twice. Do you know why they were here? \nBecause they cannot pass on the increased price of diesel fuel. They \nare stuck. They are going out of business.\n  Wait until you see the farmers when they start fueling up to plant \ntheir crops. They are going to be screaming. They will be driving their \ntractors to Washington. They will want relief. The relief of this \nadministration is to go beg for more oil production in the Mideast. I \nfind it inexcusable.\n  We concern ourselves with the deficit in the balance of payments, \n$300 billion a year. That means we are buying more from countries than \nthey are buying from us. But of the $300 billion, $100 billion is the \ncost of imported oil. We are sending our jobs overseas. We have seen \nemployment in the domestic oil industry drop dramatically.\n  It is important that Members understand what has happened to this \ncountry and to our ability to maintain a growing industry that we have \nbecome so dependent on, and what a poor job we have done on it. What we \nhave done, under this administration, is to simply import more oil, \npropose more taxes. I think the administration's tax proposal is about \n$2.5 billion this year.\n  We have seen the gas tax, 4.3 cents a gallon. I would like to do a \nlittle short review because I remember 1993. I remember when the \nRepublicans lost control of this body and the Democrats took control \nand the administration came in with a huge Btu tax--British thermal \nunit--a tax on energy. We defeated that tax then. It is a good thing we \ndid. But we also had a 4.3 cent-per-gallon gas tax and that was not \ngoing to go into the highway trust fund. That was proposed to go into \nthe general fund.\n  We had a vote. Every Republican voted against it. We had six \nDemocrats join us. The vote was tied. Vice President Al Gore broke the \ntie, and that is why we have the 30-percent increase in the gas tax \nthat went on in 1993 at 4.3 cents a gallon. Our Vice President, who \nbroke that tie, deserves accolades, if you will, because he bears that \nresponsibility. We are living with it today, and it has cost the \ntaxpayers somewhere in the area of $43 million.\n\n  That gives us some idea of the background of how we got to where we \nare and what kind of a policy this administration has toward our energy \ncrisis. They hope it will go away. There is so much finger pointing \naround here that one cannot believe it.\n  The Secretary of Energy the other day said an interesting thing. He \nsaid: We were caught by surprise; we were caught napping.\n  Come on. Let's recognize facts, and facts are that in 1994 the \nindependent petroleum producers were concerned about our dependence on \nimports. They solicited Secretary Brown under the Trade Expansion Act \nand asked him to do an evaluation of the national security risk, and he \ndid. As a consequence of that, even the President acknowledged our \nenergy dependence on the Mideast and our oil imports affect the \nnational security interests of the Nation.\n  He did that. What happened? Nothing. There was no relief. So we went \nalong even more. In any event, nothing was done. Time went on. We \nbecame more dependent. As a consequence, we found ourselves in a \nsituation last March where many of us became concerned. We became so \nconcerned that we wrote a bipartisan letter to the Secretary of \nCommerce, Secretary Daley.\n  I have the letter dated March 21 to our President. I am going to \nquote what he said in November after he received the report from the \nDepartment of Commerce by Secretary Daley. He said:\n\n       I'm today concurring with the Department of Commerce's \n     finding that the Nation's growing reliance on the imports of \n     crude oil and refined petroleum products threaten the \n     Nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to \n     oil supply interruption.\n\n  He was on notice in 1994.\n  To bring my colleagues up to date, in March of last year a bipartisan \nletter went to Secretary Daley asking him to again initiate, under the \nTrade Expansion Act, an evaluation of the danger to our national \nsecurity because of our increased dependence on imports. That was done. \nIt was delivered to the White House in November of last year, and the \nWhite House either did not open their mail, sat on it, or put it at the \nbottom of the stack. In any event, they have refused to release that \nreport.\n  Clearly, it is going to say the same thing. The national security of \nour Nation is at risk because of our increased dependence on imported \noil. I am told we are looking at billions of dollars of increased \nappropriations this year for the military so they can have fuel for our \ndefense. We have another case of this administration refusing to \nrecognize reality. It is as though they want to get out of town before \nthis becomes a political issue or before the American people understand \nthe danger of what is happening because of our increased dependence on \nimported oil.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John Warner, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, our majority \nleader, Trent Lott, and I as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, all wrote a letter to the President asking him why \nhe has not opened that report he received in November from the \nSecretary of Commerce. We asked why he has not shared that with the \nAmerican people, and to tell us whether our national security is at \nrisk because of our increased dependence, again on our old buddy, \nSaddam Hussein. How ironic. What goes around comes around.\n  Last year, we had 300,000 barrels a day from Saddam Hussein; this \nyear, 700,000 barrels a day. The fastest growing source of our imports \nis coming from Iraq. I will say it again and again and again. In 1991, \nwe lost 147 lives, 448 soldiers were wounded, 23 were taken prisoner, \nand the U.S. taxpayers paid $10 billion to fence in Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Where does this oil go? It goes to the United States--to you and me, \nand for our airplanes and cars. Where does the money go? Do you think \nit goes to the people of Iraq? It goes to Saddam Hussein who controls \nthe flow of that money. Do you know where most of it goes? It goes to \nthe Republican Guard that guards him and keeps him alive. He has \nprobably had more assassination attempts than we know. But he takes \ngood care of those people. How does he do it? He has one source of\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\ncash-flow--oil. I just cannot accept the policies of this \nadministration to enrich that man.\n  We have the farmers, and we have the truckers. Mr. President, have \nyou flown lately? Have you looked at your airplane tickets? They put on \na surcharge. Nobody can figure out what the ticket costs anyway. If it \nis a short trip, it is $20. If it is a long trip, it is $40.\n  Have you received a FedEx package lately? There is a surcharge added.\n  Pretty soon, the American people are going to wake up. A surcharge is \ngoing to be on everything. They say: Oil really hasn't affected \ninflation. Don't be too sure it has not hit yet.\n  Do my colleagues think we will get relief? We will see what happens \non Monday. Anything that happens on Monday is 8 weeks getting to your \ngas station. That is the harsh reality.\n  The policy of this administration is more imports. That is it. They \nnever learn by history: 37-percent dependent in 1973; 47-percent \ndependent when we fought the war in the Persian Gulf; 56-percent \ndependent now; 65-percent, according to the Department of Energy, in \nthe year 2015 to 2020. Does it behoove us to take action now? I think \nso.\n  I told you a little bit about exploration and production. Here is \nwhat happened in our employment in energy: 405,000 employed is down to \n293,000. That is the position we are in.\n  Our oil production domestically dropped from about 7 billion to about \n6 billion in this period of time because we don't have an aggressive \nposture. It is not that we do not have oil and gas. This administration \nwill declare victory, I guess, on the 27th if OPEC releases more oil. \nBut I think Americans are going to have to ask a basic question, a \nsimpler question, and that is: Will the administration's actions \ndecrease our oil dependence or increase it? That is the basic question, \nand the American people ought to understand it.\n  Next Monday is March 27, and they say there will be an increase in \nforeign production of another 1 million to 2 million barrels. Then the \nadministration--the Secretary of Energy and the President--is going to \nclaim victory. They will say: We have more oil.\n  How hollow, because it is going to increase our dependence, it is \ngoing to give them more leverage. We are going to have another crisis. \nThey said OPEC could never get together and did not have the \ndiscipline. They did. They got together. They would rather sell their \noil at a higher price than sell less oil, obviously. They would like to \nsee it somewhere at $20 to $25 to keep us on the hook. That is the \nthought.\n  I encourage the American people to ask: Is this in our national \ninterest to swallow the administration's claim of victory? If indeed \nthere is a significant increase coming, if we swallow the \nadministration's claim of victory that it is in the Nation's interest \nto become more dependent on imported oil, or strike out with an \naggressive posture based on American technology and American can-do \nspirit to develop resources at home in the overthrust belt in my State \nof Alaska?\n  I implore my colleagues who want to speak on behalf of America's \nenvironmental community, to know what they are talking about. I ask \nthem to get up to ANWR and Prudhoe Bay and take a look at it. See what \nwe have done and look at some other oil fields. Just do not take the \nword of the self-anointed environmental groups that have a mission. \nThat mission is membership, dollars, and a cause.\n  I am not suggesting they do not make a significant contribution. The \nproblem is that they refuse to recognize that we are going to be \nneeding crude oil--petroleum products--for a long time. They refuse to \nrecognize that we are better off developing domestically than importing \nit. They refuse to recognize where we are getting our imports, the \nsignificant role of our rock. They refuse to recognize the role of the \nlives we lost in the Persian Gulf war. They refuse to recognize we have \ndone a pretty good job in developing oil and gas resources. We can do a \nbetter job, if given the opportunity.\n  I do appreciate the time that has been allotted to me today.\n  I think it is important to recognize that, in all honesty, we do not \nhave an oil policy, we do not have an energy policy. I fear my \ncolleagues from the Northeast are going to be exposed to substantial \nincreases in electricity.\n  I have the obligation to proceed with electric reliability bills, \nelectric restructuring. But the fact is, they are going to be dependent \non fuel oil making electricity. The price is going to be a lot higher \nthan they have ever had before. People are going to be asking, What are \nyou doing about it to relieve the problem? I hope their answer is not \nsolely to increase imports.\n  I again extend my willingness to travel to the Northeast corridor, my \nwillingness to meet with the editorial writers of the Northeast papers \nthat continually misrepresent facts. I encourage them to give us an \nopportunity to be heard. I encourage them to come on up and take a look \nand spend the money so they can objectively make recommendations and \ndecisions upon those to whom they and their papers and their media \nextend themselves.\n  I would like them to know that our Governor, and our delegation would \nlove to have you. We will treat you with a level of hospitality that \nyou will find quite suitable and quite comfortable. You might want to \nbring some long underwear though.\n  Give us an opportunity to contribute to this country.\n  The last thing I want to say is, we became a State in 1959. That was \n41 years ago, or thereabouts. The rest of the country established their \nland patterns 100, 150 years ago. We are still trying to develop an \neconomy. We have 700,000 people. We are trying to develop a university. \nWe don't have any roads across our State. The Federal Government owns \nit. We are dependent on natural resources. Our fish are renewable. Our \ntimber is renewable. We also have a lot of oil and gas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1651-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE RETURNED TO CALENDAR--S. 2251\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I alert my colleagues that an \nextraordinary thing happened yesterday in the House of Representatives. \nThe House accepted the Senate bill on nuclear waste without amending \nthe Senate bill.\n  As the occupant of the Chair knows, oftentimes the House has a little \ndifference of opinion on what is good for the country. The bill we \npassed in the Senate on nuclear waste had certainly a vigorous debate \nin this body. There were 64 votes recorded for the legislation which \nwould resolve what to do with our high-level nuclear waste and how to \nproceed with the dilemma associated with the reality that the Federal \nGovernment had entered into a contract in 1998 to take this waste from \nthe electric-power-generating units that were dependent on nuclear \nenergy. This is the high-level rods that have partially reduced their \nenergy capacity and have to be stored. We have had this continued \nbuildup of high-level waste adjacent to our reactors.\n  The significance of this is that this industry contributes about 20 \npercent of our power generation in this country. There are those who \ndon't favor nuclear energy and, as a consequence, would like to see the \nnuclear industry come to an end. But they accept no responsibility for \nwhere the power is going to be made up. Clearly, if you lose a \nsignificant portion, you will have to make it up someplace else.\n  The point of this was to try to come to grips with a couple of \nthings. One is that the ratepayers have paid the Federal Government $15 \nbillion over an extended period of time to take the waste in 1998. The \nsecond issue is the cost to the taxpayers because since the Federal \nGovernment has failed to meet the terms of the contract and honor the \nsanctity of the contract agreement, there are damages and litigation \nfrom the power companies to the Federal Government. That cost is \nestimated to be somewhere in the area of $40 to $80 billion to the \ntaxpayer in legal fees associated with these claims that only the court \nwill finally adjudicate.\n  By passing the Senate bill in the House--I believe the vote was 275--\nindeed, it moved the issue closer to a resolve. Many in this body would \nlike to not address it. That is irresponsible, both from the standpoint \nof the taxpayer and from the standpoint of the sanctity of a \ncontractual commitment. If we don't do it, somebody else is going to \nhave to do it on a later watch.\n  The difficulty is, nobody wants the nuclear waste. But if you throw \nit up in the air, it is going to come down somewhere.\n  France reprocesses theirs. The French learned something in 1973, \nduring the Arab oil embargo. They learned that they would never be held \nhostage by the Mideast oil barons and be subservient to whatever the \ndictates of those oil nations were and what it cost the French economy \nin 1973. As a consequence, they proceeded towards the development of a \nnuclear power capability second to none. About 92 percent France's \npower is generated by nuclear energy. They have addressed the issue of \nthe waste by reprocessing it through recycling, recovering the \nplutonium, putting it back in the reactors, and recovering the residue. \nThe residue, after you take the high-level plutonium out, has a very \nshort life. It is called vitrification.\n  In any event, we are stuck still. We can't resolve what to do with \nour waste. But we have a bill that has moved out of the House. It is \nour bill. I have every belief it will go down to the White House. We \nwill have to see if the President wants to reconsider his veto threat \nin view of the energy crisis we have in this country now and the fact \nthat the administration does not have an energy policy, let alone the \nwillingness to address its responsibility under the contractual terms \nto accept the waste. If the administration chooses to veto it, we have \nthe opportunity for a veto override. In this body, we are two votes \nshort.\n  I encourage my colleagues, particularly over this weekend as they go \nhome, to recognize that this issue is going to be revisited in this \nbody. If they have nuclear reactors in their State and they don't \nsupport a veto override, they are going to have to wear the badge, the \nidentification of being with those who want to keep the waste in their \nState. That is where it will stay. It will stay in temporary storage \nnear the reactors that are overcrowded and that were not designed for \nlong-term storage. It will never get out of their State unless we come \ntogether and move this legislation, if the President does not sign it \nnow that it has gone through the House and Senate.\n\n  Unfortunately, this would put the waste ultimately in Nevada where we \nhave had 50 years of nuclear testing out in the desert, an area that \nhas already been pretty heavily polluted. We have spent over $7 billion \nin Nevada at Yucca Mountain where we are building a permanent \nrepository. Quite naturally, the Nevadans, my colleagues, will throw \nthemselves down on the railroad track to keep this from happening.\n  But the point is, you have to put it somewhere. In my State of \nAlaska, we don't currently have any reactors.\n  As chairman of the Energy Committee, my responsibility is to try to \naddress this national problem, with a resolve. What we have, obviously, \nis this legislation that has passed both the House and the Senate. It \nwill be back. It will be revisited. I encourage my colleagues to \nrecognize that we have a responsibility to address this on our watch. \nIf we put it off, somebody else is going to have to address it. It is \ngoing to cost the taxpayer more. Now is the time, since we finally have \na bill that has gone through the House and Senate.\n  The interesting thing is, had the House taken up our bill and amended \nit, we would be hopelessly lost because there would be a filibuster on \nappointment of conferees. It would take 9 days or something like that. \nIt could not be done.\n  That didn't happen in the House. I commend the Speaker, Denny \nHastert, for keeping a commitment. I commend our leader, Senator Lott, \nwho made a commitment that we were going to bring this up. Not only did \nwe bring it up but we passed it.\n  I alert my colleagues, again, what goes around comes around. We are \ngoing to get this back. If you are against it, you had better come up \nwith something else that is a better idea. Otherwise, it will stay in \nyour State. If you want to get it out of your State in a permanent \nrepository, you had better get behind this bill, if we have to go for a \nveto override.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, are we in morning business at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today I came to the floor, as did \nseveral of my colleagues, to discuss what I believe is now nearing a \ncrisis in our country; that is, the tremendous runup in the price of \nenergy that we have watched for well over 3 months creep up on the \nreader boards at the local gas station or in fuel bills for those in \nhomes heated with fuel oil.\n  A lot of Americans are scratching their heads and saying: What is \nhappening? Last year, at this time out in\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nNorthern Virginia, I purchased regular gasoline for 78 cents a gallon. \nThere was a bit of a price war going on at that time that probably bid \nthe price down 10 or 12 cents, but there is no question that America's \ndriving public a year ago was paying at least 100 percent less, in some \ninstances, than they are paying today.\n  It is right and reasonable to ask why? What has happened? What \nhappened is obvious to many who watched the energy issue. I serve on \nthe Energy Committee. For the last several years, we have become quite \nnervous about the fact that we as Americans have grown increasingly \ndependent on foreign sources of crude oil to fuel the economy of this \ncountry. Several speakers on the floor today, and over the past several \ndays, have talked about a dependency that has gone up from 30-plus \npercent in the 1970s to over 55 percent today for oil flowing in from \noutside the United States.\n  Why is that happening? Why don't we have a policy stopping it? Why \nare all these things happening at a time when our economy is doing so \nwell?\n  This morning I joined some of my colleagues to discuss some of the \nwhys. This country, for at least the last 8 years, has been without an \nenergy policy. When the current Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, \ncame to that seat, I asked him in his confirmation hearing: If we don't \nhave an energy program, can't we at least have an energy policy that \nlooks at all aspects of the energy basket--both, of course, crude oil \nfor the hydrocarbons and for all that it provides for our country, a \nrecognition of electrical generation in this country, both nuclear, \nhydro, and certainly coal fired and oil fired? He assured me that would \nbe the case.\n  Of course, today, that simply isn't the case. In the budgets this \nDepartment of Energy has presented to this Congress in the last 2 \nyears, there has been a tremendous increase in the money the Clinton-\nGore administration has wanted to allocate for solar and wind, but they \nhave constantly dropped the research dollars on hydro production or \nclean coal production for the use of coal in the firing of our \nelectrical generating facilities.\n  While all of that has been going on, there has been something else \nthat I find fascinating and extremely disturbing: a progressive effort \nto lock up exploration and development of our public lands and public \nareas where the last of our oil reserves exist. The administration has \nnot tried to encourage domestic production. In most instances, they \nhave openly discouraged it or they have set the environmental bar so \nhigh that no one company can afford to jump over it.\n  Over the course of the last 5 or 6 years, we have seen a tremendous \nnumber of our production companies leave this country. In fact, the CEO \nof one company sat in my office 5 years ago in a rather embarrassing \nway saying: Senator, after having been in this country drilling, \ndeveloping, and producing oil and gas for almost 100 years, my company \nis being forced to leave the United States if we want to stay \nprofitable or productive.\n  Of course, that company did largely go overseas. That is an American \ncompany and they will be producing oil and gas. But they are, in most \ninstances, producing for a foreign government, and they don't control \ntheir supply. Most importantly, that supply is not a U.S. supply. It is \na foreign supply being brought into this country, dramatically changing \nour balance of trade. Of course, many of those nations are members of \nOPEC or are other oil-producing nations that are, in part, causing the \nproblems our consumers are currently experiencing.\n\n  I have found it fascinating over the last several years as we have \nwatched this administration refuse to acknowledge our vast reserves of \noil and gas, offshore, and in Alaska. The Senator from Alaska, chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was on the floor to \nspeak for the last hour about one of the great remaining reserves in \nnorthern Alaska that could be tapped, and tapped in a sound and safe \nenvironmental way so the beautiful area would not be damaged. \nLiterally, tens of thousands of barrels a day of oil could be produced \nfrom that region of our country and brought into the lower 48 to be \nrefined and sold.\n  The Rocky Mountain overthrust belt in my area of the country is \nlargely now off limits to further exploration and production. Yet in \nthe 1970s and the early 1980s a lot of the new domestic production in \nour country came from the overthrust belt areas of Wyoming and \nColorado.\n  We have seen the Clinton administration recently announced a ban on \nany future exploration of many areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, \nwhere some of the largest oil reserves exist today, all in the name of \nthe environment. Even though some of the great new technologies have \nallowed the kind of development in the Gulf of Mexico and other areas \nwhere the chance of a spill is almost nonexistent today. In fact, the \ngreatest concern for a spill is not drilling and development and \ntransfer onshore of crude oil; it is the shipping in the great \nsupertankers from all around the world. That is where the greater risk \nto our oceans exist, not offshore oil production. Yet this \nadministration, all in the name of the environment, says, no, we will \nnot develop our offshore capabilities.\n  In 1996, the administration resorted to the little-used Antiquities \nAct. I mentioned that earlier this morning. They made 23 billion tons \nof low-sulpher mineable coal off limits to production in southern Utah. \nThe U.S. Forest Service issued road construction policies designed to \nrestrict the energy industry's ability to explore for gas and oil on \nForest Service lands. The Clinton-Gore administration has vetoed \nlegislation that would have opened the coastal plain, as I mentioned, \nin the remote Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, where an estimated 16 \nbillion barrels of domestic oil may be found.\n  The administration has ignored a report prepared by the National \nPetroleum Council requested by the Energy Secretary explaining how the \nNation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas \nresources from about 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 \ntrillion cubic feet per year over the next 10 to 12 years.\n  Doable? Yes. Environmentally sound? Yes. A clean fuel source? Yes. \nThen why aren't we doing it? Because we have an administration that is \nhostile to the idea of actually producing in this country and providing \nfor this country, and their 8 years of record clearly show that.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has shown little interest in solving \nthese kinds of domestic problems and, as a result, as I mentioned \nearlier, we have watched our dependence on foreign crude tick up to 56 \npercent of our total crude demand. The price last year of a barrel of \ncrude was around $10 and peaked last week at somewhere near $34 a \nbarrel.\n  Did we see it coming? You bet we did. Has the administration known \nit? Yes, they have. On two different occasions, and in two very well-\ndeveloped reports over the last several years, that message has been so \nclearly sent to this administration.\n  Why would they ignore it? There are probably a lot of reasons, and I \nhave already expressed some of those reasons why this country cannot \nuse its energy resources.\n  Yesterday, my distinguished friend from West Virginia, Senator Robert \nByrd, spoke eloquently on the floor on this very subject. Of course, \nhis State of West Virginia is a great coal State, a great producing \nState. The United States has the world's largest demonstrated coal \nreserve base and accounts for more than 90 percent of our total fossil \nenergy reserve. In other words, we have more coal than any other \ncountry. Yet we have an administration that truly wants to deny the use \nof it or the development of technologies that will cause it to be \nburned in an ever increasingly clean way.\n  At the present rate of recovery and use, U.S. coal reserves can last \nus for more than 270 years. Let me repeat that. For 270 years, we can \nbe self-sufficient at our current level of coal consumption. Of course, \nwe all know the technology that will develop over that period of time \nthat might well make the use of fossil fuels unnecessary at some point \nin the distant future.\n  Coal is used to generate over 56 percent of our electrical supply and \nabout 88 percent of the Midwest's electrical needs. Coal use for \nelectrical power has risen more than 250 percent since 1970, while \nsulfur dioxide emissions has decreased to 21 percent below the 1970 \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\n  While there has been a dramatic increase in the use of coal, there \nhas been a dramatic drop in coal-fired emissions. Why? Technology, the \napplication of technology, the kind of combustion technology that has \ncontinued to drive down emissions and make continued use of coal \neconomically attractive.\n  Why shouldn't we be putting more research dollars into even better \ntechnology? Of course, we should, but it does not show up in this \nadministration's budget. Not at all. They want windmills and solar \ncells. The last I checked, to provide electricity for Los Angeles with \nsolar energy, one has to cover the whole State of Arizona with solar \npanels. President Clinton, don't you understand that would be \nenvironmentally unsound? It would not make a lot of sense and would not \nbe a very, shall we say, aesthetically valuable thing to do.\n  Somehow they are caught in this mythical illusion: Pop up a solar \ncell, put a propeller on the end of a stick, tie a generator to it, and \nthe world is going to light up. We simply know that is not the case \nwhen it comes to the kinds of energy we need to fuel our households and \ndrive our industries. That kind of energy has to be of large capacity. \nIt has to have the ability to peak and  supply our needs during high-\ndemand periods. Of course, it says little for the need of America's \nfarmers and ranchers when they go to the pump this year to find out \ntheir energy costs have now doubled.\n\n  What about nuclear? Nuclear drives 20 percent of our electrical \nneeds, and yet this administration is the most antinuclear \nadministration in the history of this country. They have on every \noccasion attempted to block the effective storage of nuclear waste, \nhigh-level waste, the kind that comes from nuclear generation of \nelectricity. They are basically saying to the electricity industry, the \npower industry, at least the generating industry: Don't build any more \nnuclear plants, even though there are no emissions from such plants. If \nyou want to strive to get to the clean air standards that we want in \nour unattainment areas, you cannot do it any other way than to assure \nthat we at least maintain the 20 percent of our electricity being \ngenerated by nuclear power.\n  What does that mean? It means we have to bring newer reactors online, \nsafer reactors with new technology. Yet this administration will not \ninvest in the necessary research.\n  In November of 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency sued several \ncoal-burning utilities claiming they made major modifications in their \nfacilities without applying for new source review permits. Utilities \nmaintain that the modifications fell within the routine maintenance \nprovisions that had been provided and grandfathered into the Clean Air \nAct in 1990.\n  What kind of a message does a central government send to the \ngenerating industries of this Nation? It tells them: We will not stick \nby the rules; we will not play by the rules; we are interested in \npolitics at this moment, EPA politics, environmental politics; we are \nnot interested in the pocketbooks of the consumer or, more important, \nthe strength of the economy, even though the utility industries are \nproviding ever cleaner sources of energy.\n  EPA is discussing the notion that new-source review should include \nvoluntary regulation of CO2, which is not a poisonous gas and which is \nnot regulated under the Clean Air Act. President Clinton, don't you \nunderstand that you cannot keep beating this economy and our energy \nsupplies over the head with these silly notions and expect the economy \nto remain productive?\n  EPA recently changed the toxic release inventory, or the TRI, to \nrequire electric utilities to report chemical release data. The level \nat which reporting is required for mercury was lowered by an order of \nmagnitude. In making these changes, EPA presented no studies or \nsupporting rationale for why nearby communities should suddenly be \nconcerned about such releases. Nevertheless, the reports will be widely \npublished, thereby placing utilities at the top of the ``dirty'' \nfacilities list.\n  Again I say to the President: From where are you coming? What is the \ngame? Because it appears you are attempting to game this issue.\n  In 1993, EPA staff concluded that coal combustion waste, or fly ash, \nbottom ash, slag waste, or other combustion products, from electric \nutility generation do not warrant hazardous waste regulation. Yet, EPA \nat the behest of the environmental community seems to be about to \noverrule the staff recommendation. The story goes on and on.\n  Here is the other message. Out in my area of the country, a very \nlarge portion of the electric generating capacity comes from \nhydropower. We dam up rivers and we put generators in the face of the \ndams and we generate large quantities of renewable clean electricity.\n  Ever since Secretary Babbitt took office, he has been running around \nthe country trying to find a dam to blow up. On numerous occasions, he \nsaid: I would like to blow up a really big dam. That is what the \nSecretary of Interior wants as his legacy. What kind of a legacy is \nthat? I think it is called a cave man  mentality legacy. Give everybody \na candle and send them to a cave? Come on, Bruce Babbitt. You know the \ntremendous value of clean hydroelectric generation. Some 15 to 18 \npercent of our market blend today is hydro.\n\n  In my area, it is much larger than that. Do we need to modify our \ndams to save fish? Do we need to make them operate more efficiently \nwith new technology? Absolutely we do. And we are doing that. Already \nwe are putting in new fish-friendly turbines at Bonneville Dam at the \nlower end of the Columbia River. We are going to work our way up the \nColumbia-Snake Rivers system and that marvelous hydro facility that \nfuels the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. No, Mr. \nBabbitt, we ``ain't'' going to blow up any really big dams.\n  It is going to be kind of refreshing when that man leaves office to \nleave that silly mentality by the wayside.\n  Technology? Yes, you bet. Bring on the new technology. But shouldn't \nwe be encouraging clean fuel, renewable resource technology of the kind \nthat is so abundant in the West today?\n  I could talk a good deal more about this, but what I hope we \naccomplish is a reduction in the overall fuel cost of this country by \neliminating the 4.3-cent Gore tax. That is right, that is Al Gore's \ntax. He is the one who sat in the Chair and broke the tie and caused \nthe tax to become law. I want him to get the credit for raising the \ncost of energy in this country by that vote.\n  Here is something else I want to close with today that is added \nfrustration as to why this country finds itself increasingly in an \nenergy dilemma. The Clinton-Gore administration embraces the Kyoto \nProtocol. What is the Kyoto Protocol? It is the misguided result of \nconcern by scientists around the world--and by all of us--that our \nworld may be getting warmer as a result of the generation of greenhouse \ngases.\n  We all know that we have phenomenal long-term cycles in our country \nof warming and cooling. Once upon a time ago, there was an ice age. \nPrior to that, there was a warm period. Those 5,000- to 10,000-year \ncycles are very evident throughout geologic time. We know, as a fact, \nwe get warmer. We know, as a fact, we get colder. Right now we are \ngetting warmer.\n  The question is, Does the presence of man on the globe and what we \nare doing to our climate cause us to get warmer or does it cause us to \nget a little warmer under a normal warming cycle? We don't know that \nyet. Yet this administration, in the absence of science, and in the \nfull-blown presentation of world environmental politics, said: Let me \ntell you what we are going to do. We are going to put all kinds of \nrestrictions on the United States and other developed nations. We are \ngoing to tax the use of hydrocarbons. We want those lessened in their \nuse. To do that, we are going to drive up the cost. Al Gore thinks the \ninternal combustion engine is a really bad idea. He's said so on \nnumerous occasions.\n  But what they did not recognize was the double kind of impact that \nwould result from driving up the costs through taxes and limiting \nproduction at a time when the world was not ready to shift away from \nconventional forms of energy.\n  The Kyoto Protocol would require the United States to vastly reduce \nthe use of oil, natural gas and coal, and achieve emission reduction \nstandards when, frankly, the rest of the world\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nwould not have to play--or at least the rest of the newly developing \nworld that will be the largest generators of greenhouse gases.\n  Thank goodness this Senate, in July of 1997, stood up, in a very \nbipartisan way, and said: No, Mr. President. No, Mr. Vice President. \nYour idea and the protocol is wrongheaded. We are going to stand \ntogether as a nation. More importantly, we are going to convince the \nrest of the world to go with us. If we are going to develop this kind \nof policy, we will all share equally.\n  What we ought to be doing, with our tremendous talents, is developing \nthe technology for the rest of the world to use to clean up their air \nand to clean up their water. We should not ask them to sacrifice. We \nshould not ask the people of developing nations to live with less than \nwe have simply because we do not want them to use their resources for \nthe purpose of advancing their economies. Yet that is exactly what this \nPresident and this Vice President have said by the proposal of and the \nendorsement of the Kyoto Protocol.\n  Our Senate said no, on a vote of 95-0. Thank goodness we did. It had \na chilling effect. In fact, I have not heard Al Gore mention Kyoto once \nin the last 6 months. Why? Because he knows he has created a tremendous \nliability for himself politically, when the American public really \nunderstands what would have happened if the protocol had become law, \nand those kinds of standards and those kinds of taxes had been placed \non the American consumer on the eve of a dramatic runup in the cost of \ncrude oil that has resulted from our OPEC neighbors getting their \npolitical act together.\n  We will be back next week. Stay tuned.\n  On Monday of this coming week, on the 27th, the OPEC nations meet. \nBill Richardson has been running around, all over the world, with his \ntin cup, begging them to turn on the oil. They turned them off 6, 8 \nmonths ago--or turned them down by several millions of barrels of \nproduction a day. They may open them a little bit. But my guess is, \ntheir goal is to keep crude oil prices well above $20 a barrel, which \nmeans the price at the pump will remain high. It may come down some \nthis summer--and I hope it does. I hope we can jawbone them. I hope we \ncan convince them, through good foreign policy, that wise economic \npolicy dictates that they ought to increase production.\n\n  Yesterday, the House spoke very clearly. It said to the OPEC nations: \nIf we are going to provide for your defense, as we have in the past, \nmaybe you need to help us provide for some of our energy needs. All of \nthat is a part, in combination, of what we ought to be involved in and \nwhat we ought to be talking about. I think our consumers would expect \nnothing less of us because, clearly, energy policy is a Government \nresponsibility in this country, especially if there is policy that is \nnegative in its impact on the ability of the private sector to produce \nan abundant source of low-cost energy to the consuming public.\n  This is an issue that will not go away because every day, when the \nconsumer goes to the gas pump, and sticks his or her credit card in it, \nand pulls out 10, 12, 15, 20 gallons of gas, they are going to feel the \nimpact. If you go out to buy new carpeting, if you go out, as a farmer, \nto buy pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides--all with a hydrocarbon \nbase--you are going to find out that this runup in cost is having a \ndramatic impact on the economy and, ultimately, could have an impact on \nthe lifestyle of all American citizens.\n  We must act. I hope we act both with short-term and long-term policy \nthat is sensible, environmentally sound, but recognizes that energy \nabundance in this country has been the key to our tremendous economic \nsuccesses down through the decades.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, today the distinguished and esteemed \nSenator from Massachusetts and I are reintroducing the Democratic \nproposal to raise the minimum wage.\n  For those familiar with the legislation, they know that our \nlegislation--the bill being reintroduced this afternoon--raises the \nminimum wage by $1 over 2 years, to $6.15 an hour. It is a modest but \nbadly needed bill. It is overdue. It has already passed in the House, \nas most of our colleagues know, by an overwhelming margin, with strong \nbipartisan support. It deserves equally strong and bipartisan support \nin this Chamber.\n  Among the many people who support our proposal are America's \nreligious leaders--the U.S. Catholic Conference, the United Church of \nChrist, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the American Friends \nService Committee, the Unitarian Association of Congregations, the \nEpiscopal Church, the Methodist Church, and many more religious \norganizations. There are Republicans and Democrats in this coalition of \nreligious leaders, and all have joined together in supporting the \neffort to raise the minimum wage by $1 an hour over 2 years.\n  A job isn't only a source of income. A job, frankly, is a source of \npride--or it should be. The Catholic Conference tells us that the \nminimum wage ought to reflect the principles of human dignity and \neconomic justice. That is what it ought to reflect. There ought to be \nmore to a minimum wage than simply what pay you get. There ought to be \na sense of dignity and a sense of pride and a sense of accomplishment. \nThere ought to be a feeling of goodwill in a workplace. But today's \nminimum wage precludes much of that. The U.S. Catholic Conference is \nright, the minimum wage today denies dignity, it denies economic \njustice.\n  When you adjust the increased cost of living, the real value of the \nminimum wage today is almost $2.50 below what it was in 1968. This \nchart reflects, very graphically, what we are talking about. This shows \nthe value of the minimum wage over the years.\n  We started in 1968, with a value of the minimum wage, in today's \ndollars, at $7.66. But look what has happened. We come down now to the \nyear 2000, and we have a minimum wage value of slightly over $5.\n  But look what has been happening to the trendline representing the \nvalue of the minimum wage, in the last couple years. While there have \nbeen peaks the trend is actually going down. Next year, the value of \nthe increase, in constant dollars, will be $4.90--almost $3 below what \nit was 30 years ago.\n  Is it any wonder people are working two and three jobs? Is it any \nwonder we have lost some of the value, some of the dignity, some of the \neconomic justice that was concomitant with the minimum wage of 30 years \nago?\n  What is remarkable is that all we are asking with this increase is to \nbring it to $5.85 next year. This proposal, as you can see, is still \nbelow the value of the minimum wage in 1968. That is what is \ndisconcerting. If we do not raise the minimum wage by the end of the \nyear, every single penny of the value of the 1996 increase will be \nerased by increases in the cost of living.\n  As the chart shows, at one time we were able to increase the value of \nthe minimum wage. Now, we would like to bring the wage back to its \nvalue in 1996. But look what happens. If we do not raise the wage, we \nwill have eliminated entirely the previous increases of the minimum \nwage.\n  I think people ought to remember, all we are trying to do is to \nmaintain virtually the status quo. We are not even able to bring it up \nto where it should be. So forget economic justice, dignity--working \nfamilies are living in poverty.\n  The Senate passed the welfare reform legislation several years ago. \nWe said we want to dignify work. We want to reward work. We want to \nensure that people who work get the rewards that otherwise they would \nget on welfare. Look what has happened. As the minimum wage continues \nto decline, the poverty line continues to go up. So even with the \nminimum wage increase, minimum wage workers are going to be below the \npoverty line. How does that reward work? How does that keep people off \nwelfare? If this gap continues to spread, where is the economic \njustice?\n  Under our proposal, a full-time minimum-wage worker would earn \n$12,792 a year. That is an increase of $2,000. That doesn't sound like \na lot of money. As I noted, right now minimum wage workers are below \nthe poverty line. But the fact is, $2,000 would buy 7 months of \ngroceries for a family of four.\n  I was in a grocery store not long ago. Somebody came up to me, a \ntotal\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nstranger, and said: I know you are Senator Daschle. I hate to \ninterrupt. I know you are out there buying your groceries. I am just \none person, but I want to thank you. I want to thank you for trying to \nfight for the minimum wage increase because I am a minimum wage worker. \nI have two jobs. I have no health insurance. I have a daughter who is \nvery sick. You don't know me, and you may never see me again. I'm \ntelling you, Senator Daschle, I need that money, without it I don't \nknow what I am going to do.\n  You remember conversations like that. That brings life to charts like \nthis.\n  It is very troubling to me that, as we fight over the minimum wage \nthis year, we are fighting about that worker, working two jobs, trying \nto stay above the poverty line with a sick daughter. We are trying to \ndecide in the Senate today whether we are going to make this worker \nwait another year and lose $1,200 over that period of time in this era \nof economic growth and vitality.\n  What do we say to that man in that grocery store: Look, I am glad you \nare working two jobs. I am sorry your daughter is sick? We want you to \nstay off welfare? And while we have more and more people becoming \nbillionaires in this country, we are going to make you wait 1 more year \nto get that full $1 increase in minimum wage, even though it is $3 \nbelow what it was in 1968?\n  I can't do that. I don't know how anybody can do that. But that is \nwhat we are asking. That is why we care so much about this fight now. \nWe didn't have the chance to bring it up last year. We forced it on the \nbankruptcy bill. Now the House, because I believe we forced that action \nlast year, has acted, as they should, on minimum wage. I have some real \nproblems with the House-passed tax package, but they acted \nappropriately on the minimum wage.\n  Why, in Heaven's name, given the economic strength we have in this \neconomy, given the extraordinary increase we have seen in income at \njust about all levels but the lowest, why would we make that man, or \nanybody like him, wait 3 years rather than 2 to get a $1 increase so \nthat he might be able to stay above the poverty line?\n  Recently, my State created 17,000 new jobs. Unemployment is lower now \nthan it has been in 30 years. Yet we hear our colleagues say this \nsomehow is going to hurt small business. This age-old argument has been \nso totally ripped apart by virtually every credible source. The Wall \nStreet Journal, Business Week--hardly the mouthpiece of a liberal \nagenda--now say the 1996 predictions about job loss, the last time we \nincreased the minimum wage, could not have been further from the truth. \nThey were wrong. We have created more jobs in my State and in every \nState. Unemployment is lower, not higher. There is no question \nwhatsoever, we can create more jobs and still provide dignity in the \nworkplace.\n\n  Of what value is a job if you need four of them to survive? Of what \nvalue can a job be if you can't even buy health insurance for your \nchildren?\n  The other argument we hear so often is that minimum-wage workers are \nteenagers, or that they are part-time people, who pay for cars and CD \nplayers, who will be working in a high paying job someday. Again, the \nfacts could not be more the opposite: Seventy percent of all minimum-\nwage workers are in their twenties or older; 60 percent of minimum-wage \nworkers today are women in that age category; 40 percent of minimum-\nwage workers today are the sole breadwinners in their families.\n  You hear these arguments over and over again: The minimum wage costs \njobs. These jobs are for teenagers. That is just bunk. There is \nabsolutely no truth to these assertions that we hear over and over \nagain. We are talking about people who walk up to me in grocery stores \ntelling me about their kids, telling me they have more than two jobs, \ntelling me that unless they get this increase in the minimum wage, they \ndon't know how they are going to survive. What an irony--talk of \nsurvival in a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity.\n  I am hopeful that somehow over the course of the next couple of weeks \nwe can reach an agreement. The House has acted on an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan basis. The Senate ought to go to conference. We ought to \nresolve this minimum wage issue. But we ought to accept the fact that \nwe have no real argument to ask that person or anybody else to wait 3 \nyears for a $1 increase in the minimum wage when they need it so badly \nright now. I am very hopeful that we can work out a procedural \narrangement whereby every single person this year can count on a \nminimum wage increase within 2 years.\n  The average family now works an additional 265 hours a year just to \nmaintain the same standard of living they had at the beginning of this \ndecade. That is an additional 6 weeks a year that parents could be \nspending with their children that they are not. How much more in that \ndirection should we be going? Three hundred hours more a year to \nmaintain the status quo; 7 or 8 weeks a year that parents ought to be \nspending with their kids that they are now spending on a second or \nthird job?\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and I, and so many of \nour colleagues, have said if we do anything this year, if we really \nmean what we say about economic justice and about dignity in the \nworkplace and keeping people off welfare and addressing the real needs \nof working families, there is nothing more important than ensuring an \nincrease in the minimum wage, this year, over 2 years. It ought to be \nover 1 year, but if we can't do it in 1 year, the compromise was, well, \nthen let us at least try it in 2. If we can't do it in 2 years, I don't \nknow how we turn to those working those extra hours, those extra weeks, \nwith any sense of compassion or understanding for their circumstances.\n  I ask whether or not it could be a bipartisan goal that we sign and \npass a measure before Mother's Day this year. What better opportunity \nto tell those women who make up 40 percent of the minimum wage \nworkforce and who head households that we are going to give you some \nhelp. We are going to do all we can to keep you off welfare. We are \ngoing to try to put a little more dignity into the workplace, and we \nare going to provide the kind of economic justice we all say is \nimportant to us.\n  I have admired Bob Dole for a lot of reasons, but one thing he once \nsaid, while he was the Republican leader, is something we ought to \nremember again and again. He said:\n\n       I never thought the Republican Party would stand for \n     squeezing every nickel out of the minimum wage.\n\n  That wasn't something Senator Kennedy or I said or anybody else on \nour side said. That was the Republican leader who said it wasn't the \nrole of the Republican Party to squeeze every nickel out of the minimum \nwage.\n  I hope the majority will not squeeze every last nickel from this \nminimum wage either. I hope they will join us. I hope they will \nremember the families below the poverty line. I hope they will remember \nwhere we are and from where we have come, when it comes to dignity, \neconomic justice, and the minimum wage today. I hope they will join us \nin passing this 2-year bill before Mother's Day.\n  Let's sign it into law. Let's send the right message.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator agree with me that here we are on \nThursday afternoon, early afternoon, 2:45, most Americans are out \nworking. The Senate, as I understand the schedule, will not be voting \nuntil next week on Tuesday. It is Thursday afternoon. Does the Senator \nagree that we have an opportunity to debate this this afternoon, and, \nif there were additional questions, we could debate it on Friday where, \nagain, most Americans are working? We could stay here, doing our \nbusiness, and then vote sometime on Friday or Friday afternoon, that we \ncould dispose of this issue in a timely way? Will the Senator not agree \nwith me that someone who bears a responsibility--as well as the \nmajority leader, in terms of a schedule--that this particular issue \ncould be easily disposed of this afternoon, or on tomorrow, without \ninterrupting the Senate schedule?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely right. We have declared now an end of official business. We \nare in morning business this afternoon. We are not going to be in \nsession tomorrow. We will be taking up the flag\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\namendment on Monday and voting on it on Tuesday. But we are told there \nis not time to bring this matter to the floor. Yet tomorrow is a \nperfectly opportune time for us to be debating and talking about this. \nWe would love nothing more than to have a good debate. Let's talk about \nwhether or not this affects jobs. Let's talk about whether or not this \nis for teenagers or for working mothers and working families. Let's \nentertain amendments.\n  The fact is, we wouldn't have debated this last year were it not for \nthe extraordinary efforts made by the Senator from Massachusetts who \noffered this amendment to a bankruptcy bill. That is what triggered the \naction in the Senate. I believe that is what triggered the action in \nthe House. Now we are in a situation where we are prepared to split the \nbankruptcy conference from the minimum wage conference. But unless we \nhave a vehicle with which to go to conference, it is very hard for us \nto conference a minimum wage that has never been considered in the \nSenate.\n  How can we go to conference without a vehicle? That is unheard of. I \nthink Daniel Webster would be rolling over in his grave trying to \nunderstand what the modern Senate has done to the process. The process, \nas I used to understand it is you pass a bill in the Senate, you pass \nit in the House, it goes to conference, you work out the differences, \nand you bring it back. We haven't passed a minimum wage bill in the \nHouse.\n  The distinguished Senator is right. We are introducing this bill. We \ncould bring it up today. We could have a vote on it tomorrow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this is an \nissue on which I believe every Member of this body has voted at one \ntime or another. It is not an extraordinary, complex issue, as issues \ngo that we deal with. This is a rather basic issue and a rather \nfundamental issue. As the leader pointed out, it is basically a \nquestion of whether we are going to respect the dignity of those who \nwant to work and can work, who are willing to work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year.\n  Institutionally, we have voted, if my memory serves me correctly, \nover the history of this, probably 10 to 14 times. It is not a new \nissue. Members know what the dimensions of this particular question are \nreally about.\n  The Senator, as I understand it, would agree with me that it wouldn't \ntake a very long period of time to permit the Senate to express its \nwill on whether they believe there should be an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  As I understand the leader's position, he introduced this \nlegislation. It is 50 cents this year; it is 50 cents next year. If we \ndon't see this increase, we will see that the increase we provided in \nthe 1996-1997 period will effectively be wiped out. It will be about \nthe lowest period in the history of the country in terms of the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage at a time perhaps of greatest \nprosperity.\n\n  Does the Senator find that is something that is difficult to explain \nto people back in his own State of South Dakota, as I do in \nMassachusetts, and who wonder why we aren't willing to take some \naction?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator is so right. This is a $2,000 \nincrease. That $2,000 increase is probably made, in the case of many \nAmerican entrepreneurs, in a matter of moments, minutes, or hours. We \nare talking about a $2,000 increase over the course of a couple of \nyears. That is what we are talking about. These people are already \nstruggling to retain some form of dignity in the workplace. They are \ndetermined not to go back on welfare. They are determined to try to \nfind ways to ensure that their children have the quality of life we all \ndream about as Americans.\n  As the Senator said, how ironic it is that at a time when we have \nmore billionaires in this country than we have ever had in our Nation's \nhistory, at a time when income has gone up exponentially for the top 20 \npercent of those in this country, at that very time we see potentially \nthe lowest level of purchasing power the minimum wage has ever brought \nabout in our Nation's history. What an incredible irony that is.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. I appreciate his calling attention \nto that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nsomething perplexes me.\n  Is the Senate in session tomorrow?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senate is not in session tomorrow.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Are there going to be votes on Monday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There are not any votes on Monday. We will not have any \nvotes now until Tuesday afternoon.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Has the Senate had many votes lately on Mondays or \nFridays?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not recall the last time we had a vote on Monday or \nFriday.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is there any reason the Senate cannot meet, do its \nbusiness, and vote on matters of importance on Mondays and Fridays?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Montana raises a very good point. It \nused to be that we considered a workweek working 5 days. The workweek \nis becoming more and more 3 days. Not only that; our work periods are \nonly 3 weeks. Then there is no workweek at all. It is a remarkable \njuxtaposition.\n  First of all, we have a limited time each week. Then we have these \nperiods for which there is no legislative work. Then we are told we \ndon't have time to bring up the minimum wage. We don't have time to \nbring up issues that are of importance to families all across this \ncountry.\n  The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe the Senator can answer another question.\n  I think the Senator may have a good answer for this. But I don't. Why \nis it that the Senate spends so much time debating campaign \ncontributions and campaign expenses at such astronomical and almost \nexponential rates so they can get elected but doesn't want to be here \nto do the Nation's work?\n  Can the Senator explain that discrepancy?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wish I could. All I know is that if you take what it \ncosts to get elected to the Senate and divide it over the number of \nlegislative days, it comes out to millions of dollars per day. It is a \nremarkable change in the circumstances we face since I have come to the \nSenate.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Isn't it true that people at home who elect us want us to \ndo the Nation's work? Isn't that what the people at home expect us to \ndo?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We are talking about minimum-wage workers working 40 \nhours and sometimes 80 hours a week. If we are not in session long \nenough to address the concerns they have, it seems to me, we will have \na lot of explaining to do to a lot of those people who are wondering: \nIf they are working that long, why can't we work a 5-day week?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Didn't we just get a pay raise that went into effect this \nyear?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It was a cost-of-living increase.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It went into effect this year.\n  I compliment the Senator. I compliment both Senators for what they \nwant to do. I want to join them. To me, it is a tragedy that the Senate \nis not doing the Nation's work, particularly on an issue such as the \nminimum wage. I commend the Senators.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator makes a good point. I defended the cost-of-\nliving adjustment. I think there are times when we have to recognize we \nwant people in public service. But if we want to bring about the kind \nof cost-of-living increases that we understand we need at our salary \nlevel, I think everyone would also understand the need for a cost-of-\nliving adjustment for minimum-wage workers to at least stay equal to \nthe poverty line, and to at least give them some encouragement not to \ngo back on welfare.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Montana pointing out that \nmatter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see others who wish to address the \nSenate.\n  On this issue of the scope of what we are talking about and \nincreasing the minimum wage 50 cents and 50 cents, as I understand it, \nall Americans combined earn about $4.2 trillion per year. The impact of \na $1 wage increase over 2 years would be one-fifth of 1 percent of the \nnational payroll. This is effectively what we are talking about.\n  If the leader has given up the floor, I ask for recognition on my own \nright.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see others who desire to be recognized. \nBut\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nI want to at this time join with our leader, Senator Daschle, in the \nintroduction of this measure. He has pointed out that it is 50 cents \nthis year and 50 cents next year. That is a very modest increase.\n  We have been debating this issue for the last 2\\1/2\\ years. We have \nbeen denied the opportunity to bring this up to the Senate. We have \nbeen told by Republican leadership, day in and day out, that we haven't \nthe time to debate this issue, that this is a complex issue that will \nimpact inflation, that it will impact employment.\n  These are very important macroeconomic issues. We need time to \ndebate.\n  Let the record show that our Democratic leader and others introduced \nthis measure this afternoon. We are prepared this afternoon, on a \nThursday in late March, to consider this legislation and deal with \namendments, as we have done day in and day out over the period of the \nlast 2 and a half years since we introduced minimum wage legislation. \nBut we are prepared to deal with those arguments and finally take \naction.\n  We are being denied the opportunity as elected officials of our \nrespective States to be able to have a vote on the increase in the \nminimum wage because of process, because of procedures, and because of \nthe rules of the Senate. That is so today. But it isn't always going to \nbe that way. As the leader pointed out, we are strongly committed to \ngetting a vote on this measure as soon as we possibly can. We would \nlike to do it in an orderly way so Members can participate in the \ndebate and offer amendments. We can reach a final resolution. But if we \nare denied that opportunity, we are going to find a way or means to \ninsist that the Senate address this particular issue.\n  I will just take a few moments to review exactly where we are in \nterms of the people about whom we are talking and those who would be \nthe beneficiaries of this particular action.\n  We have taken action at other times in our history in order to \nprovide for and to say to those who are working at different levels of \nour economy 40 hours a week for 52 weeks of the year that they are not \ngoing to have to live in poverty. That is what this is all about.\n\n  Are we going to say in the United States of America that men and \nwomen who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, who play by the \nrules, are not going to have to live in poverty in the year 2000 and \n2001, when we have this extraordinary prosperity? We say yes; the other \nside says no. That is a principal difference between our two parties on \nthis issue. The American people ought to understand it.\n  If Tom Daschle were the majority leader, we would be debating and \nacting on this issue this afternoon in the Senate. But we are not. We \nare denied it because of the Republican position. Our leader has \npointed out, all Members, Republicans and Democrats, were quite \nwilling, without delay, without any kind of prolonged debate, to take \nthe cost-of-living index increase of $4,600 without delay, which is \nwhat our Republican friends want us to do, delay the increase of the $1 \nminimum wage over 3 years. We didn't hear any of them say during the \ndebate on the increase in the cost of living of $4,600: Spread that \nout.\n  No, no, no, we took that quickly.\n  We want for those working, who are needy and who are poor and who are \nstruggling, we are saying we will spread out your increase of $1 over 3 \nyears. How does anyone dignify that position?\n  We can see what has happened. The bottom fifth of families have \nfallen behind some 6 percent. This is from 1979 through 1999, over the \nlast 20 years. Middle-income families are working harder. Generally, \nadditional members of the family are going into the workforce. These \nmiddle-income families have seen a 5 percent increase in income. But \nmost of them are working longer.\n  The United States of America today has workers working over 50 hours \nmore a year than any other industrial society in the world. They are \nworking harder and barely hanging on. Look what has happened to the top \n5 percent of income families, those earning $246,000 versus the bottom \n20 percent earning $12,500. Of the bottom 20 percent, many are minimum \nwage earners, with incomes of $10,000 or less.\n  Look what has been happening in the workforce during this period. \nPeople have always said the real issue in question for wage increase is \nproductivity. There must be an increase in productivity for a wage \nincrease. Look what has happened regarding productivity and the \nAmerican worker. The real value of the minimum wage drops as \nproductivity grows. We have had one of the greatest spurts in American \nproductivity in the history of this Nation by American workers in \nrecent years. At the same time, the real value of the minimum wage has \ncollapsed. We have a dramatic increase in productivity, with more goods \nbeing produced by these workers, and they are still getting paid less \nand less.\n  What is the possible justification for that? Every indicator we \nhave--the size of employment, the impact on inflation, the issues of \nproductivity--all come to the same conclusion, that this Nation at this \ntime as never before can afford an increase in the minimum wage. That \nis what this is about.\n  Finally, as the leader has pointed out, we have found now in order to \nget some action in the House of Representatives in the Senate of the \nUnited States, our Republican leader said we are going to ``piddle'' \nout an increase in the minimum wage over 3 years. We will take 3 years. \nHowever, we will provide $75 billion in unpaid for tax expenditures.\n  I hope we don't hear from the other side about being responsible \neconomically. Mr. President, that is $75 billion for 3 years.\n  That wasn't good enough for the House of Representatives. Do you know \nwhat they said? We will give you 2 years, but we have $122 billion in \nunpaid-for tax cuts where 94 percent of the benefits go to the top \nfifth. Is that not interesting? We have to take care of the small \nlittle mom-and-pop stores; we have to help them out. We are interested \nin doing that. We would work with our Republican friends in terms of \nthe mom-and-pop stores. Our Democratic leader indicated a willingness \nto do that. We did it in the last minimum wage increase. We are glad to \ntake modest steps in order to be able to do that. We heard we are going \nto have some tax expenditures in order to protect the mom-and-pop \nstores. Except under this tax cut, mom-and-pop stores aren't helped; 94 \npercent goes to the top fifth.\n\n  Maybe that goes over in some areas of the country, but we want our \nfriends on the other side to know this issue will not go away.\n  When we have that kind of action that has been taken previously, a \ndelayed minimum wage increase spread out over 3 years, added to a $75 \nbillion in unpaid-for tax expenditures, it makes me wonder. How many \ntimes have we come on the floor of the Senate saying: Let's do \nsomething about Head Start; let's do something about immunization, or \non mental health. How much will it cost? Is it paid for? Is it paid \nfor? Is it paid for? Well, you are not getting that, Senator.\n  I don't know what happened to that particular position where we have \nnow $75 billion and $122 billion in play, holding that minimum wage \nhostage to benefit the wealthiest individuals in this country.\n  Can we justify that? Is it a position that is defensible? I don't \nbelieve so. It is wrong. Fundamentally, it is wrong.\n  This issue is basically a women's issue because the majority of those \nwho receive the minimum wage are women. It is a children's issue \nbecause many women who are receiving the minimum wage have children. \nThis is about the quality of life. As the Council of Economic Advisers \nhas pointed out, the children in minimum-wage families spend 22 hours a \nweek less with their parents than they did 20 years ago.\n  When we talk about the minimum wage, it is a family issue. It is a \ncivil rights issue because many of the people who earn the minimum wage \nare people of color. And it is a fairness issue because it says in the \nUnited States we stand for men and women who work hard, play by the \nrules, and they ought not to live in poverty. We believe the \noverwhelming majority of Americans support it.\n  I thank our leader for bringing this matter to the Senate again and \nfor all of the leadership he has provided. I am proud to stand with \nsome of my colleagues on this side who have stood for\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nthat kind of increase and for the brave few on the other side who have \njoined. As the leader has pointed out, we will have this issue up one \nway or the other.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a young man, \nSean-Michael Miles. Slightly over a year ago, his life was taken \ntragically in an automobile accident in Bozeman, MT, while he was home \ncelebrating the Christmas holidays with his family. Everyone privileged \nto know Sean was touched by his contagious zest for life. He was among \nthe very best to emerge from our State, from ``The Last Best Place.'' \nHe was a shining star. He is my friend.\n  Sean's father and I grew up as neighbors. We went to school together \nand remained close friends ever since. I might add, Sean's grandmother, \naffectionately known as Granny Miles, was one of my baby sitters. I \nknow this family well. Their strength and love for one another is an \ninspiration to all of us who know them. Sean-Michael's future was as \nbright as one could imagine. He graduated at the top of his class in \nBozeman High School in 1997 and was selected by his classmates to \ndeliver the commencement address. That same address, filled with \nfamiliar compassion for our Native American heritage, is still talked \nabout today. Such was its honesty, its power, its celebration of \npromise.\n  At Princeton University, where Sean was in his second year, he was \nadmired as an exceptional writer, an accomplished artist and musician. \nPerhaps a classmate put it best: Sean was totally brilliant and \ncompletely humble, a cool combination.\n  Following his graduation from Princeton, Sean intended to return to \nhis beloved Montana and commit himself to a career dedicated to writing \nand the preservation of our last remaining wildlands.  Sean enjoyed \nconsiderable gifts, and was truly living up to them.\n\n  Sean wanted to make the world a better place, and believed completely \nthat one person can truly make a difference. There was no cynicism in \nhis life. He befriended the friendless, and remembered the forgotten. \nAbove all, he was making a difference. It is a loss beyond Montana's \nboundaries as well. Professor John McPhee of Princeton echoed such \nsentiments:\n\n       By my lights, Sean-Michael Miles was the best that we can \n     do--bright, responsive, hardworking, clear in expression, \n     clear in thought, and with a personality immediately likable, \n     immediately demanding respect. We will all miss him terribly.\n\n  Sean enjoyed a way with words. I would like to share a small piece of \nhis brilliant work.\n  After climbing atop a remote buffalo jump, he discovered the ``drive \nlines'' that the Native tribes of our region used centuries ago to \nfunnel herds of bison over the cliff's edge. Looking out beyond that \nedge, toward the vast expanse of the Absoorka Beartooth Wilderness, \nSean wrote:\n\n       Whenever I think of the changes sweeping over Montana like \n     a spring storm, a lump forms in my throat. My first breath \n     was drawn from mountain air.\n       Yet I know that this land may pay a price for being \n     beautiful, as change advances, carrying with it the prospect \n     of loss. It is a land I desperately love. It is a part of me. \n     It hurts so much to care so much. Yet as a Westerner, I am \n     invited to breathe it all in deeply each day.\n       Despite change and loss, a drive line containing wisdom \n     offered through memories stretches before me. For now I am \n     satisfied to walk along its path, eyes fixed on what remains \n     a geography of hope.\n\n  Sean-Michael Miles was proud to live his entire life surrounded by \nthe majestic spine of mountains that he fondly referred to with the \nBlackfeet phrase, ``the backbone of the world.''\n  Sean's death casts a dark shadow over the future of those of us who \nknew and loved him. Yet it is the light he offers that we commemorate \ntoday.\n  I have risen today to announce that I will create a fellowship in \nSean's name that will focus on the conservation issues that were so \ndear to him. I am also pleased and honored to announce that the first \nCongressional Fellow serving in this prestigious position will be \nSean's beloved sister Michelle. Her younger sister, Shaleen, once \nserved as Democratic page on the floor of the Senate. So today, \nMichelle, who is sitting behind me, I welcome you to my staff, and I \nknow that you bring with you your brother's finest qualities. May the \nlegacy of Sean-Michael Miles, who walked with the silent feet of \nreverence through the wilds, forever serve as a source of inspiration \nfor generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, prescription drugs currently constitute \nthe largest out-of-pocket health care cost for seniors. Over 85 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries take at least one prescription medicine, and \nthe average senior fills eighteen prescriptions per year.\n  Because prescription drug coverage was not a standard part of health \ninsurance when Medicare was enacted 35 years ago, many seniors must pay \nfor the high cost of prescription drugs out of their own pockets. We \nare now facing a crisis of monumental proportion for many older \nAmericans.\n  The simple fact is, the high cost of today's modern medicines and the \nabsence of Medicare coverage have placed needed medications out of \nreach for too many seniors. Most older Americans must juggle daily \ncosts like groceries and utilities with paying for medicine. They are \nbeing forced to compromise by buying only a portion of the needed \nmedications, too often making their treatment regimens incorrect and \nineffective. Without the proper medication and dosage for conditions \nsuch as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems, seniors may \nfind themselves faced with even more costly hospitalizations and \ncompromised health.\n  Recently, I received a letter from Reverend Lois Congdon of Decatur \nGeorgia. Reverend Congdon wrote to me about her impending retirement. \nShe told of her expensive drug treatment costs and the coverage she was \ncurrently receiving under her employer-based insurance plan. Without \nher current salary, and once she is placed on Medicare, Reverend \nCongdon will no longer be able to afford her expensive prescription \ndrugs. Even supplemental prescription coverage such as medigap offers \nonly limited benefits and is too expensive for most seniors. Currently \nonly one-fourth of Medicare enrollees have supplemental drug insurance \nand the number of firms offering such coverage has declined by 25 \npercent in the last four years alone.\n  Last month, I cosponsored legislation to provide similar prescription \ndrug coverage for military retirees. The bill would enable military \nretirees over age 65 to use the National mail order pharmacy program \nfor drug coverage. However, affordable prescription drug coverage is a \nbenefit that all seniors should be able to obtain, not just armed \nservice men and women. Seniors make up 12 percent of our nation's \npopulation and they purchase over one-third of all prescription drugs \nin America. Most older Americans live on fixed incomes of $15,000 a \nyear which is adjusted slightly for inflation each year. However, for \nfar too long, the rate of increase in prescription drug costs has \nexceeded the rate of inflation. This situation has created a need more \nurgent than ever to strengthen the Medicare Program with a prescription \ndrug plan, and thereby protect millions of American seniors from more \ncostly hospitalizations and treatments.\n  Expanding Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit will bring \nthe program in line with the realities of modern medicine. Prescription \ndrug coverage is essential to the delivery of 21st century medicine. \nThese medicines keep people healthy, independent, and out of the \nhospital. To not include prescription benefits in Medicare today is\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nakin to not including a major form of treatment such as a surgical \nprocedure when Medicare was established in 1965. It is absolutely \nunthinkable. Too many seniors lack dependable drug coverage and their \nhealth is being compromised. I am committed to providing Medicare \ncoverage for prescription drugs, and promise to continue fighting for \nAmerica's seniors.

Mr. President, last week the city of Bellingham was the \nsite of a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety. This hearing comes \nafter the unspeakable tragedy that took place when three young boys \nwere killed after a gasoline pipeline exploded in Bellingham on June \n10.\n  I want to share with you my thoughts from the hearing and outline \nfuture congressional action as the Senate Commerce Committee prepares \nto reauthorize the Office of Pipeline Safety this year.\n  Unfortunately, my Senate Commerce Committee colleagues were unable to \nattend last Monday's hearing in Bellingham, but I believe the committee \nhas no greater priority than to making sure the pipelines running \nunderneath our schools, neighborhoods, churches, and senior centers are \nsafe.\n  Pipeline safety concerns aren't unique to Washington. We're seeing \nStates such as Texas, Wisconsin, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania \nrespond to various local pipeline issues from oil spills and leaks to \nsiting battles. In the last decade, there were 3,917 liquid fuel spills \nand natural gas leaks, averaging roughly one per day. These accidents \nresulted in 201 deaths, close to 3,000 injuries and $778 million in \nproperty damage. And for the first time, a National Pipeline Safety \nConference will be held in Washington, D.C. next month.\n  Though the sacrifice is one that no family and no community should \nhave to make, the tragedy in Bellingham would be even worse if we did \nnot learn from it and apply those lessons to try to prevent other \naccidents. To this end, last week's hearing was invaluable.\n  While the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, here's \nwhat we do know:\n  We know that many people in Bellingham were unaware that a pipeline \nwas even running through their neighborhood.\n  We know that the Office of Pipeline Safety ignored enhanced safety \nrequirements, including increased inspections inside pipes, in highly \npopulated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in \n1992 and 1996.\n  We learned that cities through which the Olympic Pipelines Company \nline runs have tremendous concerns with the integrity of the pipelines, \nand have had problems getting information and cooperation from the \ncompany.\n  We know that the National Transportation Safety Board has criticized \nOPS for its poor record of responding to NTSB recommendations. NTSB \nChairman Jim Hall has even said, ``There's no indication that the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations, its \ninspections, its assets, its staffing and its spirit are adequate to \nthe task.''\n  We know that right now, the power to oversee and regulate the safety \nof the millions of miles of pipelines running underneath our \ncommunities rests with the federal Office of Pipeline Safety under the \nsupervision of the Department of Transportation. And in the case of \nimplementing pipeline safety standards in Washington State they have \nfailed miserably.\n  We learned that only a handful of States have the power to implement \ntougher safety standards, and when States are given this authority, \ntheir safety record is equal if not greater to that of OPS.\n  So, where does this leave us?\n  State government, local government, and citizen groups in Washington \nState were quick to answer the wake-up call from Bellingham and examine \nwhat they could do to improve pipeline safety. What they found was that \nwhile there are significant actions Washington can take to prevent and \nrespond to accidents, such as improving the State's call-before-you-dig \nrequirements, increasing public awareness, and training emergency \nresponse personnel, there is a lot the state cannot do with respect to \nprescribing safety standards because Federal law preempts state \nregulations.\n  Today is already March 23. We know this is going to be a short \nlegislative year. Many will say we won't have the time to address this \nissue this year. I disagree. Congress is due to reauthorize the Office \nof Pipelines Safety and we've been told the administration will submit \nits proposal to Congress any day now.\n  Senator Murray and I are supporting legislation to give states \ngreater authority in adopting tougher pipeline safety standards. Given \nthe Office of Pipelines Safety's failure to make pipeline safety a \npriority, its reluctance to cede any authority to states, I feel we \nmust move forward.\n  When I asked both the Office of Pipeline Safety and the NTSB last \nweek to take a position on our pipeline legislation, the answer was \nless than clear. After listening to the painful and damaging testimony \nthat scourged OPS's safety record and failure to comply \nwith congressionally-mandated safety requirements, I was speechless at \ntheir unwillingness to relinquish oversight authority to the states. \nThe State of Washington, the people of Bellingham and communities along \nthe pipeline route are ready and capable of implementing tougher safety \nstandards. I demand OPS to take a firm position on this pipeline \nlegislation.\n\n  I also request that my good friend and colleague, Senator John \nMcCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, schedule a vote on \nthe various pipeline safety proposals.\n  As I have said before, this pipeline legislation may not be perfect, \nand I believe we need to do some more listening before we arrive at the \nfinal pipeline safety proposal. NTSB officials highlighted the \ncomplexities of regulating pipelines that pass through a\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nnumber of States. They made their case as to why they should retain \nsole authority to regulate interstate pipelines. But it was an \nunpersuasive case. I encourage the Office of Pipeline Safety to \nconsider my proposal to allow States which have at least 90 percent of \na pipeline passing through their borders, to have greater authority in \nsetting and implementing its own safety and inspection standards.\n  As Senator Murray and I await the administration's proposal, we agree \nthat the following proposals must be included in the final legislation:\n  Allow States greater authority to adopt and enforce safety standards \nfor interstate pipelines, particularly in light of the absence of \nmeaningful federal standards.\n  This increase in authority should be accompanied by an increase in \ngrants to States to carry out pipeline safety activities.\n  Improve the collection and dissemination of information about \npipelines to the public and to local and State officials responsible \nfor preventing and responding to pipeline accidents. This includes \nensuring that operators are collecting the information necessary to \naccurately assess and respond to risks. The public should be informed \nabout where pipelines are, what condition they are in, when they fail \nand why they fail.\n  Adopt more stringent national standards for pipeline testing, \nmonitoring, and operation.\n  Ensure congressional mandates are followed, and make sure there are \nsufficient resources to enforce regulations.\n  Invest more in research and development to improve pipeline \ninspections.\n  Create a model oversight oil spill advisory panel in Washington \nState. This body would have the authority to not only respond, but to \ninitiate the development of pipeline safety measures.\n  I have long believed that those closest to the problem are in a \nbetter position to help develop the solution. Families in Washington \nstate, and across the country, have already paid to high a price for us \nto miss this opportunity to put higher federal safety standards into \nlaw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk this afternoon about this \ncountry's overall energy policy or, more truthfully, to talk about the \nlack of this country's overall energy policy.\n  With fuel prices continuing their rise to levels that threaten \nfarmers, truckers, families, and, in fact, our entire economy, I felt I \nneeded to come to the Senate floor for a few minutes to discuss this \nvery important issue.\n  As my colleagues know, I come from a rural State that is heavily \ndependent on agriculture. When farmers in Minnesota are hurting, it has \nan impact on businesses, on families, and individuals far removed from \nthe fields of our family farms. Because Minnesota is a large State and \nso heavily reliant upon agriculture, it is also reliant upon truckers \nto move products to market and to bring products to communities. It is \nalso important to note that Minnesota is well known as one of our \nNation's coldest States, a State where many residents rely on fuel oil \nto heat their homes. These realities are a few examples of why crude \noil prices and supplies are so important to the people of my State. \nThey are also examples of why, since coming to the Congress in 1993, I \nhave been a strong critic of the Department of Energy's failure to \nstrengthen our Nation's energy policies.\n  In the late 1970s, our Nation responded to the energy crisis by \ncreating the Department of Energy and charging it with developing a \nstable energy policy that would decrease our reliance on foreign \nsources of energy. At the time, our Nation was reliant on foreign oil \nfor about 35 percent of our needs. When DOE was created, with its \ncharge to create an energy policy to make us more energy independent, \nour reliance on foreign fuels was 35 percent. Despite the countless \nbillions of dollars taxpayers have invested in the Department of Energy \nover the past two decades, our Nation is now roughly 60 percent reliant \non foreign energy sources, and that reliance is growing and growing \nrapidly.\n  That's one of the reasons why I'm an original cosponsor of S. Res. \n263, which calls on both the administration and Congress to undertake \nsteps which will lead to a long-term reduction of our reliance on \nforeign sources of energy. Among those steps, the resolution calls on \nthe administration to review all programs, policies, and regulations \nthat place an undue burden on domestic oil and gas producers. I believe \nthis is an important aspect of the DOE's failure to reduce reliance on \nforeign energy sources. Sadly, this administration's opposition to \nvirtually all exploration and production activities on public lands has \nrendered our nation's domestic producers incapable of responding to \nsupply shortages. That is why we are in the position we are in today. \nIn fact, since 1992, U.S. oil production has been reduced by 17% while \nour consumption of oil has increased by 14%. In 1990, U.S. jobs in oil \nand gas exploration and production were roughly 405,000--today those \njobs have been reduced to roughly 290,000 a 27% decline in jobs in \nenergy-related fields. In 1990, the United States was home to 657 \nworking oil rigs. Today, there are only 153 working oil rigs scattered \nacross the Nation--a decline of 77 percent; again, a reason the United \nStates did not respond to shortages in supply. During a recent hearing \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee, I asked Energy Secretary Bill \nRichardson if he would consider supporting the exploration of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), which is estimated to hold \nenough oil to offset 30 years of imports from Saudi Arabia. In his \nresponse, he indicated that he believes we have sufficient areas for \nexploration on federal lands without developing ANWR. We have \nopportunities, he says, to go onto other Federal lands and do the \nexploration. If we do, the question is, Why haven't we? If that is the \ncase, then why has the Clinton administration failed to move forward in \nallowing expanded exploration and production activity on those Federal \nlands instead of leaving us vulnerable to the OPEC nations?\n  Why has this administration waited until an oil price crisis has \ngripped our nation before suggesting increased development of domestic \noil and gas reserves on public lands? Why does this administration \nstill maintain it's opposition to exploring our nation's most promising \noil reserves like ANWR? And why does this administration maintain \nopposition to exploration in the United States based on environmental \nconsiderations but has no reservations about calling on other nations \nto do so?\n  For some reason, this administration seems to believe that it is an \nenvironmentally friendly proposition to expect other nations to produce \nour oil for us. The United States has some of the most stringent \nenvironmental standards for oil exploration and production--standards \nthat aren't embraced by many of the oil producing nations of the world. \nI simply cannot see how sending our nation's energy secretary across \nthe world to beg for increased oil production every time we have a \nsupply problem is sound energy, economic, or environmental policy. I do \nnot connect the two.\n  I believe it's also important to note that this administration is \ncurrently engaged in a number of other activities that severely limit \nour nation's ability to increase our energy independence. First, this \nadministration's failure to remove nuclear waste from civilian nuclear \nreactors threatens to shut down nuclear power plants across the \ncountry. In Minnesota, the DOE's inaction may force the premature \nclosure of the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Facility. If it should \nclose, Minnesota will lose 20% of its generation capacity. At the same \ntime, this administration is attempting to breach hydropower dams in \nthe Pacific Northwest--dams that are crucial to the energy needs of \nthat region. In each of these situations, consumers will be forced to \nrely more heavily upon fossil fuels to replace the loss of clean energy \ntechnologies. As if that weren't enough abuse of America's energy \nconsumers, the Clinton administration has undertaken a number of \nactivities that have severely impacted the ability of utilities to turn \nto coal-fired plants to meet the energy demands of consumers. And I \nneed not remind any of my colleagues of the lack\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nof infrastructure in our nation to dramatically increase our use of \nnatural gas as a reliable, base-load source capable of replacing \nhydropower, nuclear, and coal-fired generation.\n  What continues to amaze me is how this administration sends its ``yes \nmen'' in front of Congress to pledge support for each of these \ngeneration technologies. I do not hear the administration telling \nCongress they want to eliminate coal-fired generation. But the EPA is \ndoing its best to regulate coal plants out of business. I have never \nheard the administration say they want to close down nuclear plants, \nbut I have yet to see them lift a finger to keep them operating. When \nanyone in this body confronts the administration with the impending \nbrown outs and energy price increases its policies are going to force, \nall its representatives can say is that they're working on it and they \nsupport renewable energy technologies.\n  Well, I too, am a strong supporter of renewable energy technologies. \nI've been a strong proponent of the development and promotion of \nethanol and biodiesel as a means of reducing our reliance on foreign \noil and improving the environment. I was a cosponsor of legislation \nsigned into law last year extending the tax credit for electricity \ngenerated from wind and expanding that tax credit to electricity \ngenerated from poultry waste. I have written letters in each of the \npast two years to Senate appropriators supporting significant increases \nin renewable energy programs, and I was one of 39 Senators to vote in \nsupport of a $75 million increase for renewable energy programs last \nyear. I wrote to President Clinton this year asking him to include more \nmoney for renewable energy programs in his budget. However, I know that \nsimply calling for increased funding for renewable energy can't even \napproach the loss of generation in hydropower, nuclear, coal, and other \nsources that this administration has pursued through its energy \npolicies.\n  I'd like to believe that this administration has a grasp on the long-\nterm energy needs of our nation and has plans for meeting those needs, \nbut the actions of the administration and the DOE's failures on the \nspectrum of energy challenges prove otherwise.\n  That's why, in a letter to Secretary Richardson last week, I urged \nhim to take immediate actions to allow for both on and offshore oil and \ngas exportation and production in states that want to do so. I urged \nhim to take immediate steps to ensure that nuclear power plants such as \nMinnesota's Prairie Island Facility are not forced to shut down due to \nDOE inaction. I urged him to work with the Department of Interior to \nresist attempts to reduce the use of hydropower. And I urged him and \nthe administration to undertake an immediate review of all regulations \nthat impose undue burdens on the development of domestic energy sources \nthat could reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  Long ago, the Congress charged the U.S. Department of Energy with the \njob of reducing our nation's reliance on foreign oil and establishing a \nlong-term, stable energy policy to guide our economy for decades to \ncome. It goes without saying that the Department has failed miserably \nin that, its most basic mission.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days, \nweeks and months in enacting a number of both short-term and long-term \nresponses to the needs of farmers, truckers, the elderly, and all \nenergy consumers. I've been a strong supporter of renewable energy \ntechnologies and increased funding for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program--or LiHEAP. I strongly support the efforts of my \ncolleagues to increase domestic oil and gas exploration and production \non public lands, including offshore reserves and the tremendous \npotential of ANWR. I remain committed to finding a resolution to our \nnation's nuclear waste storage crisis--as crisis that threatens to shut \ndown nuclear plants and further weaken our nation's domestic energy \nsecurity. And I'll continue to be one of the Senate's strongest critics \nof the Department of Energy's unbelievable neglect of the long-term \nenergy needs of our nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. the Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1662-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1662-S1663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 17TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT REAGAN'S STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

President Reagan understood that \nthe only way to protect the American people and our homeland was \nthrough common sense, straight talk, and a strong, credible defense, \nnot threats of mutual annihilation. While President Reagan and his \nStrategic Defense Initiative were mocked by critics, he remained \nsteadfast in his vision and his belief that the American people could \nachieve anything they committed themselves to doing.\n  Seventeen years later the United States remains vulnerable to missile \nattack, but from newer and more likely threats, some of which we may \nnot be able to deter: accidental launches, terrorist groups, and rogue \nstates. The United States Intelligence Community and outside expert \ngroups like the Rumsfeld Commission tell us that the threats are real \nand growing. Less than two years ago North Korea launched a three-stage \nmissile over Japan, demonstrating a North Korean capability to send a \nmissile with a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon to the United \nStates. Meanwhile, other rogue states like Iran, Iraq, and Libya are \ndeveloping similar capabilities.\n  Despite these real dangers, the current administration has kept the \nAmerican people vulnerable to attack by failing to vigorously pursue \nmissile defense programs started by previous Republican \nadministrations. It has put the fate of our country and our people in \nthe hands of the 1972 ABM Treaty--a treaty signed with a country that \nno longer exists, which was written for a vastly different strategic \nenvironment, and which codified the concept of Mutual Assured \nDestruction.\n  It is imperative that the United States aggressively pursue Ronald \nReagan's vision of an American homeland free and safe, protected from \nintimidation, blackmail, and attack by missile-armed adversaries. We \ncan start by putting greater effort and resources into programs like \nthe National Missile Defense program--which has already demonstrated \nthrough actual tests that missile defense is technologically feasible--\na fact acknowledged privately by defense officials, and publicly by \nSecretary of Defense Bill Cohen following the most recent test when he \nstated that ``the technology is certainly proving to be on the right \ntrack.''\n  The United States should also continue to develop other initiatives \nwhich will complement our ground based system and provide for a multi-\nlayered defense. I'm talking specifically about a sea-based system \nmounted on Navy Aegis cruisers that can be placed off an adversary's \ncoast and destroy enemy missiles immediately after launch; or the \nAirborne Laser program that seeks to destroy missiles during their \nascent; and a space-based system that can shoot down ballistic missiles \nin the outer atmosphere and vacuum of space.\n  I might also take this opportunity to compliment the Center for \nSecurity Policy and the Heritage Foundation that made valuable \ncontributions in the discussion toward these alternatives.\n  The key to such a system is working with the Russians to allay their \nconcerns, address their fears, and modify the ABM treaty to accommodate \na robust, multi-layered national missile defense. We must try to \nconvince the Russians that they share the threats we face--limited \nattacks or threats by rogue states--and that our missile defense plans \nin no way undercut their strategic deterrent. But ultimately, whether \nRussia is convinced or not, America must do what is necessary to \nprotect itself.\n  I am concerned that the Clinton administration is currently \nnegotiating changes to the ABM Treaty that will not allow us to fulfill \nthese plans; that they are negotiating to make limited changes to the \ntreaty that will sound good in an election year but will prevent us \nfrom building the robust, multi-tiered missile defense we need. This \nwould be unsatisfactory and irresponsible. Marginal changes to the\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nABM Treaty will only keep America vulnerable to missile attack, mislead \nthe public about their safety, and tie the hands of the next \nAdministration that may choose to do what is right, not politically or \ndiplomatically expedient.\n  Finally, we must work with our Allies to address their concerns, \ninterests, and our mutual defense obligations. We stood guard together \nduring the dark days of the Cold War and eventually defeated communism. \nWe must stand together again now and face the threats of the post-cold-\nwar era.\n  Only through a sustained commitment to a national missile defense \nsystem--which can defend the American people from these horrible \nweapons of mass destruction--can the government fulfill its first \nresponsibility of defending the United States. This is the right and \nsensible thing to do, and the American people are capable of achieving \nit. President Reagan understood that almost twenty years ago today.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on several occasions I have discussed \nmissile defense programs and the importance of moving as quickly as \npossible to develop and deploy missile defense systems--both theater \nand national--to protect forces that are deployed around the world and \nour citizens here at home. Of all the programs designated as ``Major \nDefense Acquisition Programs'' by the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense, only the Airborne Laser program has distinguished itself by \nbeing on schedule and on budget while meeting or exceeding all of its \ntechnical requirements. The spectacular performance of this program is \nthe standard all defense programs should aspire to.\n  Our debates on defense programs usually focus on budgets, schedules, \nperformance, requirements, and threats, but seldom do we pause to \nrecognize success; more specifically, we hardly ever acknowledge the \nhuman component of success.\n  The many accomplishments of the Airborne Laser program did not just \nhappen by accident. Rather, the program has succeeded because of the \nhuman element; because of the many people who, over the course of the \nlast three decades, have advanced our science and engineering to the \npoint where the United States will be able to put chemical lasers on \n747 aircraft and use them to defend America, its interests, and its \ndeployed forces.\n  Most recently, the Airborne Laser program has succeeded because of \nthe leadership of Col. Mike Booen and Dr. Paul Shennum, both of whom \nwill be leaving the program in April after having driven the Airborne \nLaser program forward for the last four years. They deserve special \nrecognition for their efforts.\n  Colonel Booen was named Deputy Airborne Laser Program Director in the \nsummer of 1996 and promoted to Director in November of that year. While \nColonel Booen has been an energetic and tireless advocate for the \nAirborne Laser program and its people, his latest achievements are just \nthe most recent in a notable career that includes early promotions, \nacademic recognition as a distinguished graduate of the Air Force \nAcademy, and assignments as a Defense Department Manned Space Flight \nEngineer and Deputy Chief of the Secretary of the Air Force's Staff \nGroup. In recognition of his success Colonel Booen has been selected to \nbecome the next Director of the Air Force's System Program Office for \nthe Space-Based Infrared System. It is an assignment of critical \nimportance to our nation's security, and I look forward to continuing \nto work with Colonel Booen as he resuscitates that program.\n  Over a distinguished career of 40 years with Boeing, Dr. Paul Shennum \nhas developed a reputation as a leader who leads with energy and \nintegrity, embraces change, encourages innovation, and challenges \npeople to contribute more than they thought they could. Dr. Shennum is \none of the rare program managers who can be counted on to provide \nfactual answers when asked a question. He does not give evasive \nresponses, however convenient they may sometimes be for his company or \nthe Pentagon. His straightforward approach with the Pentagon, Congress, \nand within his industry team has been instrumental in the Airborne \nLaser's outstanding program performance. I wish him the best in his \nwell-deserved retirement.\n  The Booen-Shennum team has succeeded because both of these men \nunderstand what the word ``leadership'' means. They know it involves \nfixing on an objective, setting high, but realistic, standards, and \nleading the government and industry components of the Airborne Laser \nteam effectively to that objective. They have refused to accept excuses \nfor work that hasn't met their standards. They have inspired their \ncolleagues to accomplish more than many thought possible. They \nappreciate effort, but expect results.\n  And it is results, unparalleled in any other defense program, that \nMike Booen and Paul Shennum have given us.\n  Colonel Booen and Dr. Shennum have demonstrated how a government-\nindustry team should act. This program is not a team in name only, \nthanks to the constant efforts of Colonel Booen and Dr. Shennum. They \nhave caused the team members, including the various defense \ncontractors, industry and government employees to really work together \nto achieve a common goal.\n  In their relentless pursuit of excellence, Col. Mike Booen and Dr. \nPaul Shennum have reminded us that America's defense programs will \nultimately succeed or fail because of the people involved. I \ncongratulate them and thank them for doing such a great job.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Any Senators interested in debating this important measure \nshould be prepared to do so on Monday or early Tuesday.\n  Again, the next scheduled rollcall vote will occur beginning at 2:15 \non Tuesday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to leaving the floor, I hope the \nleader gets the message that we have a lot of work to do. There was a \ndialog that went on in the Chamber today talking about the many things \nthat need to be done. Minimum wage was talked about at some length. I \nalso remind the majority that there are other things we need to get to \nwork on. We are not doing anything related to education. We have health \ncare delivery problems that need to be addressed, including Patients' \nBill of Rights, prescription drugs for seniors, and Medicare.\n  There are other things that may not sound as important but are just \nas important. I met again today with some high-tech people. I know the \nSenator from Tennessee has spent some time on the Export Administration \nAct. I hope the majority will allow us to move forward on that \nlegislation. It is extremely important to the high-tech industry, which \nis the flagship that is now driving this economy.\n  The minority is ready to work day and night on all these issues. The \nreason I am so concerned is I have worked since my time in the Senate \nwith Senator Byrd. He has been whip, he has been majority leader, \nminority leader, chairman as well as ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and many other positions, but I have worked \nwith him my entire 14 years in the Senate on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I know how long it takes to work the appropriations process. \nWe have 13 appropriations bills we must move, and it must be done \nbefore October 1.\n  We don't have a budget yet. We have 13 subcommittees with the \nappropriators waiting to move their bills. We cannot do it until we get \na budget. I don't think we are at a point of desperation yet, but there \nis a lot of work to do and not much time to do it. I hope the majority \nallows the Senate to move forward on all these important things as \nquickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1664-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1664-S1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO RICHARD BEST--AN AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Tom Brokaw's recently released a best-\nselling book, ``The Greatest Generation'' is a tribute to the \ncontributions of the millions of Americans who grew up during the Great \nDepression, then went on to fight and win WWII.\n  I suggest that most Americans will agree that Mr. Brokaw's father's \ngeneration is one of unique and lasting significance.\n  Having lived through that dark hour when totalitarian regimes in \nEurope and Asia threatened the survival of our republic, and having \nwitnessed the sacrifices unhesitatingly borne by our servicemen, I must \nconfess that I, like most of that generation, can never take our \nliberties for granted.\n  More than a half-century removed from victory in WWII, in retrospect \nI am convinced that far too many Americans have forgotten (or perhaps \nnever learned) how bleak the prospects for our success appeared to be \nin the spring and early summer of 1942.\n  Victory was not preordained, and our fate might well have been vastly \ndifferent had it not been for the heroic actions of U.S. Navy \nLieutenant Richard Best and others like him who won that decisive \nvictory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942, reversing a decade of \npreviously unchecked (and largely unchallenged aggression) by the \nJapanese Imperial Navy.\n  Mr. President, to understand fully the heroic nature of Lieutenant \nBest's heroism, it is essential to understand the events leading up to \nthe battle. Prior to Midway, American forces in the Pacific had endured \na devastating series of losses and withdrawals that had crippled the \nU.S. Pacific Fleet.\n  Beginning with almost 3,600 casualties at Pearl Harbor in December \n1941, Americans witnessed the fall of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Rangoon \nto battle-hardened Japanese forces; the collapse of a spirited defense \nof Battan by American and Filipino forces; and finally, the devastating \nloss of Corregidor, the island at the entrance of Manila Bay--an island \nthat the United States had heavily fortified and which had been dubbed \nthe ``Gibraltar of the East.''\n  These losses led many Americans to the conclusion that Japan's \nsuccess in the Pacific was inevitable. Some voices at home began to \ncall for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Pacific theater so that \nwe could first concentrate on winning the war against fascism in \nEurope.\n  After the selfless and courageous action of Lieutenant Best on June \n4, 1942, and the American victory at the Battle of Midway, it became \nclear that America would not abandon the Pacific theater to an \nunprovoked aggressor. Instead, America would stand and fight.\n  Mr. President, the Japanese plan of attack on Midway was designed as \npart of the largest operation in the history of the Imperial Japanese \nNavy. Anticipating complete surprise and equipped with four fast \ncarriers, Kaga, Akagi, Soryu, and Hiryu, the First Carrier Striking \nForce had reason to expect a crushing victory. The early action of the \nbattle seemed to justify that confidence.\n  The first action saw three successive waves of American torpedo \nbombers attack the Japanese carriers. While avoiding damage to their \ncarriers, Japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns quickly managed to \nshoot down 35 of the 41 American aircraft.\n  Following these devastating losses, two squadrons of United States \ndive bombers from the U.S.S. Enterprise swooped down on the Japanese \ncarriers. Leading the Enterprise's Bombing Squadron Six, a group of 15 \nDauntless SBD aircraft was their commanding officer, Lieutenant Richard \nBest (later lieutenant commander).\n  Regarded as one of the Navy's most skilled dive-bomb pilots. \nLieutenant Best took the point attacking the well-defended Japanese \nflagship, The Akagi. With precision, he delivered his bomb on the \nflight deck of the powerful carrier, scoring the first direct hit, one \nthat would eventually lead to the sinking of the ship.\n  Of the 15 planes in his squadron, only Lieutenant Best and four \nothers returned to the Enterprise that day. After refueling and \nrearming, Lieutenant Best soared into the air again. This time he was \nsearching for the Hiryu, the one Japanese carrier that had managed to \nsurvive the day's earlier fighting.\n  According to the Naval Historical Center, Richard Best scored a \nsecond direct hit against the Hiryu, helping to deliver a devastating \nblow the overconfident and seemingly invincible Japanese Navy.\n  In addition to being the only American pilot to score two successful \ndirect hits on Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway, there was \nsomething else remarkable about Lieutenant Best's courage that day. At \nthe time of the attack, he was physically weakened and suffering from \nsevere lung damage. Doctors later diagnosed him as suffering from \ntuberculosis, a condition that would (1) prevent him from ever flying \nagain and (2) would cause him to spend the next two years recovering in \nNavy hospitals.\n  For his actions at Midway, Lieutenant Commander Best received the \nNavy Cross in 1942, the second highest military award presented to \nmembers of the Naval Service. It now appears that this award was based \non incomplete information and that at the time, the Navy was not aware \n(1) that Best was the only pilot who scored two direct hits and (2) \nthat he was suffering from tuberculosis.\n  Since then, a number of distinguished retired Naval officers, \nincluding Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, have ``weighed-in'' in support of \nawarding Dick Best the Congressional Medal of Honor. Should the \nDepartment of the Navy and the Department of Defense determine that an \nupgrade of the Navy Cross is appropriate I will unhesitatingly support \nit.\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow night, at a dinner in New York City, the \nInternational Midway Memorial Foundation, will celebrate the 90th \nbirthday of Dick Best and honor him for his selfless and courageous \nconduct in the Battle of Midway. While I am unable to be present, I \ncertainly extend my gratitude and respect for his incredible heroism \nthat day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1665-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE DEDICATION OF RICE-TOTTEN STADIUM, MS VALLEY STATE \n                               UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of this \nweekend in my home State of Mississippi. On March 25th, Mississippi \nValley State University (MVSU) will rededicate and rename its football \ncomplex. Formerly known as Magnolia Stadium, the Rice-Totten Stadium \nwill honor two of MVSU's great athletes and two ambassadors for the \nItta Bena school.\n  Jerry Rice is a legend--not only in Mississippi, but throughout the \nworld. After completing an extraordinary career at Valley, Jerry went \non to become the greatest professional wide receiver ever. During his \ntime with the San Francisco 49ers, Jerry dazzled fans with his ability \nto make the impossible look easy, broke numerous NFL reception records, \nand led his team to multiple Super Bowl Championships.\n  Willie Totten is one of collegiate athletics's greatest competitors. \nFrom 1983-1986 Willie led Valley to the top of Division I-AA football. \nHe also raised the bar by which all college offenses are now judged. \nToday, almost every college football team utilizes a strong pass-\noriented offense game plan, but that hasn't always been the case. \nFootball fans have Willie to thank for showing us how exciting passing \nover 50 times a game can be. Following a solid career with the Buffalo \nBills, Willie served the future of competitive athletics as a college \nand high school coach.\n  I believe it's only fitting that MVSU recognize and honor Jerry Rice \nand Willie Totten for their accomplishments and achievements by naming \nMagnolia Stadium after them. Although I will not be able to attend the \nrededication ceremony, I wish MVSU, Jerry Rice, Willie Totten, their \nfamilies, and those associated with the University they celebrate this \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1665-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2003, Keep \nour Promises to America's Military Retirees Act of 2000.\n  This is an important step in providing the men and women who serve \nour nation with a benefit our government promised them when they \nentered the military and, a promise that our government broke. It is \nour duty to restore these benefits.\n  There are still a few of us who serve in the Senate that wore our \ncountry's uniform in time of war and in time of peace that know of the \nhardships placed on the military people and their families. We also \nknow, first-hand, of the promises made by our government to our service \nmen and women. This bill is just a small step in restoring one of those \nmost important promises--health care for military retirees. There are \nmilitary retirees in my State of Montana that drive hundreds of miles \nto get their health care. There are some living a few miles from \nMalmstrom AFB, who cannot get an appointment on base. Mr. President, \nthese are the folks that we promised to take care of it they spent 20 \nyears of their lives defending our freedom.\n  We have a long way to go and much more to be done for our military \npersonnel, active duty, retired, as well as our veterans. As chairman \nof the Appropriations subcommittee on Military Construction, I place a \nhigh priority on providing the active duty men and women and their \nfamilies with adequate homes and facilities to work and live in. Mr. \nPresident, we have the best trained and the most highly educated \nmilitary in the world--we must make a commitment to provide them with \nthe tools necessary to do their jobs, with the salaries and benefits to \nrecruit and retain them and with adequate homes and facilities to live \nand work. Just as these people honor their country with their \ncommitment, this country must honor our commitment to them. With \nanything less, we lose these valuable people.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support S. 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1665-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DAY OF HONOR OBSERVANCE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Too often during the war and in years since, these brave men \nand women were subjected to unfair discrimination and have never \nreceived the recognition they deserve.\n  In 1941, we lived in an era in which African Americans could not eat \nat a lunch room counter with others, or drink from the same water \nfountains. Yet, we felt no hesitation in asking these same Americans to \nfight for democracy. As a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I see firsthand the sacrifices that our men and women in the \narmed forces make to preserve America's freedom. How much harder must \nit have been to make these same sacrifices fifty years ago. We owe them \nmore than we can ever repay, and for this reason I wholeheartedly \nsupport a resolution and encourage nationwide participation in \nrecognizing those African Americans who helped to preserve the liberty \nthat has made our country great.\n  Pittsburgh will be joining cities across the nation who will host a \n``Day of Honor Observance'' on March 15, 2000, as part of the effort to \nrecognize these citizens to whom we owe so much. I will be \nparticipating in this observance and I encourage you to join me in \nhonoring those who put their lives on the line so that we might be \nfree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1665-5", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1665-S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n JOHN AND MICHAEL DONOGHUE--FATHER & SON NEW ENGLAND PRESS ASSOCIATION \n                             HALL OF FAMERS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize two \noutstanding Vermont journalists, both affiliated with my alma mater, \nSt. Michael's College, and both recently elected to the New England \nPress Association Hall of Fame. This prestigious honor recognizes \nlifetime achievements in journalism. I am well acquainted with the work \nof both, and know that this recognition is well deserved.\n  The late John D. Donoghue was the first Public Relations/Sports \nInformation Director at St. Michael's, the first chairman of the \nJournalism Department there, was a music and arts critic for 35 years \nat the Burlington Free Press, and Executive Editor of the Vermont \nCatholic Tribune. During his\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\ntenure as professor and journalist, John Donoghue worked through his \nassociation with the New England Press Association and Vermont Press \nAssociation to improve professionalism within the industry, and fought \nfor the public's right to know. He was a trailblazer among journalists \nfrom my home state, and his legacy continues in Vermont, across the \nUnited States, and in the foreign press, through his students who have \nsuccessfully pursued journalism careers.\n  Michael Donoghue has served Vermonters for three decades as a \njournalist at the Burlington Free Press, and in the tradition of his \nfather, teaches journalism at St. Michael's College. During Mike's \ntenure at the Free Press, he has been at the center of efforts to \nimprove reporters' access to information, thus increasing Vermonters' \naccess to their government. Mike helped lead the effort to allow \ncameras into Vermont courts, was a leader in efforts to improve the \nVermont Public Records Law, has successfully fought to keep court \nrecords open, and recently was one of four Americans invited to Ireland \nto make presentations on Freedom of Information after that country \nadopted such a law. He is a past President of the Vermont Press \nAssociation, and active in several national journalism organizations. \nAt the Burlington Free Press, he has proven to be among Vermont's most \nversatile reporters, covering everything from sports to politics to the \ncourt beat with expertise.\n  In honor of this outstanding father and son duo, I ask that the \narticle Dedication Runs in the Family for Donoghues, from the Saturday, \nFebruary 12, issue of the New England Press Association Daily News, be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n               [From the NEPA Daily News, Feb. 12, 2000]\n\n              Dedication Runs in the Family for Donoghues\n\n                          (By Jaclyn Tammaro)\n\n       They have always said ``like father like son,'' and NEPA \n     board member Mike Donoghue and his late father, John D. \n     Donoghue, are a perfect example.\n       Both were honored by NEPA last night for their strong \n     commitment and contributions to community journalism.\n       Mike Donoghue, who lives in Vermont, has written for the \n     Burlington Free Press for 30 years, covering a variety of \n     news. Recently, he began specializing in sports reporting.\n       In what Donoghue calls his ``spare time,'' he teaches \n     journalism classes at St. Michael's College in Vermont. In 10 \n     of the 15 years he has taught there, he has been a co-adviser \n     to the award-winning student newspaper, The Defender.\n       Aside from his work with NEPA, the Burlington Free Press \n     and St. Michael's College, Donoghue has also served as an \n     officer of the Vermont Press Association for 20 years, mainly \n     pressing the issue of camera use in Vermont's courtrooms.\n       The last 13 years, he has taken the position of volunteer \n     executive director. In this seat, he ran meetings and dealt \n     with newspaper comments.\n       ``I've tried to improve professionalism in Vermont and move \n     it to the rest of New England'' Donoghue said.\n       On a national level, Donoghue is state chairman of Project \n     Sunshine, a society for professional journalists. As \n     chairman, he has testified for the release of public records \n     and has tried to improve various laws.\n       His job as journalism educator at St. Michael's College has \n     allowed him to become a member of the Journalism Education \n     Committee.\n       A member of NEPA since 1996, Donoghue has served as \n     chairman of the Publications Committee, and has chaired the \n     legislative and membership services committees.\n       ``NEPA is a vital organization,'' he said. ``Approximately \n     1,500 people come to Boston each winter to hear topnotch \n     speakers and to see the best work in six neighboring states \n     being honored. The convention is a tribute to the \n     organization and a highlight of New England journalism each \n     year.''\n       Donoghue said he is strongly motivated by his wife, Ann \n     Marie. ``If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be doing this,'' he \n     said.\n       Donoghue shared some memories about the contributions of \n     his father, John D. Donoghue. A former NEPA board member, \n     John Donoghue was an arts and entertainment critic for the \n     Burlington Free Press for 35 years. He also worked as an \n     editor for the Vermont Catholic Tribune for four years, \n     before retiring.\n       Involved in journalism education like his son, John \n     Donoghue served as the first chairman of journalism at St. \n     Michael's College.\n       Both father and son have shown a strong dedication to the \n     field of journalism and their contributions have been \n     recognized by NEPA's Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1666-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF JONESBORO TRAGEDY\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to \nacknowledge and celebrate the 179th anniversary of Greek Independence. \nOn March 25, 1821, courageous Greeks, poorly armed but imbued with an \nancient calling for democracy, initiated a revolution that would \nsuccessfully end 400 years of oppression by the Ottoman Empire. I am \nproud to join my distinguished colleagues as a cosponsor of Senator \nSpecter's Senate Resolution 251 which designates Saturday ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \nDemocracy.''\n  The achievements of Greek civilization in art, architecture, science, \nphilosophy, mathematics, and literature became legacies for succeeding \ngenerations living around the world. But it was the idea of democracy, \nborn in Athens over two thousand five hundred years ago, that signaled \nthe beginning of a lasting revolution to which we as Americans are \neternally grateful.\n  As citizens of the United States, we are proud to recognize the \ncontributions of Greek culture in the creation of our great nation. The \nFounding Fathers, deeply inspired and influenced by Hellenic ideals, \ndeveloped our representative democracy from the example of the ancient \nGreeks. As U.S. democracy flourished, its principles inspired citizens \nin other nations, sparking revolutions across time and space, from \nFrance in 1789 to Portugal in 1974.\n  As vital as the culture of ancient Greece was to the formation of our \nnation, modern Greek culture continues to enrich our society today. I \ncan speak firsthand of the significant contributions that Greek-\nAmericans make in my home state of Rhode Island. They serve our \ncommunities in many professions and continue to contribute to the state \nthrough their hard work and active citizenship.\n  Greece's commitment to democracy has been essential in fostering \nstability and supporting the ideals of freedom and equality among its \nneighbors in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region. Today, the \nUnited States supports Greece in its call for fellowship and peace in \nthe Balkan peninsula and on the divided island of Cyprus. I applaud the \nGreek people for their commitment to the protection of democratic \nprinciples in these regions.\n  Therefore, on the day marking the 179th anniversary of the revolution \nfor independence, I congratulate all Greeks and Greek-Americans and \nexpress my appreciation for their contributions and those of their \nancestors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1666-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1666-S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF TC DRAYTON\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize one of Charleston, South Carolina's finest and feistiest \ncommunity activists, Thelma ``TC'' Drayton. People who have known my \nfriend TC over the years will tell you that nothing, and I mean \nnothing, stands in her way in spurring the East Side community to \naction. Thanks in large part to TC's hurricane-force commitment, the \nat-risk neighborhood where she has lived for 53 years is cleaner, safer \nand more in control of its destiny. Last week, the community \nacknowledged her many contributions when Agape Ministries established \nthe TC Drayton Award for volunteerism to be presented each year.\n  Volunteers in search of encouragement during tough times need look no \nfurther than TC's example. Like Charleston's East Side, which \ndevelopers have begun to acquire an appetite for, TC Drayton is up \nagainst a formidable foe these days. She is fighting her battle against \nlung cancer with characteristic force and optimism. She hopes to retire \nfrom her job as community liaison with the city of Charleston and \ndevote more time to volunteer\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nprojects. One that is closest to her heart is a new Agape project known \nas COAT--Coalition of Older Americans Task Force. TC has always been \nquick to lend a hand to older members of her church family at \nFriendship Baptist and would like to extend her reach to other seniors \nin need.\n  We all wish TC a speedy recovery and a chance to touch even more \nlives in Charleston. She is a credit to South Carolina, deserving of \nall the accolades that she receives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1667-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CALVIN COLLEGE KNIGHTS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nCalvin College Knights on their recent athletic success. On Saturday, \nMarch 18, 2000, Calvin College's Men Basketball team completed their \n``storybook'' season by winning the Division III Men's National \nChampionship. The National Championship is the Men's second since 1992 \nand the third for Calvin College in the last two years. The Calvin \nWomen's Cross Country team captured the National Title in 1998 and \n1999.\n  With only two seniors on their roster, the young Knights opened the \nseason by winning the Lee Pfund Classic in Wheaton, Illinois. After the \ntournament, Calvin began play in the competitive Michigan \nIntercollegiate Athletic Association, the nation's oldest athletic \nconference, where they compiled a perfect 17-0 record. Included in this \ntotal were two thrilling victories over arch-rival Hope College. For \nthe uninitiated, this intrastate rivalry has the ability to make or \nbreak either school's season. Sports Illustrated has noted that the \nrivalry between these ``two Division III schools in Western Michigan, \nis the equal of Duke-North Carolina, Georgetown-Syracuse or any of the \nbig Division I rivalries,'' and Tim Russert announced the outcome on \n``Meet the Press'' this year.\n  The drama and success of the regular season served as a prelude to \nthe NCAA Tournament. Calvin's first tournament game was an overtime \ncliff-hanger against Franklin in which Nate Burgess, of Grand Rapids, \nMI, tipped in the winning basket with 3.6 seconds left. This basket \nallowed Calvin to advance to the ``Sweet 16'' for the first time since \n1993. After two lopsided victories, Calvin relied on the last minute of \nheroics of Bryan Foltice, of Grandville, MI, who hit a running jumper \nas time expired to propel Calvin into the National Championship game.\n  The Championship game against the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire \nfeatured a torrid first half, clutch plays in the waning minutes and a \nwell-balanced attack in which five Knights scored in double figures. \nWith this 79-74 victory, Calvin concluded the season with a 22-game \nwinning streak, and became only the sixth Division III school to have \nwon two national championships.\n  The season became even sweeter when Jeremy Veenstra, of Kalamazoo, \nMI, and Aaron Winkle, of Lake City, MI, were named to the Final Four \nAll-Tournament team. In addition, Winkle was both an All-American and \nAcademic All-American. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in \nsaluting Calvin College for their extraordinary individual achievements \nand their National Championship. Go Knights!\n  Mr. President, I ask that the team roster be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                           CALVIN COLLEGE MEN'S ROSTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Name                         Yr      Ht      Wt       P                Hometown\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo.  4.

Dave is such an individual. As President of McDuffee Insurance, \nDave has learned that a solid business structure rests on the \nsurrounding community.\n  Dave's working career has been dedicated to both the insurance \nbusiness and the community. In 1981, Dave started his own insurance \nagency with offices in Pepperell, Massachusetts and Merrimack, New \nHampshire. A few years later, he added another office in Dover. Dave's \nbusiness, which began with himself and a secretary, has grown to be the \nlargest independently owned agency in New Hampshire with nearly 40 \nemployees. With effort, dedication, and hard work, Dave has built a \ngrowing empire in its own right. Few men could do as he has done \nwithout his courage and drive.\n  Additionally, Dave has managed to place his agency at the forefront \nof community affairs. Dave is a firm believer in people and businesses \ncoming together for the betterment of the community. He strongly urges \nmembers of his board to participate in community events and activities. \nHis agency has been a sponsor of the Merrimack Chamber's golf \ntournaments, MYA teams, and numerous other charities.\n  It is an honor to represent Dave McDuffee in the United States \nSenate.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of West Virginia relative to an \n     amendment to the Constitution regarding taxation; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, Separation of powers is fundamental to the United \n     States' form of government; and\n       Whereas, Section eight, article one of the Constitution of \n     the United States of America vests the Congress, the \n     legislative branch of government, with the power to lay and \n     collect taxes; and\n       Whereas, The duty and responsibility of the judiciary is to \n     interpret law, not to create law; and\n       Whereas, Recent federal court decisions, including Missouri \n     v. Jenkins of 1990, have resulted in the judicial branch \n     levying taxes or increasing the amount of taxes imposed upon \n     our citizenry to raise revenue sufficient to support various \n     court orders or federal mandates; and\n       Whereas, These federal courts, through their mandates, have \n     strayed from the provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States of America and the separation of powers doctrine and \n     have intruded into the legitimate public policy making \n     function of the states; and\n       Whereas, Taxation is and must remain the exclusive \n     prerogative of elected representatives in the legislative \n     branch of government, and not be subject to imposition by an \n     appointed judiciary; and\n       Whereas, Numerous other states have petitioned the Congress \n     of the United States to propose an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States of America reiterating that \n     the federal courts are prohibited from levying or increasing \n     taxes without the representation of the people; and\n       Whereas, The Legislature of the State of West Virginia \n     reaffirms in no uncertain terms that the power and authority \n     to levy or increase taxes is and should continue to be \n     retained by the citizens, who do delegate that power and \n     authority explicitly to their duly elected representatives in \n     the legislative branch of government, with such \n     representatives being responsible and accountable to those \n     who have elected them; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia: That in \n     accordance with the provisions of article five of the \n     Constitution of the United States of America, the West \n     Virginia Legislature hereby petitions the Congress of the \n     United States to adopt an amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States of America, for submission to the states \n     for ratification, a new article providing substantially as \n     follows:\n       ``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of the \n     United States shall have the power to instruct or order a \n     state or a political subdivision thereof, or an official of \n     such a state or political subdivision, to levy or increase \n     taxes''; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the West Virginia Legislature \n     requests the Legislatures of the states who have not yet done \n     so to make a similar petition to the Congress of the United \n     States; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the house of Delegates \n     is directed to send copies of this resolution to the \n     presiding officers of both houses of the legislature in each \n     of the other states in the union, to the Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, to the Secretary of the \n     United States Senate, to the President of the United States, \n     to the Vice president of the United States and to members of \n     West Virginia's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-443. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington relative to Migratory bird predation \n     on salmonid stocks; to the Committee on environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4026\n\n       Whereas, The state of Washington has embarked on a major \n     salmon recovery effort as reflected in significant \n     legislation enacted in 1998 and 1999; and\n       Whereas, The state of Washington has formulated a state-\n     wide strategy to recover salmon; and\n       Whereas, The state of Washington has spent and is prepared \n     to spend millions of dollars to protect and restore salmon \n     populations; and\n       Whereas, The state of Washington is aggressively pursuing \n     salmon recovery through a comprehensive undertaking in \n     partnerships with federal agencies, Indian tribal nations, \n     local governments, nonprofit organizations, and others; and\n       Whereas, The national marine fisheries service has listed \n     under the federal endangered species act a number of salmon \n     species that live in evolutionarily significant units within \n     Washington state; and\n       Whereas, Predation by certain migratory birds such as the \n     Caspian Tern is widely viewed as a significant issue for \n     recovery of listed fish species throughout Washington inland \n     and coastal waters; and\n       Whereas, The federal migratory bird treaty act of 1918, 16 \n     U.S.C.A. Sec. 703 et seq., has proven ineffective in managing \n     migratory bird predation on salmonids; and\n       Whereas, Washington's efforts toward salmon recovery, while \n     addressing nearly all the factors that have led to the \n     decline of salmon, cannot currently, because of federal law, \n     effectively address predation by these migratory birds; and\n       Whereas, Public confidence and support of Washington's \n     salmon recovery efforts will be diminished unless the \n     interaction among migratory birds and salmonid populations is \n     better understood and site-specific conflicts are addressed;\n       Now, Therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     Congress pass legislation that amends the federal migratory \n     bird treaty act of 1918, 16 U.S.C.A. Sec. 703 et seq., to \n     provide a more effective means to allow for the protection \n     and restoration of salmonid populations.\n       Congress is further urged to:\n       (1) Fund joint federal and state research on migratory and \n     resident predatory bird interactions with salmonids, \n     especially site-specific investigations to determine the \n     significance of migratory and resident bird predation on \n     adult and juvenile salmonids for stock recovery, and to \n     develop a cohesive conservation plan that balances protection \n     of both migratory and resident birds and salmonids;\n       (2) Grant at least limited management authority for state \n     and federal agencies to remove those migratory and resident \n     birds preying on listed fish stocks at areas of restricted \n     fish passage;\n       (3) Prohibit the relocation of predatory bird nesting areas \n     that could result in shifting predation to salmonid stocks \n     that need recovery in other geographic areas.\n       Be it Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of \n     the United States, the United States House of Representatives \n     Committee on Resources, the United States Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State \n     of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-444. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Michigan relative to the low-income housing tax \n     credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 138\n\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States created the low-\n     income housing tax credit as an incentive for developers and \n     investors to provide affordable rental housing. Under this \n     program, states are authorized to allocate federal tax \n     credits in block grant form. The awarded tax credits may be \n     taken annually for 10 years by developers and investors to \n     offset federal taxes otherwise owed on their income; and\n       Whereas, Low-income families cannot afford to construct and \n     rehabilitate apartments. The low-income housing tax credit \n     program leverages about $7 billion in investments each year \n     and produces approximately 75,000 apartments. These \n     apartments rent at prices affordable to low-income working \n     families, the elderly, and people with special needs; and\n       Whereas, Low-income housing tax credit apartments help \n     stabilize neighborhoods by improving housing quality and \n     supply. They rent out quickly because the need for them is so \n     much greater than the supply created under the present \n     housing credit volume limit; and\n       Whereas, Despite rapid growth in the economy and in states' \n     low-income housing needs, the present housing credit limit, \n     $1.25 per state resident, has not been adjusted for inflation \n     since the program was created in 1986. Consequently, states \n     are severely shortchanged in their capacity to produce badly \n     needed urban and rural low-income apartments. Every year, \n     another 100,000 low-cost apartments, more than the housing \n     credit replaces, are demolished, abandoned, or converted to \n     market rate use; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to increase the cap on \n     the low-income housing tax credit and index it in accordance \n     with the Consumer Price Index; and be it further\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     the President of the United States Senate, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the Senate, March 15, 2000.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-445. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona relative to federal redesignations of \n     land in Arizona; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2003\n\n       Whereas, efforts are underway within the current \n     administration to redesignate millions of acres of western \n     lands as National Monuments or Forest Service roadless areas, \n     including more than one million acres in Arizona alone. The \n     Secretary of the Interior has requested the President to \n     designate nearly a dozen sites in the West as National \n     Monuments under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Additionally, there \n     is a recent proposal to redesignate forty million acres of \n     federal lands under a ``roadless areas'' policy within the \n     United States Forest Service; and\n       Whereas, these proposals, which would bypass input and \n     consent from the public, the states and even the Congress, \n     would result in the redesignation of lands in Arizona without \n     any consideration of state or local interests. The people of \n     Arizona, the Arizona Legislature and the Congress of the \n     United States have not considered, debated or approved the \n     federal redesignations that are proposed by the \n     administration; and\n       Whereas, instead of working as a partner to help local \n     communities define and achieve their conservation goals, the \n     federal government proposes unilateral actions that would \n     affect this state and exclude citizens from determining or \n     even having a voice in land management decisions in their \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, land management and conservation efforts are best \n     administered and managed at state and local levels of \n     government. Failure by the federal government to recognize \n     and respect this basic tenet would leave this state no \n     recourse but to turn to the judicial system to halt the \n     further redesignations of federal land in this state.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the President, the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Congress of the United States take action to prevent the \n     designation of any additional National Monuments or Forest \n     Service roadless areas in this state without full public \n     participation and an express act of Congress.\n       2. That the recipients of this Memorial convey to the \n     Arizona Legislature their plan to consider this request.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the United States Secretary of the Interior, \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-446. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to Sudan; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, According to the United States Committee for \n     Refugees an estimated 2,000,000 people have died over the \n     past decade due to war and war-related causes and famine, \n     while millions have been displaced from their homes and \n     separated from their families; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government's war policy \n     in southern Sudan, the Nuba Mountains, and the Ingessena \n     Hills has brought untold suffering to innocent civilians and \n     is threatening the very survival of a whole generation of \n     southern Sudanese; and\n       Whereas, The people of the Nuba Mountains and the Ingessena \n     Hills are at particular risk, because they have been \n     specifically targeted and, as a consequence, they are \n     deliberately prevented from receiving international food aid, \n     resulting in manmade famine, and are the targets of routine \n     bombing of their civilian centers, including schools, \n     hospitals, and areas where religious services are being held; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Convention for the Prevention and the \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the United \n     Nations General Assembly in 1948, defines ``genocide'' as \n     official acts committed by a government with the intent to \n     destroy a national, ethnic, or religious group, and this \n     definition also includes ``deliberately inflicting on the \n     group conditions of life calculated to bring about its \n     physical destruction, in whole or in part''; and\n       Whereas, By that definition, the National Islamic Front \n     government is deliberately and systematically committing \n     genocide in southern Sudan, the Nuba Mountains, and the \n     Ingessena Hills; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government has \n     systematically and repeatedly obstructed peace efforts of the \n     Intergovernmental Authority for Development over the past \n     several years; and\n       Whereas, The Declaration of Principles put forth by the \n     Intergovernmental Authority for Development mediators is the \n     most viable negotiating framework to resolve the problems in \n     Sudan and to bring lasting peace; and\n       Whereas, Humanitarian conditions in southern Sudan, \n     especially in Bahr al-Ghazal and the Nuba Mountains, \n     deteriorated in 1998, largely due to the National Islamic \n     Front government's decision to ban United Nations' relief \n     flights from February through the end of April in that year \n     and the government continues to deny access to certain \n     locations; and\n       Whereas, an estimated 2,600,000 southern Sudanese have been \n     at risk of starvation in southern Sudan and the World Food \n     Program currently estimates that 4,000,000 people are in need \n     of emergency assistance; and\n       Whereas, The United Nations-coordinated relief effort, \n     Operation Lifeline Sudan, failed to respond in a timely \n     manner at the height of the humanitarian crisis and has \n     allowed the National Islamic Front government to manipulate \n     and obstruct the relief efforts; and\n       Whereas, The relief work in the affected areas is further \n     complicated by the National Islamic Front's repeated aerial \n     attacks on feeding centers, clinics, and other civilian \n     targets; and\n       Whereas, Relief efforts are further exacerbated by looting, \n     bombing, and killing of innocent civilians and relief workers \n     by government-sponsored militias in the affected areas; and\n       Whereas, these government-sponsored militias have carried \n     out violent raids in Aweil West, Twic, and Gogrial counties \n     in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes Region, among others, killing \n     hundreds of civilians and displacing thousands; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government has \n     perpetrated a prolonged campaign of human rights abuses and \n     discimination throughot the country; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government-sponsored \n     militias have been engaged in the enslavement of innocent \n     civilians, including children, women, and the elderly; and\n       Whereas, The now common slave raids being carried out by \n     the government's Popular Defense Force militias are \n     undertaken as part of the government's self-declared jihad \n     (holy war) against the predominantly traditional and \n     Christian south; and\n       Whereas, According to the American Anti-Slavery Group of \n     Boston, there are tens of thousands of women and children now \n     living as chattel slaves in Sudan; and\n       Whereas, These women and children were captured in slave \n     raids taking place over a decade by militia armed and \n     controlled by the National Islamic Front regime in Khartoum--\n     they are bought, sold, branded, and bred; and\n       Whereas, The Department of State, in its report on Human \n     Rights Practices for 1997, affirmed that ``reports and \n     information from a variety of sources after February 1994 \n     indicate that the number of cases of slavery, servitude, \n     slave trade, and forced labor have increased alarmingly''; \n     and\n       Whereas, The enslavement of people is considered in \n     international law to be a ``crime against humanity''; and\n       Whereas, Observers estimate the number of people enslaved \n     by government-sponsored militias to be in the tens of \n     thousands; and\n       Whereas, Former United Nations Special Rapporteur for \n     Sudan, Gaspar Biro, and his successor, Leonardo Franco, \n     reported on a number of occasions the routine practice of \n     slavery and the complicity of the Government of Sudan; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government abuses and \n     tortures political opponents and innocent civilians in the \n     north and many northerners have been killed by this regime \n     over the years; and\n       Whereas, The vast majority of Muslims in Sudan do not \n     subscribe to the National Islamic Front's extremist and \n     politicized practice of Islam and moderate Muslims have been \n     specifically targeted by the regime; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government is \n     considered by much of the world community to be a rogue state \n     because of its support for international terrorism and its \n     campaign of terrorism against its own people; and\n       Whereas, According to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism Report, ``Sudan's support to terrorist \n     organizations has included paramilitary training, \n     indoctrination, money, travel documentation, safe passage, \n     and refuge in Sudan''; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government has been \n     implicated in the assassination attempt of Egyptian President \n     Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995 and the World Trade Center \n     bombing in 1993; and\n       Whereas, The National Islamic Front government has \n     permitted Sudan to be used by well-known terrorist \n     organizations as a refuge and training hub over the years; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Saudi-born financier of extremist groups and \n     the mastermind of the United States embassy bombings in Kenya \n     and Tanzania, Osama bin-Laden, used Sudan as a base of \n     operations for several years and continues to maintain \n     economic interests there; and\n       Whereas, On August 20, 1998, United States Naval forces \n     struck a suspected chemical weapons facility in Khartoum, the \n     capital of Sudan, in retaliation for the United States \n     embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam; and\n       Whereas, Relations between the United States and Sudan \n     continue to deteriorate because of human rights violations, \n     the government's war policy in southern Sudan, and the \n     National Islamic Front's support for international terrorism; \n     and\n       Whereas, In 1993, the United States government placed Sudan \n     on the list of seven states\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n     in the world that sponsor terrorism and imposed comprehensive \n     sanctions on the National Islamic Front government in \n     November 1997; and\n       Whereas, The struggle by the people of Sudan and opposition \n     forces is a just struggle for freedom and democracy against \n     the extremist regime in Khartoum; and\n       Whereas, On June 16, 1999, the United States House of \n     Representatives adopted House Concurrent Resolution 75, \n     introduced by Representative Don Payne (D-NJ), with only one \n     dissenting vote, condemning the Government of Sudan for \n     ``deliberately and systematically committing genocide''; and\n       Whereas, In Congress, both the Senate and House of \n     Representatives have introduced the Sudan Peace Act, a bill \n     to facilitate famine relief efforts and a comprehensive \n     solution to the war in Sudan that would, among other specific \n     measures, condemn slavery and other human rights abuses by \n     the Government of Sudan; support the Inter-Governmental \n     Authority on Development sponsored peace process; increase \n     pressure on combatants to end slavery and human rights \n     abuses; and protect humanitarian operations, separating \n     civilians from combatants, and reducing food diversion;

and\n       Whereas, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has stated \n     that the Sudanese regime has an ``. . . appalling human \n     rights record, including torture, religious persecution, and \n     forced imposition of sharia (Islamic) law.

A bill to terminate the application of title IV of the Trade \nAct of 1974 with respect to the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n  permanent normal trade relations with the people's republic of china\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Moynihan \nto introduce legislation that will make normal trade relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China permanent when China accedes to the World \nTrade Organization. The legislation I am introducing is the same as \nthat sent up by the administration. It is a clean bill, and I believe \nwe should keep it that way.\n  Last year, the Chinese made a series of bold commitments to United \nStates negotiators to open their market in return for WTO accession. In \nsector after\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nsector--and by a date certain--the Chinese have pledged to open their \nmarkets to foreign goods, investment and services. These openings \nrepresent an unparalleled opportunity for U.S. farmers, manufacturers, \nand service providers to expand their exports into a rapidly growing \nmarket.\n  Those commitments will help move the Chinese economy toward a rules-\nbased system and end many forms of state control. In essence, China has \nconceded that its future depends on the replacement of its communist-\nstyle economy with an open, market-oriented system based on the rule of \nlaw. Indeed, in a number of sectors, economically backward China will \nbe more open to American exports than some of our developed-country \ntrading partners in Asia and Europe.\n  What must the United States give away in terms of access to our \nmarket in return for China's pledge to enact these sweeping reforms? \nThe answer is as striking as it is simple: absolutely nothing. The cost \nof our access to China's market is simply to comply with our own WTO \nobligations. Indeed, for the United States to reap the benefits of \nChina's open markets once it joins the WTO, the only act necessary is \npassage of this legislation. This legislation will thus end the annual \nnormal trade relations renewal process required by the Jackson-Vanik \nprovisions in current trade law.\n  Some believe we must retain the annual renewal process because it \ngives us leverage in checking China's conduct on a number of fronts. \nBut the annual debate on renewing normal trade relations has not been a \nvery effective means of achieving any of the goals we all share with \nrespect to China: peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question; enhanced \nhuman rights, religious freedom and stronger worker rights for the \nChinese people or curbing China's irresponsible behavior on security \nmatters. But the active involvement of United States firms in China can \nonly help open that society and reinforce the changes already under way \nin China toward free markets and a rules-based society.\n  The enormous benefits of enacting permanent normal trade relations, \non the other hand, are clear. Just as clear is the huge cost of failing \nto do so. In passing PNTR, American workers, farmers and exporters will \ngain access to market-opening concessions the Chinese made to our \nnegotiators after 13 long years of hard negotiations.\n  If we fail to pass PNTR, then every member economy of the World Trade \nOrganization will gain such access except the United States. Our \nEuropean, Japanese and Asian competitors could not hope for a more \nlucrative gift, and all at the expense of our farmers and workers.\n  Here is what Leonard Woodcock, many years the President of the United \nAuto Workers, had to say in support of PNTR 2 weeks ago:\n\n       American labor has a tremendous interest in China's trading \n     on fair terms with the U.S. The agreement we signed with \n     China this past November marks the largest single step ever \n     taken toward achieving that goal. The agreement expands \n     American jobs. And while China already enjoys WTO-based \n     access to our economy, this agreement will open China's \n     economy to unprecedented levels of American exports, many of \n     which are high-quality goods produced by high-paying jobs.\n\n  With that sentiment I most strongly agree.\n  What about the rights of Chinese workers themselves? On this point I \nagree with Mr. Woodcock, as well. To be sure, nothing in the U.S.-China \ntrade agreement requires that free trade unions be formed in China. Yet \nthe WTO does not require this of any of its 136-member countries, and \nthe WTO is the wrong instrument to use to achieve that goal. We should, \ninstead, be asking a more important question: Are Chinese workers \nbetter off with this agreement? The answer is a resounding yes.\n  With so little to lose in ending the annual renewal process and so \nmuch to gain by enacting PNTR, I would hope this body will pass this \nlegislation overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with enthusiasm to join our \nchairman in introducing this measure which is word for word as the \nPresident sent to us on March 8. In doing so, he put the matter clearly \nenough. He said:\n\n       The Agreement will dramatically cut import barriers \n     currently imposed on American products and services. It is \n     enforceable and will lock in and expand access to virtually \n     all sectors of China's economy. The Agreement meets the high \n     standards we set in all areas, from creating export \n     opportunities for our businesses, farmers, and working \n     people, to strengthening our guarantees of fair trade.\n\n  I point out, sir, that the negotiations that have led us to this \npoint have taken 13 years. They began prior to the creation of the \nWorld Trade Organization, under its predecessor, the GATT. It has been \nhard slogging, painful, detailed work, but it has come to a conclusion.\n  China wants into the WTO, the World Trade Organization. The price is \nto give us access to her markets. She has access to ours; hence, the \nimbalance of our trade, which is enormous just now.\n  I say, sir--and I think it would be agreed to--this will be very \nlikely the most important legislative decision we have made in a decade \nor will make for a decade. At issue is the opening of American and \nworld markets, which followed the calamitous conditions brought about \nby the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930. The opening began by Cordell Hull, \nin the form of the reciprocal trade agreements.\n  Every President since has expanded and continued this process. You \nsee it all around you in unprecedented prosperity in those countries \nwhich first participated.\n  Now China wishes to do so. The condition is that we share in the \nChinese market. It could not be more simple. We are not giving them \nanything they do not now have. They are giving us the treatment that is \nrequired by a member of the World Trade Organization.\n  Just this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported, in a Wall Street \nJournal/NBC poll, that a solid majority of Democrats--almost 2 to 1--is \nin favor of this legislation. I am hesitant to tell my revered chairman \nthat Republicans do not do as well. But on balance, the American people \nsense this. They have had the experience of it for three generations \nnow.\n  Let's do it.\n  We had a fine hearing today. We had wonderful testimony from \nrespected scholars on the subject--Merle Goldman from the Fairbanks \ninstitution--well, from Boston University--Nelson Graham, East Gates \nMinistries International, who is the son of the Rev. Billy Graham, and \nMichael A. Santoro, a professor from Rutgers.\n  The case is so clear, it should not be obscured or delayed. It is up \nto us. I think there is going to be another hearing, at least. I \nbelieve it is the intention of the chairman to have a legislative \nmarkup and, as we say, actually reporting out a bill in about a month's \ntime.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished leader, it is my intent to bring \nthis up at least within a month.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. At least within a month.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think the sooner we can move on it, the better off we \nare. I expect this legislation to be adopted with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Exactly so. It should. I do not think we can name it \nfor you, but it certainly will be one of the great measures you have \nachieved in a long career, not yet concluded. I would observe that it \ntook some prodding to get the legislation sent up to us. In his State \nof the Union Address on January 27, 2000, the President called upon \nCongress to pass legislation authorizing PNTR for China ``as soon as \npossible this year.'' It took almost two months to get the \nAdministration to produce a draft of the legislation, which the \nPresident formally transmitted to Congress on March 8.\n\n  But we have it now, and the President is fully committed to this, and \nwe ought to move swiftly.\n  I want to clarify one important point: passage of this legislation \nwill not determine whether China enters the WTO. China will enter the \nWTO regardless of Congress' action with respect to PNTR. But until we \ngrant China PNTR, we cannot enter in to a full WTO relationship with \nChina, which means that we cannot reap the full benefits of the trade \nagreement.\n  This is because the WTO--under the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the \nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights--\nrequires that WTO members grant each other immediate and unconditional \nnormal trading\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\nrelations status. We do not do so now with respect to China.\n  China's trade status is conditioned on an annual review of China's \ncompliance with the so-called Jackson-Vanik freedom-of-emigration \nprovisions of the Trade Act of 1974. The President makes a \ndetermination by the third of June each year, which is then subject to \nreview by the Congress. Because of this conditionality, the trade \ntreatment that we currently accord China is insufficient under WTO \nrules. Until we grant China PNTR, we must invoke the WTO's so-called \n``non-application'' provision--that is, Article XIII of the Agreement \nEstablishing the World Trade Organization--meaning that WTO benefits \nwill not apply.\n  Simply put, we must grant China permanent normal trade relations \nstatus in order to reap the benefits that the United States, its \nworkers and its companies will gain from China's entry into the WTO. \nAnd we ought to do so promptly.\n  Mr. ROTH.

A bill to reauthorize the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and \nDesign Program Act of 1994; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n  junior duck stamp conservation and design program authorization act\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to \nintroduce the ``Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program \nAuthorization Act''. The Junior Duck Stamp program gives youth a \nvaluable opportunity to study waterfowl and learn about environmental \nconservatism through the arts.\n  I believe we have an unique opportunity to instill in our children a \nlove of the outdoors and must encourage our children by example to \nprotect our natural resources for future generations. Through my own \npersonal experiences in the outdoors, I have learned to value and \nappreciate the joys of hunting and fishing and look forward to raising \nmy twin boys with the proper respect for the environment so that they \ntoo will enjoy a lifetime of experiencing one of America's greatest \ntreasures.\n  The Junior Duck Stamp Reauthorization Act provides us with one of \nthese opportunities to instill the importance of conservation in our \nnation's children. This legislation will reauthorize a program which \nhelps teach children to love and respect the environment, while \nencouraging artistic development. By concentrating on nature, students \nhave an opportunity to appreciate our country's great natural resources \nand explore their own talents.\n  The Junior Duck Stamp program allows students from elementary to high \nschool to research any species of North American waterfowl and portray \nit artistically. Students then may enter their design in a state \ncontest. The ``Best of Show'' winners at the state level are then sent \nto Washington D.C. for a national competition. The first place national \nwinner receives a $2500 scholarship award and his/her design is used to \ncreate a Federal Junior Duck Stamp each year. Proceeds from the sale of \nthe stamp, which costs $5, are then invested back into the program.\n  The Junior Duck Stamp Program was originally developed through the \nFish and Wildlife Service with a grant from the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation. The program was expanded by Congress in 1994 and \nauthorized through the year 2000. In 1998, more than 42,000 students \nentered the art contest. It is estimated by educators who work with the \nprogram, that for every student who enters the contest, ten other \nstudents actually participate in the curriculum.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting legislation \nwhich will continue the Junior Duck Stamp Program and encourage \nconservation practices and appreciation of the outdoors in our \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2279. A bill to authorize the addition of land to Sequoia National \nPark and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n               dillonwood sequoia grove bill introduction\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to introduce legislation to expand the \nboundary of Sequoia National Park to include Dillonwood Grove.\n  The 1,540-acre Dillonwood Grove is the largest privately owned stand \nof giant sequoias and borders the southern boundary of Sequoia National \nPark.\n  The Dillonwood and Garfield Groves together form one of the five \nlargest giant sequoia groves in the world. The Garfield Grove is \nalready in the Park. Management of these groves as a single unit as \npart of the National Park will reunite the 3,085-acre Dillonwood-\nGarfield Grove, historically separated in name only.\n  For more than one thousand years, the massive trunks of Dillonwood's \ngiant sequoias have towered above the headwaters of the North Fork of \nthe Tule River at the foot of Moses Mountain in California's southern \nSierra Nevada.\n  Home to mountain lions and bears, Dillonwood's canyons and steep \nmountain ridges funnel wind currents flown by some of the last \nCalifornia condors seen in the wild.\n  More than a thousand years ago, Indians gathered at a high-elevation \nsummer camp below Dillonwood's granite outcroppings.\n  In the late 1800s, early settlers operated a mill on the site. Today \na healthy, 120-year-old giant sequoia forest is rising among the \nancient monarch trees. No second-growth giant sequoia forest of this \nage is currently fund anywhere in the Park.\n  The Save-the-Redwoods League has negotiated an option to purchase the \nDillonwood Grove for $10 million, based on its appraised value. This \nfunding will be equally matched by federal and non-federal sources.\n  I am pleased that my Republican colleague Congressman Radanovich \nintroduced the identical bill in the House last week. I also want to \nthank my colleague Senator Feinstein for cosponsoring my bill.\n  Dillonwood's rich natural and cultural heritage will be an important \nand significant addition to the legacy of our national parks. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITION TO SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK.\n\n       (a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     acquire by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated \n     funds, or exchange, all interest in and to the land described \n     in subsection (b) for addition to Sequoia National Park, \n     California.\n       (b) Land Acquired.--The land referred to in subsection (a) \n     is the land depicted on the\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\n     map entitled ``Dillonwood'', numbered 102/80,044, and dated \n     September 1999.\n       (c) Addition to Park.--On acquisition of the land under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall--\n       (1) add the land to Sequoia National Park;\n       (2) modify the boundaries of Sequoia National Park to \n     include the land; and\n       (3) administer the land as part of Sequoia National Park in \n     accordance with all applicable law (including regulations).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 2280. A bill to provide for the effective punishment of online \nchild molesters; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 cybermolesters enforcement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the Internet has \nrevolutionized communication and business. However, it also provides a \nnew tool for some very traditional villains: child molesters. \nUnfortunately, loopholes in the current law allow some of these \npredators to escape without any real consequences. For this reason I \nhave introduced the Cybermolesters Enforcement Act to ensure that these \nnew on-line molesters are brought to justice.\n  It is already a federal crime to cross state lines to sexually molest \na minor. In recent years the number of people using the Internet to \nviolate this law has skyrocketed. In the last two years alone the FBI's \ncybermolester caseload his increased by 550 percent.\n  Most cybermolesters are well-educated, middle-class, and have no \nprevious criminal record. As a result, many judges are giving them \nlaughably light sentences. Ironically, the purveyors of child-\npornography receive a ten-year mandatory sentence, but those who use \nthe Internet to meet children and act out pornographic fantasies often \nreceive no jail time at all. We need to end the double standard that \ngives lighter sentences to a special set of privileged criminals. The \nCybermolesters Enforcement Act takes a measured approach to this \nproblem by imposing a five-year mandatory minimum sentence without \nchanging the maximum sentence already contained in the law.\n  I would like to thank the high-tech industry for their help in \ndrafting this bill. In particular, I would like to thank the Law \nEnforcement Security Council of the Internet Alliance. This broad-based \ninternet industry coalition is doing important work in the fight \nagainst online crime, and helped to ensure that this bill will not \nburden Internet service providers.\n  The Cybermolesters Enforcement Act addresses a real and chilling \nthreat to our children. It is supported by the FBI's ``Innocent \nImages'' program, which is on the front lines of the battle against on-\nline pedophiles. It doesn't create any new federal crimes or \nregulations. It simply takes a common sense step to ensure that we \nbring today's high-tech child molesters to justice. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in co-sponsoring this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article by George Will outlining \nthis problem be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 23, 2000]\n\n                               Nasty Work\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       To visit a crime scene, turn on your computer. Log on to a \n     list of ``bulletin boards'' or real-time chat rooms, which \n     come and go rapidly. Look for names like \n     ``Ilovemuchyoungerf'' (``f'' stands for females) or \n     ``vryvryvrybrlylegal'' or ``Moms'nsons'' or ``likemyung.''\n       The Internet, like the telephone and automobile before it, \n     has created new possibilities for crime. Some people wielding \n     computers for criminal purposes are being combated by FBI \n     agents working out of an office park in Calverton, Md.\n       The FBI operation, named Innocent Images, targets cyber-\n     stalkers seeking sex with children, and traffickers in child \n     pornography. As one agent here says, ``Business is good--\n     unfortunately.'' Criminal sexual activity on the Internet is \n     a growth industry.\n       In many homes, children are the most competent computer \n     users. They are as comfortable on the Internet as their \n     parents are on the telephone. On the Web, children can be pen \n     pals with the entire world, instantly and at minimal cost. \n     But the world contains many bad people. Parents should take \n     seriously a cartoon that shows two dogs working on computers. \n     One says to the other, ``When you're online no one knows \n     you're a dog.''\n       A child does not know if the person with whom he or she is \n     chatting is another child or a much older person with \n     sinister intentions. The typical person that the agents call \n     a ``traveler''--someone who will cross state lines hoping to \n     have a sexual encounter with a child--is a white male age 25-\n     45. He has above-average education--often an advanced degree, \n     and he can find his way around the Internet--and above-\n     average income, enabling him to travel. Many ``travelers'' \n     are married.\n       But these cyber-stalkers do not know if the person with \n     whom they are chatting is really, as they think, a young boy \n     or girl, or an FBI agent. Some ``travelers'' who thought they \n     had arranged meetings with children have been unpleasantly \n     surprised, arrested, tried and jailed.\n       Since the first arrest under Innocent Images in 1995, there \n     have been 487 arrests of ``travelers'' and pornographers, and \n     409 convictions. Most of the 78 nonconvictions are in cases \n     still pending. The conviction rate is above 95 percent. \n     However, the FBI is distressed by light sentences from some \n     judges who justify their leniency by the fact that the \n     offenders are socially upscale and first offenders. \n     (Actually, probably not: How likely is it that they get \n     caught the first time they become predators?) Lenient \n     judges also call the crime ``victimless'' because it is an \n     FBI agent, not a child, receiving the offender's \n     attention.\n       Agents are trained to avoid entrapment, and predators \n     usually initiate talk about sexual encounters. But children \n     implicitly raise the subject by visiting such chat rooms. \n     Most children recoil when sexual importunings become overt. \n     (``When you come to meet me, make sure you're not wearing any \n     underwear.'') But some importunings, including gifts and \n     sympathetic conversation about the problems of children, are \n     cunning, subtle and effective.\n       Publicity about Innocent Images may deter some predators, \n     but most are driven to risk-taking by obsessions. America \n     Online and other service providers look for suspect chat \n     rooms and close those they spot, but they exist in such \n     rapidly changing profusion that there are always many \n     menacing ones open.\n       Digital cameras, and the plunging price of computer storage \n     capacity for downloaded photographs, have made this, so to \n     speak, the golden age of child pornography. The fact that the \n     mere possession of it is a crime does not deter people from \n     finding, in the blizzard of Internet activities, like-minded \n     people to whom they say things like, ``I'm interested in \n     pictures of boys 6 to 8 having sex with adults.''\n       A booklet available from any FBI office, ``A Parent's Guide \n     to Internet Safety,'' lists signs that a child might be at \n     risk online. These include the child's being online for \n     protracted periods, particularly at night. Being online like \n     that is the unenviable duty of FBI agents running Innocent \n     Images.\n       Each of the FBI's 56 field offices has an officer trained \n     to seek cyber-stalkers and traffickers in child pornography. \n     Ten offices have Innocent Images operations. Agents assigned \n     to Innocent Images can spend as many as 10 hours a day \n     monitoring the sexual sewer that is a significant part of the \n     ``information superhighway.'' So the FBI looks for \n     ``reluctant volunteers'' who, while working, are given \n     psychological tests to see that they are not becoming \n     ``damaged goods.'' Whatever these agents are being paid, they \n     are underpaid.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 2281. A bill to name the United States Army misssile range at \nKwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands for former President Ronald \nReagan; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO RENAME KWAJALEIN TESTING ATOLL FOR PRESIDENT RONALD \n                                 REAGAN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, twenty years ago, \nPresident Ronald Reagan took office with daunting tasks before him. A \nyear before, the Soviet Red Army had invaded Afghanistan, and Soviet \nproxy forces were challenging U.S. allies and interests in Central \nAmerica, in Africa, and elsewhere. American hostages were still being \nheld in Tehran, and the United States was suffering an acute crisis of \nconfidence. Faced with an expansionistic Soviet Union that intimidated \nthe Free World with nuclear weapons and a Communist ideology spread by \nSoviet-supported insurgencies and armed coups, President Reagan \ndedicated his Administration to resisting this global menace and toward \nwinning the Cold War.\n  President Reagan rejected the notion that the Soviet Union would \nmodify its belligerence if only allowed to match U.S. military \nstrength. He rejected the idea that the Evil Empire was indivisible, by \nimplementing the Reagan doctrine, which met the Soviet proxy challenge \nin the Third World in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Angola, and by funding \nSolidarity in Poland.\n  On March 23, 1983, President Reagan set forth a broad vision of \nbuilding a space-based defense, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), \nto free the American people from the threat of nuclear annihilation and \nto protect the public from an accidental nuclear\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nlaunch initiated by the Soviet Union or by a rogue state or actor. The \ncritics labeled it ``Star Wars'' after the blockbuster hit by the same \nname and scoffed that it would never work. They publicly floated the \nnotion that SDI was only a bargaining chip for arms control \nnegotiations. America held its breath while President Reagan, remaining \nfaithful to his vision, turned down President Gorbachev's offer at \nReyjavik, because it would have meant the end of SDI. Reagan refused to \ngive up his dreams of assured survival to replace assured destruction.\n  Yet only twenty years earlier, President John F. Kennedy, after the \nSoviet launching of Sputnik, promised to put a man on the moon, and the \nApollo program was born. Today, as the technology to intercept incoming \nmissiles is being tested, Reagan's vision, like that of John F. \nKennedy, is being realized, and the irrational notion of mutual assured \ndestruction (MAD) pushed by arms control zealots is being dealt a \nmortal blow.\n  Progress towards a national missile defense has not been impeded \nprimarily by technical limitations, but rather by political \nobstruction, foot-dragging and by restraints of an imprudent treaty \nsigned with a power that no longer exists. The ABM Treaty signed with \nthe now-defunct USSR denies effective antimissile protections for the \nUnited States. As a result, the American people continue to remain \nundefended in the event of a missile attack.\n  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall more than 10 years ago, and the \ncollapse of the Soviet empire, Russia continues to pursue programs and \npolicies that place the U.S. in conflict with the Russian Government, \nespecially in the area of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear war-\nfighting. There is also rapid proliferation of ballistic missile and \nnuclear technology world-wide.\n  In recognition of President Reagan's dedication to providing America \nwith protection from her enemies, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin with me in supporting the renaming of the Army Missile Testing \nRange in the Republic of the Marshall Islands as the Ronald Reagan \nStrategic Defense Initiative Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll.\n  I would like to point out that Kwajalein is a valuable national asset \nwith a prime location for space surveillance, the ability to handle \nboth long and short-range missions, and a suite of radars unsurpassed \nfor assesssing missile intercepts. In 1986, President Reagan isssued \nProclamation 5564, implementing the Compact of Free Association between \nthe two nations, a key element of which granted the U.S. Department of \nDefense leasing rights to the Kwajalein Atoll for development of a \nnational missile defense program, or the Strategic Defense Initiative. \nSDI was Ronald Reagan's greatest dream, and I believe that most of us \nlook forward to its near-term fulfillment.\n  The Marshallese legislature in February of 1999 decided to \ncommemorate President Reagan in this manner by enacting Resolution 85. \nTherefore, I think it only fitting that the Senate concur in this \ntribute to a great President, leader and patriot, and a man, who \nbecause of his courage in attacking the conventional wisdom of his era, \nand because of his extraordinary and courageous vision, has changed the \ncourse of history.\n  I am also including in the Record a fitting tribute to President \nReagan by Winston Churchill which describes the impact that SDI had on \nthe Soviet empire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Any reference to \n     that range in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or \n     other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a \n     reference to the Ronald Reagan Strategic Defense Initiative \n     Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  From the Remarks of Winston S. Churchill, MP, at the Opening of an \n    Exhibition of His Grandfather's Paintings at the Ronald Reagan \n                  Presidential Library, December 1992\n\n       Mr. President, You have made reference to Sir Winston \n     Churchill's Iron Curtain speech at Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, \n     but more than any other single person, it was you who brought \n     about the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the demise of the \n     ``evil empire.''\n       Historians will ponder the intriguing fact that in 1979 \n     electorates on both sides of the Atlantic simultaneously \n     smelled a rat. They sensed that if things were allowed to \n     drift on through the 1980s as they had so disastrously in the \n     1970s, with the West in full retreat in the face of Soviet \n     expansionism in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the free \n     world be heading for catastrophe.\n       Accordingly, the U.S. and British electorates placed you \n     and Margaret Thatcher in office--and what a formidable \n     partnership you forged! You inspired NATO with a new resolve. \n     You strengthened the defenses of the West. You made clear \n     that the bugle would no more sound ``retreat!''\n       When you unveiled your Strategic Defense Initiative, it was \n     mockingly dubbed ``Star Wars'' and dismissed by all too many \n     in both our countries as pure Hollywood hype. Fortunately, \n     there were a few people who believed it would work.\n       I believe that when the history of this cataclysmic period \n     comes to be written, it will be seen that it was SDI--more \n     than any other factor--that broke the Soviet camel's back by \n     convincing the incumbents of the Kremlin that they could no \n     longer afford to compete militarily with the United States as \n     their economy could no longer bear the burden.\n       All mankind owes you a debt of gratitude for bringing the \n     Cold War to an end, for putting the arms race in reverse and \n     for promoting reconciliation between East and West, so that \n     today we all live in a safer world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2282. A bill to encourage the efficient use of existing resources \nand assets related to Indian agricultural research, development and \nexports within the United States Department of Agriculture, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n   the native american agricultural research, development and export \n                        enhancement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Tim Johnson in introducing the Native American Agriculture \nResearch, Development and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to encourage \nthe development of the Indian agricultural sector. This bill will help \nmake efficient use of Federal agriculture research, development and \nexport resources in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Agriculture has been a central part of the Native American culture, \nway of life, self sufficiency, and economies from time immemorial. This \nis still true today with many Indian tribes using agriculture and \nagribusiness to sustain their livelihoods and economies.\n  There are some 55 million acres of Indian lands in the United States, \napproximately 2 percent of all lands in the country, with nearly 47 \nmillion of these acres made up of crop and range land.\n  Indian agriculture production is not limited to just farming and \nranching, it also includes such diverse products as timber and forest \ngoods, fish and seafood, bison, wild rice, fruits and nuts, cotton and \na host of other Native-made and gathered products.\n  Agriculture constitutes the second largest revenue generator and \nemployer in Indian country but often takes a back seat to other \ninitiatives in the development of tribal resources and economies. By \nreinvigorating the Indian agriculture sector we can develop the value-\nadded industries to provide food security, as well as increase \nemployment and raise incomes in Indian communities.\n  Although there are many programs within the Department of Agriculture \nfor which tribal and individual Indian producers are eligible, Indian \nproducers have not fully benefitted from these programs because of a \nlack of thoughtful coordination and attention within the Department.\n  In fact, these is now pending a class action lawsuit filed by Indian \nfarmers against the Department charging discrimination and neglect in \nthe availability and use of funds, programs, and services.\n  This bill will afford Indian farmers and producers the same benefits, \nassistance and organization that non-Indian producers currently enjoy \nby promoting the coordination of existing agriculture and related \nprograms within\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nthe Department to provide maximum benefit to Indian tribes and their \nmembers.\n  It is my hope that this initiative will encourage intertribal, \nregional, and international trade and business development in order to \nassist in increasing productivity, access to specialty markets, export \npromotion, marketing assistance, access to capital, and at the same \ntime help facilitate agricultural ventures with non-Indian entities.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, a Native American Research, \nDevelopment, and Export Office would be established within the \nDepartment and would have a Director appointed by the Secretary to \nensure the intra-agency and inter-agency coordination of programs that \nassist Indian agriculture and economic development.\n  This bill is not intended to reduce, rather than create, more federal \nbureaucracy. Therefore, this office will be formed using funds already \nappropriated to the Department.\n  Within this office, the Director would establish the Native American \nTrade and Export Promotion Program to help coordinate and cooperate \nwith the other appropriate Federal agencies to promote Indian \nagriculture and related value-added industries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Agricultural \n     Research, Development and Export Enhancement Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n     United States and Indian tribes.\n       (2) Beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n     Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each \n     successive President has reaffirmed the special government-\n     to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the \n     United States.\n       (3) In 1994, President Clinton issued an executive \n     memorandum to the heads of all Federal departments and \n     agencies that obligated all such departments and agencies, \n     particularly those that have an impact on economic \n     development, to evaluate the potential impacts of their \n     actions on Indian tribes.\n       (4) The United States has an obligation to guard and \n     preserve the agricultural and related renewable resources of \n     Indian tribes in order to foster strong tribal governments, \n     Indian self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency \n     among Indian tribes.\n       (5) Despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, \n     poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and associated \n     social ills than those of any other group in the United \n     States.\n       (6) Reservation-based Indians tend to be the most rural of \n     any minority group. They tend to be geographically isolated, \n     resource limited, and the least likely of any farm group to \n     receive payment or loans from the United States.\n       (7) Indian land represents close to 55,000,000 acres, or \n     about 2 percent of the United States land base, with nearly \n     47,000,000 of these acres consisting of range and cropland.\n       (8) Indian agriculture constitutes the second largest \n     revenue generator and employer in Indian country and is not \n     limited to farming and ranching, but often includes such \n     products as forestry, bison, wild rice and fruits, cotton, \n     tobacco and other Native-made or grown products.\n       (9) Because of the lack of Federal intra-agency and inter-\n     agency coordination in agriculture programs and policies, the \n     development of Indian agriculture and related tribal business \n     and economic development potential has been hindered.\n       (10) It is estimated that about 20 percent of reservation \n     grazing land and about 70 percent of cropland is leased to \n     non-Indian producers.\n       (11) American Indians today use their lands and natural \n     resources for agriculture and agribusiness to provide food \n     and other staples for consumption, improving their economic \n     self-sufficiency, agriculture income and reservation \n     employment.\n       (12) Although there are many programs within Department of \n     Agriculture for which tribal and individual Indian producers \n     are eligible, Indian producers have not fully benefited from \n     these programs because of insufficient coordination within \n     the Department of Agriculture.\n       (13) The United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n     tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and \n     political conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n       (A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not \n     originate with the tribes; and\n       (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that \n     are not tribal entities.\n       (14) The economic success and material well-being of Native \n     American communities depends on the combined efforts of the \n     Federal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, \n     and individuals.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) promote the coordination of existing agricultural and \n     related programs within the Department of Agriculture to \n     provide the maximum benefit to Indian tribes and their \n     members;\n       (2) encourage intertribal, regional, and international \n     trade and business development in order to assist in \n     increasing productivity and the standard of living of members \n     of Indian tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency \n     of the Indian tribes;\n       (3) through improving the administration of Federal \n     program, improve the access of Indian tribes to capital, \n     specialty markets, export promotions, and marketing \n     assistance that non-Indian agriculture producers currently \n     have access to;\n       (4) improve the development and coordination of Indian \n     agriculture and related value-added industries to promote \n     self-sustaining Native economies and communities; and\n       (5) promote economic self-sufficiency and political self-\n     determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to make certain amendments with respect to Indian tribes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          the indian tribal surface transportation act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Tim \nJohnson in introducing today a bill to make needed clarifications in \nthe law to aid in the administration of the Indian Reservation Road and \nBridge Program to better meet the transportation needs in Indian \ncountry.\n  There is an enormous need for physical infrastructure on Indian lands \nthroughout the country. This infrastructure is necessary for Indian \ntribes and their citizens to carry out emergency services, law \nenforcement, and the transportation of goods and services.\n  In addition, physical infrastructure is just as important for Indian \ncommunities as it is for other communities because Indian economies are \nstill in need of significant investment and private sector activity.\n  When entrepreneurs or investors are calculating whether to invest in \nany community they look first to see if basic building blocks are \nthere: roads, highways, electricity, potable water, and other factors.\n  So for Indian communities an efficient federal roads financing and \nconstruction system holds the key to healthier economies and higher \nstandards of living for their members.\n  In 1998, Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act of the \nTwenty-First Century (``TEA-21'') to authorize Federal surface \ntransportation programs with the goals of improved highways, increased \nsafety, protecting the environment, and increased economic growth.\n  In passing TEA-21, Congress approved several Indian amendments that I \nwas happy to propose to require a negotiated rule-making to determine \nthe allocation formula to allow the kind of flexibility needed for an \nIndian country-wide formula; as well as a provision to ensure that all \nTEA funds set aside for Indians would be made available to tribes that \nchoose to enter contracts under the Indian Self-Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act of 1975, P.L. 93-638, as amended.\n  On October 20, 1999, the Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair, \nheld an oversight hearing on the Indian reservation roads program and \nTEA-21. From testimony and other evidence presented it is evident that \nthere remain serious obstacles to a more efficient functioning of TEA-\n21 in Indian communities. I am sorry to say that one of the obstacles \nappears to be the administration of the program by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs itself.\n  The Indian reservation roads program is set up in such a way that the \nroads funding is transferred from the Department of Transportation's \nFederal Highway Administration [FHWA] to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nwhich in turn allocates the funds to Indian tribes based on a pre-\nexisting formula.\n  Although reservation roads compose 2.63 percent of the Federal \nhighway system, less than 1 percent of Federal aid had been allocated \nto Indian roads.\n  This bill would remove the so-called ``obligation limitation'' \ncontained within TEA-21 and in effect would allow the already-\nauthorized funds for Indians to reach the intended beneficiaries.\n  In 1999, the amount of funds that reached the Indian communities was \n$34 million less than that authorized in TEA-21 because of the \nobligation limitation.\n  This bill also authorizes the Federal Lands Highway Program to \nestablish a Pilot Program to contract directly with Indian tribes for \nthe administration of these tribes' roads programs. By allowing tribes \nto voluntary enter this program, it is intended that a better use can \nbe made of existing resources and at the same time encourage Indian \ntribal self-determination.\n  Under current law, the BIA is authorized to use ``up to 6 percent'' \nof the roads funding for oversight and administration of the Indian \nroads program. If it was not clear in 1998, it should be clear now that \nthese funds are not intended to be available to subsidize other BIA \nroads operations nor are they intended to be used for any other \npurposes.\n  The bill I am introducing today contains an amendment that clarifies \nthe ``up to 6 percent'' language by reiterating Congress' intention \nthat the figure was and is intended as a maximum, not a minimum, \nfunding level with regard to BIA administrative costs.\n  Finally, with regard to the option to tribes to administer these \nfunds and programs, the bill clarifies that all Indian reservation \nroads program funds are to be made available to Indian tribes which \nwant to assume the administration of their reservation roads program \nunder Public Law 93-638.\n  The bill also seeks to eliminate the current redundancy is required \nhealth and safety certification by allowing tribes the option of \nmeeting statutorily required Health and Safety Standards without the \nneed for a second, duplicative effort by the BIA. It is important to \nnote that the standards themselves will not change, nor will the need \nfor tribal compliance with those standards change.\n  Mr. President, that is a brief description of the amendments in this \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to support them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\n                                S. 2283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2287. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \nto make grants for the development and operation of research centers \nregarding environmental factors that may be related to the etiology of \nbreast cancer; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n          breast cancer and environmental research act of 2000\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenator Harry Reid in introducing the Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act of 2000. This bill would establish research centers that \nwould be the first in the nation to specifically study the \nenvironmental factors that may be related to the development of breast \ncancer. The lack of agreement within the scientific community and among \nbreast cancer advocates on this question highlights the need for \nfurther study.\n  It is generally believed that the environment plays some role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, but the extent of that role is not \nunderstood. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2000 \nwill enable us to conduct more conclusive and comprehensive research to \ndetermine the impact of the environment on breast cancer. Before we can \nfind the answers, we must determine the right questions we should be \nasking.\n  While more research is being conducted into the relationship between \nbreast cancer and the environment, there are still several issues that \nmust be resolved to make this research more effective.\n  There is no known cause of breast cancer.--There is little agreement \nin the scientific community on how the environment affects breast \ncancer. While studies have been conducted on the links between \nenvironmental factors like pesticides, diet, and electromagnetic \nfields, no consensus has been reached. There are other factors that \nhave not yet been studied that could provide valuable information. \nWhile there is much speculation, it is clear that the relationship \nbetween environmental exposures and breast cancer is poorly understood.\n  There are challenges in conducting environmental research.--\nIdentifying links between environmental factors and breast cancer is \ndifficult. Laboratory experiments and cluster analyses, such as those \nin Long Island, New York, cannot reveal whether an environmental \nexposure increases a woman's risk of breast cancer. Epidemiological \nstudies must be designed carefully because environmental exposures are \ndifficult to measure.\n  Coordination between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the \nNational Cancer Institute (NCI), and the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).--NCI and NIEHS are the two \ninstitutes in the NIH that fund most of the research related to breast \ncancer and the environment; however, comprehensive information specific \nto environmental effects on breast cancer is not currently available.\n  This legislation would establish eight Centers of Excellence to study \nthese potential links. These ``Breast Cancer Environmental Research \nCenters'' would provide for multidisciplinary research among basic, \nclinical, epidemiological and behavioral scientists interested in \nestablishing outstanding, state-of-the-art research programs addressing \npotential links between the\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\nenvironment and breast cancer. The NIEHS would award grants based on a \ncompetitive peer-review process. This legislation would require each \nCenter to collaborate with community organizations in the area, \nincluding those that represent women with breast cancer. The bill would \nauthorize $30 million for the next five years for these grants.\n\n  ``Genetics loads the gun, the environment pulls the trigger,'' as Ken \nOlden, the Director of NIEHS, frequently says. Many scientists believe \nthat certain groups of women have genetic variations that may make them \nmore susceptible to adverse environmental exposures. We need to step \nback and gather evidence before we come to conclusions--that is the \npurpose of this bill. People are hungry for information, and there is a \nlot of inconclusive data out there, some of which has no scientific \nmerit whatsoever. We have the opportunity through this legislation to \ngather legitimate and comprehensive data from premier research \ninstitutions across the nation.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, each year 800 women in \nRhode Island are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 200 women in my \nstate will die of this terrible disease this year. We owe it to these \nwomen who are diagnosed with this life-threatening disease to provide \nthem with answers for the first time.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, and ask unanimous consent that the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer and \n     Environmental Research Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among American women.\n       (2) In 1999, 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast \n     cancer, and more than 43,000 are expected to die from this \n     disease.\n       (3) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public \n     private partnership, has recognized the importance of \n     expanding the scope and breadth of biomedical, \n     epidemiological, and behavioral research activities related \n     to the etiology of breast cancer and the role of the \n     environment.\n       (4) To date, there has been only a limited research \n     investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across \n     disciplines or work with the community to study the role of \n     the environment in the development of breast cancer.\n       (5) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n     potential for avenues of prevention, the Federal investment \n     in the role of the environment and the development of breast \n     cancer should be expanded.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nSocial Security Act to repeal provisions relating to the State \nenforcement of child support obligations and the disbursement of such \nsupport and the require the Internal Revenue service to collect and \ndisburse such support through wage withholding and other means; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n the compassion for children and child support enforcement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Compassion \nfor Children and Child Support Enforcement Act. This important \nlegislation would ensure that children from single parent households \nwill have the financial support necessary for a healthy, happy and \nsecure childhood.\n  Mr. President, over one quarter of today's American children live in \na single-parent household. These children are more likely to live in \npoverty than children living in homes where both parents are present. \nChildren growing up in a state of poverty suffer from far reaching, \nlong-term effects: inadequate education, lack of access to quality \nhealth care and instability arising from lack of affordable housing \nfrequently leads to poorer health, lower earning potential and greater \ninstability as an adult.\n  Tragically, the financial hardship endured by many of these children \nis avoidable--simply put, Mr. President, these children are suffering \nbecause their absent parent has chosen to shirk his parental \nobligations and refuse to provide his child with the financial support \nhe or she deserves and so desperately needs. According to the Federal \nOffice of Child Support in its preliminary report for 1998, over $50 \nbillion in accumulated unpaid child support is due to over 30 million \nchildren in the United States. This dismal statistic is due to the 23 \npercent collection rate in cases handled by overwhelmed state agencies.\n  Of the children living in a household with only one present parent, \n40 percent are not eligible for child support because paternity has not \nbeen established or a support order has not been issued by the courts. \nOf the remaining 60 percent with established paternity and a support \norder, only half actually receive any financial support from their \nabsent parent and more than half will not receive the full amount of \ntheir support payments.\n  The Compassion for Children and Child Support Enforcement Act would \nwork to decrease the rate of delinquent child support payments and \nincrease the rate of paternity establishment.\n  Mr. President, the Department of the Treasury is in the unique \nposition to address problems arising from a lack of resources, \norganization and communication which frequently arise in child support \ncases involving two or more jurisdictions, by allowing the Internal\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nRevenue Service to collect child support in the same manner that taxes \nare collected and then disburse the payments to the custodial parents \nwith penalties and interest if applicable. The IRS is already the most \neffective means by which child support is collected under the entire \nstate/federal child support program nexus through its system of federal \ntax intercepts.\n  By taking over responsibility of enforcing all child support orders \nthrough routine withholding of support from obligated parents and the \nuse of the enforcement tools at its disposal to collect from delinquent \nparents, the Department of Treasury would significantly reduce the \ndemands on State judicial resources now devoted to child support \nenforcement. And, Mr. President, by reducing the drain on State \nresources in the area of support enforcement, States would be able to \nbetter focus on establishing paternity for the 40 percent of children \ncurrently unable to even file for a support order due to lack of \nrecognized paternity.\n  Congress failed again and again to find a way to ensure that families \nreceive the child support that is owed to them by deadbeat parents. \nDespite reforms in 1984, 1988, 1993 and most recently in 1996, there \nhave not been any significant improvements in the rate of child support \ncollections.\n  The Compassion for Children and Support Enforcement Act represents a \nunique opportunity to pass effective and efficient child support \nenforcement legislation which creates state /federal partnerships by \ncapitalizing on the strengths of the governments, agencies and networks \nalready in place. Chairman Hyde has already introduced this legislation \nin the House of Representatives, where it enjoys the bipartisan support \nof 21 cosponsors. It is my sincerest hope that my colleagues in the \nSenate will follow the lead of the House and demonstrate their support \nfor ensuring that our children receive the financial support necessary \nfor them to grow into healthy and productive citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2289. A bill for the Relief of Jose Guadalupe Tellez Pinales; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief \nbill on behalf a constituent of mine, Jose Pinales.\n  His family and friends call him Lupe, and a private relief bill is \nhis only hope to avoid being separated from the people and the country \nhe loves. Lupe was brought to the United States sixteen years ago, when \nhe was two years old, by his uncle, Miguel Landeros. Mr. Landeros, now \na U.S. citizen, never formally adopted Lupe. Not until recently did \nLupe learn that he was not a U.S. citizen, when he tried to enlist in \nthe United States Marines, to serve what he believed was his country.\n  The United States is the only country Lupe knows. It's the country he \nloves, and wishes to serve. Lupe grew up reciting the pledge of \nallegiance to the United States along with the rest of the children in \nhis class at Jefferson Elementary School. He is now a Senior at Fort \nMadison High School in Iowa, and works part-time as he prepares to \ngraduate this spring. This young man has almost completed a milestone \nin his life and has a dream of joining the United States Marines upon \ngraduation. It wasn't until Lupe sought to fulfill this dream did he \nlearn that not only was he not a U.S. citizen, but he was in possible \ndanger of being forced to go to Mexico, a country where the people and \ncustoms are foreign to him. He doesn't even speak the language.\n  Faced with Lupe's plight, the generous people of Fort Madison have \nrallied together asking for our support in passing a private relief \nbill for him.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe definition of contribution in aid of construction; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO CLARIFY THE TAX TREATMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS IN AID OF \n                              CONSTRUCTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of myself and the senior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to \nclarify that water and sewage service laterals are included in the \ndefinition of contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). The bill \nclarifies current law by specifically stating that ``customer service \nfees'' are CIAC. It maintains current treatment of service charges for \nstopping and starting service (not CIAC). Because this is a \nclarification of current law, the effective date for the bill is as if \nincluded in the original legislation, which is section 1613(a) of the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act of 1996.\n  The need for this legislation is brought about because the Department \nof Treasury has issued proposed regulations to provide guidance on the \ndefinition of CIAC. Despite the fact that Congress specifically removed \nlanguage concerning ``customer services fees'' in its amendment in \n1996, the Department added the language back into the proposed \nregulation specifying that such fees are not CIAC. They then defined \nthe term very broadly to include service laterals, which traditionally \nand under the most common state law treatment would be considered CIAC.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I, along with many of our colleagues here \nin this chamber, worked hard over the course of a number of years to \nrestore the pre-1986 Act tax treatment for water and sewage CIAC. In \n1996, we succeeded in passing our legislation. It was identical to pre-\n1986 law with three exceptions. Two of the changes were made in \nresponse to a Treasury Department request. The third removed the \nlanguage dealing with ``service connection fees'' primarily because of \npotential confusion resulting from the ambiguity of the term. The \nsponsors of the legislation were concerned that the IRS would use this \nambiguity to exclude a portion of what the state regulators consider \nCIAC.\n  As part of our efforts, we developed a revenue raiser in cooperation \nwith the industry to make up any revenue loss due to our legislation, \nincluding the three changes. This revenue raiser extended the life, and \nchanged the method, for depreciating water utility property from 20 \nyear accelerated to 25-year straight-line depreciation. As a \nconsequence of this sacrifice by the industry, our CIAC change made a \nnet $274 million contribution toward deficit reduction.\n  It is my belief that the final revenue estimate done by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation on the restoration of CIAC included all property \ntreated as CIAC by the industry regulators including specifically \nservice laterals. In an October 11, 1995 letter to me, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation provided revenue estimates for the CIAC \nlegislation. A footnote in this letter states, ``These estimates have \nbeen revisited to reflect more recent data.'' The industry had only \nrecently supplied the committee with comprehensive data, which \nreflected total CIAC in the industry including service laterals.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join with us in supporting this \nclarification of current law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 2291. A bill to provide assistance for efforts to improve \nconservation of, recreation in, erosion control of, and maintenance of \nfish and wildlife habitat of the Missouri River in the State of South \nDakota, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n               the missouri river restoration act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Missouri River is one of our nation's \ngreatest natural resources. Millions of visitors travel to the river \neach year to hunt, camp and fish. Millions more Americans rely on the \nMissouri's federal dams for affordable electricity. And, tens of \nthousands of South Dakotans depend upon the river as their only source \nof clean drinking water.\n  The river is rich in history. For thousands of years, Native \nAmericans have lived along the river, and countless sites of deep \nspiritual and cultural importance to tribes line its shores. The river \nwas also part of the route used by Lewis and Clark as they explored our \nnation. As we approach the bicentennial of that journey, it is expected \nthat\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nmillions of Americans will visit the Missouri River to retrace their \nsteps.\n  Because the river is so important to the economy of our nation and to \nits heritage, it is critical that we meet head-on the growing array of \nchallenges that it is facing. That is why I am introducing the Missouri \nRiver Restoration Act of 2000. This legislation will provide critically \nneeded resources to ensure that future generations will continue to \nbenefit from the river as we do today.\n  I am deeply concerned by the dramatic changes that we have witnessed \nsince the construction of four federal dams on the river in South \nDakota decades ago. These dams, which have prevented billions of \ndollars of flood-related damage downstream to cities like St. Louis, \nhave altered the natural flow of the river. Sediment that used to be \ncarried downstream, giving the river its nickname of ``Big Muddy,'' is \nnow being deposited in South Dakota's reservoirs, Lake Oahe, Lake \nSharpe, Lake Francis Case and Lewis and Clark Lake.\n  The siltation of the river is having a dramatic impact. In the cities \nof Pierre and Ft. Pierre, it has raised the water table and flooded \nshoreline homes. Already, Congress has had to authorize a $35 million \nproject to relocate hundreds of affected families, and the Corps of \nEngineers has been forced to curtail the generation of electricity at \nOahe dam in the wintertime to prevent additional flooding. In the town \nof Springfield, the economy has suffered a decline in tourism because \nfew boaters can navigate the tons of silt that have clogged the river.\n  The problem will only grow more serious in the future. Each year, the \nriver's tributaries deliver more than 40 million tons of sediment to \nthe reservoirs. It is estimated that in less than 75 years, Lewis and \nClark lake--the smallest of the reservoirs--will fill with sediment \ncompletely. The lake, and the development and recreation the lake has \ncreated for cities like Springfield and Yankton, will disappear \naltogether.\n  The economic impact of these changes on South Dakota would be very \nserious. Currently, visitors to counties bordering the Missouri River \nspend over $85 million each year. Anglers spend over $200 million in \nthe state, and support more than 5,400 jobs. The loss of the Missouri's \nfisheries to sedimentation and the decline in the number of visitors to \nthe river would have grave economic consequences. Furthermore, \nlimitations imposed on electrical generation and flood control caused \nby sedimentation will have a dramatic impact in states throughout our \nregion, as electricity prices and damages from flooding increase.\n  In addition to the problems caused by the siltation of the river, the \nriver has faced a growing amount of erosion. While erosion is natural \non all rivers, its pace has picked up on the Missouri due to the \noperation of the dams. Erosion has destroyed thousands of acres of \nfarmland and is a serious threat to irreplaceable sites of spiritual \nimportance to Indian tribes. Thousands of sites, ranging from burial \ngrounds to campsites, are found up and down the Missouri River in South \nDakota. It is unacceptable to let them wash away into the river. We \nmust respect all those who came before us, and preserve this part of \nour nation's heritage.\n\n  Last January, Governor Bill Janklow, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Chairman \nMike Jandreau and I hosted a Missouri River Summit in the city of \nSpringfield to bring together the best minds in the state to find a \nsolution to these pressing problems. Over 400 South Dakotans attended \nthis meeting and provided their thoughts and ideas. Virtually all those \nin attendance agreed that there is a critical need for more resources \nto improve conservation, to stop erosion and to help communities better \nutilize the river. The Missouri River Restoration Act of 2000 will help \nus to meet these goals as soon as possible.\n  This legislation, which I have developed in consultation with \nGovernor Janklow of South Dakota, Chairman Jandreau and other state \nleaders, would establish a $200 million federal trust fund to provide \nthe resources necessary to address the critical needs of the Missouri \nRiver watershed. Of these funds, 30 percent would be set aside for \nprojects in Indian reservations or administered by Indian tribes.\n  Trust fund revenues would be administered by a 25-member ``Missouri \nRiver Trust'' composed of all the river's major stakeholders. Each of \nSouth Dakota's nine Indian tribes would appoint one member, as would \nthe Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota. The remainder would be \nappointed by the Governor, and must equally represent environmental, \nagricultural, hydropower and other river interests. In consultation \nwith appropriate federal agencies, the Trust must develop a plan for \nthe use of trust fund revenues that will reduce the siltation of the \nriver by improving conservation in fragile riparian lands, better \nprotect Indian cultural and historical sites, reduce erosion and \nimprove our ability to recreate on the river. It will also be \nresponsible for reviewing grant proposals to meet these goals.\n  Funding decisions would be made by a 5-member Executive Committee. To \nensure that its decisions are balanced and represent the best interests \nof the state, the Executive Committee must be composed of members \nrepresenting tribal, hydropower, agricultural, environmental and state \ngovernment interests.\n  By establishing a trust fund and administrating board that \neffectively represents all stakeholders, we can provide South Dakota \nwith the tools it needs to preserve the Missouri River for generations \nto come. I hope my colleagues will give this important legislation \ntheir support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the Sioux Falls Argus \nLeader be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Missouri River trust fund is worthy idea\n\n\n        Good management is vitally important to state's economy\n\n       Nothing has chiseled South Dakota's personality and \n     tailored its economy quite like the Missouri River. Though, \n     it geographically divides the state into East River and West \n     River, it is the lifeblood that unites the state as one.\n       The powerful waters of the Missouri River, which once \n     determined survival for early settlers, are central today to \n     the state's economic well-being and its quality of life.\n       Growing communities like Sioux Falls--and smaller towns \n     like Pipestone, Minn.--look to the river as a future water \n     source to sustain residential and industrial growth.\n       Yet, riverside landowners have seen acres of their property \n     swept away by the unruly river while others watch tons of \n     silt clog the channel, increasing lowland flooding and \n     killing recreational opportunities.\n       The millions of tons of silt that accumulate in the river \n     also have negatively affected wildlife and recreation.\n       Properly managed, its waters can nurture the environment, \n     enhance recreation and tourism opportunities and support \n     growing communities.\n       However, the practices that controlled the Missouri River \n     in past decades do not necessarily well serve state residents \n     today. With the dawn of the 21st century, it's time to \n     rethink and revamp policies established in the 1940s and \n     '50s.\n       The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has begun tweaking \n     longstanding practices to improve habitat for fish and birds \n     along North America's largest reservoir system. It also has \n     developed a plan to address the sediment buildup near Pierre \n     and Fort Pierre.\n       It is unacceptable, however, to allow the problems to be \n     addressed in a piecemeal fashion. The reasons are clear. \n     Consider:\n       Visitors spent an estimated $85.2 million in 1998 on \n     lodging, food and beverage in countries along the Missouri \n     River.\n       In 1996, anglers on South Dakota waterway spent $206.4 \n     million in the state, generated more than $8 million in state \n     sales taxes, and supported more than 5,400 jobs.\n       Last year, 1.6 million people visited recreation areas \n     along the Missouri River to hike, hunt, fish and participate \n     in water sports.\n       More than 300,000 South Dakotans will ultimately receive \n     clean and safe drinking water from the Missouri River through \n     the Mid-Dakota, Mni Wiconi, WEB and proposed Lewis and Clark \n     water systems.\n       The four hydroelectric dams of the Missouri River provide \n     cheap, clean hydroelectric power to about 3.5 million people \n     in the Missouri River Basin. Rural customers benefit the most \n     from this low-cost power supply.\n       If something isn't done soon, tourism, recreation and \n     hydropower generation will be hobbled. Homeowners and \n     businesses will be hurt.\n       To this end, we support Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who is \n     pressing federal legislation to create a ``Missouri River \n     Trust Fund'' to protect and enhance the river. The fund would \n     support efforts to reverse the sediment build-up and short \n     erosion that have taken place on the river since construction \n     of federal dams in the 1960s. It also would pay for \n     improvements in recreation, conservation and the protection \n     of cultural sites. It would also extend the ability of the \n     dams to generate affordable electricity for the region.\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\n       A trust fund would ensure that a steady source of revenue \n     would be available to address the problems for years to come.\n       Daschle is rallying support of federal, state, local and \n     tribal leaders and wants to secure the first installment this \n     year.\n       The sooner the better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url":

Res. 98\n\n       Whereas the Department of State reports that at any given \n     time there are 1,000 open cases of American children either \n     abducted from the United States or wrongfully retained in a \n     foreign country;\n       Whereas many more cases of international child abductions \n     are not reported to the Department of State;\n       Whereas the situation has worsened since 1993, when \n     Congress estimated the number of abducted and wrongfully \n     retained American children to be more than 10,000;\n       Whereas Congress has recognized the gravity of \n     international child abduction in enacting the International \n     Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 (18 U.S.C. 1204), the \n     Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C. 1738a), and \n     substantial reform and reporting requirements for the \n     Department of State in the fiscal years 1998-1999 and 2000-\n     2001 Foreign Relations Authorization Acts;\n       Whereas the United States became a contracting party in \n     1988 to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \n     International Child Abduction (in this concurrent resolution \n     referred to as the ``Hague Convention'') and adopted \n     effective implementing legislation in the International Child \n     Abduction Remedies Act (42 U.S.C. 11601 et seq.);\n       Whereas the Hague Convention establishes reciprocal rights \n     and duties between and among its contracting states to \n     expedite the return of children to the state of their \n     habitual residence, as well as to ensure that rights of \n     custody and of access under the laws of one contracting state \n     are effectively respected in other contracting states, \n     without consideration of the merits of any underlying child \n     custody dispute;\n       Whereas Article 13 of the Hague Convention provides a \n     narrow exception to the requirement for prompt return of \n     children, which exception releases the requested state from \n     its obligation to return a child to the country of the \n     child's habitual residence if it is established that there is \n     a ``grave risk'' that the return would expose the child to \n     ``physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child \n     in an intolerable situation'' or ``if the child objects to \n     being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity \n     at which it is appropriate to take account of the child's \n     views'';\n       Whereas some contracting states, for example Germany, \n     routinely invoke Article 13 as a justification for nonreturn, \n     rather than resorting to it in a small number of wholly \n     exceptional cases;\n       Whereas the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children (NCMEC), the only institution of its kind, was \n     established in the United States for the purpose of assisting \n     parents in recovering their missing children;\n       Whereas Article 21 of the Hague Convention provides that \n     the central authorities of all parties to the Convention are \n     obligated to cooperate with each other in order to promote \n     the peaceful enjoyment of parental access rights and the \n     fulfillment of any conditions to which the exercise of such \n     rights may be subject, and to remove, as far as possible, all \n     obstacles to the exercise of such rights;\n       Whereas some contracting states fail to order or enforce \n     normal visitation rights for parents of abducted or \n     wrongfully retained children who have not been returned under \n     the terms of the Hague Convention; and\n       Whereas the routine invocation of the Article 13 exception, \n     denial of parental visitation of children, and the failure by \n     several contracting parties, most notably Austria, Germany, \n     Honduras, Mexico, and Sweden, to fully implement the \n     Convention deprives the Hague Convention of the spirit of \n     mutual confidence upon which its success depends: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress urges--\n       (1) all contracting parties to the Hague Convention, \n     particularly European civil law countries that consistently \n     violate the Hague Convention such as Austria, Germany and \n     Sweden, to comply fully with both the letter and spirit of \n     their international legal obligations under the Convention;\n       (2) all contracting parties to the Hague Convention to \n     ensure their compliance with the Hague Convention by enacting \n     effective implementing legislation and educating their \n     judicial and law enforcement authorities;\n       (3) all contracting parties to the Hague Convention to \n     honor their commitments and return abducted or wrongfully \n     retained children to their place of habitual residence \n     without reaching the merits of any underlying custody dispute \n     and ensure parental access rights by removing obstacles to \n     the exercise of such rights;\n       (4) the Secretary of State to disseminate to all Federal \n     and State courts the Department of State's annual report to \n     Congress on Hague Convention compliance and related matters; \n     and\n       (5) each contracting party to the Hague Convention to \n     further educate its central authority and local law \n     enforcement authorities regarding the Hague Convention, the \n     severity of the problem of international child abduction, and \n     the need for immediate action when a parent of an abducted \n     child seeks their assistance.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution urging \ncompliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \nInternational Child Abduction. Joining me in introducing this \nresolution are Senators Helms, Warner, Thurmond, Robb, Rockefeller, \nThomas, Dodd, Landrieu, and Hatch. Congressmen Nick Lampson of Texas \nand Steve Chabot of Ohio have introduced a similar measure in the \nHouse.\n  The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child \nAbduction sets forth the legal mechanism for returning internationally \nabducted children to their countries of habitual residence, where \ncustody can then be decided. Fifty-four countries, including the United \nStates are signatories to the Convention.\n  According to the State Department, each year the United States sends \nan estimated 90% of kidnapped children back to foreign countries. But, \nthe rate at which other nations belonging to the Convention return \nAmerican children is much lower. A State Department report singles out \nseveral countries for their noncompliance with the accord, including \nAustria, Honduras, Mauritius, Mexico and Sweden. Notably absent from \nthe report, however, was Germany, which also has established a \ndisturbing pattern of noncompliance. According to ``Insight Magazine,'' \nState Department records show that of the 243 Hague cases filed in \nGermany, there were only 40 court-ordered returns.\n  Last fall, the General Accounting Office (GAO) testified before the \nHouse International Relations Committee on their preliminary review of \nthe federal government's response to international parental child \nabduction. They cited noncompliance with the Hague Convention on the \npart of other countries as one of the problems with our federal \ngovernment's response to international parental kidnappings. According \nto GAO's testimony: ``The State Department acknowledges that more \nsystematic and aggressive diplomatic efforts are needed to address \nproblems with the Hague Convention.'' The GAO also noted that while \nincreased diplomatic efforts are needed, recommendations developed by \nthe State Department and Department of Justice to rectify the \nnoncompliance problem ``seek to review, study, and explore Hague \nimplementation issues, but fail to identify how these activities will \nactually help solve Hague implementation problems.''\n  What we have to remember in any case where a parent abducts a child \nis that each of these cases involves the\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\ndestruction of a family. A good illustration of this is what happened \nto Tom Sylvester of Cincinnati, the father of a little girl named \nCarina, whom he has seldom seen since his ex-wife abducted her from \nMichigan in 1995, and took her to Austria. The day after the \nkidnapping, Mr. Sylvester filed a complaint with the State Department \nand started legal proceedings under the terms of the Hague Convention. \nAn Austrian court heard his complaint, and the court ordered the return \nof Carina to Mr. Sylvester. However, this court order was never \nenforced and Carina's mother took the child into hiding. Eventually, \nthough, when Carina's mother surfaced with the child, the Austrian \ncourts reversed their decision on returning Carina to her father, \nfinding that Carina had ``resettled into her new environment''--a \ndecision clearly contrary to the terms of the Hague Convention.\n\n  While the State Department recently has indicated some willingness to \nwork more aggressively through diplomatic channels in individual cases, \nlike that of Tom Sylvester, we must do more to improve compliance with \nthe Hague Convention overall. The resolution we are introducing today \nencourages all of the contracting parties, particularly those countries \nthat consistently violate the Convention--namely Austria, Germany and \nSweden--to comply fully with both the letter and the spirit of their \nobligations under the Convention. In order to improve compliance rates, \nthe resolution urges all Hague signatories to educate their judges and \nlaw enforcement personnel about the Convention. And, finally, this \nresolution urges countries to return children under the Convention, \nwithout reaching the underlying custody dispute, and to remove barriers \nto parental visitations.\n  Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I cannot begin to imagine \nthe nightmare that so many American parents face when their children \nare kidnapped by a current or former spouse and taken abroad. But, \ntragically, this is a very real and daily nightmare for hundreds of \nparents right here in this country. That's why the resolution I have \nintroduced is critical to encouraging the safe return of children to \nthe United States. It gives us an opportunity to help make a positive \ndifference in the lives of children and their families. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it with their cosponsorship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1685-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1685-S1686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 277--COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLICY \n                      OF INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Johnson) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 277\n\n       Whereas, the United States of America and the sovereign \n     Indian Tribes contained within its boundaries have had a long \n     and mutually beneficial relationship since the beginning of \n     the Republic;\n       Whereas the United States has recognized this special legal \n     and political relationship and its trust responsibility to \n     the Indian Tribes as reflected in the Federal Constitution, \n     treaties, numerous court decisions, federal statutes, \n     executive orders, and course of dealing;\n       Whereas Federal policy toward the Indian Tribes has \n     vacillated through history and often failed to uphold the \n     government-to-government relationship that has endured for \n     more than 200 years;\n       Whereas these Federal policies included the wholesale \n     removal of Indian tribes and their members from their \n     aboriginal homelands, attempts to assimilate Indian people \n     into the general culture, as well as the termination of the \n     legal and political relationship between the United States \n     and the Indian Tribes;\n       Whereas President Richard M. Nixon, in his ``Special \n     Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' on July 8, 1970, \n     recognized that the Indian Tribes constitute a distinct and \n     valuable segment of the American federalist system, whose \n     members have made significant contributions to the United \n     States and to American culture;\n       Whereas President Nixon determined that Indian Tribes, as \n     local governments, are best able to discern the needs of \n     their people and are best situated to determine the direction \n     of their political and economic futures;\n       Whereas in his ``Special Message'' President Nixon \n     recognized that the policies of legal and political \n     termination on the one hand, and paternalism and excessive \n     dependence on the other, devastated the political, economic, \n     and social aspects of life in Indian America, and had to be \n     radically altered;\n       Whereas in his ``Special Message'' President Nixon set \n     forth the foundation for a new, more enlightened Federal \n     Indian policy grounded in economic self reliance and \n     political self determination;\n       Whereas this Indian self determination policy has endured \n     as the most successful policy of the United States in dealing \n     with the Indian Tribes because it rejects the failed policies \n     of termination and paternalism and declared that ``the \n     integrity and right to continued existence of all Indian \n     Tribal and Alaska native governments, recognizing that \n     cultural pluralism is a source of national strength.''\n       Now Therefore be it Resolved, That the Senate of the United \n     States recognizes the unique role of the Indian Tribes and \n     their members in the United States, and commemorates the \n     vision and leadership of President Nixon, and every \n     succeeding President, in fostering the policy of Indian Self-\n     Determination.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nMcCain and Senator Tim Johnson in submitting today a resolution to \ncommemorate the anniversary of a little-noticed but critical event that \ntook place 30 years ago this summer.\n  In July 1970, President Richard M. Nixon delivered his now-famous \n``Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs'' that \nrevolutionized how our nation deals with Native governments and Native \npeople from Florida to Alaska, from Maine to Hawaii.\n  With centuries of ill-conceived and misdirected federal policies and \npractices behind us, I am happy to say that the Nixon Indian policy \ncontinues as the bedrock of America's promise to Native Americans.\n  In his Message to Congress, the President made the case for a more \nenlightened federal Indian policy. Citing historical injustices as well \nas the practical failure of all previous federal policies regarding \nIndian Nations, President Nixon called for the rejection of both the \n``termination'' policy of the 1950s and the ``excessive dependence'' on \nthe federal government by Indian tribes and people fostered by federal \npaternalism.\n  Nixon observed that ``[t]he first Americans--the Indians--are the \nmost deprived and most isolated group in our nation. On virtually every \nscale of measurement--employment, income, education, health--the \ncondition of the Indian people rank at the bottom.''\n  Thirty years later, Indians continue to suffer high rates of \nunemployment, are mired in poverty, and still rank at or near the \nbottom of nearly every social and economic indicator in the nation.\n  Nonetheless, there is cause for hope that the conditions of Native \nAmericans are improving, however slowly.\n  The twin pillars of the policy change initiated in 1970 are political \nself determination and economic self reliance. Without doubt, the most \nenduring legacy of the 1970 Message is the Indian self determination \npolicy best embodied in the Indian Self Determination and Education \nAssistance Act of 1975, amended several times since then.\n  This Act, which has consistently been supported, promoted, and \nexpanded with bipartisan support, authorizes Indian tribes to assume \nresponsibility for and administer programs and services formerly \nprovided by the federal government.\n  As of 1999, nearly 48% of all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and 50% \nof all Indian Health Service (IHS) programs and services have been \nassumed by tribes under the Indian Self Determination Act.\n  With this transfer of resources and decision making authority, tribal \ngovernments have succeeded in improving the quality of services to \ntheir citizens, have developed more sophisticated tribal governing \nstructures and practices, have improved their ability to govern, and \nhave strengthened their economies.\n  Self determination contracting and compacting have improved the \nefficiency of federal programs and services and at the same time have \ndevolved control over these resources from Washington, D.C. to the \nlocal, tribal governments which are much more in tune with the needs of \ntheir own people.\n  As steps are taken to provide tribes the tools they need to develop \nvigorous economies and generate tribal revenues, our policy in Congress \nand across the federal government should be to encourage and assist \ntribes to expand self determination and self governance into other \nagencies and programs, and in the process help Native people to achieve \nreal and measurable success in improving their standard of living.\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\n  The challenge of the Nixon Message was not only to the federal \ngovernment but to the tribes themselves: that by building strong tribal \ngovernments and more robust economies, real independence and true self \ndetermination can be achieved.\n  Our experience has shown that any cooperative efforts between the \nUnited States and the tribes must include a solemn assurance that the \nspecial relationship will endure and will not be terminated by the fits \nand starts of periodic economic success enjoyed by some Indian tribes.\n  President Nixon wisely realized that the mere threat of termination \nresults in a tendency toward an unhealthy dependence on the federal \ngovernment which has plagued Native people for decades. As President \nNixon himself knew, Native people are not hapless bystanders in this \nprocess. His Message recognized that the story of the Indian in America \nis one of ``endurance, survival, of adaptation and creativity in the \nface of overwhelming obstacles.''\n  This persistence and tenacity by Native people have been the \nfoundation in forging a more enlightened Indian policy and with the \nassistance of the United States will, I am confident, result in true \nself determination for Native people in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Nixon Message and \nthe combined efforts of Natives and non-Natives alike in making Indian \nself determination a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1686-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, on March 9, I advised the Senate of my \nintention to offer an amendment on Kosovo to the supplemental, assuming \nthat legislation comes up. If not, I will consider other avenues of \nlegislation to incorporate the basic structure of this amendment.\n  I have been joined in this effort by a thoughtful and well-respected \nnumber of my colleagues; indeed, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, \nwho just departed the floor, and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  I placed a draft copy of the amendment in the Record at that time and \ninvited comment and constructive criticism. I am so pleased to report \nthat has happened in abundance.\n  I am here today to report to the Senate there has been an increasing \ninterest in this amendment--positive, in most instances. I will refer \nto one bit of very constructive criticism momentarily.\n  We have taken into consideration the views of many. I will be putting \nin today's Record an amendment which shows certain modifications, \ntechnical modifications, which I hope will meet some of the very fine \nconstructive ideas I have received.\n  To summarize, the amendment would require our European allies to \nfulfill a certain percentage of the commitments they have made to \nprovide assistance and police personnel to Kosovo before the entire $2 \nbillion contained in the supplemental for United States military \noperations in Kosovo would be made available.\n  The amendment would allow for the provision of 50 percent of the \nmoney--over $1 billion--immediately for the use of the Department of \nDefense. But the remainder would be dependent on a certification by the \nPresident of the United States that our allies had provided a certain \npercentage of their commitments of assistance to Kosovo.\n  If the President is not able to make that certification by June 1, \nthen the remaining $1 billion could be used only to conduct the safe, \norderly, and phased withdrawal of our troops from Kosovo--not a cut and \nrun; not a fixed timetable; I repeat, a safe and orderly phased \nwithdrawal.\n  Again, I have been pleased by the response that has been generated by \nthis amendment. It is clear, we have already achieved our first goal of \nfocusing attention on this very serious problem in Kosovo.\n  Actions on the part of our allies are being taken at an accelerated \nrate, and much more detailed information on such actions, past and \npresent, are becoming available daily.\n  For example, this past week I received letters from Lord Robertson, \nthe Secretary General of NATO, and Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the head of \nthe UN Mission in Kosovo, outlining the increased efforts of \nburdensharing of certain allies.\n  According to the letter I received from Dr. Kouchner--I would like to \nquote a paragraph--I quote:\n\n       I very much appreciate the efforts that you have made so \n     far which have been instrumental in improving our budget \n     situation. Existing donor pledges have now been honored. \n     The next challenge will be to get new donor pledges and to \n     ensure that the pledges for the reconstruction budget of \n     17 November 1999 do materialize.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters from Lord \nRobertson and Dr. Kouchner be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks, with certain other documents that I will attach, and \nletters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. WARNER. In addition, I had the opportunity to meet yesterday with \nAmbassador Guenter Burghardt, the European Commission representative in \nWashington, who provided me with valuable information on the \ncontributions of the EU, particularly their efforts to streamline their \nprocess for providing assistance.\n  Several weeks ago, it was very difficult to get accurate information \non what had been pledged by our allies--not that they were withholding \nit; people just could not find it, in many instances, and put it into \nwriting--and almost impossible to get data on what had actually been \nsupplied to Kosovo.\n  Now we are clearly making progress on this front, but more remains to \nbe done.\n  I asked for constructive criticism. And within the hour, by pure \ncoincidence, because I planned to deliver these remarks, came a letter \nfrom our former distinguished majority leader, and my very close friend \nand mentor, Senator Robert Dole.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a letter from Senator Dole in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Dole wrote:\n\n       Accordingly, I would urge you to consider, at a minimum, \n     allowing a Presidential waiver authority based upon \n     compelling national security needs.\n\n  That sort of thing is often done. We carefully considered that. But \nafter consultation with my cosponsors and many others, we decided not \nbecause it would make the amendment so weakened that it loses its \npurport. Therefore, I say respectfully to my former leader that that I \ncannot do. However, he has made other suggestions. And by pure \ncoincidence and timing, they have been incorporated in the revised \namendment, which I will file as a part of these remarks.\n  For example, he said:\n\n       That said, I believe in principle that you are entirely \n     right to try to hold the Administration's feet to the fire to \n     ensure that the United States continues to lead, while at the \n     same time preventing it from shouldering an inordinate share \n     of the international burden in the Balkans. The devil is in \n     the details, however, and I am concerned that some of the \n     targets identified in your amendment simply cannot be met, \n     and that the European powers are being held to a higher \n     standard than the United States. For example, is it realistic \n     for the United States and/or Europeans to be required to \n     disburse 33 percent of the funds needed for Kosovo \n     reconstruction by June 1, 2000?\n\n  Prior to receiving this letter, we had made technical changes from \n``disbursed'' to ``obligated or contracted\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\nfor.'' This gives the flexibility that is needed to obviate the \nproblems raised by Senator Dole and others.\n  These technical changes, if I may enumerate them, give added \nflexibility to the President of the United States in making this very \nimportant certification. We have not, in my judgment, diminished in any \nway the strength of this amendment, but it has given added flexibility. \nNo. 1, it makes it clear that the performance we are seeking on the \npart of the allies is to be evaluated, as we put in our amendment, ``on \nthe aggregate.'' Performance of one nation which falls short, one \nnation which may not be able to make it, will not prevent the President \nfrom making the required certification. No. 2, we require that \nreconstruction and humanitarian assistance must be, as I said, \nobligated or contracted for. That point we covered in the recitation of \nSenator Dole. This is in recognition that even if the money has been \nset aside for Kosovo, some of these projects ``spend out'' at a slow \nrate.\n  These are the types of constructive changes that have come to my \nattention and we have incorporated them. We are still working on this. \nAs I say, I have also been engaged in discussions with a number of \nadministration officials over the past 2 weeks.\n  Last Friday, I had a productive meeting with the National Security \nAdviser, Sandy Berger, on the eve of his departure on this important \ntrip the President is now undertaking. We were joined by OMB Director \nJack Lew and Under Secretary of Defense, Walter Slocombe. As a result, \nof some of the technical information relayed to me at that meeting--it \nwas a very good meeting--I have redrafted my amendment to take into \naccount some of the concerns that were raised. While I think it is fair \nto say the redraft which I and my cosponsors have agreed to will not \nsatisfy all the concerns of the administration, I believe our \nconsultations are making progress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the latest version of my amendment \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the bottom line for the United States and \nfor the other nations involved in KFOR--that is the entire military \noperation in Kosovo--is the current safety and well-being of our troops \nbeing deployed there--U.S. troops and those of some 35 other nations \nare involved and the formulation of a timetable, safety first, but the \nformulation of a timetable. We can't do it right now, but if the \npurport of this amendment is met, we will be able in the reasonable \nfuture to formulate a timetable for the establishment of the \ninfrastructure, both economic and security, which will allow for the \nsafe return of our troops and those of other nations to their \nrespective homes.\n  Today, I had the opportunity to meet in my office with the Italian \nMinister of Defense, for example. He shares the common goal of this \namendment.\n  We are now one day away from the 1-year anniversary of the start of \nthe NATO war on behalf of Kosovo, on behalf of human rights. The world \ncould not have stood by idly and watched the killing and the rape and \nthe pillaging of that nation and done nothing. It was a challenge to \nfigure out what to do. On a number of occasions, I consulted with \nGeneral Clark. Indeed, I was with him in part of that campaign, \nwatching the operations he directed, and directed very skillfully. We \ncould not have done nothing.\n\n  This is an appropriate time for reflection and assessment. What have \nwe accomplished and what remains to be done? Clearly, the large-scale \nethnic cleansing has stopped and hundreds of thousands of Kosovar \nAlbanian refugees have returned to their homes. For this, NATO should \nbe proud of their military action.\n  But what better way to express our pride in their successful \naccomplishment of that military mission than for the United States, in \nconcert and partnership with its allies, to come forward in a timely \nmanner and meet the commitments to solidify the military gains? None of \nus are totally satisfied. A regrettable chapter relates to the Serbian \npeople who lived in those areas, many of whom have left after the \ncessation of the 78-day campaign. But I think the KFOR troops are doing \ntheir best to provide equal protection and that we are continuing to \naddress that situation because we have to have an evenhanded policy. \nHuman rights, to be successful, has to be implemented evenhandedly.\n  Yes, the fighting has stopped. Unfortunately, the violence continues. \nRecent events in Mitrovica and in the vicinity of the Presevo Valley \nare cause for great concern. Bottom line, until there is an economic \nstructure in place, together with a security structure, we will not see \nsubstantial progress in creating peaceful, civil society in Kosovo. \nUntil that happens, under the administration's current plan, U.S. \ntroops could remain indefinitely in Kosovo.\n  Earlier this week, General Reinhardt, the commander of KFOR, said--\nand I believe I am quoting him accurately--that he believed KFOR troops \nwould be in Kosovo for up to a decade. To make such a declaration at \nthis time, I say, with respect to this fine professional military \nofficer whom I have met--I met him in Pristina about a month ago, right \nin his office--I repeat, to make such a declaration at this time I find \nunacceptable. This is one of the motivating factors behind the \namendment I have proposed. We cannot let General Reinhardt or anyone \nelse set a timetable of a decade. We need to see more progress on the \ncivil implementation side.\n  The U.N., the E.U., and the OSCE must move more swiftly to fulfill \ntheir responsibilities for rebuilding Kosovo, and our European allies \nmust provide the assistance and personnel they have promised to provide \nif these goals are to be achieved. Time is of the essence.\n  The amendment I and others have placed before the Senate is but one \napproach to deal with the situation in Kosovo. I know other colleagues \nhave their own approaches on this issue, not necessarily dissimilar. We \nshare common goals. In particular, I commend Senator Robert Byrd, who \nhas proposed a concept for rapid turnover of the KFOR mission to the \nEuropean allies.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the editorial by Senator Byrd be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 5.)\n  Mr. WARNER. It outlines in full his concepts, which are very \ninteresting. I have been on the Senate floor with Senator Byrd so many \ntimes. He is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. No one \ntakes to heart more dearly the welfare of the men and women of the \nArmed Forces and their families than Senator Byrd. He is concerned \nabout their welfare as am I. We have joined together at a meeting in \nthe White House, I think some 3 weeks ago, to discuss this very \nsubject.\n  He spoke up with great courage and determination to the President and \nthe Secretaries of State and Defense. It was quite an interesting \nmeeting. What we cannot allow to happen is for the current situation in \nKosovo to drift on for a decade. I say no. There are problems. Those \nproblems are surmountable if we work together. They must be addressed. \nThey must be addressed in a timely manner.\n  I hope the amendment in its present form, revised, will contribute to \nthis goal. I, once again, encourage my colleagues and others to come \nforward with any constructive suggestions they may have. I continue to \nsay that this Senator--I think I can speak for my cosponsors--is going \nto stand firm, firm in furtherance of the goals of human rights in \nKosovo, in furtherance of remaining as a vital partner of NATO, in \nfurtherance of creating a record to show that NATO can handle \npeacekeeping missions. To do that, we need more timely assistance from \nthose who have committed to provide the infrastructure of economics and \nsecurity.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                      Secretary General, NATO,\n\n                                        Bruxelles, March 15, 2000.\n     Senator John Warner,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       My Dear John: I am glad we had the chance to talk by phone \n     yesterday. As I noted, I share your concern that the Allied \n     nations need to react more swiftly and forcefully to the \n     current challenges in Kosovo. I have been pressing hard to \n     ensure that nations provide additional forces for KFOR.\n       Dire press reports notwithstanding, progress has in fact \n     been made. Let me give you an update on what steps are being \n     taken.\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\n       On force levels for Kosovo, the European Allies are now \n     stepping up their contributions.\n       Italy has agreed to provide a manoeuvre battalion of two \n     companies for a limited time period.\n       France is putting under NATO command two companies that had \n     already been dispatched to Kosovo on short notice under \n     national authority, and is adding one further company. \n     Together, these three companies will form a new French \n     manoeuvre battalion.\n       This still leaves a shortfall of three companies relative \n     to the needs in theatre as identified by the Supreme Allied \n     Commander, General Clark, and the KFOR Commander General \n     Reinhardt. I have been in direct contact with several Allied \n     governments, and General Clark and the Military Committee \n     Chairman Admiral Venturoni have been in touch with Chiefs of \n     Defense. As a result of these contacts, a further five \n     countries have indicated that they are seriously considering \n     sending additional forces to Kosovo.\n       Even before the addition of these forces, European nations \n     are contributing a majority of the forces on the ground in \n     Kosovo. The following figures relate to forces to theatre on \n     13 March. While these figures fluctuate by small amounts on a \n     daily basis, the overall ratio of forces has been fairly \n     constant for some time.\n       EU nations makes up 60.3 percent of all the forces in \n     Kosovo.\n       European nations--leaving aside Russia and the CIS states--\n     make up 69.2 percent of the forces in Kosovo.\n       Adding in Russia and the other CIS states, European nations \n     account for 80 percent of all the forces in theatre.\n       The remainder is made up by Argentina, Jordan, the United \n     Arab Emirates, Morocco, Canada and, of course, the United \n     States, for a total of 38 nations contributing to KFOR.\n       On the civil implementation side, there has also been some \n     notable progress:\n       The European Union has started to disburse 45 million Euro \n     ($43.6 million) of the 360 million Euro ($349 million) \n     pledged to UNMIK for the year 2000. Several NATO members \n     states have also increased their financial contributions to \n     both UNMIK and the KPC.\n       Germany, Italy and Turkey have strengthened their civil \n     police contingents to Kosovo, and the United Kingdom has \n     agreed to provide additional judiciary officials.\n       Let me emphasize in providing you this data that I am only \n     reporting to you what I have been told as Secretary General. \n     Implementation is key, and I will continue to press hard to \n     make sure that nations follow through both on their KFOR \n     contributions and on civil implementation.\n       With these points in mind, I have to convey to you my firm \n     belief that it would be wrong for NATO right now to have a \n     reduction or limitation on the U.S. commitment, just as the \n     situation in Kosovo is becoming more challenging and the \n     European Allies, who are already carrying a large load, are \n     beginning to do even more.\n       This is particularly true when looking at the situation in \n     the Presevo Valley, which is adjacent to the U.S. sector in \n     Kosovo. I hope the U.S. will play a strong role in heading \n     off a potential crisis there. The U.S. forces did a superb \n     job today in raiding a number of support bases in Kosovo for \n     extremists operating in southern Serbia. We need that kind of \n     effective military presence to continue.\n       On a related point, I understand your concerns for not \n     deploying American forces away from these Southeastern \n     trouble spots to help reinforce other Allies in Mitrovica. \n     But I would not want to see the U.S. position cast in stone \n     as a means of justifying lack of routine responsiveness to \n     the operational commander. Such a position would be at odds \n     with the principle of unity of command, which is essential to \n     the effective of NATO forces in multinational operations over \n     the long term.\n       I appreciate your ongoing concern for the success of the \n     KFOR operation. I am working very hard to ensure that the \n     European Allies hold up their end of the bargain--in both the \n     military and the civil implementation areas--and am counting \n     on you and your colleagues to help maintain the valuable U.S. \n     contribution.\n       All the very best.\n                                                           George.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 2\n\n                                      U.N. Interim Administration,\n\n\n                                            Mission in Kosovo,\n\n                                         Pristina, March 18, 2000.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Let me first of all thank you whole heartedly \n     for your unfettered support and assistance as Chairman of the \n     Armed Services Committee: the kind of tough questioning that \n     took place as a result of your interventions have been \n     instrumental in helping UNMIK achieve some of its objectives.\n       I want to give you an update on the situation regarding the \n     Kosovo Consolidated Budget, which is now in considerably \n     better shape than it was earlier in the year. Donor pledges \n     made at the end of last year have now crystallized into cash \n     in the bank. Recently the Kosovo Budget has received \n     contributions from the United States, the UK, France, Japan, \n     and the European Union. As you will see from the attached \n     tables, it is now estimated that the budget has sufficient \n     cash to carry us through the summer. Furthermore our revenue \n     collection is now improving. In particular, the European \n     Union has already paid in some of its contributions, and \n     clear and rapid procedures are in place for the remaining of \n     the Union's contributions to be paid in (another more than \n     Euro 55 Millions will be transferred to the Kosovo Budget in \n     the next three months). Further, and as planned, the Union \n     will contribute over Euro 240 Millions for reconstruction in \n     2000.\n       I would however also stress that there were never \n     sufficient pledges to cover the whole of the needs for the \n     year 2000. there is still an uncovered gap of about 35 \n     million DEM, as per attached table, and any assistance you \n     can extend to us to cover that gap will be deeply appreciated \n     by this mission.\n       I very much appreciate the efforts that you have made so \n     far which have been instrumental in improving our budget \n     situation. Existing donor pledges have now been honored. The \n     next challenge will be to get new donor pledges and to ensure \n     that the pledges for the reconstruction budget of 17 November \n     1999 do materialize.\n       I look forward to a continued dialogue with you, and I hope \n     to see you soon.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Bernard Kouchner,\n\n                                         Special Representative of\n     the Secretary General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Kosovo Consolidated Budget 2000 Budget Update\n\n\n                    background on this week's update\n\n       Attached are documents that detail donor pledges and \n     domestic revenue. Tables 1, 2, and 3 review donor pledges to \n     date. Table 4 projects cash flow through mid-June 2000. \n     Tables 5 through 9 review revenue estimates and actual \n     collections. Table 10 reviews budget 2000 revenue estimates \n     and summarizes donor support.\n       Noteworthy items are:\n       Donor pledges have started to arrive.--Since the last \n     report we confirm that roughly DM 76.9 million of donor \n     pledges for budgetary support are either in our account or \n     en-route, including (see Table 2): \\1\\ United States--DM 24.2 \n     million; Great Britain--DM 15.9 million; France--DM 3.5 \n     million; Japan--initiated transfer of DM 13.7 million; \n     European Union--initiated transfer of DM 19.6 million. A \n     further K35 million is expected shortly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Total pledges received to date are DM 79.6 million, which \n     includes the previously reported amount of DM 2.7 from \n     Canada.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Cash Needs.--The recent influx of cash will allow the \n     Kosovo Consolidated Budget to continue functioning until mid-\n     June (see Table 4). Kosovo's cash requirements will be met \n     through September 2000 upon receipt of the European Union's \n     pledge of K35 million.\n       Revenue collections improve.--The last two weeks witnessed \n     a 55 percent increase in collections (from DM 5.8 year-to-\n     date to DM 9.8 million). Two factors appear to drive this \n     increase. First, sales and excise tax collection at the \n     Montenegro Administrative Boundary Line (ABL) has become \n     operational, collection over DM 756,684 in the last two \n     weeks. Collections at the ABL has the direct effect of \n     capturing lost revenue through that crossing, and an indirect \n     effect of re-diverting trucks back to previously established \n     border points for collection. Second, customs collections are \n     slightly higher because vehicle registration requires proof \n     of customs payment on imported cars. The former is expected \n     to continue, while the latter is a short-run effect that will \n     dissipate.

John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: To follow up on our recent conversation, I would \n     like to share a few further thoughts regarding the \n     Administration's proposed supplemental spending bill for the \n     Balkans.\n       You and I have worked together on Balkan issues for many \n     years and have more often than not agreed on the policy \n     direction that should be taken. We have frequently shared a \n     critical view of the Clinton Administration's policies and \n     their implementation. In addition, we have always agreed that \n     the President of the United States has the ultimate \n     responsibility to carry out U.S. foreign policy according to \n     our national security objectives, which include a strong and \n     effective NATO.\n       As you know, my support for U.S. military and other \n     operations in the Balkans is based on the firm belief that \n     democratization and stability in the region must be achieved, \n     and that the U.S. troop deployments in Bosnia and Kosovo are \n     vital to these goals. To this end, I am concerned that, as \n     drafted, the amendment that you are introducing to the \n     Administration's supplemental bill would, based solely upon \n     the action or inaction of a third party (our European \n     allies), prohibit the President from maintaining a U.S. troop \n     presence--even though he may have determined this presence to \n     be in our country's national interest. In my view, this \n     legislative restriction would tie the hands of the President \n     in a sphere of power that clearly lies within the prerogative \n     of the executive branch of the U.S. government. Accordingly, \n     I would urge you to consider, at a minimum, allowing a \n     Presidential waiver authority based upon compelling national \n     security needs.\n       Second, I am concerned that your amendment could, albeit \n     unintentionally, adversely affect our role in NATO and our \n     relations with our Alliance allies. Our credibility within \n     NATO and our strong bilateral relations with each of our \n     allies in the Alliance could be damaged by policies that link \n     our presence in the Balkans to extraneous factors, as opposed \n     to our national and collective European security objectives.\n       That said, I believe in principle that you are entirely \n     right to try to hold the Administration's feet to the fire to \n     ensure that the United States continues to lead, while at the \n     same time preventing it from shouldering an inordinate share \n     of the international burden in the Balkans. The devil is in \n     the details, however, and I am concerned that some of the \n     targets identified in your amendment simply cannot be met, \n     and that the European powers are being held to a higher \n     standard that the United States. For example, it is realistic \n     for the United States and/or the Europeans to be required to \n     disburse 33 percent of the funds needed for Kosova \n     reconstruction by June 1, 2000?\n       In my view, the Congress and those of us who support \n     stronger U.S. leadership in the international arena should \n     focus more on exerting direct pressure on the Administration \n     to implement policies that promote democratization, political \n     stability, and security in the Balkans. The issue, it seems \n     to me, is not so much whether our troops are deployed in the \n     region, but what they are actually doing on the ground. While \n     the United States and its allies can point to a number of \n     successes in Bosnia and Kosova, severe problems remain. At \n     times, it even seems as though we are taking steps backwards. \n     For example, I wholly disagree with the Administration's \n     failure to support General Clark's recent effort to deploy \n     U.S. troops in Mitrovica. The troops putatively in charge of \n     that sector of Kosova have clearly failed to perform their \n     mission to create a stable security environment. While their \n     actions have not put them in the league of their predecessors \n     in Bosnia's now infamous UNPROFOR, continuation on their \n     current course will almost certainly lead to a de facto \n     partition of Kosova--a highly destabilizing situation that \n     would put our troops at even greater risk. A resumption of \n     large-scale conflict may then follow. I would therefore urge \n     you and others in the Congress to do your utmost to ensure \n     that the Pentagon takes stronger action to get this situation \n     in hand as quickly as possible.\n       A second example can be found in Bosnia, where the U.S.-led \n     equip-and-train program for the Federation forces has \n     floundered. As you know, in 1996, the Administration secured \n     Senate majority support for the U.S. troop deployment in \n     Bosnia based on President Clinton's written commitment to \n     equip and train the Federation forces. In the past four \n     years, the United States has done far too little to honor \n     this commitment. When the war in Bosnia ended, an \n     Administration-commissioned assessment determined that, to \n     maintain adequate defenses, the Federation needed equipment \n     that would cost an estimated $800 million to $1 billion. To \n     date, only $250 million in equipment and training has been \n     provided to the Federation. Of this, the U.S. contribution \n     was only $100 million in Congressionally mandated drawdown \n     authority. Beyond these initial sums, the Administration has \n     neither proposed nor sought significant funding for the \n     program. In my view, the Congress should provide additional \n     drawdown authority for the purchase of the major equipment \n     and provision of the training that remain necessary for \n     Bosnia to be able to defend itself. It should also \n     immediately increase FMF funding so that the equipment we \n     have provided thus far can be adequately maintained.\n       Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my views. \n     I wish you every success as you continue your leadership in \n     the Senate.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\n                             Exhibit No. 4\n\n       On page ____, between lines ____ and ____, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ____.

In that case, the \n     President shall submit to Congress, not later than June 30, \n     2000, a report on the plan for the withdrawal.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 5\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 20, 2000]\n\n                    Europe's Turn To Keep the Peace\n\n                          (By Robert C.

Mr. Milosevic remains \n     firmly in control in Serbia and, by most reckoning, is \n     stepping up his effort to foment trouble along the border \n     between Serbia and Kosovo. In the latest eruption of \n     violence, ethnic Albanian insurgents have begun attacking \n     Serbs across the border in Serbia.\n       The administration's response to this deepening crisis? \n     Stern words to the Albanians, urgent pleas to our allies for \n     more troops and money, and a request to Congress for a \n     supplemental $2 billion to continue American peacekeeping \n     business as usual in Kosovo.\n       Is that really the best we can do?\n       I see three options we can practically consider at this \n     juncture.\n       We can stay the course, reacting to events as they occur \n     and hoping for the best as we settle into a semi-permanent \n     role of soldiers on patrol and cops on the beat. We can pick \n     a date and simply pull American troops out of Kosovo. Or \n     Congress can give the administration unequivocal direction \n     and a reasonable period of time--say three months--to craft a \n     framework for turning the Kosovo peacekeeping operation over \n     to our European allies. Congress can then examine the plan, \n     gauge the progress being made, and vote either to stay or to \n     go.\n       It is my firm belief that the United States should take \n     steps to turn the Kosovo peacekeeping operation over to our \n     European allies. NATO undertook the Kosovo mission with an \n     understanding that Europe, not America, would shoulder the \n     peacekeeping and reconstruction duties. The United States, \n     with its outstanding military forces and weaponry, \n     effectively won the war; the European allies were to keep the \n     peace.\n       But now, as the United Nations interim administration in \n     Kosovo teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, NATO allies are \n     squabbling over the need for military reinforcements, and the \n     international police that were supposed to help bring law and \n     order remain undermanned, underfinanced, and unable to cope.\n       If Congress agrees to the administration's request for \n     additional financing for Kosovo, it should be with the clear \n     understanding that the money is tied to a plan for \n     establishing an all-European peacekeeping force. The plan \n     should have benchmarks, like numbers of European troops to be \n     added to the forces by particular dates, and Congress should \n     have an opportunity to vote on whether to keep troops in \n     Kosovo if those benchmarks are not being met.\n       Removal of American troops from Kosovo need not be abrupt \n     and need not mean that the United States is turning its back \n     on the victims of Slobodan Milosevic. We can continue to \n     support humanitarian relief and can provide support in \n     military logistics, communications, intelligence and \n     effective command.\n       It is just possible that the Europeans will excel at \n     peacekeeping duties in Kosovo if ever they are allowed to \n     emerge from the overwhelming shadow cast by the United \n     States. Unfortunately, we will never know if we do not tie \n     further American investment in Kosovo to a rock-solid plan to \n     turn the peacekeeping operation over to them--sooner rather \n     than later.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Wednesday of this week, a team of \nState Department officials departed for Libya as part of a review of \nthe travel ban that has been in effect since 1981.\n  State Department officials will be in Libya for 26 hours in the next \nfew days, visiting hotels and other sites. They will then prepare a \nrecommendation for the Secretary to help her determine if there is \nstill ``Imminent danger to . . . the physical safety of United States \ntravellers,'' as the law requires in order to maintain the ban.\n  Because of the travel ban, American citizens can only travel to Libya \nif they obtain a license from the Department of the Treasury. In \naddition, the State Department must first validate a passport for \ntravel to Libya.\n  The travel ban was imposed originally for safety reasons and predates \nthe terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But lifting the ban now, \njust as the two Libyan suspects are about to go on trial in the \nNetherlands for their role in that atrocity, will undoubtedly be viewed \nas a gesture of good will to Colonel Qadhafi.\n  Indeed, just after the State Department announced that it would send \nthis consular team, a Saudi-owned daily paper quoted a senior Libyan \nofficial as saying the one-day visit by the U.S. Team was a ``step in \nthe right direction.''\n  The official said the visit was a sign that ``the international \ncommunity was convinced that Libya's foreign policy position was not \nwrong and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's relations with \nthe world.''\n  I have been in contact with many of the families of the victims of \nPan Am Flight 103, and they are extremely upset by the timing of this \ndecision. The families want to know why the Secretary of State is \nmaking this friendly overture to Qadhafi now--just six weeks before the \ntrial in the Netherlands begins. They question how much information the \nState Department will be able to obtain by spending only 26 hours in \nLibya. They wonder why the Department cannot continue to use the same \nsources of information it has been using for many years to make a \ndetermination about the travel ban.\n  These courageous Americans have waited for justice for eleven long \nyears. They feel betrayed by this decision. They have watched with \ndismay as our close ally, Great Britain, has rushed to reestablish \ndiplomatic relations with Libya, before justice is served for the \nBritish citizens killed in the terrorist bombing. The State Department \ndenies it, but the families are concerned that the visit signals a \nchange in U.S. policy, undermines U.S. sanctions, and calls into \nquestion the Administration's commitment to vigorously enforce the Iran \nLibya Sanctions Act. That Act requires the U.S. to impose sanctions on \nforeign companies which\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\ninvest more than $40 million in the Libyan petroleum industry, until \nLibya complies with the four conditions specified by the UN Security \nCouncil.\n  The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 188 Americans were killed, \nwas one of the worst terrorist atrocities in American history. The \nState Department should not have sent a delegation to Libya now and it \nshould not lift the travel ban on Libya at this time. The State \nDepartment's long-standing case-by-case consideration of passport \nrequests for visits to Libya by U.S. citizens has worked well. It can \ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1692-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge my \ngood friend Senator Ted Stevens' special honor as Alaska's Man of the \nCentury, which I understand will be awarded to him this Saturday in \nAnchorage.\n  Speaking as a Senator from the State of West Virginia, it is a \nfitting tribute, I believe, for a man whose life has been devoted to \nAlaska since long before Alaska became a State.\n  Calvin Coolidge once said:\n\n       No person was ever honored for what he received. Honor has \n     been the reward for what he gave.\n\n  Calvin Coolidge was a man of few words.\n  The Bible says:\n\n       A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of \n     silver.\n\n  Calvin Coolidge spoke words that were fitly stated. Senator Ted \nStevens has given much to Alaska, and he has given much to the Nation. \nHe has given much to the Senate. He served his nation in war as a pilot \nin the 14th Air Force in World War II. As chairman of the Defense \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, which he also leads \nwith great distinction, and as a cofounder of the Senate Arms Control \nObserver Group, Senator Stevens has continued to look after U.S. \nnational security interests and the men and women who serve, as he did, \nin the uniform of her armed forces.\n  Senator Ted Stevens has served his nation well in war, and he has \nserved his nation well in peace, upholding the laws of the land as an \nattorney, as a U.S. attorney, and as a solicitor for the Department of \nthe Interior. He has served in the executive branch of Government \nworking as an assistant to the then Secretary of the Department of the \nInterior, Mr. Seaton, to create and pass legislation making Alaska the \nNation's 49th State.\n  I am proud to have voted to support the entry of both Alaska and \nHawaii into the National Union. I am the only person on Capitol Hill \nwho voted for statehood for both Alaska and Hawaii. I believe that is \nright. I was in the House when I voted for statehood for Alaska.\n  Senator Stevens has been a leader in the legislative branch as a \nSenator from Alaska, looking out first, last, and always for the unique \ninterests of his unique State, as well as for the interests of the \nNation while serving as the assistant Senate Republican leader, serving \nas the Republican whip, and serving as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. His legislative accomplishments in behalf of Alaska are \nmany--many--and they reflect the challenges of living, working, and \ntraveling in a State that possesses half of the coastline of the United \nStates, some of the most varied and spectacular terrain in the Nation, \nranging from giant glaciers to volcanoes, and some of the most \npunishing weather, as well as some of the most delightful weather, on \nthe planet.\n  The old adage says that cream rises to the top, and it is safe to say \nthen that Senator Stevens is the cream of the cream, the very best, for \nhe has risen to the top of every profession, every endeavor, every \nchallenge that he has ever tackled. His fellow Alaskans will add the \ncherry on top of the cream of the cream by recognizing his \nmultitudinous accomplishments, his supreme dedication, and his deep \npassion for service when they bestow upon Senator Stevens the very \ndistinct honor of naming a very special man, Senator Stevens, Alaska's \nMan of the Century.\n  Now the century is not over yet. I hope the people of Alaska \nunderstand that. Our own people need to understand that as well. The \ncentury is not over yet, nor is the second millennium. It is still \ngoing on. The new millennium will begin next year, not this year, and \nthe new century will begin next year, not this year. But this is the \nman, the Man of the Century for Alaska.\n  Although he was not born in the earliest years of this century, his \nlegacy for Alaska is more than enough to span the century and to reach \ninto the next century as well.\n  Senator Stevens is a worthy representative of his great State. He is \nthe kind of Senator whom the framers of the Constitution had in mind \nwhen, on July 16, 1787, they reached the Great Compromise out of which \ncame this, the greatest Senate of the world in all of the history of \nman.\n  His sometimes fiery temper matches the fiery volcanoes that rim the \nAleutians, while his dogged persistence mirrors the inexorable push of \nthe icy glaciers of the frozen North. His understanding of the \nappropriations process is as thorough as an Alaskan snowfall, \nblanketing every nook, every cranny, every corner of the budget. But \nhis warm and courteous consideration of his colleagues and his staff \nreflects the loyalty and the teamwork necessary to survive in the cold \nwastes of faraway Alaska.\n  I know him to be a worthy competitor. I know him to be a loyal \nfriend, a man of his word. What more can a man say? And only the Man of \nthe Century could be like this man. He is an honest speaker of even the \nhardest and difficult truths, a man of surprising compassion and \nunexpected mirth. I am proud to see him honored. I wish I could be in \nAlaska when he is honored. I would like to just have a few minutes in \nAlaska to speak about this man to his own people. They know him best. \nThe Bible says:\n\n       A prophet is not without honour save in his own country, \n     and house.\n\n  But you see how this man's own house, how his own country, how his \nown State, how his own constituents, how his own people who know him \nbest, how they honor him. I am proud to see him honored. I hope he \nenjoys the good wishes and the attention that will be his on Saturday.\n  Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said this:\n\n       Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts \n     were touched with fire. It was given us to learn at the \n     outset that life is a profound and passionate thing. While we \n     were permitted to scorn nothing but indifference, and do not \n     pretend to undervalue the worldly rewards of ambition, we \n     have seen with our own eyes, beyond and above the gold \n     fields, the snowy heights of honor, and it is for us to bear \n     the report to those who come after us.\n  Ted Stevens of Alaska surely has a heart touched early by the fire of \npublic service. That flame has fueled his passion through a long and \ndistinguished career which continues to burn brightly. But the report \non Senator Stevens is already in. From his fellow Alaskans. And they \nview him admiringly. And in their eyes he has crowned the snowy heights \nof honor. And in my eyes he has also.\n\n     ``How far away is the temple of fame?''\n     Said a youth at the dawn of the day.\n     He toiled and strove for a deathless name;\n     The hours went by and the evening came,\n     Leaving him old and feeble and lame,\n     To plod on his cheerless way.\n\n     ``How far away is the temple of good?''\n     Said another youth at the dawn of the day,\n     He toiled in the spirit of brotherhood,\n     To help and succor as best he could.\n     The poor and unfortunate multitude,\n     In its hard and cheerless way.\n\n     He was careless alike of praise or blame,\n     But after his work was done,\n     An angel of glory from heaven came\n     To write on high his immortal name,\n     And to proclaim the truth that the temple of fame\n     And the temple of good are one.\n\n     For this is the lesson that history\n     Has taught since the world began;\n     That those whose memories never die,\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\n     But shine like stars in the human sky,\n     And brighter glow as the years go by,\n     Are the men who live for man.\n\n  I did not write the poem, but I dedicate it to my good and dear \nfriend, Alaska's Man of the Century, Ted Stevens.\n  May God continue to bless him and his family always.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am once again humbled by the words of my good friend \nfrom West Virginia. There is no man, I think, in history who knows more \nabout the Senate, and loves and serves it better, than the Senator from \nWest Virginia. The honor to be here and serve with him is honor enough \nfor this Senator.\n  I am still humbled by the award I will receive on Saturday night. But \nI am warmed by the Senator's comments, and thank him for his comments \nabout this honor I will receive.\n  Believe me, I think if there is a Man of Two Centuries, it is the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with complete humility, may I ask to be \nassociated with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia on behalf of our colleague.\n  I have had the privilege of serving both with the Senator from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Alaska. This is my 22nd or 23rd year, I \nthink. I have lost count. But in those years, I have come to so respect \nboth Senators. As we look at life in the Senate, there are no moments \nthat are more cherished, no more well deserved than when a colleague \nrises at his or her own initiative to speak from the heart, as our \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has done. He evoked the great \nquote from the Bible about the prophet without honor. But I would say \nto my friend from West Virginia, I have never thought of Senator \nStevens--until this moment--as being a prophet, but I have always \nthought of him with honor.\n  Although we are from the same side of the aisle, we have had very \nstrong and vigorous debate in dissent, but I have never left the \nChamber with less than the feeling that it has been a fair fight, and \nan honest fight, having even greater respect for our distinguished \ncolleague.\n  How richly he deserves this honor. Like you, I say to the Senator, I \nonly wish I could be there. But we will be there in spirit.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. BYRD. We will.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/23/senate-section/article/S1693-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 27, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
