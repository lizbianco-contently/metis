Mr. President, I have some comments I will make today \nfollowing what has happened in Colorado, the Columbine tragedy that \noccurred this last week which has caused all of us really to reflect on \nthe causes and the cures. As we mourn the loss of so many precious \nyoung lives, we really have to ask ourselves, how did we get to this \nplace? Why do so many young people with so much going for them in their \nlives have such despair and so much hate?\n  Obviously, there are no easy answers and certainly no silver bullets. \nThere are many factors which led those two young men to don trench \ncoats and kill, just as there were many factors that resulted in the \nshootings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, and Springfield, communities \nthe names of which have become all too familiar to us via school \ntragedies where a child has killed other children.\n  But there are enough common factors that I believe we can start to \npull together some ideas as to what is causing this and some solutions. \nOne of the most obvious conclusions is this: The immersion of troubled \nkids in a violence-glorifying culture is a recipe for disaster.\n  Monday, I addressed this body on the need for a commission on \ncultural renewal. Today, I would like to address the importance of one \nof the most important elements that makes up our culture, and that is \nour music. In many ways the music industry is more influential than \nanything that happens here in Washington. Most people spend far more \ntime listening to music than watching C-SPAN or reading the newspaper. \nThey are more likely to recognize musicians than Senators--I guess \nmaybe unless the Senators sing. And they spend more time thinking about \nmusic than about government.\n\n  All of those can seem to be some fairly trite statements, but when \nyou look at what we are putting out in the music and then ask that \nquestion, it takes on a different color.\n  Of course, no one spends more time listening to music than the young \npeople. In fact, one recent study conducted by the Carnegie Foundation \nconcluded that the average teenager listens to music around 4 hours a \nday--about 4 hours a day. In contrast, they spend less than an hour a \nday on homework or reading, less than 20 minutes a day talking with \nmom, and less than 5 minutes a day talking with dad.\n  If this study is true, there are thousands, perhaps even tens or \nhundreds of thousands, of teens who spend more time listening to the \nmusic of such artists as Marilyn Manson or Master P than mom or dad.\n  In fact, Marilyn Manson himself said this:\n\n       Music is such a powerful medium now. The kids don't even \n     know who the President is,\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\n     but they know what's on TV. I think if anyone like Hitler or \n     Mussolini were alive now, they'd have to be rock stars.\n\n  Over the past few years, I have grown increasingly concerned with the \npopularity of some lyrics, lyrics which glorify violence and devalue \nlife. Some recent best selling albums have included graphic \ndescriptions of murder, torture, and rape. Women are objectified, often \nin the most degrading ways. Songs such as Prodigy's ``Smack My B. . . \nUp'' or ``Don't Trust a B. . .'' by the group Mo' Thugs actively \nencourage animosity or even violence towards women. A few years ago, \nthe alternative group ``Nine Inch Nails'' enjoyed critical and \ncommercial success with their song ``Big Man With a Gun,'' which \ndescribed forcing a woman into oral sex and shooting her in the head at \npoint-blank range.\n  I brought along a few examples of the kind of music I am talking \nabout. Each of the Marilyn Manson songs shown here are from his 1996 \nalbum ``Anti-Christ Superstar,'' an album which debuted at No. 3 on the \nBillboard charts. These are some of the song lyrics that you can look \nat. I want to point it out because it is about the culture of violence \nand the culture of death, and they may be unpleasant words for us to \nlook at, but when these debut at No. 3 on the Billboard charts, when \nthat song wraps itself around one's inside, when it wraps around a \nperson's soul, it has an impact just as significant as when we might \nlisten to John Philip Sousa's music and it makes us feel patriotic and \nuplifted or a love song makes us loving. Violent, hateful, misogynistic \nmusic encourages that in us as will violence come from hate music.\n  Look at this:\n\n Marilyn Manson, ``Irresponsible Hate Anthem'' (Anti-Christ Superstar) \n                     on Nothing/Interscope Records\n\n     I'm so all-American, I'd sell you suicide\n     I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes\n     I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper\n     I am the animal who will not be himself\n     F*** it\n\n     Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?\n     Hey victim, you were the one who put the stick in my hand\n     I am the ism, my hate's a prism\n     Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out\n     F*** it\n\n     Everybody's someone else's n**ger/I know you are so am I\n     I wasn't born with enough middle fingers/I don't need to \n           choose a side.\n                                  ____\n\n\n DMX, ``Get At Me Dog'' (It's Dark and Hell is Hot) on Def Jam Records/\n                                Polygram\n\n     Well in the back with ya fag*** a** face down\n     Lucky that you breathin but you dead from the waist down\n     The f*** is on your mind?

But these are not. These are top-\nof-the-chart hits that are out there playing endlessly in too many \ncases and even being marketed to a very troubled youth's mind.\n  Are we really surprised, then, when some things happen that are \npretty strange? That there seems to be so much violence and so much \nhatred out in this culture? Are we really that surprised? Should we be \nreally that surprised?\n  I hope people are listening and I hope they are looking.\n  These are not obscure songs. They are immensely popular, and hugely \nprofitable. They are backed by some of the largest, most prestigious \ncorporations in our country and the world--Time-Warner, Seagrams/\nUniversal, Sony, Polygram, Viacom, BMG, and Thorne-EMI.\n  I ask if any of the executives of these companies would allow their \nchildren to listen to this music? Would they? I hope not. Yet they are \nselling it and making millions.\n  Many of my colleagues may not be familiar with these lyrics. Until \nthe past couple of years, I wasn't, either. But most kids are very \nfamiliar with them. They make up a vital part of the cultural ocean in \nwhich they swim. The messages of these songs are heard over and over, \nuntil they are, at the least, familiar, and at worst, internalized.\n  A little over a year ago, I chaired a hearing on the impact of \nviolent music on young people. During this hearing, we heard a variety \nof witnesses testify on the effects of music lyrics that glorified \nviolence, sexual torture, and suicide. We heard from the nation's \nexperts on the subject. Their conclusion was unanimous: music helps \nshape our attitudes.\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\n  This is important. Studies indicate that the average teenager listens \nto music around four hours a day. It simply stands to reason that what \nwe hear, and see, and experience cannot help but affect our attitudes \nand assumptions, and thus, our decisions and behavior. If it didn't, \ncommercials wouldn't exist, and anyone who spent a dollar on \nadvertising would be a fool. But advertising is a multi-billion dollar \nbusiness. Why? Because it works. It creates an appetite for things we \ndon't need, it affects the way we think, the things we want, and the \nthings we buy. What we see and what we hear changes how we act.\n  Thousands of years ago, the philosopher Plato noted ``Musical \ntraining is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and \nharmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which \nthey mightily fasten.'' Can anybody listening to this today not readily \npull up a song in their mind and listen to it right now? Because it \nwraps around their inner being.\n  Unfortunately, perhaps the last sector of society to acknowledge the \nimportance and effects of music is the music industry.\n  In this hearing, I asked Hilary Rosen, the president of the Recording \nIndustry Association of America, the trade organization of the music \nindustry, the following questions. I asked, ``Who purchases Marilyn \nManson albums? Do you know anything about the demographics of those who \npurchase these albums?'' She answered ``No.''\n  I asked, ``Have you looked at the demographic profile of those who \npurchase shock rock or gangsta rap records? She answered ``No.'' Later \nin her testimony, she asserted that ``the purchasers of this [Marilyn \nManson's ``Anti-Christ Superstar'' album] album in retail stores are \nover the age of 17.''\n\n  I thought--I would be happy to be wrong about this, but somehow, I \ndoubt that the majority of Marilyn Manson fans are out of their teens. \nThe appeal of this music appears to be the greatest to teenagers--the \nvery group of people who are supposed to be protected from it. But \nthey're not.\n  Let me be clear: I am opposed to censorship of music. I believe the \nfirst amendment ensures the widest possible latitude in allowing \nvarious forms of speech--including offensive, obnoxious speech. But the \nfact that lyrics which celebrate should be allowed does not mean that \nthey should be given respectability. There are some forms of speech \nwhich should be thoroughly criticized and roundly stigmatized, even \nthough they are allowed. Freedom of expression is not immunity from \ncriticism.\n  What we honor says as much about our national character as what we \nallow. There is an old saying ``Tell me what you love, and I'll tell \nyou what you are.'' A love of violence, murder, mayhem, destruction, \ndebasement and pain, as reflected in the popularity of gory movies, \nviolent music, a burgeoning porn industry, grotesque video games, and \nsleazy television is a cause for national concern. What we honor and \nesteem as a people both reflects and affects our culture. We grow to \nresemble what we honor, and we become less like what we disparage.\n  Glorifying violence in music is dangerous--Because a society that \nglorifies violence will grow more violent. When we refuse to criticize \nthe gangsta rap songs that debase women, we send the message that \ntreating women like chattel is not something to be upset about. Record \ncompanies that promote violent music implicitly push the idea that more \npeople should listen to, purchase, and enjoy the sounds of slaughter. \nWhen MTV named Marilyn Manson the ``Best New Artist of the Year'' last \nyear, they help him up as an example to be aspired to. Promoting \nviolence as entertainment corrodes our nation from within.\n  This is not a new idea. Virtually all of the Founding Fathers \nbelieved--even assumed--that nations rise and fall based on what they \nhonor and what they discourage. Samuel Adams stated ``A general \ndissolution of principles and manner will more surely overthrow the \nliberties of America than the whole force of a common enemy.''\n  Next week, we will have a hearing to explore whether violence is \nactually marketed to children. We have invited the presidents and CEOs \nof the big entertainment conglomerates--Time-Warner, Viacom, BMG Sony, \nSega, Nintendo, Hasbro. We hope they will come and help us begin a \nfruitful discussion on what can be done to protect our children from \nentertainment which glorifies and glamorizes violence.\n  Mr. President, I have gone on for some time, but I think this is \ncritically important, particularly in light of what we experienced this \npast week that has shocked us as a nation and really caused us to ask \nwhy and what do we do to change.\n  I think it perhaps was best summarized in a speech given by the Most \nRev. Charles Chaput who is the Archbishop of Denver.\n  Mr. President, he said this:\n\n       As time passes, we need to make sense of the Columbine \n     killings. The media are already filled with ``sound bites'' \n     of shock and disbelief; psychologists, sociologists, grief \n     counselors and law enforcement officers--all with their \n     theories and plans. God bless them for it. We certainly need \n     help. Violence is now pervasive in American society--in our \n     homes, our schools, on our streets, in our cars as we drive \n     home from work, in the news media, in the rhythms and lyrics \n     of our music, in our novels, films and video games. It is so \n     prevalent that we have become largely unconscious of it. But, \n     as we discover in places like the hallways of Columbine High, \n     it is bitterly, urgently real.\n       The causes of this violence are many and complicated: \n     racism, fears, selfishness. But in another, deeper sense, the \n     cause is very simple: We're losing God, and in losing Him, \n     we're losing ourselves. The complete contempt for human life \n     shown by the young killers at Columbine is not an accident, \n     or an anomaly, or a freak flaw in our social fabric. It's \n     what we create when we live a contradiction . . . we can't \n     market avarice and greed . . . and then hope that somehow our \n     children will help build a culture of life.\n\n  He concludes by saying--and the title of his speech is, ``Ending the \nviolence begins with our own conversion'':\n\n       In this Easter season and throughout the coming months, I \n     ask you to join me in praying in a special way for the \n     families who have been affected by the Columbine tragedy. But \n     I also ask you to pray that each of us--including myself--\n     will experience a deep conversion of heart toward love and \n     non-violence in all of our relationships with others.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech of the Most \nRev. Charles Chaput be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Denver Catholic Register, Apr. 21, 1999]\n\n           Ending the Violence Begins With Our Own Conversion\n\n           (By Most Reverend Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap.)\n\n       He descended into hell.\n       Over a lifetime of faith, each of us, as believers, recites \n     those words from the Creed thousands of times. We may not \n     understand them, but they're familiar. They're routine. And \n     then something happens to show us what they really mean.\n       Watching a disaster unfold for your community in the glare \n     of the international mass media is terrible and unreal at the \n     same time. Terrible in its bloody cost; unreal in its brutal \n     disconnection from daily life. The impact of what happened \n     this past week in Littleton, however, didn't fully strike \n     home in my heart until the morning after the murders, when I \n     visited a large prayer gathering of students from Columbine \n     High School, and spent time with the families of two of the \n     students who died.\n       They taught me something.\n       The students who gathered to pray and comfort each other \n     showed me again the importance of sharing not just our \n     sorrow, but our hope. God created us to witness His love to \n     each other, and we draw our life from the friendship, the \n     mercy and the kindness we offer to others in pain. The young \n     Columbine students I listened to, spoke individually--one by \n     one--of the need to be strong, to keep alive hope in the \n     future, and to turn away from violence. Despite all their \n     confusion and all their hurt, they would not despair. I think \n     I understand why. We're creatures of life. This is the way \n     God made us: to assert life in the face of death.\n       Even more moving was my time with the families of two \n     students who had been murdered. In the midst of their great \n     suffering--a loss I can't imagine--the parents radiated a \n     dignity which I will always remember, and a confidence that \n     God would somehow care for them and the children they had \n     lost, no matter how fierce their pain. This is where words \n     break down. This is where you see, up close, that faith--\n     real, living faith--is rooted finally not in how smart, or \n     affluent, or successful, or sensitive persons are, but in how \n     well they love. Scripture says that ``love is as strong as \n     death.'' I know it is stronger. I saw it.\n       As time passes, we need to make sense of the Columbine \n     killings. The media are already filled with ``sound bites'' \n     of shock and disbelief; psychologists, sociologists, grief \n     counselors and law enforcement officers--all with their \n     theories and plans. God bless\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\n     them for it. We certainly need help. Violence is now \n     pervasive in American society--in our homes, our schools, on \n     our streets, in our cars as we drive home from work, in the \n     news media, in the rhythms and lyrics of our music, in our \n     novels, films and video games. It is so prevalent that we \n     have become largely unconscious of it. But, as we discover in \n     places like the hallways of Columbine High, it is bitterly, \n     urgently real.\n       The causes of this violence are many and complicated: \n     racism, fear, selfishness. But in another, deeper sense, the \n     cause is very simple: We're losing God, and in losing Him, \n     we're losing ourselves. The complete contempt for human life \n     shown by the young killers at Columbine is not an accident, \n     or an anomaly, or a freak flaw in our social fabric. It's \n     what we create when we live a contradiction. We can't \n     systematically kill the unborn, the infirm and the condemned \n     prisoners among us; we can't glorify brutality in our \n     entertainment; we can't market avarice and greed . . . and \n     then hope that somehow our children will help build a culture \n     of life.\n       We need to change. But societies only change when families \n     change, and families only change when individuals change. \n     Without a conversion to humility, non-violence and \n     selflessness in our own hearts, all our talk about ``ending \n     the violence'' may end as pious generalities. It is not \n     enough to speak about reforming our society and community. We \n     need to reform ourselves.\n       Two questions linger in the aftermath of the Littleton \n     tragedy. How could a good God allow such savagery? And why \n     did this happen to us?\n       In regard to the first: God gave us the gift of freedom, \n     and if we are free, we are free to do terrible, as well as \n     marvelous things . . . And we must also live with the results \n     of others' freedom. But God does not abandon us in our \n     freedom, or in our suffering. This is the meaning of the \n     cross, the meaning of Jesus' life and death, the meaning of \n     He descended into hell. God spared His only Son no suffering \n     and no sorrow--so that He would know and understand and share \n     everything about the human heart. This is how fiercely He \n     loves us.\n       In regard to the second: Why not us? Why should evil be at \n     home in faraway places like Kosovo and Sudan and not find its \n     way to Colorado? The human heart is the same everywhere--and \n     so is the One for whom we yearn.\n       He descended into hell. The Son of God descended into hell \n     . . . and so have we all, over the past few days. But that \n     isn't the end of the story. On the third day, He rose again \n     from the dead. Jesus Christ is Lord, ``the resurrection and \n     the life,'' and we--His brothers and sisters--are children of \n     life. When we claim that inheritance, seed it in our hearts, \n     and conform our lives to it, then and only then will the \n     violence in our culture begin to be healed.\n       In this Easter season and throughout the coming months, I \n     ask you to join me in praying in a special way for the \n     families who have been affected by the Columbine tragedy. But \n     I also ask you to pray that each of us--including myself--\n     will experience a deep conversion of heart toward love and \n     non-violence in all our relationships with others.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is time we address this. It is time we address it \nstrongly. It is time we address it clearly and ask two questions: How \ndid we get here, and how do we get out? This is not the culture we were \nraised in and this is not the culture we want our kids to be in, as one \nof our colleagues, Senator Lieberman, put it. I hope we can start the \nchange and renew our culture and start to do that by renewing \nourselves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to note that this week the world's \nfinance ministers and central bank presidents have gathered in \nWashington for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. I suspect that Secretary of the Treasury \nRubin reminded us last week that, despite the hype about the end of the \nworld's financial crisis, we are just at the starting point of making \nthose structural changes necessary to put the globe back on a solid \ngrowth path.\n  Obviously, it is critical to repair the global financial system, and \nSecretary Rubin has been the leader in this with excellent ideas. But \nthere is a whole other piece, which we can't ignore; that is, the need \nto maintain and expand an open trading system. Take a look at some \ntroubling trade statistics released last week.\n  First, the United States merchandise trade deficit in February hit an \nall-time record--over $19 billion. Imports into the United States are \ngrowing faster now than at any time in the last four years. \nFurthermore, American exports are lower than they were just one year \nago. And remember that one billion dollars in exports equals about \n12,000 jobs.\n  Japan and China seem to be in a race to see who will have the largest \ndeficit with us. Japan's trade deficit with the United States in \nFebruary was over $5 billion, while China's was a little under $5 \nbillion.\n  There is more. Another troubling statistic was the World Trade \nOrganization announcement that last year the world's exports grew only \n3.5 percent. That compares to a 10.5 percent growth rate in 1997. And \nthey expect the growth of world trade to slow down even further this \nyear.\n  Third, and this is even worse news, while imports into North America \nwere up 10.5 percent, our exports from North America, which means \nmainly the United States, rose only 3 percent last year. That is, \nimports rose three and a half times faster than exports.\n  All this means that the world economy is surviving by exporting a lot \nto us while importing less and less.\n  Why is this?\n  A major reason is that our economy is so much stronger today than any \nothers. This is due to American economic strength and competitiveness, \nas well as to the global financial turmoil that has hurt so many of our \ntrading partners.\n  But another significant reason for the growing trade deficit is the \ncontinuing discrepancy between the openness of our market versus the \nopenness of others. It is true that once the world emerges from the \nfinancial crisis and global recovery begins to kick in, these numbers \nwill change somewhat. However, the trade barriers that existed prior to \nthe start of the global financial crisis are still there today and will \nstill be there tomorrow.\n  If Secretary Rubin and other financial leaders succeed in their \nefforts, foreign economies will pick up later this year or next. We \nshould see an increase in our exports as those economies need American \ncapital goods and start buying more consumer products. But, economic \nrecovery overseas does not mean that trade barriers will disappear. We \nmust deal aggressively with barriers to our goods and services to take \nadvantage of this opportunity for greater export growth.\n  That is why we must always keep market opening and trade \nliberalization on the top of our national agenda, aggressively \nnegotiating new agreements, insisting on full implementation of \nexisting agreements, and repairing those aspects of our trade law that \nare not working.\n  Our farmers, manufacturers, and service providers are the most \nefficient in the world. They must have the same freedom to do business \noverseas that foreign businesses have in our country. And it is the \nduty of the Congress and the Administration to ensure that those \nopportunities exist.\n  We have all been pretty frustrated by the European Union's \nunwillingness to abide by WTO decisions on beef and bananas. In fact, \nEurope's reaction to the WTO beef hormone decision is to become even \nmore protectionist. We have also been frustrated by Japan's \nunwillingness to implement its trade agreements with the United States. \nA recent study concluded that Japan was implementing fewer than one-\nthird of those agreements.\n  One possible bright side to this picture, however, lies in the WTO \nnegotiations with China. USTR, USDA, and other agencies have done \nyeoman's work over the past month. I hope the agreements made thus far \nwith China hold together and the negotiations underway can bring it to \na conclusion. We have an opportunity to expand significantly American \nexports in many sectors--agriculture, manufacturing, and services, for \nexample. Another example of this is the Pacific Northwest wheat \nagreement, which has been a problem for us in the Pacific Northwest. \nChina now agrees that we will be able to sell our Pacific Northwest \nwheat to China.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that opening markets is profoundly \nimportant for our national well-being. But it requires persistent, \naggressive, high-level attention at all levels of our government. I \nwill do everything in my power to ensure that this is done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, last week the sense of security that \nAmericans had in their own communities, our sense of the strength of \nour culture, our ability to protect our families and our homes, was \nonce again shattered.\n  The challenge did not come from Kosovo, and it was not from a \ncomputer problem with the new millennium. It was from the most basic \nform of human violence, striking us where we are most vulnerable, and \ntaking the life of a child.\n  James Agee once wrote that in every child who is born, no matter what \ncircumstances or without regard to their parents, the potentiality of \nthe human race is born again. It may be because of the sense we possess \nthat our own renewal is in the life of our children that the death of a \nchild shakes us so dramatically. Rarely have we seen an America more \ntraumatized by individual acts of violence than as a result of the \nmurders in Littleton, CO.\n  All of us recognize that there is no one answer, no one explanation \nfor this tragedy. The answer lies in the strengths of our families, the \nresponsibility of parents, the roles of school administrators and \nparents and local police. Almost every critic has a point; virtually \nnone has a complete answer.\n  The increasing level of violence in the entertainment industry, the \nnew use of technologies which have sanitized the very concepts of death \nand murder, the failure of role models, the growing isolation of \nchildren from parents and siblings and extended families--all critics \nare right; no criticism is complete.\n  But in this constellation of problems there is the persistent issue \nof access to guns in American society. Only a few years ago, when a \nsimilar tragedy rocked the United Kingdom, the British Parliament \nresponded in days. A gunman killed 16 students in Dunblane, Scotland. \nThe Parliament was outraged. The British people responded. And the \nprivate ownership of high-caliber handguns was not regulated or \ncontrolled; it was banned.\n  This Congress can rightfully cite a variety of challenges to the \nAmerican people to ensure that Littleton never occurs again, though, \nindeed, we failed to do so after Jonesboro, Paducah, Springfield, and a \nvariety of other cities and schools that had similar tragedies.\n\n  Now the question is, Do we visit upon this tragedy the same silence \nas after those other school shootings, or do we have the same courage \nthe British Parliament exhibited 3 years ago in dealing with this \nproblem?\n  The amount of death that this Congress is prepared to witness before \nwe deal realistically with the problems of guns in America defies \ncomprehension. Last year, 34,000 Americans were victims of gun \nviolence. But the year before and the year before that, for a whole \ngeneration, the carnage has been similar. Every year, 1,500 people die \nfrom accidental shootings. Every 6 hours, another child in America \ncommits suicide with a gun. No gun control can eliminate all of this \nviolence. I do not believe any gun control can eliminate a majority of \nthis violence. But no one can credibly argue that some reasonable gun \ncontrol cannot stop some of this violence.\n  I am heartened that the majority leader has promised the Senate that \nwithin a matter of weeks there will be a debate on this floor and an \nopportunity to present some reasonable forms of additional gun control. \nAt a minimum, this should include the question of parental \nresponsibility for children who get access to guns. Where parents have \nknowledge or facilitate that purchase, they must bear some \nresponsibility for the likely, in some cases inevitable, consequences \nof minors having those weapons.\n  Second, there is the question of whether or not minors should be able \nto purchase certain weapons at all. It is arguable that a minor should \nnot be able to purchase a handgun. It is irrefutable, in my judgment, \nthat a minor should not be able to purchase a semiautomatic weapon.\n  Third, the question of whether, through the new technologies of the \nInternet, it is appropriate that guns be sold or purchased in any form; \nif it is not an invitation to violate and avoid existing State and \nFederal laws; if a person does not have to present themselves in a \nretail establishment with credentials to purchase a weapon. Remote \nsales, in my judgment, should not be allowed.\n  Then there is the larger question of the regulation of all weapons \nthrough the Federal Government--whether, when we live in a society \nwhere everything from an automobile to a child's teddy bear has \nregulations on their designs and materials to ensure safety, that same \nregulatory scheme should not be used for weapons; whether a weapon is \ndesigned properly to assure its safety; whether its materials are the \nbest possible; whether technology is being used to ensure that the gun \nis used properly.\n  One can envision that the Treasury Department or another Federal \nagency would require gun manufacturers to have safety locks so that \nchildren could not misuse them. Future technology may allow a \nthumbprint to ensure that only the owner of the gun is using the gun. \nMore basic technologies might require better materials or that a gun \ndoes not misfire when it is dropped. Proper regulations might ensure \nhow these guns are sold, to ensure that they are sold properly, that \nState gun laws are not being evaded by oversupplying stores on State \nborders with permissive laws so that they are sold into States with \nrestrictive laws. Inevitably this must be part of the debate: the \nproper Federal role in ensuring the proper design and distribution and \nsale of these weapons.\n\n  I am grateful, Mr. President, that the majority leader has invited \nthe Senate to participate in this debate; proud, if the Senate responds \nto the challenge.\n  There were so many prayers throughout this country for the victims of \nthe shooting in Littleton, sincere prayers on the floor of the Senate. \nThe victims and their families and traumatized Americans need our \nprayers, but they need more than our prayers. They need the courage \nthat comes from a people who recognize that change is both possible and \nrequired to avoid these tragedies from repeating themselves.\n  The victims of Littleton will be grateful for our prayers, but they \nwill curse our inaction if political intimidation, the fear of change, \nresults in the Senate offering nothing but prayers. This Senate has a \nresponsibility to respond. We know what needs to get done. The \nPresident of the United States has challenged us. Americans are waiting \nand watching.\n  Every Senator must use these next few weeks to think about how they \nwill vote, searching their own consciences on how they will answer \ntheir constituents, their families, and themselves, if Littleton \nbecomes one more town in a litany of forgotten schools, forgotten \nchildren, and a rising spiral of carnage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been some discussion about Y2K \nand the Y2K liability bill. It seems every\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nmoment I settle down in my office to do other work, I get calls for \nanother meeting on Y2K. I thought it might be good to let my colleagues \nand the public know what is in the Y2K bill we will be discussing this \nafternoon.\n  I have a chart; we like charts in this place. This chart shows how \nsimple this bill is not. It illustrates the detours, roadblocks, and \ndead ends the bill would impose on innocent plaintiffs in our State-\nbased legal system.\n  I have a real-life example so we can see what will happen. A small \nbusiness owner from Warren, MI, Mark Yarsike, testified before the \nCommerce and Judiciary Committees about his Y2K problems. A few years \nago, he bought a new computer cash register system for his small \nbusiness, Produce Palace. However, they didn't tell him it wasn't Y2K \ncompliant. This brand-new, high-tech cash register system, which the \ncompany was happy to sell him for almost $100,000, kept crashing.\n  The computer cash register system kept breaking down. After more than \n200 service calls, it was finally discovered why; it couldn't read \ncredit cards with an expiration date in the year 2000--like the credit \ncard I have in my wallet right now. That is a Y2K computer defect that \nwould be covered under this bill and the company would be protected, \nnot Mark Yarsike. The company that sold him this defective piece of \nequipment for $100,000 would be protected.\n  At the top of this chart is how the State-based court system works \ntoday for Mark Yarsike, whose business buys a new computerized cash \nregister system and, because of a Y2K defect, the system crashes.\n  I will in a moment speak to what happens if we pass this legislation \nbefore the Senate. Assume we show some sense and reject the \nlegislation; if Mark Yarsike asks the company to fix the system, if the \ncompany knows they have to do something for the owner, they will either \nagree to fix the problem--which is really what he wants; he doesn't \nwant to sue, he just wants his problem fixed--they agree to fix it and \nmake a quick, fair settlement for his damages. That is it.\n  Or they could fail to fix it, he could go into court, and a trial \nwould decide who is at fault.\n  Now, that is basically what happens today. In fact, that is what \nhappened to Mark Yarsike. He was forced to buy a new computer cash \nregister system from another company. He sued the first company which \nsold him the computer that wasn't Y2K compliant, that caused him to \nlose so much business. He recouped his losses through a fair \nsettlement, and the court system worked for him.\n  Now, say ``Joe's'' business--not Mark Yarsike, who went through the \nnormal court process--buys a computer cash register system under the \nbill before the Senate. Assume we pass this bill, assume the President \nsigns it into law. All of a sudden, instead of this very simple \nstraight line as indicated on the chart, the Congress of the United \nStates is saying: We are from the Government and we are here to help \nyou, we will make life simpler for you.\n  Instead of giving the nice straight line, which is what the law is \ntoday, this is what he is presented: first he has to wait 30 days, \nduring which nothing happens; during that time, he still has to turn \naway business because every customer with a new credit card can't use \nit, and they will say, to heck with this place, I will go somewhere \nelse. Even if after the 30 days, the company may send a written \nresponse and just say that we have another 60 days you will have to \nwait; if that doesn't put you out of business, then you can also file a \nlawsuit to recover damages if you are not already out of business \nanyway.\n  If he files a lawsuit, under the bill's contract preservation \nprovision we get to our first dead end on the road to justice. The cash \nregister company may be able to enforce unconscionable limits on any \nrecovery if it is in a written contract. Under this bill before the \nSenate, the unconscionable limits in the written contract are strictly \nenforced unless the enforcement of that term would manifestly and \ndirectly contravene State law and statute in effect January 1999 \nspecifically addressing that term.\n  In other words, if the State legislatures had not known by January 1 \nof this year what the U.S. Congress, in its infinite wisdom, was going \nto do in May of this year when enacting a statute that specifically \nanticipated what we might do, Joe is out of luck.\n  If the small business owners can't recover the losses from the Y2K \ndefective cash register system because of this contract preservation \nprovision, then he does have other alternatives: He can go bankrupt; he \ncan fire his employees, lay them off; or if somehow he was able to get \npast these roadblocks, he could actually file a suit.\n  We have another detour. The company gets another 30-day extension to \nrespond to the complaint. Their business isn't hurting, but Joe is \nbarely able to hang on. When the small business owner files that \nlawsuit, he has to meet special pleading requirements under this bill. \nHe has to file with complaints specific statements on the defendant's \nstate of mind, the nature of the amount of damage, and the material Y2K \ndefect. So he has three more roadblocks--all of which can lead to this \ndead end.\n  If he misses any one of those hurdles we have put in his way, he is \nright back to a dead end. The cash register company can say, bye bye, \nsee you; tough, Joe; we will send you a postcard when you are at the \nbankruptcy court.\n  Now, suppose the cash register company had sold others of these \n$100,000 system with a Y2K defect. Should we all join together and \nbring a class action? No, we come into a new roadblock, back to a dead \nend, back to bankruptcy again. So let's move on to the next roadblock \nthat is put in the bill--the roadblock we are putting in the way of \nsmall businesses. That is something the business lobbyists are not \ntelling the small businesses about, all the roadblocks that are in this \nspecial interest legislation.\n  This bill has a ``duty to mitigate'' section that turns traditional \ntort law on its head. It requires the plaintiff to anticipate and avoid \nany Y2K damage before it occurs, not after. Almost all the States have \nadopted the traditional duty to mitigate tort law, which requires the \ninjured party to mitigate his damages once the harm occurs. That makes \nsome sense. But this requires mitigation before the harm occurs. If the \nowners bought this $100,000 cash register and didn't anticipate that a \nlot of its customers are going to leave because the cash register does \nnot work as he was told it was going to, how does he mitigate? He wants \nto run his business. He doesn't make cash registers. He expects them, \nfor $100,000, to do it right. But if he didn't try to mitigate before \nthe system crashed, then he could be caught in another dead end, end of \nthe road here, and right back down to bankruptcy, and employees are \nout.\n  I do not understand how he could have known his cash register system \nwas not going to be able to read credit cards with the year 2000 \nexpiration date after he paid $100,000 for it, but that doesn't matter. \nThis case would be dismissed because of the bill's duty to mitigate \nprovision.\n  So, roadblock after roadblock--in fact, there is another one. Let's \nassume somehow Joe is driving a humvee of some sort through the legal \nsystem and he is getting it past these roadblocks. He has another one. \nBecause what he does not know is that the Senate has overridden the 50 \nState legislatures. We have said to the legislators: Boy, you guys are \ndumb. The men and women in these State legislatures are not as smart as \nwe are. So we are just going to throw your laws out and we will just \npass our laws and override you. Because the bill would override State \ncontract law and could even preempt existing implied warranties under \nState law.\n  For the small business owner, the bill's Federal preemption contract \nclauses may override the State common law claims of breach of implied \nwarranties. Again, here he is at another roadblock, another dead end \nleading back to bankruptcy.\n  Then, say he somehow got through all of these roadblocks and dead \nends that we put in, basically to make it impossible for a small \nbusiness owner; everything that we have done to put roadblocks and dead \nends in. Let's say he gets through all of them. He still has more \nlimits on his legal rights at the jury verdict point. There are severe \nlimits on recovery. In fact, if it is a small business, then $250,000 \nis the ceiling for any punitive damages award. If\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nhe can prove they intentionally defrauded him, then there is an \nexemption from these punitive damage caps. This bill is saying: If you \ncan prove intention to defraud, we might give you a chance.\n  This is a meaningless exception in the real world. Nobody is going to \nbe able to meet this exception, proving the injury was specifically \nintended. How in the world is our small business owner, who is just \ntrying to keep the place alive at this point, going to prove the cash \nregister company intentionally tried to injure him by selling him a Y2K \ndefective cash register system? Let's get real here. It is not going to \nhappen. Again, the best thing for him is bankruptcy. The big company \ncan breathe a sigh of relief and they are out.\n  And on and on. Severe joint liability limits; for directors and \nofficers, partial immunity; severe caps on recovery--all of these \nthings end up protecting the companies, overriding State laws, and \nsaying to the small business owner we are not going to do anything for \nyou.\n\n  You know, directors and officers are already protected by the \nbusiness judgment rule adopted by each of the 50 States. But we put a \nspecial legal protection for them in this bill. I think that sends the \nwrong message to the business community. We want to encourage decision \nmakers to be overseeing aggressive year 2000 compliance measures. \nInstead, we say: Don't worry, be happy.\n  I want those corporate officers motivated to fix their company's Y2K \nproblems now. After their corporation is Y2K compliant and they have \nworked with their suppliers and customers and business partners and we \nhave avoided Y2K problems is the time to be happy.\n  A few of these detours, roadblocks and dead ends may be justified to \nprevent frivolous Y2K litigation. But certainly not all of them.\n  This bill makes seeking justice for the harm caused by a Y2K computer \nproblem into a game of chutes and ladders--but there are only chutes \nfor plaintiffs and no ladders. The defendant wins every time under the \nrigged rules of this game.\n  Unfortunately, this bill overreaches again and again. It is not close \nto being balanced.\n  In addition, this bill preempts all 50 state consumer protection laws \nand makes ordinary consumers face the bill's legal detours, road blocks \nand dead ends on the road to justice. That is not fair.\n  Today, I filed a consumer protection amendment to exclude ordinary \nconsumers from the legal restrictions in the bill. I hope the majority \nwill permit amendments to be brought up on this legislation soon.\n  I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the \nSenate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would deter frivolous \nY2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K compliance. Those of us in \nCongress who have been active on technology-related issues have \nstruggled mightily, and successfully, to act in a bipartisan way. It \nwould be unfortunate, and it would be harmful to the technology \nindustry, technology users and to all consumers, if that pattern is \nbroken over this bill.\n  I hope Members will look at what we are doing here. Here is the \nsystem we have today for Y2K. Here is the system we are suggesting with \nall these dead ends, all these roadblocks: Roadblock, roadblock, \nroadblock, roadblock, all leading to small businesses going bankrupt \nand all because we stand up here and say to 50 State legislatures: You \nare not smart enough. You are not as smart as we are. We are going to \noverride you.\n  I think that is wrong. I think we ought to go back to the drawing \nboards. I think we ought to do what we did last year when we passed \ngood Y2K legislation because we did it in a bipartisan fashion where we \nhad businesses, Members of Congress, lawyers, those in the high-tech \nfield--we came together and passed legislation that worked and the \nPresident signed it into law.\n  This maze, this unnecessary trampling of State legislatures, will not \nbe signed into law by the President of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know you, the Senator from Arkansas, \nare familiar with tragedies in high schools involving our young people \nwho create havoc and take the lives of fellow students and others. The \nevent in Colorado is the most glaring and stunning example of the kind \nof violence that we are apparently capable of as a nation today. As \nchairman the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Youth Violence, \nI have given an awful lot of thought to it. But I am perplexed. A few \nthings occur to me. There is what appears to me a pattern here that \nwould suggest how we have gotten to this point.\n\n  It strikes me that an extremely small number of young people today \nhave gotten on a very destructive path. They have headed down the road \nof anger and violence. They have not been acculturated with the kind of \ngentlemanliness and gentlewomanliness, not inculcated with religious \nfaith and discipline, maybe a lack of values or whatever--somehow it \ndid not take. Maybe their parents tried. Maybe they did not.\n  But, in addition to that, they are alienated and angry. They are able \nto hook into the Internet and play video games that are extraordinarily \nviolent, that cause the blood pressure to rise and the adrenalin level \nto go up, games that cause people to be killed and the players to die \nthemselves. It is a very intense experience. They are able to get into \nInternet chatrooms and, if there are no nuts or people of the same \nmentality in their hometown, hook up with people around the country. \nThey are able to rent from the video store--not just go down and see \n``Natural Born Killers'' or ``The Basketball Diaries''--but they are \nable to bring it home and watch it repeatedly. In this case even maybe \nmake their own violent film. Many have said this murder was very much \nakin to ``The Basketball Diaries,'' in which a student goes in and \nshoots others in the classroom. I have seen a video of that, and many \nothers may have.\n\n  In music, there is Marilyn Manson, an individual who chooses the name \nof a mass murderer as part of his name. The lyrics of his music are \nconsistent with his choice of name. They are violent and nihilistic and \nthere are groups all over the world who do this, some German groups and \nothers.\n  I guess what I am saying is, a person already troubled in this modern \nhigh-tech world can be in their car and hear the music, they can be in \ntheir room and see the video, they can go into the chatrooms and act \nout these video games and even take it to real life. Something there is \nvery much of a problem.\n  All of us have to look for the signs of children who may be moving \ndeeper and deeper into death, violence, nihilism, and other bad trends. \nWe ought to say and we ought to encourage our teachers and our school \nadministrators and our parents to intervene and to assert that life is \nbetter than death, that peace is better than violence, and honesty is \nbetter than falsehood; that respect for your brothers and tolerance and \npatience, even in the face of adverse actions by somebody toward you, \nis essential in a civilized society. I am concerned about that.\n  What I really want to mention today, because I have been through this \nfor a number of years, is the question of what we do about firearms in \nAmerica. I was at a church event, not too many months ago, and the \npreacher prayed against guns. I thought that was odd for him to pray \nagainst an inanimate object that does what the holder tells it to do. \nBut I think we would do well to focus on what it is that is eating at \nthe soul of too many people in America today, No. 1.\n  What about this problem with guns? I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 \nyears, 12 as U.S. attorney under Presidents Reagan and Bush. They \ncreated a program called Project Triggerlock. In that program, this \nCongress passed legislation that said if you are convicted of carrying \na firearm during a crime, a felony, it is 5 years without parole \nconsecutive for the underlying offense. If you are a felon and you \npossess a firearm and you are guilty of a felony, you can get 2 or 3 \nmore years in jail.\n  Those are bread-and-butter gun laws focusing on people who commit \ncrimes with firearms. There are a lot of others: having a firearm \nwithout a serial\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\nnumber, having a sawed-off shotgun, a fully automatic weapon, and now \nassault weapons. There are literally hundreds of gun laws.\n  The directive came down from the President of the United States that \nhe wanted these people prosecuted for violating those gun laws. I took \nthe directive. I was one of the lieutenants in the war, and we went to \nwork. I created a newsletter and sent it to every sheriff. I said: If \nyou have the kind of criminal that needs prosecuting under Federal gun \nlaws, you bring those cases to me and we will prosecute them.\n  Our numbers went up tremendously, and the word began to get out. The \nword got out in the streets: If you have a gun, they will take you to \nFederal court.\n  By the way, most people do not realize that some good laws have been \npassed for Federal court. Ask your sheriffs and police chiefs which has \nthe fastest justice system, which has the most severe punishment and \nthe most certainty of punishment, which one is the felon least likely \nto get out of jail on parole, and every one of them will tell you the \nFederal system is tougher than any State. Whatever State you are in, \nthe Federal justice system is tougher: We have a 70-day speedy trial \nact; whatever the sentence is, you have to serve at least 85 percent of \nit.\n  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines mandate tough sentences. The judges \nhave to impose them. If not, the prosecutor can appeal, and they go to \njail. They do not want to go to Federal court for a gun violation. I am \ntelling you, the word gets out, in my professional opinion, having been \na prosecutor, as I said, for 15 years in the Federal system and two as \nAttorney General. I actually believe there was a deterrence in the \nnumber of people carrying guns in criminal activities. That is where \npeople get killed.\n\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 1996 after I left as a Federal \nprosecutor in 1992, I began to look at the Department of Justice \nstatistics on the kinds of cases they are prosecuting, because I served \n15 years in the Department of Justice, and I know how to read those \nnumbers.\n  I want to show you what we discovered. What we found is in 1992, when \nPresident Bush's U.S. attorneys left office, they were prosecuting \n7,048 gun cases each year in 1992. They prosecuted over 7,000. Notice \nthis chart shows the decline in those cases. It was 3,800 in 1998, a \n40-percent decline.\n  This is particularly shocking to me because this President is always \ntalking about guns and how we need to have more laws and we need to \nprosecute more people for guns, and they are not doing it. His own \nAttorney General, Janet Reno, has overseen a 40-percent decline.\n  This is not a secret. Since I have been here, for 2 years, when the \nAttorney General has come before our committee, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, Eric Holder, the Chief of the Criminal Division for \nconfirmation and other hearings, I have pulled out this very chart. I \nhave gone over these numbers with them and have asked them why they are \nnot prosecuting these cases. I have not yet received a good answer, \nother than they are just not putting the message out to the U.S. \nattorneys that they expect them to enforce these laws.\n  But what we have is a President who wants to call press conferences, \nas he did yesterday, to announce more laws; that we need to pass more \nlaws. The bread-and-butter laws are already on the books, and we have \nadded scores of other laws, which I support and I willingly prosecuted \naggressively.\n  It concerns me that people say, ``Oh, you just don't believe in gun \nlaws, Jeff. You are just NRA bought and paid for and you don't want to \ndo this.'' They believe in the second amendment right to bear arms, and \nso do I. If you want to change it, let's talk about changing it, but \nthere is a constitutional right to bear arms. There also is a right for \nthe Government to place reasonable restrictions on the right to bear \narms.\n  I have spent a big part, a major part of my professional career \nactively engaged with people who violate those reasonable restrictions. \nMachine guns, fully automatic weapons have been outlawed since the \nthirties, the Al Capone days. Sawed-off shotguns have been outlawed for \nmany years. Bombs are outlawed today and have been for many years.\n  First of all, it concerns me, and I think it is hypocritical and \nreally dishonest for the President to suggest that the way to deal with \nviolations of gun laws is to pass more laws, if you are not prosecuting \nthe ones we have. But, oh, that is the big deal: Are you for coming a \nlittle further to that second amendment core principle that protects \nthe right to bear arms? Let's see how far we can go and make people \nvote against it because they have a concern for the Constitution and a \ngeneral belief that the Government has gone too far and then say they \ndon't care about guns, all the time presiding over an administration \nthat is showing this dramatic decrease, a 40-percent decrease in the \nprosecutions. That is not an imaginary number. I have raised it with \nthe Attorney General, and we pulled it out of their statistics.\n  In addition to that, we have in the last several years, at the behest \nof gun control advocates, passed a number of bills, some of which are \ngood, some of which are marginal, but we passed them. We were told that \nthese were critical to prevent violence in America. And we need these \ngun laws.\n\n  I want to show you this chart. We pulled it out of the Department of \nJustice statistics. And I questioned them about it in hearings before \nthis tragedy, because this isn't a recent deal, this is something that \nhas been going on for several years, and it is well known.\n  One of the best things, I suppose, is, the possession of firearms on \nschool grounds is a Federal crime. The First Lady, who sometimes it had \nbeen suggested was a de facto Attorney General at the beginning of this \nadministration, yesterday was speaking about gun laws. And that is all \nright. But she has not had the experience I have had in prosecuting \nthese cases. And she talks about, we need more of them. And this is one \nof them they highlighted.\n  But look at this. In 1997, the Clinton administration nationwide \nprosecuted five. In 1998, they prosecuted eight.\n  ``But we're committed, Jeff.'' But they said--the First Lady did in \nher speech yesterday--that there were 6,000 incidents last year in \nschools of weapons being brought to school. So how come her prosecutors \nare prosecuting so few of them? Let me ask you. I think it is a good \nquestion.\n  Unlawful transfer of firearms to juveniles. I support that. And right \nnow it is unlawful for a firearms dealer to transfer a pistol to a \njuvenile, a person under 21.\n  Look at this. In 1997, they prosecuted five. In 1998, they prosecuted \nsix. What difference does it make if we pass laws if nobody is being \nprosecuted for them?\n  Possession or transfer of semiautomatic weapons. Those are the \nassault weapons. The assault weapon is a weapon that looks like one of \nthese fully automatic military weapons; it has the handles on it, but \nit is really a semiautomatic weapon that fires one time when you pull \nthe trigger. Traditionally, a lot of rifles are semiautomatic. But in \nthat configuration it was made illegal.\n  Remember all the debate about that? We had tremendous debate over the \nfirst time a semiautomatic rifle had been made illegal. But the \nadministration's position was, it just had to have the law. They just \nhad to have it. And it is an unpleasant weapon, I assure you. I do not \nthink you have to have it to go hunting. But at any rate, in 1997, four \nof those cases were prosecuted in the entire United States; in 1998, \nfour.\n  I say all that to say this: I believe we have to quit doing symbolic \nthings. We need to quit doing things for headlines. We need to sit down \nand figure out how to reduce crime in America.\n  With regard to this very odd group of people we have seen in five \nStates going on rampages in high schools, that is a unique and special \ngroup. And if they are determined to build a bomb, and can build one by \nlooking it up on the Internet, whether or not they have to go down to \nthe store to buy a weapon and give their name or whatever is not going \nto make much difference. That is real. And if they are seeing this on \ntelevision, in videos, whether or not there is a law about it, as \nclever as these kids are, it is not likely to make much difference.\n  But I just say that that is a crucial matter for us. I would think, \nas one who has been at this for a long time, we need to maintain our \ndiscipline\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nnow. And if something good can come out of this tragedy in Colorado, I \npray that it will.\n  When that young girl affirmed her faith with a gun at her head, \nsubjecting herself to summary execution by a laughing, diabolical \nshooter, I think we ought to take time to pause a minute and think \nabout that, because this is really serious. It is deeper than whether \nor not you prosecute with 4 or 20 gun laws in the United States. It is \ndeeper than that. That is what I am saying. But it does not mean that \neffective prosecutions of gun laws can't reduce crime.\n  Let me tell you this story.\n  Within the last month I, as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nJuvenile Crime, called a hearing. We were going to discuss a program \nknown as Project Exile in Richmond which the leader of it called \n``Trigger Lock with Steroids.'' Not only did they prosecute every gun \nviolation they could find in Richmond, they ran ads on television \nsaying: ``We will prosecute you.'' They put up signs saying how long \nyou would serve in the Federal slammer if you carried a gun during a \ncrime or illegality.\n\n  Their prosecutions went sky-high. But there were questions in the \nDepartment of Justice. The program was not supported because it was not \nthe trend with this Department of Justice. But they kept doing it. And \njust last year they found they had over a 40-percent reduction in \nviolent crime in Richmond. And the U.S. attorney, appointed by the \nPresident of the United States, President Clinton, testified and others \ninvolved with it--the chief of police in Richmond--testified that they \nwere convinced that aggressive criminal prosecutions in a trigger-lock-\ntype fashion of violent criminals, and other criminals who carried \nguns, helped drive down the murder rate.\n  I thought we ought to have a hearing about it. I wanted to highlight \nthat and encourage it. What I want to say to you is funny, almost; and \nmaybe something good came from that hearing. The hearing was set for \nMonday in our little, lowly committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nSubcommittee on Juvenile Crime. On Saturday, before that hearing, the \nPresident went on his national radio show and said he wanted to adopt \nthe Richmond project and promote and expand it.\n  So I hope maybe our hearing had something to do with getting the \nattention of the Department of Justice. But I have not seen any numbers \nto indicate that. It is easy to say words. But what we most often heard \nis that, we want new laws--which are not being prosecuted--and if we \ncan pass a law, then we can say we did something.\n  I have been in this body just 2 years. I think there is a real \nproblem here. Whenever there is a national matter of intense interest, \nwhat happens? We up and pass a law and say we did something. ``Hey, \ngive me a medal. I passed a law. I am against assault weapons. I am \nfighting crime.'' If you have been in the pit and dealt with criminals \nprofessionally for a long time, you know it takes more than that. It \ntakes a sustained effort.\n  If you do it consistently and aggressively, and you crack down on gun \nviolations, you can in fact reduce the crime rate. Ask the U.S. \nAttorney and the chief of police in Richmond if it is not so.\n  I do hope the statement that the President made in his radio show \nreally indicates a commitment to get these numbers up, because this is \nnot acceptable for any administration, but particularly one which \nclaims that the prosecuting of criminals and violations of Federal gun \nlaws is a high priority of theirs. Obviously it is not. We have a 40-\npercent reduction.\n  So, maybe somebody says, ``Jeff, that is just political.'' It is not \npolitical with me. It is something I have lived with. I prosecuted \nthese kinds of cases. I believe it reduces murders. I believe it saves \nthe lives of innocent people. And I would like to see an effective \nprogram conducted by this administration. And it has in fact been \ndemolished, as these numbers show. It undermines the effectiveness of \nthat effort.\n  There are innocent people, I will assure you, today who have been \nshot and wounded--some people who have been killed--who would not have \nbeen had the Triggerlock Project continued.\n  So it is something that I have been raising since I first got to this \nSenate--at virtually every Judiciary Committee hearing I have had. I \nhope this tragedy will do one thing: It will get the attention of the \nPresident and the Attorney General and the Chief of the Criminal \nDivision and the Associate Attorney General and Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and they will start sending the word out to their prosecutors. \nAnd they have more of them now than they had in 1992 when I was there. \nThey ought to be putting more of these people in jail. If we do, they \nwill make some difference. But I really don't think even those \nprosecutions are likely to have any significant impact on the bizarre \nfew people who are willing to go to a school and slaughter their own \nclassmates, commit suicide, worship Adolf Hitler, and think of Marilyn \nManson as something cool. That is a different matter with which we have \nto deal.\n\n  I hope as a nation we will confront it honestly and directly and \nbegin to bring back in every school system, because some parents \napparently are not doing it, a program that teaches character and good \nvalues like we are used to in America. There are those who say, well, \nyou cannot do that, that is violating civil liberties, you cannot \nexpress a concern about right and wrong in a classroom because that is \na value judgment.\n  Well, we are suffering today from 30 or 40 years of liberalism, \nrelativism, that anything goes. Well, some will say that is just old-\nfashioned talk.\n  No, it is not. No nation, in my view, can remain strong in which \nthere are no values which we can affirm. If we can't affirm that Adolf \nHitler is bad, what are we? If we can't affirm that Charles Manson is \nnot a fit person to emulate, then what are we as a nation? If we can't \nsay that telling the truth is more important than telling a lie, that \nreality is better than spin, then we are in trouble.\n  I hope we have not reached that. I think the American people are \ngood. I hope this tragedy has some ability to cause us to confront that \nand, if so, our Nation would be better for it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for allowing me to address this body \non this important issue. I have shared with the Senate some thoughts \nand concerns of mine that have been a part of me for a long time. I \nbelieve it is something our Nation has to consider, and I hope and pray \nwe will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, let me say we are ready to move forward on \nthe bill. We have a couple of amendments that can be accepted by both \nsides. I would like to move forward with that and hope that both \nsupporters and opponents of the bill will come to the floor.\n  Today I see a Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 96 as reported by \n     the Commerce Committee, as well as the amendment intended to \n     be proposed by Senators McCain and Wyden as a substitute. If \n     S. 96 were presented to the President, either as reported or \n     in the form of the proposed McCain-Wyden amendment, the \n     Attorney General would recommend a veto.\n\n  Let me say, I am glad to see the administration's position on this. I \nthink it makes it very clear as to whose side they are on. I hope all \nthe manufacturers, the small businesses, the medium size businesses and \nthe large businesses in America will take careful note of the \nadministration's absolute opposition to an effort that would solve this \nvery, very serious issue.\n  Of course, they support amendments that are proposed by the trial \nlawyers which would gut this legislation. I have no doubt that if we \naccepted the amendments that are going to be proposed, it would gut it. \nBut let us come to the floor and debate these amendments and move \nforward.\n  We have been on this bill now for 3 days. We still haven't had a \nsingle amendment. I say to the opponents of this legislation and the \nsubstitute that Senator Wyden and I proposed, come to the floor. Let us \ndebate your amendments and let us move forward. There is a cloture \npetition that will be voted on tomorrow. We may have to move forward in \nthat fashion.\n  In USA Today, Mr. President, there is an interesting column under \nTechnology by Kevin Maney: ``Lawyers Find Slim Pickings at Y2K Lawsuit \nBuffet.''\n\n       Y2K lawyers must be getting desperate, in much the way an \n     overpopulation of squirrels gets desperate when there aren't \n     enough nuts to go around.\n       So far, there's been a beguiling absence of breakdowns and \n     mishaps because of the Y2K computer problem. The ever-\n     multiplying number of lawyers chasing Y2K lawsuits apparently \n     have had to scrounge for something to do. At least that's the \n     picture Sen. John McCain [R-Ariz.] painted on the Senate \n     floor Tuesday.\n       McCain, who is sponsoring legislation to limit Y2K \n     lawsuits, told the story of Tom Johnson. It seems that \n     Johnson has filed a class action against retailers, including \n     Circuit City, Office Depot and Good Guys. The suit charges \n     that salespeople at the stores have not warned consumers \n     about products that might have Y2K problems.\n       For one thing, that's like suing a Chrysler dealership \n     because the sales guy didn't tell you a minivan might break \n     down when you're 500 miles from home on a family vacation. Or \n     suing a TV network for failing to announce that its shows \n     might stink.\n       Beyond that, Johnson doesn't claim in the suit that he has \n     been harmed. He's just doing it for the good of humanity--and \n     ``relief in the amount of all the defendants' profits from \n     1995 to date from selling these products.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Think Johnson's case is an anomaly? We haven't even hit \n     seersucker season, and the lawsuits focusing on Jan. 1 are \n     flying. More than 80 have been filed so far. If you sift \n     through the individual suits, a few seem understandable. The \n     rest seem like Rocco Chilelli v. Intuit.\n       Chilelli's suit says older versions of Intuit's Quicken \n     checkbook software are not Y2K ready and alleges that Intuit \n     refuses to provide free upgrades. Filed in New York, the suit \n     is a class action on behalf of ``thousands of customers (who) \n     will be forced to spend even more money to acquire the latest \n     Quicken version and may be required to spend time acquainting \n     themselves with the updated program and possibly re-inputting \n     financial information.''\n       After much legal wrangling, the Supreme Court of the State \n     of New York, County of Nassau, found that--duh!--no damage \n     had yet happened, as the calendar hasn't yet flipped to 2000. \n     The case was dismissed.\n\n  Mr. President, the column goes on to talk about the frivolous suits \nthat have been filed already. We need to act.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from South Carolina. I ask if he \nis ready to consider two Murkowski amendments at this time, which have \nbeen agreed to by both sides.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my distinguished chairman continues to \nsay let's talk, let's vote, let's move along. He thinks it is a \nprocedural question. I guess, in a way, it is when it comes to joint \nand several.\n  Mr. President, there is an old story told about the days when they \nused to block minorities from voting down in Mississippi. A gentlemen \npresented himself at the poll and the poll watcher showed him a Chinese \nnewspaper. These were the days of the literacy tests in order to be \nable to vote. He presented him with a Chinese newspaper and he said, \n``Read that.'' The poor voter takes it and turns it around different \nways and says, ``I reads it.'' The poll watcher said, ``What does it \nsay?'' The poor minority says, ``It says: Ain't no minority going to \nvote in Mississippi today.''\n  Now, Mr. President, in a similar vein, when you have been in this 20 \nyears, like Victor Schwartz down there at the NAM, when you have been \nin speaking panels before the manufacturers groups, when you have seen \nevery trick of the trade that they have had to repeal the 10th \namendment and take away from the States the administration of the tort \nsystem, and you know that there are the strong States righters but they \nare willing to do this, and when you know there is a nonproblem--I \nemphasize ``nonproblem\" --in the sense that there have only been 44 \ncases brought and over half have already been disposed of--some 10 \nothers have been settled, and only 8 or 9 are pending--and you know \nthat here we have a contract case, not a tort case, and you have to \nhave privity of contract under joint and several in contract cases.\n  But you know this extreme strain about punitive, about joint and \nseveral, and all of these other hurdles they put in there to discourage \nanybody bringing a suit, setting precedence, if you please, in the tort \nfield, then like the poor voter that ``can read'' the Chinese \nnewspaper, I can read S. 96. That is right. I can read the McCain-Wyden \namendment. What that says is, we don't care about Y2K, but we do care \nabout reforming torts and federalizing it and taking the richest, most \ncapable crowd in the world and giving them all kinds of rights and \ndefenses and privileges and take away from middle sector, the small \nbusinessman, the small doctor.\n  We put into the Record, Mr. President, where an individual doctor up \nin New Jersey--he came before the committee--bought this particular \ncomputer in 1996. He talked about the salesman who bragged in terms \nthat it would last 10 years. Like the old adage regarding the Packard, \nhe said, ``Ask the man who owns one. Go and see these. They will last \nfor years. This will take you into the next century.'' And then he \nfinds, of course, that this past year it broke down. It didn't work and \nhe could not get his surgical appointments straight, and otherwise. So \nhe called the salesman and the company, and they absolutely refused.\n\n  After several weeks he writes a letter and demands, and they still \nrefuse. A couple of months pass and he gets an attorney. When he gets \nthe attorney, at first they don't respond. But somehow the attorney, or \nothers, had the smarts to put it on the Internet. The next thing you \nknow, they had 17,000 doctors who were similarly situated, and the \ncomputer company immediately settled and replaced them free.\n  When the demands were first made, they said, ``Yes, we can fix it for \nyou for $25,000,'' when the instrument itself, the computer, only cost \n$13,000 in 1996. But to fix it was $25,000. He didn't, of course, have \nthe $25,000. So all of those cases were settled to the satisfaction of \nboth parties, the computer company, and everything else.\n  So these are not bad back cases, or some that are indeterminate with \nrespect to injury, pain, and suffering, and a sentimental kind of case \nof a person\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\nhaving lost his job, in that sense, and all that, where you get poor \npeople injured in a wreck; but, on the contrary, responsible business \npeople who operate by way of contract with the company. You see all of \nthese tort things superimposed and you hear them in the conferences say \nit is nonnegotiable, there is a nonnegotiable item here, joint and \nseveral; it is nonnegotiable because under the chairman's onslaught \nhere, it is, ``Let's move, let's vote, let's vote.''\n  I responded to him yesterday. I am a minority of a minority. I am \ntrying to make sense out of a bum's rush. They have all the \norganizations. I have been talking to the trial lawyers about this \nthing. I know all of them, and they have been big friends of mine, and \nthey did respond handsomely last year in the campaign. But I have been \nin it 20 years. In the early eighties, in the Presidential race and \neverything else, I still pleaded the cause and I got no help. So I have \na track record of not just taking a position to help good friends in \nthe trial business, but I have the greatest respect for all those \nfriends, because they are there for the injured parties. They are the \nones setting the record on health. These trial lawyers have done more \nto save people from cancer than Koop and Kessler put together. I have \nbeen on the floor 33 years now, and we could not get anything moving on \ncancer and smoking.\n  Now we have it. Not only on account of dollars, not only on account \nof the Cancer Institute, not only on account of the American Cancer \nSociety, all leaders that they are with concerns in this field, but on \naccount of trial lawyers. I see them institute the Environmental \nProtection Agency and institute the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  When you see those cars recalled, yes. That trial lawyer, Mark \nRobinson, out there in San Diego, back in 1978 got a $128 million \nverdict. It was $3.5 million actual, but $125 million punitive. He \nnever has collected a red cent of the $125 million punitive. But he has \nbrought to the automobile manufacturers a conscience rather than a \ncost-benefit study to just write it off and let them pay and pay the \nlawyers, and pay the doctors, and pay for the injuries, or beat the \ncase on a cost-benefit study. On the contrary, there was one company \njust last week that recalled another million cars. You see these car \nrecalls. That is my trial lawyer friends. I am very proud of them.\n  But in this particular case I am trying to protect on the one hand \nthat small doctor, that small businessman, or, on the other hand, what \nwe are trying to do is protect the States and the administration of \ntort law.\n  They talk about the ``glitches''--the ``glitches'' and ``deep \npockets'' and ``deep pockets.'' We have at this minute, as I speak, on \nthe floor of the Senate, glitches. Everybody has a computer. It comes \nup again and again with a glitch. You learn how to get it fixed. Nobody \nis running down to the courthouse. There were only 40 more cases this \npast year. Deep pockets--you have people running around here. They had \na gentleman come in here from America Online. I saw in the USA Today \nhis income last year --just annual--income $325 million. He has deep \npockets. But nobody is suing him. He is a wonderful, brilliant \nindividual who deserves every dollar he makes. I am for him. That is \nthe American way.\n  But there are deep pockets in this technology computerization \nindustry. And there are glitches.\n  Don't give me this stuff about January 1 glitches, glitches all of a \nsudden, and that we have to change the whole tort system. You can go \nahead and get your computer now. As Business Week shows, they are \ndemanding that the small businessmen come about with the changes in \ntheir equipment and become Y2K compliant, or else they are going to run \nout of suppliers and other distributors that will be Y2K compliant. \nThey are in business. They are not in the law game that the Chamber of \nCommerce is in downtown. That is their political gain--to get them, \npile on, find a nonproblem, but find the organizations, go tell all of \nthem, and say, ``Do you believe in tort?'' ``Yes. I believe in tort \nreform.'' ``Write your letters to the Senators and talk about $1 \ntrillion''--outrageous estimations. There is not going to be any such \nthing. Everybody knows it.\n  I am happy today to receive from the White House a ``Statement of \nAdministration Policy.'' ``This statement has been coordinated by OMB \nwith the concerned agencies.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Statement of Administration Policy--S. 96--Y2K Act\n\n                    [McCain (R-AZ) and Frist (R-TN)]\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 96 as reported by \n     the Commerce Committee, as well as the amendment intended to \n     be proposed by Senators McCain and Wyden as a substitute. If \n     S. 96 were presented to the President, either as reported or \n     in the form of the proposed McCain-Wyden amendment, the \n     Attorney General would recommend a veto. The Administration, \n     however, understands that Senators Kerry and Robb and others \n     are working on an amendment in the nature of a substitute \n     that would address its primary concerns and which the \n     Administration can support.\n       The Administration's main goal is to ensure that all \n     organizations--private, public, and governmental--do \n     everything they can between now and the end of this year to \n     ensure that their systems and those of their customers and \n     suppliers are made Year 2000 compliant. The Administration \n     also recognizes both the importance of discouraging frivolous \n     litigation and the need to keep the courts open for \n     legitimate claims, especially those brought by small \n     businesses and consumers with limited resources to press \n     their cause.\n       The Administration's overriding concern is that S. 96, as \n     amended by the McCain-Wyden amendment, will not enhance \n     readiness and may, in fact, decrease the incentives \n     organizations have to be ready and assist customers and \n     business partners to be ready for the transition to the next \n     century. This measure would protect defendants in Y2K actions \n     by capping punitive damages and by limiting the extent of \n     their liability to their proportional share of damages, but \n     would not link these benefits to those defendants' efforts to \n     solve their customers' Y2K problems now. As a result, S. 96 \n     would reduce the liability these defendants may face, even if \n     they do nothing, and accordingly undermine their incentives \n     to act now--when the damage due to Y2K failures can still be \n     averted or minimized.\n       S. 96 also would substantially modify the procedural law of \n     the 50 States by imposing new pleading requirements and by \n     effectively requiring nearly all Y2K class actions to use \n     Federal certification standards. While the Administration \n     could support the adoption of certain federal rules that \n     would, in some meaningful way, help identify and bar \n     frivolous Y2K lawsuits, the broad and intrusive provisions of \n     S. 96 sweep far beyond this purpose and accordingly raise \n     federalism concerns.\n       The Administration has been working with the Senate on \n     alternatives that would more closely achieve the goals S. 96 \n     purports to serve--creating incentives for organizations to \n     be Y2K compliant, weeding out frivolous Y2K lawsuits, and \n     encouraging alternatives to litigation. In that regard, the \n     Administration would support provisions encouraging \n     alternative dispute resolution, and carefully drawn \n     modifications to pleading rules and substantive law that \n     encourage Y2K readiness. The Administration would support \n     Senators Kerry and Robb's amendment because it satisfactorily \n     addresses many of the previously mentioned concerns (although \n     we are working with the Senators to address drafting issues \n     raised by the Department of Justice).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  There it is, Mr. President. We are trying to mushroom a nonproblem \ninto a crisis with $1 trillion worth of lawsuits all on the political \njuggernaut of the Chamber of Commerce downtown for greed, and taking \naway rights to protect the group that is not only protectable--God \nknows they have the money--but they know it. They can bring in their \ninstrument right now and make it compliant.\n  Those who are purchasing are being told, like that doctor in New \nJersey, that it is compliant. But they are being taken advantage of. \nYou find out it is not, and it is not until they have everybody ready \nto go that, ``Oh, no. We are ready to give you a new computer free.'' \nNot $25,000, as they charged for months, but they would have to be paid \nbefore they get any results. ``We are glad to give you this free, and \neven to pay your attorney fees.'' Right or wrong? Is this a frivolous \nlawsuit, some kind of bad back, injured party case coming across trying \nto go after deep pockets? It is legitimate small businesses that can \nwork right now. They will be like an automobile dealer trying to \noffload their old year models, with misleading purchases sometimes. But \nthey find out that hasn't paid, so they have gotten very competitive.\n  This market this minute is very, very competitive. Read Business \nWeek.\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\n The market is working. But there is a political agenda here on course, \nnot really to look out for the small businessman, but change the rights \nof the States under the 10th amendment to administer tort cases. Here \nwith the administration, do you see any States coming up and saying \nthat they are totally inadequate, that they can't handle it, that what \nthey really need is the Federal Government to interpose and change the \nrules of jurisprudence?\n  Does any State come up here? Does any legitimate legal organization \ncome up here? Not at all.\n  I heard what the distinguished Senator from Oregon read about the \nAmerican Bar Association, but give us hearings before the American Bar \nand give us the legal folks--they understand law. That is one of the \ndifficulties we have in the Commerce Committee. We don't necessarily \nhave profound legal talent, so they don't want to study it. They look \nat a business cost-profit standpoint and then it is the bum's rush for \nS. 96.\n  I am glad the rush now has stopped with the policy of the \nadministration and the recommended veto of S. 96 and the McCain-Wyden \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as always, the Senator from South Carolina \nhas raised a number of important issues. I will take a minute or two to \nrespond.\n  First, it needs to be understood by the Senate that, under the \nsubstitute offered by the chairman and myself, a plaintiff can file \nsuit immediately for injunctive relief should they choose to go that \nroute.\n  There have been all kinds of discussion raised and I gather it is \nalways raised by the administration that somehow the rights of \nplaintiffs are being cut off. The fact of the matter is, under the \nsubstitute being offered by the Senator from Arizona and myself, it is \npossible for a plaintiff to move for injunctive relief immediately.\n  What we are saying is, we ought to look at ways to try to bring about \ncorrections in the private sector by private parties coming together, \ntrying to encourage the alternative dispute resolution, a process which \nis clearly laid out in our legislation.\n  Our substitute makes it very clear that if a plaintiff wants to file \na suit on day one, they can. If they believe they are being jerked \naround in the marketplace, they can go out on that very first day and \nseek injunctive relief. We think it would be preferable and avoids \ncausing this bedlam with everybody rushing to court. We think a lot of \nthose approaches can be resolved by the parties coming together.\n  Second, it seems to me those who will look at the substitute will \nunderstand in the vast majority of instances private contract law is \ngoing to govern. In most other instances it will be State law. In this \nadministration statement, the notion is that somehow we are \nfederalizing everything, where the substitute clearly lays out in the \nvast majority of cases contract law is going to take the lead in this \narea. That, regrettably, is a part of the administration's position \nthat simply is not accurate.\n  In fact, I and others raised that issue in the committee. We felt \nthere wasn't a strong enough bias in favor of protecting private \ncontract law. That was a change made after the bill left committee, \nbecause a number of consumer and other organizations thought it was \nvery important.\n  I think what is especially troubling about the policy statement that \nhas now been offered by the administration--and this Senator and others \nare going to continue to work with them--is that they are essentially \ntelling the Senate that over in the Justice Department they know more \nabout the technical issues of running computers and the software \nbusinesses than do those businesses that have to do it every single \nday.\n\n  The administration statement says this legislation is going to \ndecrease the incentives, that these computer and software and other \ntechnology organizations have to be ready to assist customers to be \nready for the transition of the next century.\n  The fact of the matter is, all of these groups that have to actually \nwork with computers and software every single day believe this \nlegislation is absolutely critical to their being ready for the \ntransition to the next century. Essentially what we have is folks at \nthe Justice Department on this issue saying they know a whole lot more \nabout the technical issues of the computer business than the folks who \nactually have to work with these systems every single day.\n  I raise this issue again with respect to defendants who engage in \ntruly outrageous, egregious action. There have been statements made on \nthe floor by others and raised in the administration's letter as well \nwith respect to the question of proportional liability and particularly \nwhat you are going to do about those defendants who engage in \nfraudulent activity.\n  Under the substitute before the Senate, if a defendant is engaged in \nfraud, it is very clear that joint and several liability stays in \nplace. There are no changes whatever with respect to joint and several \nliability if, in fact, a defendant is engaged in an egregious type of \nconduct. We also ensure that joint and several liability is kept when a \ndefendant is insolvent. We felt it was important to make sure the \nplaintiff would have an opportunity to be made whole in instances where \nthere was an injured party who badly needed a remedy.\n  The fact is that there have been many, many changes made in this \nlegislation since it left the committee. In order to be responsive to \nthe consumer, the chairman of the committee reached out to a variety of \nparties--myself and others--in order to make those changes. I will take \na minute or two to outline a couple of those.\n  Perhaps the most important is the fact that this is a bill with a \nstrong sunset provision. Neither the original McCain legislation nor \nthe Hatch-Feinstein legislation, which has many, many good features, \nnor the legislation that our colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, \noffered, which also has many good features in it--none of those bills \nhad a sunset provision originally.\n  We felt it was important to make sure that this legislation was not \nproducing a set of changes for all time but it was going to be \nlegislation that specifically targets problems directly related to Y2K \nso we don't have an open-ended onslaught with respect to product \nliability issues.\n  I happen to think the Senator from South Carolina made a number of \nimportant points with respect to tobacco. I also happen to think there \nwere other issues that were relevant on this debate. I and others in \nthe other body were able to get the tobacco executives under oath to \nsay that nicotine was addictive which certainly helped to open up this \nissue in order to protect consumers and injured parties. I think the \nSenator from South Carolina makes a number of important points with \nrespect to the issue of lawyers who stand up for injured parties and \nconsumers.\n  Make no mistake, colleagues, this is not an open-ended tort reform \nbill. It is not an open-ended product liability bill. It is essentially \na 3-year bill to deal directly with a problem that, frankly, could not \nhave been envisaged at the time. At the time many of these decisions \nwere made, there was a real question as to whether there would be \nadequate space for disks and for memory, so there was an engineering \ntradeoff adopted a number of years ago to get more space for disks and \nmemory. We find it hard today to believe that at one point disk and \nmemory space was at a premium. It was at that time.\n  Now we are in a position where we have to come up with ways to ensure \nwe make our computer and technology systems ready for the next century \nwhile at the same time providing a safety net when, in fact, there are \nreal problems such as frivolous suits.\n  I hope our colleagues will look at the many changes that have been \nmade: The fact that there is joint liability when a defendant knowingly \ncommits fraud, there is joint liability when you have an insolvent \ndefendant in order to make a plaintiff whole, that there are punitive \ndamages when an individual acts in bad faith, that there are not new \npreemptive Federal standards for establishing punitive damages, that \nthere has been an elimination of the vague Federal defenses for \nreasonable efforts.\n\n  I hope our colleagues will look at those changes that have been made. \nI, for one, am going to continue to work with the administration. I \nthink there\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\nare many in the administration who realize this is a very, very serious \nproblem. But I really have to say to the Senate today, with respect to \nthe policy statement issued today, that there simply are a number of \nstatements in there that, to be charitable, are inaccurate. The fact \nis, this idea that under our substitute injured persons are having \ntheir rights to sue cut off is simply wrong. Under our substitute, a \nplaintiff, an injured consumer, can go out and file a suit immediately \non the very first day.\n  Under the McCain-Wyden substitute, if you feel that you are a wronged \nparty, you can file a suit the first day. We just do not think, as a \nmatter of public policy, that is a particularly good idea. We would \nlike to encourage parties to work together in the private sector. That \nis what we seek to do through the 90-day period. That is what we seek \nto do through the alternative dispute resolution system. But for those \nwho think it is important to basically have the right to sue \nimmediately, our legislation does that. We do it in a way that \nprotects, first and foremost, contract law rather than writing whole \nnew Federal standards to govern in this area.\n  Finally, and this is perhaps the area where I have the strongest \ndisagreement with what the administration has offered today, I find it \nvery, very far-fetched to believe that there are folks in the Justice \nDepartment who know more about the technical issues of helping those in \nthe technology sector get ready for the 21st century; that those folks \nwould know more about this technical job we have in front of us than \npeople who have to do it every single day in my home State of Oregon \nand across the country. Those are folks who right now, every single \nday, come to work saying, What are we going to do about working with \nour suppliers? What are we going to do about individuals overseas who \nmay have been slow to get ready for Y2K? Those folks know a whole lot \nmore about the challenge of getting ready for the 21st century than do \nthe folks in the Justice Department.\n  I hope we listen to those folks across the country in the small \nbusinesses, in the grocery stores and hardware stores, who, by the way, \noverwhelmingly support this substitute. We have had discussions about \nsomehow the grocery stores and the hardware stores and others are ones \nthat are not supportive of this legislation, who feel their rights are \nbeing cut off. The fact is they are overwhelmingly in support of this \nlegislation.\n  A lot of my colleagues, I guess, are saying: Where do we go from \nhere? Is it just going to be impossible to move forward? I am not one \nwho shares that view. I think there is a centrist coalition in the \nSenate that very much wants to get a responsible bill that meets the \nneeds of consumers and injured parties, and is also concerned about \npreventing bedlam in the private marketplace next January. We have been \nmeeting on an ongoing basis for several days now. We have had some very \nthoughtful ideas presented. Senator Dodd has some important \nsuggestions; Senator Hatch, Senator Feinstein, and others have made \nreal contributions. I understand our colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry, continues to negotiate on several of the issues that are \noutstanding.\n\n  So I am very hopeful that with the continued leadership of Tom \nDaschle and Trent Lott on this issue that we can continue to work \nthrough some of the outstanding issues. I have tried to respond this \nmorning to areas where I think the administration is simply off base \nwith respect to what the McCain-Wyden substitute is all about, but I \nwant to make it clear I remain open to working with them.\n  But I would say now is the time for the Senate to deal with this \nissue. If we let this go on, if we just let it fester and take months \nand months and months and arrive at no resolution of this problem, I \nhappen to think we may well be back here early next January for a \nspecial session of the Senate having to deal with this problem. There \nis not a Member of this body who wants that result. Let us continue to \nwork together.\n  I plan to continue to negotiate with all the Senators I have \nmentioned this morning, and will continue to try to be responsive to \nthe concerns raised by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nalthough I think in the end it is quite clear we have a difference of \nopinion on this legislation. But this bill is too important to just \nsay: This is it, the end, the administration has given its opinion and \nlet's move on.\n  I think we have an opportunity to proceed under the McCain-Wyden \nsubstitute. We have made nine major changes that were requested by \nvarious organizations to be responsive to areas where they thought the \ncommittee bill was inadequate. We have made it clear we are open to a \nvariety of other suggestions. Senator Dodd, in particular, has offered \nseveral which I think are very important and ought to be addressed. I \nhope the Senate will continue to work in a bipartisan way to deal with \nthis issue, because the time to deal with it is now and not next \nJanuary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4325-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4325-S4330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 96, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 96) to regulate commerce between and among the \n     several States by providing for the orderly resolution of \n     disputes arising out of computer-based problems related to \n     processing data that includes a 2-digit expression of that \n     year's date.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 267, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Lott amendment No. 268 (to amendment No. 267), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Lott amendment No. 269 (to amendment No. 268), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Lott amendment No. 270 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 267), in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Lott amendment No. 271 (to amendment No. 270), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I take a moment on the pending issue before \nthe Senate. The year 2000 litigation reform proposal has certainly been \nthe subject of a lot of discussion over the last couple of days. As the \nranking Democrat on the committee chaired by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, Robert Bennett, we have spent the last couple of years \nlooking at this issue--intensely the last year and a half. We have held \n18 or 19 hearings on the subject of this computer bug problem and its \npotential effect not only on our own economy but the global economy and \nthe disruptions it would cause in the lives of average Americans, in \neverything from flying airplanes to operating elevators, emergency \nrooms in hospitals, schoolrooms and classrooms, the functions of small \nbusinesses that depend upon computer data information today to maintain \ntheir businesses.\n  A legitimate area of concern has been raised regarding potential \nlitigation surrounding this issue. I, for one, am very supportive of \npassing legislation to try to minimize the tremendous cost of lawsuits \nthat could ensue for a number of years as a result of this anticipated \nbut undealt with problem.\n  I won't go into how the Y2K issue emerged. Suffice it to say that it \nwent back to economies of scale a number of years ago when computers \nwere in their infancy and we were trying to save space in developing or \nprogramming computer information. Rather than list all four digits, \nwhich took two more spaces, only two spaces were used, ending with the \nlast two digits of the year rather than including all four digits. The \nassumption was, years ago, that modern technology would take over, the \nold computers would be replaced, and that new information would include \nthe millennium, therefore solving the millennium problem.\n  As we painfully know, with some 245 days to go now before January 1 \nof the year 2000, that is not the case. Not only has this problem not \nbeen erased in terms of the date issue, but the embedded chip problem \nmakes this a confounding issue.\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n  Had it not been for Senator Bennett of Utah calling out to all of the \nMembers to get involved in this question, and my involvement with him \nafter his initial interest in this in the Banking Committee where we \nexamined financial institutions, I don't think we would have done as \ngood a job getting the Federal Government and the country as a whole as \ninterested in this subject matter as it is today. As our reports have \nindicated, we are actually in very good shape in many areas.\n  However, there is the potential problem of litigation. Some estimates \nindicate that the cost of litigation surrounding the year 2000 problem \ncould be as much as $1 trillion. That may be an exaggeration. No one \nknows for certain how big a problem this may be in terms of clogging up \nour courts--primarily with companies suing companies, I presume, in \ncontract litigation--over failed businesses or machinery that didn't \noperate as advertised.\n  There are several bills before us. We are trying to work out our \ndifferences, to see if we cannot put together a proposal here that \nwould attract broad, bipartisan support of legislation that will do \nseveral things.\n  First of all, it tries to avoid litigation altogether. I think this \nis common of all the various proposals. I do not have each one of them \nin front of me, but all the proposals try to have some waiting period \nor some means by which a plaintiff and defendant could see if they \ncould resolve the issue which had prompted the litigation in the first \ninstance. I think that is a wise inclusion here. We ought to do \neverything we can to avoid litigation and the cost to defendants and \nplaintiffs. So I commend the authors of those provisions for trying to \nminimize the cost.\n  We then try to insist upon some specificity in the allegations, so \nplaintiffs would have to lay out in some detail what the charges are, \nwhere the shortcomings are, giving defendants an opportunity to know \nwhat they have been charged with. It sounds like a simple enough \nrequest, but in the past we have had a serious problem where merely \nbroad, vague allegations were enough to prompt litigation that could \ntie up individuals for years and cost literally thousands, in some \ncases millions, of dollars to the defendants when, in the final \nanalysis, there was a lack of proven culpability. So we are requiring \nsome specificity in the allegations.\n  We are also talking about trying to reduce the probability of class \naction lawsuits, particularly in an area which is primarily contract \nlaw. But in order to do that, there is a sense of proportional \nliability here, which is something we included in the securities \nlitigation reform bill--which passed this body and the other body \nsubstantially a few years ago and ultimately, after an initial veto, \nwas passed over the President's veto by the Senate and the House--and \nthe uniform standards legislation which followed thereafter.\n  The proportional liability idea is one of basic fairness. It says \ndefendants ought to be brought into a lawsuit based on the percentage \nof their alleged culpability, not based on the depth of their pockets \nfinancially. If a company is 10-percent responsible for the problem, \nthey ought to bear 10 percent of the cost of liability. In fact, the \ncases prove that too often what has happened is we have plaintiffs--\ntheir attorneys--who go out and seek out the companies with deep \npockets that may have had little or nothing to do with the issue but, \nbecause they are affluent potential marginal defendants, they get \nbrought into the litigation. If there is a successful result on the \npart of the plaintiff, then that marginally involved defendant, under \nthe joint and several provisions of most of our law in this area, no \nmatter how marginally involved, are responsible for the full cost of \nthe lawsuit, paying the awards.\n  Again, I appreciate the lawyers who want to have that. I understand \nthat is one way to get paid. But in fairness to those companies which \nare only marginally involved, it does not seem to be a very fair way to \nproceed.\n  There are some very legitimate issues people raise about trying to \ncome up with some modified version of the proportional liability \nprovisions. They may have some value. I am still listening to their \narguments, but I am not yet convinced that is such that we need to \nmodify it in this kind of bill.\n  The argument they make, and it has some appeal, is that in dealing \nwith the year 2000 litigation, it is fundamentally contract law. Unlike \nsecurities litigation or litigation in product liability or other \nareas, in contract law the notion of proportional liability may not \nhave as much meaning as it would in other areas. So there is some \nargument. There is an argument being made that you may have a more \ndifficult time reaching offshore companies that are major computer \nproducers, manufacturers, software manufacturers and producers. That \nargument, again, has some appeal. It has not yet persuaded this Senator \nto support any moderation in the proportional liability sections of \nthese bills.\n\n  The last series of ideas I would like to see incorporated--and I am \nprepared at the appropriate time, if we get to it, to offer an \namendment, I hope with several of my colleagues who share these views--\nis we ought not, in my view, have any caps on punitive damages except \nin the case of small businesses and municipalities. I do not think a \ncap on punitive damages is needed in this area. We are not talking \nabout personal injury matters here; we are talking about contract law. \nI understand for smaller businesses that could be a huge problem and \nput them out of business--on a small lawsuit, destroy them. And for \nmunicipalities where taxpayers end up paying the costs of these \nburdens, I think most of our colleagues will accept those arguments.\n  The second is to try to raise the limits or lift the limits on the \ndirectors' and officers' liability. In this area, I also do not think \nthere is a need for caps on the amount of liability a director or \nofficer should pay in a successful plaintiffs' suit dealing with Y2K \nissues.\n  I say that because when we passed the disclosure act a year ago, \ndealing with the year 2000 legislation, we provided in that legislation \na safe harbor for forward-looking statements by the officers and \ndirectors and managers of these businesses. It seems to me that \nprotection plus the general business rule which protects business \nleaders from the kind of frivolous lawsuits that some might envision \neliminates the necessity for having a cap on directors' and officers' \nliability in this area. So I include in my amendment lifting the cap on \nthat issue.\n  Last is the issue of the state of mind question, which is the one \nthat is a little more thorny for people. This can get rather arcane and \nesoteric, but it is an important issue. Presently, under the bill \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, which is the bill before us, the \none that is on the floor, and I believe under the bill offered by my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch and others, that would have a state \nof mind that would require that it be--I think clear and convincing is \nthe standard that is used. I may be wrong on one of those, but I think \nit is in the McCain bill.\n  The argument there is that we used clear and convincing as a standard \nwhen we did the full disclosure bill. If we used it there, why not \ncontinue using it here? We used it there because we wanted to protect, \nin a sense, and encourage the leaders of industry and business to \ndisclose to each other where they were in the Y2K remediation efforts. \nSo, candidly, it was to make it more difficult for someone to sue an \nofficer or director of a company that was reaching out to its clients, \nto its fellows in the business community, its peers, by sharing \ninformation. So it was part of the incentive of the Disclosure Act to \nget that information out.\n  The reason I am uneasy about including clear and convincing in this \nbill is because I can see some who want to bring lawsuits on income-\nrelated matters where it may actually be more of a product liability \nissue, it may be a tort issue, but the defendant will say it is an \nincome issue.\n  So, even though the plaintiff is not thinking about the Y2K problem, \nthe defendant will use the Y2K defense, raising the bar to clear and \nconvincing and make it very difficult for that plaintiff to be able to \nbring an action which has little or nothing to do with the year 2000 \nissue.\n  I also think we established in the securities litigation area a \nlesser standard. In fact, I know we did, in clear and convincing. It \nseems to me that by using the standard we used in the securities \nlitigation area, we will be adopting a standard in a more parallel fact \nsituation than the disclosure bill of last year, and one that has \nalready proved to be successful in winning a lot\n\n[[Page S4327]]\n\nof support in this Chamber and in the other body. It has become the law \nof the land. We now have a few years of experience of that standard in \nplace.\n  Clear and convincing opens up a new door that we do not know, quite \nfrankly, where it goes.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this proposal on the \npunitive caps on the directors' and officers' liability, with the \nexceptions that I have mentioned, when and if I get a chance to offer \nit, and on the issue of state of mind.\n  That may not be enough. I am sure there will be other amendments \nothers may want to offer. But I think if you have a bill that roughly \nincorporates what I described to deal with the year 2000 problem, we \ncan pass a bill with a substantial bipartisan vote; it can go to the \nHouse and go to the President's desk, which I am confident he will sign \ninto law.\n  I know the administration and I know the President and the Vice \nPresident care about this issue. They think it is important. We have a \nresponsibility to act. This issue is not as galvanizing, obviously, as \nthe issue surrounding the tragedy in Kosovo or the tragedy in Colorado. \nClearly, those are two issues which this Senate must debate and \ndiscuss, in my view.\n\n\n                     Tragedy in Littleton, COLORADO\n\n  We ought to be talking about ways in which we can minimize the \ntragedy that occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO.\n  I want to hear my colleagues' ideas on what we can do as a country. I \nam suspicious of quick legislative solutions to what provoked and \ncaused the loss of 13 lives in that tragedy in Colorado, but \nnonetheless, I want to hear a good discussion of what my colleagues are \nhearing from their constituents across this country as to how we, as a \nlegislative body, can make a positive contribution to help this country \nnot only come to terms with what happened a week ago, but how we can do \neverything in our power to minimize the recurrence of that tragedy.\n\n\n                                 Kosovo\n\n  Secondly, on Kosovo, clearly there the events, as they are unfolding, \nindicate that we are on the right track. It is not a perfect policy, \nbut I am proud of the fact that my country is standing up for the \nrights of human beings who have been treated so poorly, to put it \nmildly, by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic.\n  It was almost 60 years ago yesterday that a ship called the St. Louis \nleft Europe with one-way tickets. Many who are part of the families of \nsurvivors or survivors of the Holocaust will know the name of the ship, \nSt. Louis.\n  That ship sailed from Europe with a boatload of passengers, all of \nwhom were Jewish. They were bound for Cuba. When they arrived at Cuba, \nonly 28 of them were allowed to come ashore.\n  Unfortunately, our country denied that ship the right to enter U.S. \nwaters. Rather than being a one-way ticket to freedom and avoiding the \nhorrors of the Holocaust, the St. Louis was forced to return to Europe, \nand all those passengers on that boat faced the fate of the Holocaust.\n  This Nation and the nation of Cuba at the time turned its back on a \nshipload of people seeking freedom. Sixty years later, Mr. President, \nwe are confronted with a human tragedy that, I argue, is not on the \nmagnitude of the Holocaust but of a significant magnitude where 1.5 \nmillion people have been tortured, have been executed, have been \ndisplaced because of the appetites of one individual and those who \nsupport him in Serbia.\n  It is not easy to stand up. It is not easy to build coalitions. It is \ncostly to be involved in this. In my America, we stand up for people \nwho face that kind of a problem, and when we can do so with 18 other \nnations standing with us, bearing the cost in proportional ways, to try \nto right this wrong, then I think it is something of which all \nAmericans can be proud.\n\n  It is legitimate to have a debate over the execution of this \nconflict, how it is being prosecuted, who is doing what and how fast it \nis occurring, whether or not we should have ground troops or whether or \nnot the airstrikes are performing and achieving the desired results. I \nthink we are on the right track. We ought to have a debate on that as \nwell. It is healthy to have that kind of discussion.\n  I do not mean to say Y2K is not important. Hardly so. I think it is \nvery important. It is an issue we should resolve in this body, come to \nterms with, try to pass it here, and send the bill to the President for \nhis signature. If we do not, we will regret deeply what may happen, and \nwe will look back and wish that we had taken the short time we need to \npass a bill that will allow for this problem to be avoided. I also hope \nwe will get to the issue of Kosovo, get to the issue of Columbine High \nSchool and the tragedy in Colorado, and discuss and debate how we think \nwe can respond to those issues as well.\n  Mr. President, I see the arrival of my colleague from California. She \nmay not be ready to say something at this moment. I thank the Chair and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Arizona?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the \nexamples of how S. 96 would deny justice to businesses injured by a Y2K \nfailure that have been offered by the ranking member. In particular, \nthe example of a company called Produce Palace has been raised a number \nof times. In fact, the owner of that business testified before the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Let me respond to the specific charges with the specific facts of \nthat case and dispel the notion that S. 96 would make that business' \nsituation even worse.\n  The small businessman who owns Produce Palace has testified \nfrequently regarding the problem he had with a computerized point of \nsale system, including a credit card scanner which would not accept \ncredit cards with expiration dates of ``00.'' He asserted his situation \nwould somehow be worsened by S. 96. The facts are to the contrary. The \nsituation would be better with the passage of S. 96.\n  Although he complains that S. 96 would require a 90-day waiting \nperiod, his lawsuit against the cash register system company was not \ncommenced for over 2 years after the problem occurred. S. 96 would \nrequire that he provide 30 days notice to the company of the problem. \nThis notice period does not foreclose emergency action for temporary \nrestraining orders or similar extraordinary court involvement where \nwarranted.\n  Although he communicated back and forth with the company responsible \nfor his problems over many months, under S. 96 the company would have \nhad to respond by the end of the 30 days, and fix the problem within \nanother 60 days. He could have begun suit at the end of the 60-day \nremediation period if the problem was not fixed, and not continued to \nbe strung along for months and months.\n  Additionally, most of the Produce Palace damages were suffered from \nlost profits and business. These losses may or may not be covered in \nhis contract with the equipment provider. If those issues are included \nin a contract, then the contract terms prevail. If not, he would have \nevery right to secure a new cash register or new credit card ``swipe'' \nmachine so his business could proceed during the interim. This is \nsomething he apparently did not do under the current law.\n  S. 96 would not affect his right to sue if the problems were not \nfixed in a timely manner. In fact, he would have been able to sue much \nmore quickly than he actually did. More to the point, under S. 96 \ndefendants are encouraged to fix problems, and quickly, so that Mr. \nYarsike's problems would have been alleviated more quickly and without \nthe drain on his energy and financial resources that litigation \nentails.\n  We are sending a letter to Yarsike explaining to him this aspect, and \nwe certainly look forward to his response, if there is any \ndisagreement.\n  The second area that I will talk about is proportionate liability. \nProportionate liability is one aspect of the bill that has caused some \nconcern among my colleagues. I quoted this morning from a paper by the \nProgressive Policy Institute concerning the impact of Y2K litigation, \nand that same paper also discusses proportionate liability.\n  The Progressive Policy Institute paper says:\n\n       It is also extremely important that defendants be held \n     liable for only their portion of the fault by eliminating \n     joint and several liability. Given that computers and \n     electronic products pass through many hands before they are \n     finally sold, sourcing the liability like this will be that \n     businesses that had no role in causing the problem will not \n     be held accountable. To demand that a business with little \n     complicity in a dispute provide the lion's share of \n     reparations only because they have the deepest pockets or \n     because they are the last ones left standing, would simply be \n     unfair.\n\n  The other issue I will discuss is the financial impact of litigation. \nIt costs everybody money. It raises the cost, goods, and services. Here \nare a few examples. Twenty percent of the price of a ladder, 50 percent \nof the price of a football helmet is attributable to liability and \nlitigation costs. The cost of defensive medicine used to help avoid \nmalpractice liability has been estimated at $50 billion annually. These \nkinds of costs will result in higher costs of technology goods and \nservices.\n  These increased costs to consumers make technology a potentially more \ndivisive element in our society, dividing the haves and have-nots, \nthose who can afford technology, goods, and services versus those who \ncannot. Seminars on how to try Y2K cases are well underway. \nApproximately 500 law firms across the country have put together Y2K \nlitigation teams to capitalize on this event.\n  Let me just give you a sample of the Y2K litigation cost estimates:\n  The year 2000 computer bug is expected to cause some disruptions, \neven if 95 percent of computer system problems are corrected. Problems \nwill dramatically worsen if only 85 percent or 75 percent of the bugs \nare found. Ninety-five percent corrected/best-case estimate: U.S. total \ncosts (to replace and repair software and systems and pay for \nlitigation) $90 billion; 85 percent: U.S. total costs: $500 billion; 75 \npercent, which is the worst-case: $1.4 trillion.\n  The source of that information is Capers Jones of Artemis Management \nSystems.\n  The amount of legal litigation associated with the year 2000 has been \nestimated by the Giga Information Group to be $2 to $3 for every dollar \nspent on fixing the problems. With the estimated size of the market for \nthe year 2000 ranging from $200 billion to $600 billion, the associated \nlegal costs could easily near or exceed $1 trillion.\n  Mr. President, the effects of abusive litigation could further be \ncurbed by restricting the award of punitive damages. Punitive damages, \nas we all know, are meant to punish poor behavior and discourage it in \nthe future. However, this is a one-time event. The only thing deterred \nby excessive punitive damages in Y2K cases would be remediation efforts \nby businesses.\n  I have managed a number of bills on the floor of the Senate, some of \nthem more controversial than others. It is the rarest of occasions when \nwe have seen a situation where amendments are not even allowed to be \npropounded and debated and voted on.\n  It is not clear to me why we can't move forward with the legislative \nprocess. We have a bill that was reported\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\nout of committee. We have made several changes to it, as is normal \nbetween the time a bill is reported out of committee and when it gets \nto the floor. I know there are significant objections by the \ndistinguished Democrat leader, Senator Hollings, of the Commerce \nCommittee. I do not quite understand why he wouldn't come forward, \npropose an amendment, et cetera.\n  Now we are playing parliamentary games with motions to recommit and \ncloture motions. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, who I have \ngreat respect for, why don't we just amend, vote, and move forward on \nan issue that all of us realize is very, very important to the future \nof this country? The year 2000 is not going to wait.\n  I have never, in 13 years in the Senate--and many of those years, \nfrom 1987 to 1995, spent in the minority--come to this floor and tried \nsome parliamentary maneuver such as I just saw. Never. I do not think \nit is the proper way we should conduct business here in the Senate.\n  We are going to have a cloture vote tomorrow. I believe we will get \n60 votes. If we do not get 60 votes, then I believe we ought to have \nanother cloture vote a day or two later and another cloture vote a day \nor two later and another cloture vote a day or two later. Because we \nought to find out, Mr. President, who is really interested in curing \nthis problem and who is interested in blocking legislation on behalf of \nthe American Trial Lawyers Association.\n\n  I hope the Senator from Massachusetts will withdraw this foolishness \nthat he just went through. I hope the Senator from Massachusetts will \npropose an amendment on anything that has to do with this bill, and we \nwould debate it and vote on it. That is the courtesy that I used to \ngive my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when I was in the \nminority.\n  I want to repeat, never once, never once did I propose a motion to \nrecommit followed by a cloture motion, nor have I seen it here in this \nbody that often, especially when we are dealing with an issue of this \nimportance.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 293 To Amendment No. 292\n\n   (Purpose: To regulate interstate commerce by making provision for \n dealing with losses arising from year 2000 problems, related failures \n that may disrupt communications, intermodal transportation, and other \n                 matters affecting interstate commerce)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 293 to Amendment No. 292.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that we have to go through this. \nIt was chosen to attempt to recommit this important bill back to the \ncommittee. As a result of that action, it is not only impeding but \nmaking very difficult our progress on the legislation.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and I have done battle on the floor of \nthe Senate in an environment characterized with respect and \nappreciation. I do appreciate and respect the commitment that the \nSenate from Massachusetts makes to a variety of issues. I have not seen \nanyone on the floor who is committed as much as he is and willing to \ncome to the floor day after day in advocacy of the issues that he \nbelieves in--health care, minimum wage, and many others. I hope the \nSenator from Massachusetts and others on the other side of the aisle \nwill allow us to move forward with this legislation, whatever \namendments they wish to propose, or amendments on this side, that we \ncould have open debate and move forward.\n  With that commitment, I will move that we remove the cloture motion, \nif we have that commitment from the other side.\n  I hope we can move forward. Apparently, we will not. But it is not \nthe way the American people expect us to do business.\n  There is a little book we hand out to people when they come here to \nthe Capitol and we give to our constituents. It is called, ``How Our \nLaws are Made.'' Our laws aren't made this way. This isn't the way we \ndescribe it to the American people. The way we describe it to the \nAmerican people is a bill is reported out of committee, it comes to the \nfloor, the amending process takes place, and we then continue to final \npassage of the legislation and to a conference and come back to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  This is not that procedure. I do not think the schoolchildren will \nlook very favorably on this kind of exercise that we are going through \nnow. I appeal to the better angels of my colleague's nature that we \nmove forward with this very important legislation as quickly as \npossible.\n  I note the presence of the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments of the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The bill before us is the Y2K liability legislation, which is time \nsensitive, which has bipartisan support, which would allow for a \nprocess for small business individuals and others who might be talked \ninto Y2K computer problems, to deal with the problem without winding up \nwith the typical lawsuits being filed.\n  That is what this is really all about, trying to deal with the \nliabilities that could be facing a lot of people inadvertently, or \nbecause they don't have the ability to deal with this problem, to find \na way to deal with the problem, and not just, as is the idea of a lot \nof people, just to provide an avenue for a lot of lawsuits.\n  I had hoped we could have amendments on the subject and maybe \nsubstitute amendments by others. There are two or three different bills \nthat are very close in this area. I thought we could deal with the \nsubject matter and move forward. In a show of good faith, I wanted to \nleave those options open, and I didn't completely ``fill up the tree,'' \nas it is described around here, and offer a lot of amendments to block \neverybody, to see if we really had a good-faith intent of dealing with \nthis important legislation. There are a lot of small business men and \nwomen, and businesses in general, who are very interested in this \nlegislation and know it needs to be done, and they know it could be \ndone in a bipartisan way.\n  But my show of good faith has been rewarded with an amendment that is \nunrelated and is intended to change the subject to fulfill an agenda \nthat has been developed on the other side. They had the opportunity and \nthey took advantage of it. That, I think, is a tragedy, but that is the \nway it goes around here. I have learned a lesson. If we are going to \npass legislation, whether it is on bankruptcy or financial \nmodernization, FAA reauthorization, or this legislation, Y2K \nlegislation, which is important, I am going to have to take actions to \nblock irrelevant, nongermane amendments that are just part of a \npolitical agenda.\n  Having said that, I move to table the motion to recommit the bill and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I advise Members that in about 10 minutes we \nintend to have a recorded vote. I give Members notice that a vote is \nimpending.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue with the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I regret that we have to use this procedure. \nBut we are hoping that we can see an agreement reached with regard to \nY2K. I know there is a bipartisan effort underway on this important \nissue. It is timely. I hope that Members will work together this \nafternoon and tonight, and that we can find a way to come to a \nconclusion on it.\n  The Social Security lockbox also is an issue that we think is very \nimportant which we need to be talking about and find a way to actually \nachieve that goal. This will give us an opportunity to discuss that \nsome more.\n  I want to say to Senator Daschle publicly what I have been saying to \nhim privately. It is not my intent, and I will not be used to prevent a \ndiscussion in a reasonable period of time--we talked about week after \nnext--with regard to school violence, how you deal with that. I think \nit is appropriate after a reasonable period of time to have a debate \nand have votes on amendments. I suggest that we would do it on the \nJustice bill. If for some reason that bill is a problem, we will find \nsome other vehicle, and I am sure there will be amendments with a lot \nof different ideas of how we try to deal with this problem.\n  I am not sure we can solve what has happened in Colorado here. But we \nwill have a chance to have a discussion and have a debate and have \namendments.\n  I said to Senator Daschle that we are going to do that, and he and I \nwill work together to find a way to do it and to have amendments \ndealing with school violence.\n  I don't want this to become a laundry list of all kinds of other \nissues. But the Senate needs to be heard, and needs to have an \nopportunity to debate and vote on those issues dealing with school \nviolence. How we try to address that--we will find a way to get that \ndone.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just for a question for the leader to \nclarify, yesterday I think the understanding was that it would be his \nintent to bring this bill to the Senate floor 2 weeks from yesterday.\n  Is that the current intention?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my intention. To give you an example of what might \nhappen, though, it is possible that the supplemental appropriations \nbill would be ready that day. It depends on when the House acts and \nwhen the Senate is able to get to it. If we have to do it a day \nearlier, or a day later, I don't want the Democratic leader to think it \nwould have to be something he and I agree on. Barring something that \nmight happen, we will do it on that Tuesday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to comment on developments over \nthe last couple of days in particular, and the vote that we just had \nspecifically. There are two issues here. I want to touch on both of \nthem.\n  The first issue has to do with our desire to reach some \naccommodation, some agreement on Y2K. I have said it publicly and \nprivately, I think this is a serious issue. I believe there is a way \nwith which to resolve this matter. But I don't think it does any of us \nany good, or the industry any good, or our country any good to pass a \nbill out of the Senate knowing it will be vetoed. I don't know why we \nwould do that.\n  I have heard the argument, ``Well, we can clean it up in \nconference.'' Mr. President, I don't know why we don't clean it up \nhere. We have as clear a letter as any I have ever seen from this \nadministration which says the current draft will be vetoed. I don't \nknow how you get any more definitive than this.\n  If we were serious--and I really believe that there are a number of \nserious and well-intentioned Senators who want to see this resolved--I \nthink this is the test of seriousness, because I believe that the \nSenators who truly want to see an accomplishment rather than an issue \nwill take this letter seriously.\n  I am very hopeful that in the not too distant future we will see some \nfinal agreement that will allow us to vote on an overwhelming basis on \nthis issue. I want to support it. Most of us will support it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the minority leader yield for a quick \nmoment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding. I want to \nthank him for his patience in an effort to try to make this legislation \nresponsible and fair to prevent damage to our economy.\n  I also want to tell him that we have made exceptional progress in the \nlast couple of hours, particularly in dealing\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\nwith the number of those issues that were raised in the \nadministration's letter.\n  I really commend Senator Dodd for all of his efforts. As you know, he \nis the senior Democrat on the Y2K Committee. He has done yeoman's work \nover the last couple of hours, particularly on the issue of punitive \ndamages, which is the issue raised by this administration, and also on \nevidence standards to make sure that you are fair to the consumer and \nto the plaintiff. Senator Dodd has worked very closely with the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee and myself, Senator Hatch, Senator \nFeinstein. It is a bipartisan group.\n  We are going to continue to work in the spirit that the leader has \ntalked about. As a result of the progress in the last few hours, I \nthink we have gone a considerable distance toward meeting the leader's \nobjective.\n  I thank the leader for yielding me the time, and also for his \npatience in this effort.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of people--Senator Wyden, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Edwards, Senator Dodd, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Robb--as the Senator has noted, who deserve great credit for \nmoving this process along. There are a number of Senators who are \nactively engaged in an effort to bring this matter to closure. I am \nvery hopeful we can do that.\n  Let me talk about the second matter, the procedural question. Senator \nKennedy offered an amendment, as is his right, through the recommittal \nmotion simply because he has no other recourse. This is illustrative of \nan array of frustrations the Democratic Caucus has about the procedure \nused in each and every instance in which a bill has come to the floor \nthis session of Congress. This is the 28th of April and we have yet to \nhave one amendable vehicle on the Senate floor.\n  I have a great deal of affection for the majority leader, but I must \nsay, I think he should have run for Speaker because I really believe he \nwould be more comfortable as Speaker. I have said that to him, and I \nthink he would acknowledge he would much rather have a Rules Committee \nin the Senate than the current rules. When I become majority leader, \nmaybe I will have that same feeling.\n  However, in the Senate, we have always prided ourselves on open, free \ndebate. We lay a bill down, offer amendments, have tabling motions, \nhave second-degree amendments, and we have a debate. We call ourselves \nthe most deliberative body in the United States, if not in the world, \nand I believe we have a right to that distinction. How can we be \ndeliberative when every time we bring a bill to the floor, we fill the \nparliamentary tree, denying anybody a right to offer an amendment?\n  There is a pent-up frustration and a pent-up pressure to have the \nopportunity to vote, to have the opportunity to offer amendments on key \nquestions. This happened to be the minimum wage. The distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts said he will pull the amendment if we \ncan reach some agreement, if we can get some final solution here in \nsolving the problem of Y2K. If we can solve it and if we can reach \nagreement, he will pull this amendment. He made that request and that \noffer. That is more than I get on many occasions. I have to thank the \nSenator for that.\n  However, we will continue to see as many challenges and as many \nsignificant breakdowns in the effort to reach, with some comity, a \nsolution procedurally and a solution substantively of the issues we \nwant to address in the Senate as long as we fill the tree on each and \nevery occasion.\n  We just did the Social Security lockbox. What happened? The majority \nleader filled the tree and, in filling the tree, once again denied the \nminority the right to offer even a single amendment.\n  I am very hopeful we can resolve this matter, but the way to resolve \nit is to do what we are supposed to do, to do what we are paid to do \naround here. We come to the Senate with ideas. We come to the Senate \nwith a bona fide appreciation of the differences of opinion that exist \nin the Chamber, even within our own caucuses. I am exasperated, \nfrustrated, mystified that here in the Senate we are not allowed an \nopportunity to have a free and open debate. If amendments are \nundesirable, table the amendments; if the amendments can be improved, \nimprove them with a second-degree. But to deny Democratic Senators--and \neven Republican Senators, for that matter--the chance to amend a bill \nis not acceptable.\n\n  I am hopeful we can find a way to resolve this. If we can't, I will \nput the Senate on notice that we will use other recourses if we have \nto. I don't want to have to do that. However, there are ways to \nrespond, to reciprocate, if we are going to be gagged. Committees are \nmeeting with our approval; we don't have to do that. There is an array \nof other tools we can use to demonstrate our frustration, and we will \nresort to those if we have to.\n  I hope we can come to a point where we don't have to do this. We can \ntake up issues that are offered in good faith, debate them, amend them, \ndispose of them. We can do that on Y2K as we are doing today. We can do \nthat on a lot of other issues, and we must.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I can speak only of your predecessor, the Democratic \nleader, Senator Mitchell. I know during one Congress he used this \nprocedure one time during a 2-year period. This has been used, to my \nknowledge, on every bill that has been brought up this session; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unless there is a unanimous consent agreement, it has \nbeen used on virtually every occasion.\n  Mr. REID. My understanding is this procedure, when the Democrats were \nin the majority, was used rarely; is that true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not have the statistics the majority leader \nreferred to. The majority leader showed me the list of occasions when \nfilling the tree was something that Democrats resorted to when we were \nin the majority. We go back to 1977 to find the first time, and we have \nonly used it, according to his own list, on a handful of occasions \nsince 1977. Over the last 20 years, Democrats may have used this \nprocedure 5 times--5 times in 20 years.\n  This procedure has been used five times in 1999. We will have a lot \nmore to say about the extraordinary utilization of this concept of \nfilling the tree and how undemocratic and unfair it is to the process \nand to the institution itself. We have to find a way to fix it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the majority leader yield? Pardon me; wishful \nthinking on my part. Will the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I recently ran for the Senate. One of the main reasons I \nran was the ability of Members to amend bills. I have always admired \nthe Senate for this. The House has become nasty and partisan. It has \nbasically shut down.\n  I want to thank the minority leader for voicing the frustration that \nso many Members have. During the impeachment proceeding, we worked \ntogether. Since then, it seems to me that comity is gone. There is no \nability for Members on either side of the aisle who have ideas to offer \nthem. We may lose them.\n  The frustration that so many felt in the wake of Littleton--we had \nideas which we thought wouldn't solve the problem but might ameliorate \nor reduce the chances of future Littletons--of not being able to offer \nthose amendments was enormous.\n  Has the process thus far this year evolved so we are virtually no \ndifferent from the House?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We have created a Rules Committee of one. I think it is \nunfortunate. They have a Rules Committee in the House. \nConstitutionally, the House was designed differently than we are. We \ndon't need a Rules Committee in the Senate. Somebody made the comment, \nI think it was the distinguished assistant Democratic leader, the \nreason our Senate is so family friendly is that we are not doing \nanything. If we did something, maybe we would not be so family \nfriendly.\n\n  I think it is time we do something, we try to resolve these matters. \nLet's move on and allow Senators the opportunity to express themselves \nin amendments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is for a question. I appreciate the Democratic \nleader taking to the floor. I want to use this opportunity to ask him a \nparticular question.\n  The Democratic leader and the Democratic caucus have an agenda of \nissues. The Republican leader and the Republican caucus, they have \ntheir agenda of issues. This is good. This shows the people our vision \nfor this country. One of the things that occurred when the Senator from \nMassachusetts offered the minimum wage increase as an amendment here, \nor asked the bill be recommitted so we could vote for it, was that the \nmajority leader was very unhappy with this and said something to the \neffect--I am not quoting verbatim, but something to the effect--he even \nused the word ``tragedy''--it was a tragedy this was occurring on this \nbill and that this is not a time for one party to put forward its \npolitical agenda.\n  I ask my leader this question: Isn't it totally appropriate that each \nside here, Republicans and Democrats, has a chance to put forward their \npolitical agenda? The Senator from New York talked about his race. I \nhad a race that was very difficult. I can assure my friends on both \nsides of the aisle, it was based on real issues. It was not some \ntheoretical race. It was about the minimum wage, it was about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, it was about equal pay for equal work, it was \nabout the environment, yes, and schools and education.\n  So the question is, I would love to ask my leader what he thinks \nabout our agenda, whether it is pressing? I think the majority leader \nsaid this bill is timely. It is; that is true. But is our agenda not \ntimely as well?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California raises a very good question. \nAbsolutely, our purpose is to present our agenda. That is why we are \nhere.\n  That does not mean to the exclusion of the Republican agenda. \nObviously, we ought to have a good debate about both agendas. But you \nneed that debate. You need that opportunity. How do you have that \ndebate? Not just by talking but by offering legislative proposals: the \nminimum wages, Patients' Bill of Rights, school construction, Social \nSecurity, Medicare reform. Those are the things we are here to vote on \nand work on, and we need the opportunity to do that.\n  We can do it the easy way or the hard way. We can do it by allowing \namendments and having a good debate, by having some agreement about \nwhat the schedule will be, or we can force these issues by offering \namendments and by having to defeat cloture and by doing all the \nprocedural things we have had to do now for so long. By the time we set \naside all the procedural time we have spent, we could have had a good \ndebate on the minimum wage or the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The majority leader has said we will bring up the Patients' Bill of \nRights. He just said we will bring up minimum wage. He has now said we \nwill bring up juvenile justice. So we are making progress. But I think \nthe time has come to drop this procedural stampede that we find every \ntime on the part of the majority when we want to offer amendments. We \nhave to quit trying to steamroll these bills without offering due \nopportunity to all Members to offer amendments.\n  I know the Senators from Massachusetts and Arizona are waiting to \nspeak, and I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to first comment on the \nremarks by the Democratic leader, who is a very old and dear friend of \nmine going back many years. I appreciate his frustration and concern. I \nthink he made a very eloquent point here.\n  I point out to my good friend, there is a bit of frustration on this \nside, too. There is no better example than what is happening right now. \nWe have this bill on Y2K, which is time sensitive if there ever was \none, if there was ever a definition of a time-sensitive piece of \nlegislation. We have had it on the floor for 4 days and we cannot get a \nsingle amendment, not one single amendment up on your side of the aisle \nfor debate and voting. I say to the Senator, the distinguished Democrat \nleader, that is what also breeds frustration on this side. Then the \nmajority leader has to file a cloture motion.\n  The Senator hearkened back to previous years when his party was in \nthe majority. I have to tell you, most of the bills we took up, we put \nup amendments. Those amendments were either tabled or agreed to or \nmodified, and we went forward. On this bill right here, we have not had \na single amendment. I begged for the last 4 days: Please come forward \nwith an amendment. In all candor, on that side of the aisle the leader \nhas said: On this bill, all I want to do is kill the bill. All I want \nto do is kill the bill. Then we are forced to go ahead with a cloture \nmotion and a cloture vote.\n  My point to the distinguished Democratic leader is, maybe we ought to \nall draw back a little bit, go back to a period of time where perhaps \nwe were proposing amendments on both sides and they were allowed. I \nagree with the distinguished Democratic leader that we should have \nthese issues raised, I hope in a timely fashion, such as the \ndistinguished Democratic leader has sought to do.\n  I know what the staff is now whispering in the Senator's ear: ``We \nfilled up the tree.'' We filled up the tree because we did not want to \ntake up minimum wage. We wanted to move forward with this bill.\n  I understand and appreciate the passion the Senator from \nMassachusetts has about minimum wage. I do not mind debating the bill. \nBut I would also like to get this bill done, which is time sensitive on \nJanuary 1 of the year 2000. Why there would not be a single amendment--\nas soon as we filled up the tree I said I would be glad to agree by \nunanimous consent we take up any amendment that is germane to this \nbill. I think that would be appropriate.\n  In 4 days, there has not been a single amendment. I am not saying the \nresponsibility is all on that side of the aisle or on this side of the \naisle. I hope we can work out an orderly process. But it frustrates me \nand the people, the small-, medium- and large-size business people all \nover America who are facing this crisis, when we seem to be stuck \nwithout even considering a single amendment on the bill.\n  So I hope the Democratic leader in his frustration, which is \nunderstandable, would also understand that occasionally there is \nfrustration on this side of the aisle as well. Having been in both the \nminority and the majority, I understand, I think, the frustrations that \nare felt there on that side of the aisle.\n  I would like to make one additional comment. I want to express my \nappreciation to Senator Dodd for his efforts on this bill; Senator \nHatch, Senator Feinstein, Senator Wyden, and Senator Bennett. As we \nknow, Senator Dodd and Senator Bennett chaired a very important special \ncommittee on the Y2K issue. They have done a tremendous job. So they \nhave been heavily involved in this legislation.\n\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Hatch have had a longstanding \ninvolvement, and I am very grateful to them for their constructive \ncontributions to this bill. We have had many hours of meetings trying \nto work out very difficult aspects of this issue. Thanks to Senator \nDodd's leadership, along with that of Senators Hatch and Feinstein, \nWyden and Bennett, I think we have an agreement that we will be able to \nmove this issue forward.\n  So I ask again if we could agree on amendments. I understand there \nare about 20 pending, about 10 of them by the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee. If we could narrow down those \namendments, agree to them and agree to have votes, then we could \nvitiate the cloture vote tomorrow and get this thing done.\n  Unfortunately, so far there has been no agreement, there has been no \namendment brought up, and there has been no time agreement. I again \nplead with the other side, if we are really interested in passing this \nlegislation, let's go ahead, agree we stand ready to agree to the \namendments and the time agreements on all of those amendments.\n  Mr. President, again I want to make clearly understood the great \nrespect and affection I have especially for the distinguished \nDemocratic leader. I understand his frustrations. We felt them when we \nwere in the minority, and I hope all of us together can have more \ncomity in this entire process so we can do the people's business.\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, does the Senator from Arizona still have \nthe floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know others have been here, but I have \nbeen here for 2\\1/2\\ hours waiting to speak on the amendment which I \noffered. While I see my friend from Oregon, I do not intend to take a \nvery long time, but I would like to be able to speak about that issue.\n  First of all, just to review where we are, I want to identify myself \nwith the good remarks of my friend from South Dakota, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have printed in the \nRecord the majority leader's schedule for April and for May.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following is a list of legislative items the Senate may \n     consider between now and the Memorial Day recess. As always, \n     this is not an exclusive list and is in no particular order.\n\n     Supplemental Conference Report\n     Kosovo Funding\n     Y2K\n     Ed-Flex Conference Report\n     Safe Deposit Lockbox\n     Budget Reform\n     FAA\n     Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations\n     Financial Modernization\n     Flag Burning\n     Bankruptcy\n     Satellite Users\n     Water Resources\n     State Dept. Authorization\n     Dod Authorization\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In April and May, we have the supplemental conference \nreport, Kosovo funding, Y2K, Ed-Flex, safe-deposit lockbox, budget \nreform, FAA, Commerce-Justice-State appropriations; financial \nmodernization, flag burning, bankruptcy, satellite users, water \nresources, State Department authorization, DOD authorization.\n  Mr. President, do you know what is not on that? Any possible \nopportunity to debate an increase in the minimum wage.\n  We were effectively shut out from any opportunity last year.\n  We raised the issue, and we had to follow a similar process to bring \nthat issue before the Senate. We were denied that opportunity. It is a \nvery simple and fundamental issue of fairness and equity to those who \nare some of the hardest workers in America--11 million hard-working \nAmericans, who go to work every single day, who work 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks a year, and at the end of the year bring home what is less \nthan a poverty wage in the United States of America.\n  Forty-five Members of the Senate have asked this body for an \nopportunity to address this issue so that we can have economic justice \nfor the workers of this country, and what has been the response? Is \nthere any opportunity to look down the road and say, ``In another week, \nor 2 weeks, or 3 weeks, you will have that opportunity''? No. The \nanswer is no, you cannot have an opportunity to raise the minimum wage. \nYou cannot even bring that to floor of the Senate.\n  I have heard a lot of talk about courtesy and about how bills are \nmade here. What about courtesy toward the hard-working men and women \nwho are making a minimum wage, who cannot put bread on the table or pay \ntheir rent? Or, courtesy toward the proud working woman we heard from \njust yesterday who said that she has been unable to go to see her two \ndaughters in the last 3 years because when you make the minimum wage, \nyou cannot afford to take a bus across the country to see them. How \nabout courtesy to them, Mr. Leader, how about courtesy to them? Don't \nthey count? Shouldn't they be on the agenda?\n  Mr. President, I find these arguments rather empty in trying to \nestablish priorities here. I am sympathetic to trying to reach out with \nlegislative solutions to the problems we have before us, but we have \nbeen denied any opportunity to do anything about these 11 million \nAmericans earning the minimum wage.\n  And it is not only on the issue of the minimum wage. Last year we \nbrought up an issue that is on the minds of every working family in \nthis country, and that is the Patients' Bill of Rights--a very \nfundamental idea--that the medical profession, and not an accountant in \nthe insurance companies, ought to be making the decision affecting \nfamilies. That is the heart of the Patients' Bill of Rights. And we \nwere denied the opportunity to consider it on the basis of the merits. \nWe were denied the opportunity to even have a hearing.\n  I hope all of those voices that were out here talking about \n``undermining the spirit of the Senate'' will go back and talk to the \nchairmen of those various committees and say: Give them a hearing, \nreport a bill out, get it to the floor of the Senate, so we can make \nsure that we are going to have clinical trials available to women who \nhave breast cancer or to children who have other dreaded diseases; to \nmake sure people are going to have a specialist when they need it; to \nmake sure people are going to be able to get treated at the nearest \nemergency room; to make sure, if someone has some particular illness or \nsickness, they are going to get the right prescription drugs, not just \nwhat is on an ordinary formulary.\n  It is not very complicated, not very revolutionary, not very \ndramatic. It is not our agenda, not the Democratic agenda. It is the \nagenda of 100 agencies of doctors, nurses, and consumers of this \ncountry who say this is what we need to protect your children, to \nprotect your wives, and to protect your loved ones.\n  But where is it on this agenda? Where do we have the opportunity to \ndebate these issues? Where do we even have the opportunity to say that \nwe will be willing to enter into a time agreement, say, 3 days? We take \ndays and weeks on some issues around here, but are not even given the \nopportunity to have time-limited debate on these issues, which are of \nsuch vital importance to the men, women, and children of this country.\n  Just tell us, majority leader, when we can debate these issues. Give \nus Mondays and Fridays when we are not voting. Give us those days when \nthe Senate has not been working. We will take any time. We will take \nMondays and Fridays. We will take nighttimes. We will take any time. \nBut give us the time, and put these issues on the agenda, because they \nare on the agenda of every family.\n\n  But no. We are denied the opportunity to debate these issues: ``It is \nnot on our agenda, Senator. Don't insult us on our side by trying to \nbring this measure up on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. Don't \ninconvenience the majority that have an agenda here this afternoon. No, \nyou cannot speak, Senator; you cannot speak here this afternoon on your \nparticular amendment. No, no, we are not going to let you do that.''\n  Mr. President, it is the best reason I know why we ought to change \nthis body, why we need men and women in this body who are going to say \nthat an increase in the minimum wage is deserved. An increase in the \nminimum wage is a women's issue--Sixty percent of those recipients of \nthe minimum wage are women. It is a minority issue--nearly 4 million \nAfrican-American and Hispanic workers would benefit from an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, this is something that cries out for fairness. The \nAmerican people support it. But, no, we cannot even debate the issue.\n  I am beginning to believe that the majority refuses to bring it up \nbecause they do not want to vote. We know what is going on, all the \nwhispers: ``Don't let them bring up the minimum wage on the basis of \nthe merits because it's going to be painful for us.''\n  But how much pain does it cause those individuals who are trying to \nprovide for their families tonight? How much pain are they going \nthrough?\n  Still, we heard words on the floor this afternoon about courtesy to \nthe body. We were told about this is not the way of doing business, \nthis is not how laws are made. I was reminded by another Republican \nleader, we ought to be showing good faith, that this is a tragedy but \nthat it is irrelevant material.\n  You tell the 11 million people who are trying to survive on the \nminimum wage that this is what has happened to their purchasing power.\n  We have heard in the wake of the Littleton tragedy about the \nimportance of parents spending time with\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\nfamilies. When you are working two or three jobs at the minimum wage, \nhow much time do you have to spend with your children? That is the \ntestimony these people are giving. They do not have the time to spend \nwith their children.\n  Do you know what the payroll for the United States of America is a \nyear? It is $4.3 trillion. Do you know what the impact of this increase \nin the minimum wage would be? It would be three-tenths of 1 percent of \nthat, and we hear that it is going to add to the problems of inflation, \nthat we are going to throw a lot of people out of work. Mr. President, \n$4.3 trillion, and we are talking about 50 cents a year for more than \n11 million people. Come on.\n  If you do not want to vote for it, do not vote for it. Let's take it \nto the American people and see who they want to represent them. But no. \nJust read the schedule. No matter how much we try, Senator Daschle has \nnot been able to bring those measures before the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me make a final comment, and then I will be glad to \nyield.\n  Mr. President, I underscore my support for Senator Daschle. I \nmentioned very briefly yesterday in our Democratic caucus that just \nbefore I came to the Senate, you did not get a vote in the Senate \nunless you got the nod from the majority leader.\n  But something took place in the 1960s. We had a movement within this \nNation to strike down the walls of discrimination. People said, ``This \nis an important issue.'' The two places these issues were debated and \nconsidered were the federal court--the 5th Circuit--and the Senate. The \ndebate on the war also took place in the Senate--and later, on the \nenvironment, disability rights, and other issues of crucial importance \nto our country. The Senate has been the repository for debate about the \nNation's concerns.\n  One thing that every Senator understands is that everyone is equal in \nthis body. So I cannot accept what the majority leader is saying: ``I \nmake the decisions on this agenda. And no one else.'' That isn't what \nthis body is about.\n  The Senate Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, indicated in a very \npositive and constructive way his willingness to try to work with the \nmajority. This is the way it has been for 36 of the 37 and a half years \nI have been here--when Democrats have been in the majority and when \nRepublicans have been in the majority. But never in that time have we \nhad the leadership saying that one Senator is a lesser Member of this \nbody than another. And that is what is being said, when a Member is \ndenied the opportunity to raise important issues of conscience or of \nconcern to their constituency.\n  They may be able to deny that opportunity on a particular measure. \nThey may be able to prevent someone from speaking for 2\\1/2\\ hours, as \nthey did today. They may eat up another hour of time, as they did this \nafternoon by having a live quorum. That is all part of this process. \nYou can play this nice or you can play it rough.\n  I like to believe, as someone who takes a sense of pride in being \nable to work together with Members on both sides of the aisle, that we \nhave been able to make a difference. That is what the Senate should be \nabout. But if they are going to play it the other way, let them just \nunderstand that we can play it that way too.\n  I suggest my colleagues go back and read the little book by Jim \nAllen. Senator Allen had this place tied up for 7 months--an individual \nMember of the Senate. If they are not going to work this out in a way \nthat respects individual Members, they cannot expect Members to respond \nin the positive tradition of this great institution.\n  Every Member on both sides of the aisle wants to honor that \ntradition. That is what I want to see. Hopefully we can, through the \nleadership of Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, proceed in that way for \nthe remainder of this session.\n  I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator: You have talked about minimum wage. It \nis true, is it not, as you have said, that 60 percent of the people who \ndraw minimum wage are women? Is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. Sixty percent.\n  Mr. REID. For 40 percent of all of these women who draw minimum wage, \nthat is the only money they get for themselves and their families; is \nthat true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Y2K problem is something you and I acknowledge we \nshould resolve; is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. But tell me, isn't it true--you have been the lead Democrat \non the Judiciary Committee; you have been on that committee for many \nyears that is looking to litigation which will transpire as a result of \ncomputers not working properly after the year 2000 hits? Is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct again.\n  Mr. REID. Even though we both acknowledge it is more important \nlegislation, would the Senator tell me why it is important in April of \n1999 that that legislation be completed prior to a bill that would give \nthe 12 million people who are desperately in need of a minimum wage \nincrease?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know there may be some who differ, but I think we \ncould pass the minimum wage and the Patients' Bill of Rights and the \nY2K in a relatively short period of time and do the country's business. \nAs it is we cannot do the country's business, as the Senator has \npointed out, if we can never even reach the minimum wage or the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  In the meantime, we are told by my good friend from Arizona--I wish \nhe were here--that he is frustrated because we have not had an \namendment all week. Well, you know what he is saying? ``We haven't had \nan amendment that the majority can agree to all week.'' He said right \nhere on the floor, ``We haven't had an amendment all week.'' Well, the \nrest of that sentence is: ``that he will permit, to be offered.''\n  That is not what this place is about. I really am quite surprised \nthat a Member of the Senate would interpret the rules that way.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator outlined graphically the Patients' Bill of \nRights. And it is important that we do something about that. But is it \nnot also true, in relation to the Patients' Bill of Rights, that all \nover this country managed care entities are dropping senior citizens?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. REID. There are senior citizens now who have chosen to go off \nMedicare, who are now without any managed care, without any ability to \nget health care; is that right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. There are some who say, once you go off Medicare, then you \ncan't go back on for a certain period of time.\n  And now there are hundreds of thousands of them in the country who \nhave been dropped from the managed care entities. Don't you think our \ndoing the Patients' Bill of Rights is important to the senior citizens \nof this country?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. An opportunity to debate the \nprescription drug issue is also important to our senior citizens. I \nknow the Senator is home just about every weekend, and I am sure that \nwhen he meets with senior citizens they raise, in an almost unanimous \nchorus, their concerns about prescription drugs. I daresay they think \nwe ought to be addressing that issue in the Senate.\n  When I go home and meet with workers, they are concerned about the \nminimum wage, they are concerned about the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nthey are concerned about prescription drugs. Sure, the legislation \nbefore us is important, but then I look at this agenda and wonder, \nwhere are the issues the people at home care about?\n  It is important that we have the opportunity to debate and discuss \nthese issues. We are denied that opportunity now.\n  Mr. REID. One last question I will ask the Senator.\n  Based on your experience and my experience, is it a fair statement to \nsay that on our agenda items we may not win every one of them, we may \nnot prevail on every one of them, but wouldn't it be nice, I ask the \nSenator, to be able to debate the issue of the minimum wage, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, the\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\nother things we believe are important? Win or lose, wouldn't it be \ngreat if we could have the opportunity to explain to the American \npeople and the Members of this Senate why we feel strongly about an \nissue?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I could not agree with you more, Senator. And, \ntragically--tragically--the Republican leaders were able to kill the \neffort to consider the minimum wage here today. I do not know why they \nwill not even give us an opportunity to debate and vote on the merits \nof the issue.\n  I hope that we are able, through the efforts of our leader working \nwith the majority leader, to agree on a process that gives these \nissues, and others that are important to our colleagues, their day on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a brief moment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be very brief.\n  I have been on the floor with the Senator for 2 and a half hours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the Senator has.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I am proud that I was able to take that time to do \nit, because by my presence I wanted to show the support I feel for what \nhe is trying to do. I am a person who represents the Silicon Valley, \nthe high-tech people. I want to solve the Y2K problem. I know my friend \nis a leader on technology in his State.\n  We want to do the right thing. I have praise for his colleague, \nSenator Kerry, who I think is doing a terrific job, working to come up \nwith a solution some of us would prefer and, by the way, the \nadministration prefers.\n  I want to pick up on this notion of time sensitive, because it is \ntime sensitive that we do this. It doesn't have to be done today or \nnext week, but it is time sensitive. Certainly, we have to do it in \ntime to resolve the problem.\n  But there are a lot of things that are time sensitive. Isn't it time \nsensitive when a family can't pay the bill? Isn't it time sensitive \nwhen, as the Senator says, a woman can't afford to take a Greyhound bus \nto see her children? Isn't it time sensitive that under current law a \n12-year-old can walk into a gun show and buy, essentially, a \nsemiautomatic assault weapon? There are a lot of things that are time \nsensitive.\n  In many ways, it is as if the majority leader has the corner on what \nis time sensitive. As my friend says, it depends on who you talk to.\n  Frankly, the people I am talking to must be similar to the people you \nare talking to. These are bread-and-butter issues. It is safety in \nschools. It is a Patients' Bill of Rights, the quality of health care, \nmany, many issues, Medicare, Social Security, that we want to take up, \nin addition to the business issues that the majority leader wants to \ntake up.\n  I ask my friend, isn't time sensitive a term that we could apply to \nall of the issues that are on the agenda of the Democrats here in the \nSenate under the leadership of Leader Daschle?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me answer very specifically on the time-sensitive \naspect. If we do not increase the minimum wage now to 50 cents this \nyear and 50 cents next year, next year the real value of the $5.15 \nminimum wage will be $4.90. So they are going to be worse off. Even \nwith the 50 cent increase, as the Senator can tell from this chart, we \nare still below what we were during the 1960s, all during the 1970s, \nand up through the 1980s, in terms of purchasing power. This last \nincrease was supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Yes, this is time sensitive, because the people who are living on the \nminimum wage are not just holding where they are, they are going down. \nThis is at a time when our nation is experiencing the greatest economic \nprosperity in the history of the world. But we evidently don't have \ntime to debate and act on this.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, after I voted, \nI left the floor before the rollcall was announced on the Senator's \nefforts to bring the minimum wage issue to the floor. Does the Senator \nrecall the vote total that was announced?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We were 55 in favor to 44.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So it was 55----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Moynihan is necessarily absent. It would have \nbeen 55 tabling and 45 against tabling. Every Member of the other side \nof the aisle was for denying the opportunity to consider this and \neveryone on this side of the aisle thought we ought to at least \nconsider it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So it was a straight party-line vote----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Against considering an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I want to ask the Senator: We are considering on \nthe floor S. 96, the so-called Y2K bill, which is designed to protect \nbusinesses. And good, compelling arguments can be made about protecting \nbusinesses. But doesn't this vote suggest that the majority party feels \nthat we should not be discussing help for working families, those in \nthe lower income categories who are falling behind even as they go to \nwork every single day trying to raise their families? That is how I \nread that vote. It is loud and clear.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As mentioned earlier, it is not just today that we have \nbeen refused an opportunity to debate it. I have in my hand what the \nleadership has provided as the schedule for all of April and all of \nMay. We are coming to the end of April now, but there are still several \nitems that haven't been finished in April, and all of May. And nowhere \non this do we have any indication that we will have the opportunity to \ndebate either a minimum wage increase or a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  If the Senator remembers, we were denied the opportunity to debate \nboth of those issues at the end of last year as well, and we received \nassurances from the majority leader that the Patients' Bill of Rights \nwould be considered in an early part of this session. We have had the \nmarkup in our Health and Education Committee, but still there is no \npriority on that particular issue.\n  So the Senator is right. Not only can we not consider that today, but \nit doesn't seem that it will be possible for consideration at any time \nin the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, yesterday we were prepared on \nthe floor to offer an amendment relative to school violence, to try to \nprevent a repeat of the tragedy that we saw in Littleton, CO, and in \nJonesboro, AR, Pearl, MS, West Paducah, KY, and so many other places. I \nbelieve the Senator and I came away with the understanding from the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, that, yes, within 2 weeks we would have \nour opportunity to consider those issues and some legislation to deal \nwith them.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, there is a concern as well \nabout teachers and the President's proposal to try to have more \nclassroom teachers and a smaller student/teacher ratio in grades \nkindergarten, 1, 2, and 3; is that scheduled to be considered under any \nschedule that the Senator from Massachusetts has seen?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, it is not, Senator. You have identified something \nwhich is enormously important and that is the increasing evidence that \nthe smaller the schools--schools where every schoolteacher knows the \nname of every child in the school, and knows the parents--and the \nsmaller the classrooms, the greater the reduction in incidences of hall \nrage, and other types of school violence. This, it seems to me, would \nbe worthy of debate and discussion. If we spent some time, knowing that \nwe will debate that, went back to our States and listened to \nschoolteachers and parents for a few days and then came back and talked \nabout these types of issues, perhaps we could do something that might \nbe useful.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One last question to the Senator--and I thank him for his \npatience in responding--all of us are concerned about Littleton, CO, \nand what happened there and school violence in general. There isn't a \nparent in America who isn't sensitive to that today.\n  The suggestion of a smaller classroom and more personal attention to \nchildren in the early stages of their development suggests to me the \npossibility of spotting a child's problem at an early stage and perhaps \ndealing with it successfully rather than having this child pushed \nthrough the mill, ignored, perhaps not given the personal attention \nthey need.\n\n[[Page S4337]]\n\n  It strikes me that there are so many different pieces to this, \nwhether it is the guns that make these troubled kids so dangerous to so \nmany other people, or the fact that there are troubled children who are \nnot getting the personal attention they need.\n  I join with the Senator from Massachusetts. I hope we can return to \nan agenda that really identifies the priorities of America's families. \nIt is important to talk about Ed-Flex. It is important to talk about \nY2K. But for goodness sake, before we leave at the end of the year, \nshouldn't we talk about the issues that families talk about when they \nare sitting around the table or around the family room watching \ntelevision?\n  I salute the Senator. I hope he will continue with his efforts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know my friend from \nNorth Carolina wants to speak as well.\n  First, as one who strongly supports Senator Kennedy on this matter of \nraising the minimum wage, I think he knows that I have worked since my \ndays as codirector of the Gray Panthers to make sure that senior \ncitizens would get prescription drug coverage.\n  I want him to know that I look forward to working closely with him on \nthese issues. I will, before the Senator leaves the floor, talk about \nwhy this Y2K issue is so important to those low-income seniors, and on \na point that the Senator from Massachusetts has led the fight on. I \nwant to do this briefly.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, I am quite familiar with what \nhe is talking about--health care and some of the other issues that make \na difference. I represent a State that is proudly one of the leaders in \nthis area, and I look forward to hearing what the Senator has to say.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will make this point very briefly. \nOne of the key concerns that senior citizens now have is the problem of \ntaking prescription drugs in the proper way. We have learned a great \ndeal, for example, about how billions of dollars are wasted as a result \nof seniors not being in a position to get good information about drug \ninteractions.\n  One of the ways that we are best able to tackle that problem, and \nsave billions of dollars, in order to make sure that seniors have their \nneeds met in terms of prescriptions is to get some of this information \nonline. This is now just beginning to be done. I submit that it is a \nperfect example of how we should not be pitting the issues relating to \nY2K against those affecting low-income citizens.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right with \nrespect to minimum wage, and I just say that on the basis of even the \nexample I have given with respect to drug interactions among the \nelderly, and the billions of dollars that are wasted as a result of \npeople not being in a position to take their medicine in a proper \nfashion. That is an example of how this Y2K issue really does affect \nall citizens--even on the question of pay. If the computers break down, \nit is going to be hard for folks to get their paychecks early next \nyear.\n  So I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right with \nrespect to the need to raise the minimum wage. And I share his view on \nthe need to help seniors with respect to their prescriptions. But I do \nthink that this question of addressing the Y2K issue in a responsible \nkind of way is beneficial to all Americans, regardless of their income, \nin our country.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from North Carolina. I want \nto wrap up with a couple of comments with respect to issues that \nMembers of my party may have about the Y2K legislation. For example, \nthere are a number of Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle who \nhave been concerned about the question of punitive damages. Well, in \nthe last few hours, we have made substantial progress on this issue. I \nhappen to believe that it is critically important that when you engage \nin egregious conduct, you be in a position to send a very powerful \nmessage with respect to punitive damages on these questions of \nfraudulent activity.\n  In the last couple of hours, a great deal of progress has been made \nwith respect to this issue. Senator Dodd, in particular, deserves a \ngreat deal of credit. These changes that have been made in the last \ncouple of hours with respect to punitive damages respond directly to \nwhat a number of Democratic colleagues have gotten from the \nadministration this morning.\n  The other issue I would like to touch on that was mentioned as well \nby a number of our colleagues on the Democratic side deals with the \nquestion of evidentiary standards. I think it is clear that we do need \nevidentiary standards that are fair to consumers and are fair to \nplaintiffs. In the last couple of hours, again, for Democrats looking \nat this issue, a substantial amount of progress has been made, largely \ndue to the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut. I am very pleased \nto be able to report that those changes have been made as well. \nDemocratic Senators, I think, will be pleased with some of the other \nchanges as well. I know that early on--and I think this was a concern \nthat the Senator from North Carolina, who has been such a valuable \naddition to the Senate, had raised--the bill that came out of committee \ntalked about a very ill-defined defense for defendants, essentially \nsaying if they engage in a reasonable effort, that would in some way \nprovide them with a defense from wrongful conduct. That, too, has been \neliminated.\n  So I am very hopeful that Members on this side of the aisle will look \nat the progress that has been made in the last couple of hours. I want \nit understood that I very much want to work with the Senator from North \nCarolina on the points that he, I know, is going to raise in connection \nwith this legislation. I want to see this bill go forward. I believe \nthere is a coalition on both sides of the aisle that is now prepared to \ncontinue to work in a constructive kind of way to get this legislation \ndone.\n  As one who feels strongly about an increase in the minimum wage, as \none who feels that this Y2K legislation, properly done, has the \nopportunity in it for us to help lower health care costs and make sure \nseniors don't have these drug interactions that hurt them and waste \nbillions of dollars, I hope that in the name of trying to address both \nof those issues the Senate will move forward in a bipartisan way.\n  I will just wrap up, Mr. President, by asking unanimous consent to \nhave printed a letter from the American Bar Association on this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1999.\n     Senator Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: In listening to yesterday's Y2K debate \n     on the Senate floor, we at the American Bar Association were \n     surprised to hear that you and Senator Sessions believe the \n     ABA has issued a report saying, among other things, that the \n     Y2K litigation could affect billions and billions of dollars \n     of our economy. I can assure you that the ABA has not issued \n     a report estimating litigation costs of the Y2K problem and \n     has not taken any position on the pending Y2K legislation. I \n     understand that your misunderstanding comes from the reading \n     of a Backgrounder prepared by the Progressive Policy \n     Institute which cites in turn from an article in the Newark \n     Star-Ledger.\n       The ABA had several programs on the Y2K issue at our 1998 \n     Annual Meeting in Toronto and we had speakers at those \n     programs representing all sites of the Y2K debate. In one \n     program, presented by the ABA Section of Business Law's \n     Committee on Corporate Counsel, there were seven speakers. \n     One of the speakers, Jeff Jinnett, said that ``there has been \n     considerable speculation in the legal and public press that \n     the year 2000 computer problem will generate considerable \n     amounts of litigation.'' He summarizes some of the \n     speculation, including the views of one commentator, who had \n     provided the estimate cited in the Newark Star-Ledger. Mr. \n     Jinnett concluded in his speech that ``we can only speculate \n     as to the actual litigation which will result from the Year \n     2000 computer problem and the cost of the ultimate \n     litigation, since (a) no substantial litigation (other than \n     the Produce Palace, Software Business Technologies, Symantec, \n     Macola, and Intuit lawsuits, discussed below) has been \n     reported to have occurred as of the date of this article \n     based on the Year 2000 problem and (b) we do not know how \n     much necessary Year 2000 corrective work will ultimately not \n     be completed on time.'' In any event, the views he expressed \n     are not those of the American Bar Association and should not \n     be referred to as either our policy position or as coming \n     from an ABA ``study'' ``report.''\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\n       We would appreciate it if you would do what you can to \n     correct the record on this matter. If you have any questions, \n     please let me know.\n       I will be sending a similar letter to Senator Sessions to \n     let him know our views as well.\n       Thank you for any assistance you can provide on this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the Senator from \nOregon, that I have great respect for him. He knows that. He has spent \na tremendous amount of time and work on this project, along with \nSenator McCain, for whom I also have tremendous respect, along with my \ngreat and dear friend, Senator Dodd from Connecticut. All three have \nspent a tremendous amount of time on this issue.\n  I will say at the outset that, from my perspective, I do believe we \nneed to provide the kind of support and help for the high-tech \ncommunity in this country that it so richly deserves. It is a critical \nissue not only in Oregon but also in North Carolina. We take great \npride in our high-tech community, particularly in the Research Triangle \narea of North Carolina. My problem is that I don't think this bill \nstrikes a proper balance. I think it fails to do so in a number of \nways. I will candidly admit that I am not fully familiar with some of \nthe discussions and negotiations going on right now. We will have to \nsee the final product. I only have the bill as it is before us now to \ndiscuss.\n  First, I think there is an enormous problem in doing at least one of \nthe things that this bill does, which is to relieve, in some ways, \nbusinesses and corporations from accountability or responsibility, \nparticularly in a day and age when we as Americans are saying to our \nchildren, to our families, that they need to be responsible for what \nthey do. We need to be personally responsible and accountable for \neverything we do.\n  How do we say to the children and families of America that they are \naccountable and responsible, fully, for everything they do, while at \nthe same time passing legislation in the Congress of the United States \nsaying that a particular slice of corporate America is not fully \naccountable and responsible for what it does? I think the reality is \nthat it sends a terrible message to our children and to our families. I \nthink what they want to hear from us is that every American, every \nchild, woman, family, parent and every business is, in fact, fully \naccountable and responsible for what they do, because we as Americans \nbelieve in personal responsibility and accountability.\n  Now, I want to talk about a couple of things by way of background. \nFirst, we are tinkering here with a civil jury system that has existed \nin this country for over 200 years. Whenever you tinker around the \nmargins with a system with checks and balances, which has been at work \nfor a long period of time, you create an enormous potential for \ntrouble. That is exactly what this bill does.\n\n  The argument is made on behalf of this bill that it will decrease \nlitigation, that it will help with this anticipated but still fictional \nlitigation explosion.\n  The reality is that bill creates a morass of potential litigation. It \ncreates new terminology. It creates new definitions, and it has \ndescriptions of legal avenues that can be pursued that have not existed \nheretofore.\n  The jury system that we have in this country has been developed over \na long period of time. There are many trial and appellate decisions \nthat we can rely on and depend on.\n  This bill creates a whole new genre of litigation and appellate \ndecisions. There will be enormous fights over some of the language in \nthis bill. More importantly, one of the things this bill does is it \ndilutes the jury system. The reality is, if you believe in democracy, \nyou believe in the jury system, because the jury system is nothing but \na microcosm of democracy.\n  Speaking for myself, and I think speaking for most Americans, I have \ntremendous faith--in fact, I would go so far as to say I have a \nboundless faith--in the Americans who sit on juries all over this \ncountry every day who render justice and render fair decisions, fair to \nboth sides, in any litigation. This bill dilutes the responsibility \nthat we give those Americans.\n  I personally have more confidence in regular Americans, North \nCarolinians, farmers, bankers, people who work in stores, people who \nare engaged in all walks of life, who come in and sit on the jury, hear \ncases, and do what they think is right. I have more confidence in them \nthan I do in us as a body trying to impose upon them what we think is \nfair and just across the board. Those juries hear the facts; they hear \nthe circumstances from both sides, and they render justice. They do \nwhat they think is fair and right.\n  Anybody, as I said earlier, who believes and has confidence in \nAmericans who sit on those juries, knows that the decisionmaking should \nstay right where it is--with the jury.\n  Let me talk for just a minute about this Y2K problem, because this is \nnot a new problem. The history of this problem is, I think, greatly \neducational in terms of where we are.\n  If I could look at a chart, the title of this chart is ``Y2K. Why do \ntoday what you can put off 'til tomorrow?\"\n  This is not a new problem.\n  I might add that, along with Senators Dodd and Bennett, I also serve \non the Y2K committee. We have learned a great deal through the hearings \nthat have taken place on that committee.\n  For example, in 1960, Robert Bemer, who was a pioneer in computer \nsciences, advocated the use of a four-digit rather than a two-digit \ndate format. This is now 39 years ago--almost 40 years ago. One of the \npioneers of American computer science said it is an enormous mistake to \ngo to a two-digit system instead of a four-digit system.\n  In 1979, he wrote again, the same Robert Bemer, in a computer \npublication about the inevitable Y2K problems, unless this defect is \nremedied. He warned, ``Don't drop the first two digits. The program may \nwell fail from an ambiguity in the year 2000.''\n  We have known about it for 40 years.\n  In 1979, 20 years ago, he is telling the industry you have to do \nsomething about this, and you have to do something about it now.\n  In 1983, an early Y2K-fix software was marketed and sold in this \ncountry which dealt with the Y2K problem. How many copies of that \nsoftware were sold? Two copies of this software that addressed this \nproblem were sold.\n  In 1984, just 1 year later, ``Computerworld'' magazine said, ``The \nproblem you may not know you have,'' and they warned companies to start \nmaking modifications now--in 1984, 15 years ago.\n  In 1986, there was a publication by another computer magazine where \nIBM asserted:\n\n       ``IBM and other vendors have known about this problem \n     for many years. This problem is fully understood by IBM \n     software developers who anticipate no difficulty in \n     programming around it.''\n\n  Then in 1988, the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nsaid, ``NIST highly recommends that four-digit year elements be \nused''--11 years ago.\n  In 1989, the Social Security Administration's computer experts found \nthat the overpayment recoupment systems did not work for dates after \n2000, and realized that 35 million lines of code had to be reviewed.\n  Finally, in 1996, Senator Moynihan requested the Congressional \nResearch Service report on Y2K. It predicted widespread massive \nfailures. He introduced legislation to create a special office for Y2K \nproblems and to establish compliance deadlines. It died in committee.\n  Finally, in 1999, this year, Bill Gates blamed Y2K on those who \n``love to tell tales of fear.'' At the same time, Microsoft was still \nshipping products that were not Y2K compliant.\n  My point is a simple one. This Y2K problem has been around for 40 \nyears. Those folks who are involved in this business have known about \nit. The truth is that many of the people involved in the computer \nindustry have worked hard at correcting this problem. They have \naddressed it in a very responsible way. Those people will have no \nliability and no responsibility from any failures that occur.\n  The people who I think make up a great deal of the high-tech \nindustry, who have acted responsibly, who have recognized that this is \na problem, who have gone out to the people who they\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\nhave sold their products to, and done everything in their power to \ncorrect this problem, those people have no responsibility. Under the \ncurrent legal system, they have absolutely no responsibility. They \ncan't be held responsible.\n  The people who can be held responsible are those who have known about \nthis problem for 40 years and have done nothing to correct it, and, in \nfact, over the course of the last few years have continued to sell \nproducts that are not Y2K compliant, and are not concerned about the \nresult. They have their product sold. They have their money in, and \nthey have let the people who bought the product worry about the \nproblem, or it would be dealt with later.\n  We have no business in this Senate providing protection for people \nwho have engaged in that kind of behavior. That is exactly what this \nbill does.\n  It has a number of problems in it. Let me just talk about a few of \nthem briefly.\n  First, my friend, the Senator from Oregon, mentioned a few minutes \nago that he thought it was important for punitive damages that we be \nable to send a powerful message to those who had acted irresponsibly \nand recklessly.\n  This bill places enormous limits on punitive damages that can be \nawarded, punitive damages that under existing law--if this bill never \ngoes anywhere, never passes, never becomes law, as I stand here today, \nbusinesses can only be held accountable for punitive damages if they \nhave engaged in reckless, egregious, willful, sometimes criminal, \nconduct. It is the only circumstance in which a business can be held \nliable for punitive damages.\n  My friend, the Senator from South Carolina, who just joined us, is \nfully aware of that. We have an existing law that provides that \nprotection.\n  ``Joint and several liability'' are terms that lawyers use regularly. \nBut they are critically important terms. The terminology that we hear \nused by my friend, Senator Dodd, and Senator Wyden, is ``proportionate \nliability.'' It is very important for the American people to understand \nwhat this bill will do to them if it passes.\n  Let me give an example. A small business man--say a grocery store \nowner--buys a computer system that is necessary to run his business on \na day-to-day basis. This is a family business. The system fails. As a \nresult of the system failing, he is unable to keep his doors open over \na period of 2, 3, or 4 months. All of these businesses operate on very \nshort-term cash flow. They need money, and they need it on a daily \nbasis. If they don't have it because the computer fails, they get run \nout of the business.\n  So we have this family-owned grocery store that has been run out of \nbusiness because their computer system didn't work. Keep in mind, we \nare talking about a regular American who runs a business. These are not \ncomputer experts. They are not experts in lawsuits and litigation. They \ndon't know what they are supposed to do.\n  In my example, they discover that three different companies \nparticipated in making their computer system. So they bring an action \nagainst those three companies to recover for the cost of what happened \nwith their system and for the fact they have now been put out of \nbusiness. Any fair-minded American would say if these companies knew \nabout the problem, knew they had sold them a product that was \ndefective, they ought to be held responsible for that.\n  Joint and several liability says each one of those companies can be \nheld liable and responsible for what happened to this family grocery \nstore. This bill says if for some reason one of those three companies \nis out of business, you can't collect against the other two. Maybe one \nof the three is an offshore company--which will be true on many \noccasions with respect to this kind of case--and you can't reach it. \nThen, because of this bill, you can't reach the other two. This bill \nsays the innocent grocery store owner bears that share of the \nresponsibility.\n  Joint and several liability, which has existed in this country for \n200 years, exists for a very simple reason: It is just, and it is fair. \nWe have a choice: Somebody is going to suffer this damage. Should the \ncost of this damage be paid by the absolutely innocent grocery store \nowner? Or should it be paid and shared by the defendants who were \nguilty? It is that simple. It is the guilty on one side, the innocent \non the other.\n  The question is, Who is going to share in paying for the damage that \nhas been done? Joint and several liability says that responsibility is \nborne by the guilty and is never to be borne by the innocent. That is \nthe reason that system has existed.\n  This bill, first of all, essentially eliminates joint and several \nliability as a starting place. Then it sets up a complex--I am a lawyer \nand I can barely understand what it says--exception which creates \ncertain circumstances where this grocery store owner can make an effort \nto collect some of his money from the other defendants if, in fact, \nthere is an uncollectible defendant. But he has to jump through lots of \nhoops and he has to do it in 6 months, which is the time limitation. \nHaving been in the trenches for 20 years doing these cases, it is \nalmost an impossible task to finish the process of trying to collect in \n6 months.\n  The bottom line is, it creates a very narrow exception and puts the \nburden entirely on the innocent party to jump through these hoops. It \nmakes absolutely no sense. The system that exists in America and has \nexisted for 200 years exists for a good reason. It has been fair and \njust for 200 years. It is fair and just now. There is absolutely no \nreason to change it. It makes no sense to change it.\n  Let me use the chart that my friend, Senator Leahy, referred to \nearlier--and he did a beautiful job of that. Across the top of this \nchart is the present justice system. I want to emphasize for Americans \nwho are listening that no computer company or high-tech company can be \nheld responsible under existing law unless they have acted negligently \nor irresponsibly.\n  Under this jury system that we have in this country today, we have a \nvery simple process. We go through the process of making a claim and \nseeing if they respond to the claim. If they don't, a lawsuit is filed, \nthe case is eventually heard, and there is a result. Or, on the other \nhand, as happens in almost 99 percent of the cases, if the company \nrecognizes that the problem was their responsibility, they pay for it. \nThey settle the case, because they know they have a responsibility to \npay for what they caused. So we have a quick, fair settlement or we \nhave a fair trial. We have a system that is in place and has existed \nfor 200 years and systems that work State by State.\n\n  I have to add to this, I don't know why we as a Senate and as a \nCongress think we are so much smarter than our State legislatures that \nhave passed laws over many years and have court systems that deal with \nthese problems. They are fully capable of addressing this problem. I \npersonally believe if this were an issue, it could easily be addressed \nat the State level.\n  The reality is, the existing system that we have will work. It is \nsimple. It is streamlined. And it will get a fair result for everyone \nconcerned.\n  On the other hand, if we enact this morass that I have in my hand \nright now, what we will have is the biggest mess anybody has ever seen \nin the court system. First of all, all the cases are going to go to \nFederal court instead of State court. The National Judicial Conference \nhas said the Federal judicial system is already overburdened before \nthey ever get these cases. They don't have enough resources; they don't \nhave enough judges. What we are about to do is dump an enormous pile of \nnew cases in the Federal judicial system which they don't want and \nwhich they don't have the resources to handle.\n  We start this complicated process, and without going through all the \ndetails--Senator Leahy has outlined it beautifully--it is one roadblock \nafter another to the innocent party, the grocery store owner, the guy \nwho was put out of business because his computer system wouldn't work \nand he had nothing to do with it. Every time he moves, he runs into \nanother roadblock. He doesn't have the resources to fight this battle. \nIt is a long and tortuous process that ultimately makes no sense.\n  We have a system that works. There is no reason to do this.\n  Let me give an example of problems we create in a bill like this. \nThere is a provision in this bill that says in any lawsuit a defendant \ncan raise Y2K as a\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\ndefense. If you have one business suing another business for a \ncontract--no matter what the claim is about; it could be about \nanything--and the defendant says, wait a minute, this is a Y2K computer \nproblem, all of a sudden you have triggered enormous, procedural, \nbureaucratic hurdles that have to be jumped through. The case goes into \nFederal court. We have this big mess. A tool has been created to \ncomplicate a simple lawsuit that could be over and resolved in very \nsimple fashion.\n  I don't suggest for a minute that the people who crafted this bill \ndon't have the very best intentions. I believe they do. I myself--and I \nonly speak for myself--have no problem with the idea that we ought to \ntry to provide incentives for people who are engaged in disputes to \nresolve those disputes. Alternative dispute resolution, I think, is \nfine. A cooling off, some period when these folks can talk to each \nother and try to work it out is fine. I think, if there is a problem, \nwe want to promote discussion between the innocent person who bought \nthe computer system and the people who make it. I think we want to do \nall of those things. Those are laudable goals. The problem is what we \nhave here is an extremist version of a bill that takes away rights of \nthe innocent party and creates enormous hurdles to that innocent party \nultimately recovering.\n\n  I might add, I think this is unintentional. But the proposal makes \nthe recovery of economic losses virtually impossible. Here is the \nreason. When I say economic losses, for example in my grocery store \nstory, the recovery of the cost of the computer would not be considered \nan economic loss. But the fact that these folks have been put out of \nbusiness and their grocery store is not in business anymore and they \nhave lost the profits they would have made in their grocery store for X \nnumber of years, all because of an irresponsible computer maker that \nwould be an economic loss. Well, in order to recover those economic \nlosses that they had nothing to do with--they are totally innocent--in \norder to recover for those injuries, they have to have a written \ncontract, or a contract that says they can recover under the terms of \nthis bill.\n  Think about that. Use a little common sense here. How many Americans, \nsmall business men, who go out and buy a computer system have been \nthinking about: Well, I better make sure I have a written contract that \nsays if my computer system fails I can recover my losses, my economic \nlosses--my lost sales, my lost profits as a result? The reality is, to \nthe extent there is any contract other than a handshake or walking in \nthe store and buying the computer system, the contracts are drafted by \nthe manufacturers, because they are the ones with the lawyers, a big \nteam of lawyers. They draft these contracts. If anything, they are only \nsigned by the purchasers. So the likelihood that these contracts are \ngoing to have any provision in them for the recovery of economic losses \nis almost nonexistent.\n  The bottom line is this. I think the intention of my colleagues, \nSenator McCain, Senator Wyden, Senator Dodd--I have absolutely no doubt \ntheir intentions are only the best. They want to do exactly what they \nsay they want to do, which is to create incentives for these high-tech \ncompanies to correct these problems and not to create, from their \nperspective, a morass of litigation.\n  The problem is this bill does not do that. I spent many years in the \ntrenches, in courtrooms, fighting these battles. I can respectfully say \nthat I have read the entire bill. It has numerous problems, including \nsome of the ones I have described today. But I do believe we could \nfashion a bill, I say to Senator McCain, who has just arrived--fashion \na bill that would accomplish some of the things they want to \naccomplish, which is instead of going straight to litigation, have \nfolks talking to one another, working out the problem, curing the \nproblems with the computers. That is in everybody's best interests. I \nwant that. I think all of us here in the Senate want that.\n  But it is my belief, having studied this bill and having studied it \ncarefully--and I will concede I have not seen the most recent \ndiscussions because I don't think they have been put in writing yet--\nbut the version we have before us now is completely unacceptable and \ncreates many more problems than it cures. Instead of reducing \nlitigation, I think in fact it creates a vehicle for not only trial \nlitigation but appellate litigation that will go on for many years to \ncome.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator has come to the Senate not \njust as a practitioner, but as a brilliant one, as you can tell from \nhis comments here on the floor of the Senate this afternoon.\n  Is it not a fact that what this really does is create disincentives \nto produce a good Y2K-compliant product--isn't that correct? If \ncompanies know they do not have to worry about making their products \ncompetitive and reliable, they have no incentive to make a good \nproduct. In fact, removing any threat of litigation will remove any \nneed for technology companies and businesses to ensure that their \nproducts and systems are ready to handle the Y2K problem. I have been \nasked by none other than Jerry Yang, the head of the Internet company \nYahoo, to oppose this bill, because Mr. Yang said he will use the fact \nthat companies do not have Y2K-compliant computers when he competes \nwith them.\n  So, isn't it the fact that when you get this kind of obstacle course \nof legalities companies will say: We do not have to worry about the \nquality of the product or whether or not it is Y2K compliant, because \nby the time they can finally get to me, and everything else like that, \non a cost/benefit basis it is better for me to get rid of all these old \nnoncompliant models. I don't mind paying a few lawyers to protect me on \nthese hurdles here. Isn't that the case?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I believe that is the case for that small number of \ncompanies this is all about.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I do believe, and I know my colleague will agree with \nme, that the vast majority of these companies are totally responsible. \nThey want to cure these problems. And in fact, they will cure them, and \nas a result will never be involved in any of this process.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what ``Business Week'' just put out a month ago \nin its March 1 issue. The marketplace was taking care of what problems \ncould ensue come January 1 of the year 2000. All of the blue chip \ncorporations--grocery, manufacturers, automotive dealers--everybody is \nreally concerned if they don't perform and have Y2K compliance, they \nare going to lose the business. The blue-chippers have come around and \ntold their suppliers and distributors and everything else: Unless you \nbecome Y2K compliant, we are going to find a new sales force and \ndistributors and otherwise to handle our product.\n  Really, that is the conclusion to which the ``Business Week'' article \ncame. In fact, the Y2K problem is going to clean out the laggards and \nbring out nothing but good, quality producers. It is not going to be a \nproblem come January 1, because the market is behaving effectively. We \nget extremes like this legislation because the Chamber of Commerce gets \ndown there and starts talking about a trillion dollars' worth of \nlawsuits, and we see entities coming in not knowing really what is at \nissue.\n  The fact is, then having said that, they are way off base in the \nwhole thing with respect to the market itself. And as the Senator \nindicates, the responsible producers in America, they are the best of \nthe best because they are competing internationally with the Japanese \nand everything else. So we have the best producers and they will \ncomply. They want to comply because that is good business. They don't \nwant to get bogged down with lawyers and everything else like that.\n  But a few companies want to have the political crowd in Washington \nthrow up an obstacle course for consumers and small businesses, so that \nthose companies do not have to worry about making good, reliable, Y2K-\ncompliant products.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I agree with that, and I would add, based on my \nconversations with the high-tech companies that do business in North \nCarolina, I am totally convinced they will act responsibly, they will \ndo what they are supposed to do, and I do not think those are the \ncompanies that this bill\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\naddresses or that we are concerned about, in any event.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Isn't that the case? That is why you find the extremes \nof tort law provision in here, and joint and several? The drive really \nis not to take care of the Y2K problem but to take care of what they \ncall the lawyer problem in business. It has brought about the most \nresponsible production in the entire world. We have quality production. \nWe have safe articles on the market. On product liability and \neverything else, they have been coming after us for 20 years. Now they \nhave all joined together, of all people not to hurt, just injured \nindividuals with bad back cases like you and I have handled, but on the \ncontrary, little small businesses, individual doctors who have to have \na computer and have to keep up with their surgery and everything else \nof that kind.\n\n  I cite that because that is the testimony we had before the Commerce \nCommittee. An individual doctor, in 1996, bought a computer. They \nbragged how it was going to last for 10 years and be Y2K compliant. And \ninstead of being Y2K compliant, it was not. He asked for it to be \nrepaired. He went twice to do it. They told him, you might have bought \nit for $16,000, but it is going to cost you $25,000. He didn't have the \n$25,000 to make it compliant. He finally brought a lawsuit, and the \ncomputer industry on the Internet picked it up and before long he had \n$17,000 against this particular supplier. They came around immediately \nand said: We will do it for free for everybody and pay the lawyers' \nfees.\n  That is what we are trying to avoid. But I do congratulate the \nSenator on his very cogent analysis and commonsensical approach and \nexperienced judgment that he has rendered here this afternoon on this \nparticular issue.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I paid attention to the exchange. The \nSenator from North Carolina was not here. The Senator from South \nCarolina was here when we fought for 10 years on a little item called \naircraft product liability. I know the Senator from South Carolina \nfought viciously against that. The whole world was going to collapse if \nwe gave an 18-year period of repose to aircraft manufacturers for \nproducts they built and manufactured.\n  Now there are 9,000, at least, new employees, and we are building the \nbest piston driven aircraft in the world, thanks to that legislation.\n  Ask any of the owners of those aircraft companies and those people \nwho are working there. It is because we finally passed that bill over \nthe objections of the American Trial Lawyers Association which fought \nit for 10 years.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4341-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I wish to express my support for a bill \nthat was introduced yesterday by Senator Jeffords--the Northeastern and \nSouthern Dairy Compact. This bill would reauthorize the Northeastern \nDairy Compact and grant the consent of Congress for a Southern Dairy \nCompact. The Southern Dairy Compact, which has been passed by Alabama \nand 10 other southeastern States, authorizes an interstate Compact \nCommission to take whatever measures are necessary to assure customers \nof an adequate local supply of fresh fluid milk while encouraging the \ncontinued viability of dairy farming within the region encompassing the \ncompact States.\n  The current milk marketing order pricing system does not adequately \naccount for regional differences in the costs of producing milk; \nfurthermore, the Federal milk marketing order system establishes only \nminimum prices for milk. Due to these inconsistencies in milk prices, \nsurplus milk is flooding the southeast and shutting down the family \ndairy farmer. By design, the Federal program relies on State regulation \nto account for regional differences. However, milk usually crosses \nState lines, so courts have ruled that individual States do not have \nthe authority to regulate milk prices under the interstate commerce \nclause of the U.S. Constitution. To account for these regional price \ndifferences, states can gain regulatory authority by entering into a \ncompact. States are now joining these compacts to maintain their dairy \nindustry and are asking us to approve of the legislation they have \nalready passed in their respective states. The support at the State \nlevel has been overwhelming and unanimous and I am hopeful this body \nwill adopt these compacts unanimously as well.\n  The compact benefits everyone. Farmers are assured of more stable \nmilk prices, thereby affording them the opportunity for better planning \nand recovery of production costs. Consumers will benefit as prices for \nfluid milk stabilize in the supermarket. According to the USDA and GAO \naccounting figures, there was a 40 percent increase in the market price \nof fluid milk between 1985 and 1997. According to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the compact established in the Northeast in 1996 \nincreased the income of dairy farmers by 6 percent while maintaining \nprices to the consumer at 5 cents/gallon below the national average \nprice for milk. In addition, OMB found no adverse effect on states \noutside of the compact. The compact is a win-win piece of legislation.\n  Dairy farming is an important industry in my State of Alabama, and I \nam a strong supporter of the family farmer. Their hard work and \ndedication is at the heart of the greatness of this nation. In Alabama, \nthere are more than 2,000 employees in the dairy industry supporting a \n$48 million payroll. Last year, the dairy industry in Alabama generated \na total of $204 million in economic activity. However, recent \nproduction capacity has deteriorated and further decreases may push \nproduction past the point of no return. From 1995 to 1998, milk \nproduction in Alabama decreased by 26 million pounds. The establishment \nof the dairy compact will ensure fair prices to farmers so that they \ncan maintain a profitable level of milk production. The creation of a \ncompact will bring stability to an important industry in Alabama and \nall over the Southeast. Consumers will be assured of fair prices and \nfarmers will be confident in their production decisions.\n  The States have voiced their concerns. The States have developed a \nsolution. It is now our responsibility to stamp our approval onto the \ncompacts which have been passed in States throughout the Northeast and \nSoutheast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4341-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4341-S4342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FUELS REGULATORY RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand in support of S. 880, Fuels \nRegulatory Relief Act, to provide relief for small businesses and to \nincrease security of information from potential terrorists. This bill \nwill specifically exclude toxic flammable fuels from Section 112 of the \nClean Air Act which requires businesses provide public information on \nstored flammable fuels and how they would respond to emergencies should \na disaster occur.\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\n  When the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990, Congress required the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, under Section 112, to provide public \ninformation on a list of 100 substances which might cause injury or \ndeath to humans or adverse effects to the environment in an accident. \nEPA added flammable fuels to this list of 100 substances. This means \nthat people who store and distribute flammable fuels are required to \nprovide public information about their operations and how they would \nrespond to an accident. These Risk Management Plans provide information \non hazards associated with the fuels, safety measures and maintenance, \nand a worst-case scenario with an emergency response plan. This \ndetailed information, although intended to provide citizens near a fuel \nfacility knowledge about their local risks, also provide dangerous \ninformation to potential terrorists. The worst-case scenario \ninformation especially could provide potential terrorists with valuable \ninformation about how to destroy a flammable fuel facility.\n  I recognize the constant struggle between providing public access to \nand security protections of information about flammable fuels. However, \ngiven that public safety is adequately protected through existing \nfederal laws and state building and fire codes, I believe no further \nrequirements are needed. Also people who store flammable fuels are very \nsafety conscious given the unstable nature of the product they work \nwith. The safety record on the storage of flammable fuels is good and \ndemonstrates that current regulatory requirements are adequate. Without \nany clear problem of the existing framework of protections, I do not \nsee why these substances should be further regulated under Section 112 \nof the Clean Air Act.\n  By regulating flammable fuels under this provision of the Clean Air \nAct, fuel distributors might be hurt. For example, distributors might \nreduce their storage capacity of flammable fuels affecting their \nability to meet local customer demands. Also if businesses and farmers \nreduce their stored levels of flammable fuels, fuel switching might be \nencouraged further adversely affecting distributors. This could limit \nthe flexibility and health of these small businesses and farmers. \nBasically, it would ensure that the ``Hank Hills'' of the world (a \ncharacter on the Fox network who is a propane small businessman) are \nnot put out of business.\n  Thus, I trust my colleagues will rise with me to support this bill to \nprovide relief for small businesses and farmers struggling to survive \nwhile ensuring security against disclosure of explosive information to \npotential terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4342-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1034.

Since the cost increase is greater than \n     twenty percent, congressional legislation to reauthorize the \n     project is required; and\n       Whereas, an estimated 1,755 home and business structures in \n     southern Grand Island, with a total value of $219 million, \n     would be protected by the flood control project; and\n       Whereas, the flood control project would also protect 5,385 \n     acres of irrigated farmland and 7,000 to 8,000 acres of \n     grassland; and\n       Whereas, the Nebraska Legislature proposes to the Congress \n     of the United States that procedures be instituted for \n     congressional legislation to include appropriate \n     authorization for the Wood River Flood Control Project in \n     Grand Island, Nebraska; and\n       Whereas, prompt action is essential to decrease future \n     flooding risks, the Nebraska Legislature requests the support \n     and assistance of Congress in permitting this flood control \n     project to move forward in a timely manner: Now therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Members of the Ninety-Sixth Legislature of \n     Nebraska, First Session:\n       1.

The Legislature respectfully memorializes the Congress \n     of the United States to pass, and the President of the United \n     States to sign into law.

and\n       Whereas, Treaties and established trade relations may \n     require pest-controlled grain before grain can be exported; \n     and\n       Whereas, Insect pests in grain without fumigation treatment \n     could create health risks and reduce the quality of the grain \n     marketed from Kansas; and\n       Whereas, Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are cost-\n     effective fumigants used both by commercial elevators and \n     farmers in the storage of grain in Kansas; and\n       Whereas, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     acknowledged few, if any, viable alternatives to the use of \n     aluminum and magnesium phosphide exist for fumigation to \n     control pests in stored grain; and\n       Whereas, The current label restrictions for aluminum and \n     magnesium phosphide provide for the safe and effective use of \n     the product; and\n       Whereas, The State of Kansas practices rigorous enforcement \n     of the label restrictions on fumigants, ensures adequate \n     training of certified applicators and conducts a fumigation \n     and grain storage project to inspect the use of fumigants; \n     and\n       Whereas, Restrictions in the use of fumigations in grain \n     storage and transportation should be based only on sound \n     scientific reasoning, available technology and accurate \n     analysis of risk level and avoid raising undue public alarm \n     over unsubstantiated or inconsequential risk: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Congress of \n     the United\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\n     States direct the EPA to curtail implementation of new \n     restrictions from its reregistration eligibility decision \n     (RED) on phosphine gas that would require a 500-foot buffer \n     zone and other restrictions that effectively preclude the use \n     of aluminum or magnesium phosphide in most Kansas grain \n     storage facilities and grain transportation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Congress direct the EPA to ensure that risk \n     mitigation allowances for aluminum and magnesium phosphides \n     are clearly demonstrated as necessary to protect human \n     health, are based upon sound science and reliable \n     information, are economically and operationally reasonable \n     and will permit the continued use of these products in \n     accordance with the label; and\n       Whereas, The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) was \n     signed into law on August 3, 1996; and\n       Whereas, The FQPA institutes changes in the types of \n     information the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is \n     required to evaluate in the risk assessment process for \n     establishing tolerances for pesticide residues in food and \n     feed; and\n       Whereas, The FQPA was to assure that pesticide tolerances \n     and policies are formulated in an open and transparent \n     manner; and\n       Whereas, The FQPA further emphasizes the need for reliable \n     information about the volume and types of pesticides being \n     applied to individual crops and what residues can be \n     anticipated on these crops; and\n       Whereas, Risk estimates based on sound science and reliable \n     real-world data are essential to avoid misguided decisions, \n     and the best way for the EPA to obtain this data is to \n     require its development and submission by the registrant \n     through the data call-in process; and\n       Whereas, The implementation of FQPA by the EPA could have a \n     profound negative impact on domestic agriculture production \n     and on consumer food prices and availability; and\n       Whereas, The possibility of elimination of these products \n     will result in fewer pest control options for the United \n     States and Kansas and significant disruption of successful \n     integrated pest management programs which would be \n     devastating to the economy of our state and jeopardize the \n     very livelihood of many of our agricultural producers; and\n       Whereas, The absence of reliable information will result in \n     fewer pest control options for urban and suburban uses, with \n     potential losses of personal property and increased costs for \n     human health concerns: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, That the EPA should be \n     directed by Congress to immediately initiate appropriate \n     administrative rulemaking to ensure that the policies and \n     standards it intends to apply in evaluating pesticide \n     tolerances are subject to thorough public notice and comment \n     prior to final tolerance determinations being made by the \n     agency; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the EPA use sound science and \n     real-world data from the data call-in process in establishing \n     realistic models for evaluating risks; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the United States Department \n     of Agriculture (USDA) establish FQPA as a priority and that \n     EPA be required to have reliable pesticide residue data and \n     other FQPA data on the specific crop affected by any proposed \n     restriction, before, EPA imposes restriction of a pesticide \n     under FQPA; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the EPA should be directed by \n     Congress to implement the FQPA in a manner that will not \n     disrupt agricultural production nor negatively impact the \n     availability, diversity and affordability of food; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Congress should immediately conduct \n     oversight hearings to ensure that actions by EPA are \n     consistent with FQPA provisions and Congressional intent; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the Secretary of State be \n     directed to send enrolled copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, the administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Agriculture and to each member of the Kansas \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-67.

Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this body \n     encourage the Congress of the United States to act swiftly to \n     prevent the passage of any such legislation under the ``Know \n     Your Customer'' designation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate is authorized \n     and directed to transmit appropriate copies of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the directors of the \n     Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n     the Office of the Comptroller General, the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision, and all members of the Georgia Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 128\n\n       Whereas, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) was \n     signed into law on August 3, 1996, by President Clinton; and\n       Whereas, the FQPA establishes new safety standards that \n     pesticides must meet to be newly registered or to remain on \n     the market; and\n       Whereas, the FQPA requires the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) to ensure that all pesticide tolerances meet \n     these new FQPA standards by reassessing one-third of the \n     9,700 existing pesticide tolerances by August, 1999, and all \n     existing tolerances within ten years; and\n       Whereas, the FQPA institutes changes in the types of \n     information the EPA is required to evaluate in the risk \n     assessment process for establishing tolerances for pesticide \n     residues in food and feed; and\n       Whereas, the FQPA was designed to ensure that pesticide \n     tolerances and policies are formulated in an open and public \n     manner; and\n       Whereas, the FQPA further emphasizes the need for reliable \n     information about the volume and types of pesticides being \n     applied to individual crops and what residues can be \n     anticipated on these crops; and\n       Whereas, risk estimates based on sound science and \n     reliable, real-world data are essential to avoid misguided \n     decisions, and the best way for the EPA to obtain this data \n     is to require development and submission of such data by the \n     registrant through the data call-in process; and\n       Whereas, the ill considered implementation of FQPA by the \n     EPA could have a profound negative impact on domestic \n     agricultural production and on consumer food prices and \n     availability; and\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\n       Whereas, the possibility of elimination of these products \n     will result in fewer pest control options for the United \n     States and Georgia and significant disruption of successful \n     integrated pest management programs which would in turn be \n     devastating to the economy of our state and jeopardize the \n     very livelihood of many of our agricultural producers; and\n       Whereas, the absence of reliable information is expected to \n     result in fewer pest control options for urban and suburban \n     uses, with potential losses of personal property, damage to \n     valuable recreational areas and managed green space, and \n     increased human health concerns.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of a program under which long-term care insurance is \nmade available to Federal employees and annuitants, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\nfederal civilian and uniformed services long-term care insurance act of \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in support of the need for an initiative \nto help address the growing long-term care needs of Americans, I am \npleased to introduce the Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-\nTerm Care Insurance Act of 1999 in the Senate.\n  The Administration proposed a plan to offer long-term health care \ninsurance to federal civilian employees. Under my bill, the \nadministration's proposal is expanded to include federal civilian and \nuniformed services employees, as well as foreign service employees. \nThis non-subsidized, quality private long-term care insurance option \ncan then be offered at an affordable group rate. It is anticipated that \n300,000 Federal employees and 200,000 uniformed services employees \nwould voluntarily participate in such a long-term insurance plan. With \nsuch participation, the Federal government could truly serve as the \nmodel for employers for long-term care insurance.\n  The bill would make the following groups eligible for the long-term \ncare insurance: Civilian employees after continuously working for the \nfederal government for 6 months, Foreign Service employees, civilian \nannuitants upon retirement, members of the Armed Services, retired \nmembers of the Armed Services, and designated relatives, like parents \nand parents-in-laws.\n  The bill also offers: (1) portability of this benefit regardless of \nfuture federal or military employment as long as the monthly premium is \npaid on a time, (2) a choice of plans to meet the insurer's needs from \nup to three insurance carriers, and (3) a choice of cash or service \nbenefits (such as expense-incurred or indemnity method). Costs for this \nprogram are anticipated to be no more than $15 million for OPM \nadministrative expenses.\n  The price of long-term care is very expensive both in terms of the \nfinancial and emotional burden to families. In 1997, Medicare and \nMedicaid spent $15.4 billion providing home health care to Americans. \nIn that same year, nursing home care cost American taxpayers \napproximately $16.9 billion. What I am proposing is legislating the \nability to maintain self-reliance. The Federal Civilian and Uniformed \nServices Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999 is an important step to \nproviding ``affordable, high-quality long-term care.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 894\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment of Individual \nDevelopment Accounts (IDAs) that will allow individuals and families \nwith limited means an opportunity to accumulate assets, to access \neducation, to own their own homes and businesses, and ultimately to \nachieve economic self-sufficiency, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    savings for working families act\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with the economy in its 9th year \nof record growth, unemployment the lowest its been in over 25 years, \nand the stock market at an all time high, the following is worth \nnoting:\n  Fully a third of all American households have no financial assets to \nspeak of.\n  Another 20 percent have only negligible financial assets.\n  Almost half of all American children live in households that have no \nfinancial assets.\n  Over 10 million Americans don't even have a bank account.\n  In our efforts to foster policies that encourage economic growth, we \nhave not done enough for the group that needs it the most--hardworking \nlow income Americans. We have established tax credits for retirement \nplans, for home mortgages, for college education, and so on, all of \nwhich make for good policy. The problem is that to take advantage of \nthese policies, you must already have some wealth. You must already \nhave some assets. To put it plainly, you cannot benefit from a home \nmortgage credit if you do not have the wealth to buy a home.\n  So the challenge becomes creating a policy that helps low-income \nAmericans reach the point where they can take advantage of these \nbenefits. Any such policy must start with encouraging saving. Saving is \nempowering. It allows families to weather the bad times, to live \nwithout aid, and to deal with emergencies. Saving is also the first \nstep to building assets.\n  And having assets is a prerequisite for taking part in this economy. \nThat is because assets offer a way up. Whether it is a home, an \neducation, or a small business, assets can be leveraged to deal with \nthe bad times and usher in the good. That is why I believe that our tax \npolicies should provide more incentives for asset building.\n  So Mr. President today along with Senators Santorum, Durbin, Abraham, \nRobb, and Kerrey of Nebraska, I offer tax legislation aimed at building \nassets for low-income families. The Savings for Working Families Act is \ncentered around Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), an idea of Dr. \nMichael Sherraden of Washington University: create a savings account \nfor low income workers that can be used to acquire assets, and allow \nthe saver to receive matching funds towards the purchase of those \nassets.\n  The Savings for Working Families Act allows for the creation by \nfederally insured banks and credit unions of IDAs for U.S. citizens or \nlegal residents aged 18 or over, with a household income of not more \nthan 60 percent of area median income, and a household net worth that \ndoes not exceed $10,000 excluding home equity and the value of one car.\n  The federal government will provide tax credits of up to $300 per \naccount to financial institutions to reimburse them for providing \nmatching funds for IDAs. All other sources of matching funds are \nwelcome as well, including employers, charitable organizations, and the \nbanks themselves.\n  Before an individual can use money from an IDA, he or she must \ncomplete an economic literacy course that will be offered by \nparticipating banks and community organizations. The course will teach \nabout saving, banking, investing, and IDAs. Two years from its \nestablishment the Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to review \nthe program for its cost-effectiveness and make recommendations as \nnecessary to the Congress. We expect a cost of $200-500 million per \nyear.\n  This is not a handout. Because only earned income is matched, IDAs \nonly help those who are already trying to help themselves. Small IDA \nprograms already exist across the country and have been overwhelmingly \nsuccessfully. IDAs change the outlook of the saver. When you have \nassets, you have a stake in the economy, and you act to protect that \nstake.\n  For example, in Stamford, Connecticut a receptionist named Scharlene \nis saving to start her own business through the CTE IDA program. She \nhad always thought of her interest in jewelry as a hobby. But after \nworking with CTE IDA program she has not only saved over $700, but has \nalso learned the basics of running a business. I met Scharlene, and I \ncan tell you that win or lose, she is on the path to success. I might \nalso add that the Connecticut State Treasurer, Ms. Denise Nappier, is \nalso investigating ways to set up a state-side IDA program, and I would \nlike to commend her for her efforts.\n  In the Sierra Ridge, Texas IDA program describes the case of Charles, \na 38 year old divorced father of two. He uses that IDA program to save \nmoney for his children's education. Charles says that since he entered \nthe program he thinks more about where his money goes: ``Having to \ncommit to a long term goal makes us more aware that our decisions today \ncould have consequences for tomorrow.'' His oldest daughter is planning \non attending college in two years.\n  Another example comes from a Bonneville, Kentucky IDA program. There, \nPam, a 37 year old factory worker and mother of two, has been saving to \nstart her own business. ``I want to start a business and I will,'' Pam \nsaid. Together with the matching funds she has saved over $1700 towards \na combination dry cleaners/video store. Her reasons are simple: ``I \nwant more for my children.''\n  IDAs are good for business too. Financial institutions like IDAs \nbecause they bring some of the 10 million ``unbanked'' Americans into \nthe system, and because it allows them to support low-income \ncommunities in a way that will ultimately be profitable for them. This \nis an idea that gives the right incentives to a deserving group in an \neffective and efficient manner. It is an idea that represents at once \nboth our support of equal opportunity and our emphasis on self \nreliance. It is an idea whose time has come.\n  Mr. President, with Senators Santorum, Durbin, Abraham, Robb, and \nKerrey of Nebraska, I introduce the Savings for Working Families Act.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) One-third of all Americans have no assets available for \n     investment, and another 20 percent have only negligible \n     assets. The household savings rate of the United States lags \n     far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to \n     national economic growth and preventing many Americans from \n     entering the economic mainstream by buying a house, obtaining \n     an adequate education, or starting a business.\n       (2) By building assets, Americans can improve their \n     economic independence and stability, stimulate the \n     development of human and other capital, and work toward a \n     viable and hopeful future for themselves and their children. \n     Thus, economic well-being does not come solely from income, \n     spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, \n     investment, and accumulation of assets.\n       (3) Traditional public assistance programs based on income \n     and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and \n     supporting the transition to increased economic self-\n     sufficiency. Income-based social policies that meet \n     consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, \n     clothing, and health care) should be complemented by asset-\n     based policies that can provide the means to achieve long-\n     term independence and economic well-being.\n       (4) Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) can provide \n     working Americans with strong incentives to build assets, \n     basic financial management training, and access to secure and \n     relatively inexpensive banking services.\n       (5) There is reason to believe that Individual Development \n     Accounts would also foster greater participation in electric \n     fund transfers (EFT), generate financial returns, including \n     increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash \n     assistance, that will far exceed the cost of public \n     investment in the program.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to provide for the \n     establishment of individual development accounts projects \n     that will--\n       (1) provide individuals and families with limited means an \n     opportunity to accumulate assets and to enter the financial \n     mainstream;\n       (2) promote education, homeownership, and the development \n     of small businesses; and\n       (3) stabilize families and build communities.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to abolish the Department of Energy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\n            THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ABOLISHMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Department of \nEnergy Abolishment Act of 1999. I am pleased to include as original \ncosponsors Senator Spencer Abraham and Senator Jon Kyl and want to \nthank them for their support both this year and in past Congresses.\n  I would also like to say that Congressman Todd Tiahrt will be \nintroducing his DOE elimination bill today in the House of \nRepresentatives and I thank him for his continued leadership and \ncooperation on this issue.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the effort to eliminate the DOE \nis not a new endeavor. In fact, since its inception, experts have been \nclamoring to eliminate the Department and to move its programs back to \nthe agencies from which they were taken--agencies better suited to \nachieving specific programmatic goals.\n  When we began to look into the specifics of DOE elimination in the \n104th Congress, we considered three main issues. First, we examined the \nfact that the Department of Energy no longer has a mission--a situation \nclearly reflected by the fact that nearly 85 percent of its budget is \nexpended upon ``non-energy'' programs.\n  The Department was created to develop a long-term energy strategy \nwith an ultimate goal of energy indepedence. Sadly, we are now far more \nreliant upon foreign energy sources than we were when the Department \nwas created.\n  During the long oil lines of the 1970s, we were about 35 percent \ndependent on foreign oil. Today, it is more than 60 percent. So our \nforeign oil dependency has grown, and a lack of an energy strategy is a \nresult of the failure of the DOE.\n  I recall at one point Secretary Hazel O'Leary commented that we \nshould consider taking the word ``energy'' out of the Department's name \nbecause it was such a small portion of its overall activity. Next, we \nstudied those programs charged to the DOE and reviewed its ability to \nmeet the related job requirements.\n  And finally, we looked at the DOE's ever-increasing budget in light \nof the first two criterion--determining whether the taxpayers should be \nforced to expend nearly $18 billion annually on this bureacratic \nhodgepodge.\n  Now, I want to be up front and say for the record that I acknowledge \nthe difficulties inherent in eliminating a cabinet-level agency. I am \nkeenly aware that the chances of passing this bill into law in this \nCongress, with this Administration, and in a presidential election year \nare difficult.\n  Those chances may be exactly as they were in 1996 when I first \nintroduced this legislation and when we held our first hearing on the \nmatter, but unfortunately, the reasons for offering the bill haven't \nchanged.\n  In 1996, the opponents of this legislation charged that it was \nunnecessary. They claimed that the Department was headed in the right \ndirection and making the changes necessary to both justify its mission \nand reduce its bloated budget.\n  The call of many Members of Congress to eliminate the Department \nencouraged a group of DOE supporters to back a hastily arranged set of \nobjectives in defense of the DOE's record of mismanagement.\n  At the time of the 1996 hearings on this legislation, the backers of \nthe Department relied largely on the DOE's Strategic Alignment and \nDownsizing Initiative as a defense against charges that the Department \nwasted too much money and that the Department was involved in a two-\ndecades old scavenger hunt for new missions.\n  The Strategic Alignment and Downsizing Initiative, its proponents \nclaimed, would save taxpayers over $14 billion in 5 years and change \nthe way the DOE conducted business. Regrettably, those projections were \nnever met and the Initiative was never taken seriously--even by the \nsame people who touted its promise.\n  In fact, while they have continued their reluctance to reduce their \nbudget--they have continuously sought billions of dollars in budget \nincrease to fund their on-going mission creep. So I think its \nworthwhile to look back on the great hopes those opposed to my bill \nplaced on this proposal.\n  While speaking about this legislation on September 4, 1996, in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Bennett Johnston said, \n``Maybe all of this would be worth doing if we were going to save the \ntaxpayers a lot of money. But the operational savings claimed by S. \n1678 by the Heritage Foundation are actually less than the operational \nsavings that would be realized by the Department's on-going strategic \nrealignment initiative, savings that the GAO has testified are real.''\n  In other words, the Senator was saying that the Department of Energy \nwould save more money for the taxpayers by doing a better job than we \ncould by eliminating the department.\n  As I stated earlier, Mr. President, the Strategic Alignment and \nDownsizing Initiative--the great hope of DOE's defenders in 1996--\nhasn't achieved one red cent of budgetary savings over the last 4 \nyears, and it doesn't appear that anything is going to change anytime \nsoon. Regrettably, the Strategic Alignment and Downsizing Initiative \nisn't the only improvement the Department has failed to make over the \npast four years.\n  Today, commercial nuclear waste still sits at 73 sites in 34 states \ndespite both legal and contractual obligations that mandated the \nremoval of the waste by January 31, 1998, more than a year ago.\n  Since my election to the Senate in 1994, I have listened to a parade \nof DOE witnesses tell the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that \nthey are committed to resolving this conflict and living up to their \nresponsibilities. Every nominee I have questioned has told me how \nimportant this issue is to them and how they are going to work with \nCongress. But not one of them--not one--in any substantive way, has \ntaken actions which generate faith in Congress that the DOE is capable \nof fulfilling its promises. Again--not one--nominee has delivered on \ntheir promises--instead, of what they need to say to get confirmed and \nthen return to business as usual.\n  They don't keep their promises. They say what they need to say, what \nCongress wants to hear to get confirmed, and then they go on with \nbusiness as usual.\n  Today, the Government Performance and Results Act paints a clear \npicture of how difficult it is to get a grip on the size of problems at \nthe Department of Energy. The Department's final strategic plan, which \ntook four years of preparation, scored a pathetic 43.5 points out of a \npossible 100. That is how good this is.\n  And the DOE's FY99 annual performance plan was ranked fourth from \nlast of all government agencies--scoring 30 out of a possible 100. No \nbusiness, no college student, no family, could consistently perform so \nmiserably and yet maintain a cushy existence of even larger and larger \nbudgets.\n  But thanks to an indifferent Administration, and a Congress that \nplaces too little importance on its oversight role, the DOE continues \nalong with the knowledge that its protectors will keep the lights on \nand the funding flowing without any regard for the American taxpayer.\n  And today, as this nation continues to grow increasingly dependent \nupon foreign oil--in total contrast to the DOE's core mission. Even in \nlight of this Administration's focus on alternative energy, the DOE \nexpends less than one-sixth of its budget on ``energy'' related \nprograms--a trend that clearly will continue well into the future.\n  Let me be the first to state that the proposals contained within this \nbill are not all of my own. The idea to eliminate the Department of \nEnergy is not a new one--since its creation in 1978, experts have been \nclamoring to abolish this ``agency in search of a mission.'' This bill \nrepresents the comments and input of many who have worked in these \nfields for decades, but, I consider it a work in progress.\n  Under the Department of Energy Abolishment Act of 1999, we dismantle \nthe patchwork quilt of government initiatives--reassembling them into \nagencies better equipped to accomplish their basic goals; we refocus \nand increase federal funding towards basic research by eliminating \ncorporate welfare; and, we abolish the bloated, duplicative upper \nmanagement bureaucracy.\n  First, we begin by eliminating Energy's cabinet-level status and \nestablishing a three-year Resolution Agency\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nto oversee the transition. This is critical to ensuring progress \ncontinues to be made on the core programs.\n  Under Title I, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is \nspun off to become an independent agency, as it was prior to the \ncreation of the DOE. The division which oversees hearings and appeals \nis eliminated, with all pending cases transferred to the Department of \nJustice for resolution within 1 year. The functions of the Energy \nInformation Administration are transferred to the Department of \nInterior with the instruction to privatize as many as possible. And \nwith the exception of research being conducted by the DOE labs, basic \nscience and energy research functions are transferred to Interior for \ndetermination on which are basic research, and which can be privatized. \nThose deemed as core research will be transferred to the National \nScience Foundation and reviewed by an independent commission. Those \nthat are more commercial in nature will be subject to disposition \nrecommendations by the Secretary of Interior.\n  The main reasoning behind this is to ensure the original mission of \nthe DOE--to develop this nation's energy independence--is carried out.\n  With scarce taxpayer dollars currently competing against defense and \ncleanup programs within the DOE, it's no surprise that little progress \nhas been made. However, by refocusing dollars into competitive \nalternative energy research, we will maximize the potential for areas \nsuch as solar, wind, biomass, etc.\n  For states like Minnesota, where the desire for renewable energy \ntechnologies is high, growth in these areas could help fend off our \ngrowing dependence upon foreign oil while protecting our environment.\n  Under Title II, the laboratory structure within the DOE is revamped.\n  First, the three ``defense labs'' are transferred to the Defense \nDepartment. They include Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. The \nremaining labs are studied by a ``Non-defense Energy Laboratory \nCommission''.\n  This independent commission operates much like the Base Closure \nCommission and can recommend restructuring, privatization or a transfer \nto the DOD as alternatives to closure. Congress is granted fast-track \nauthority to adopt the Commission's recommendations.\n  Title III directs the General Accounting Office to assess an \ninventory of the Power Marketing Administration's assets, liabilities, \netc. This inventory is aimed at ensuring fair treatment of current \ncustomers and a fair return to the taxpayers. All issues, including \npayments by current customers, must be included in the GAO audit.\n  Petroleum Reserves are the focus of Title IV. The Naval Petroleum \nReserve is targeted for immediate sale. Any of the reserves that are \nunable to be disposed of within the three-year window will be sold \ntransitionally from the Interior Department.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is transferred to the Defense \nDepartment and an audit on value and maintenance costs is conducted by \nthe GAO. Then, the DOD is charged with determining how much oil to \nmaintain for national security purposes after reviewing the GAO report.\n  Under Titles V and VI, all of the national security and environmental \nrestoration/management activities are sent to the Department of \nDefense.\n  Therefore, all defense-related activities are transferred back to \nDefense, but are placed in a new civilian controlled agency (the \nDefense Nuclear Programs Agency) to ensure budget firewalls and \ncivilian control over sensitive activities such as arms control and \nnonproliferation activities.\n  And the program which has received much criticism as of late, the \nCivilian Nuclear Waste Program, is transferred to the Corps of \nEngineers. This section dovetails legislation adopted by the Senate \nlast Congress. A key element is that the interim storage site is \ndesignated at Nevada's Test Site Area 25.\n  As I mentioned in the beginning of my statement, while I believe we \nshould eliminate the Department as cabinet-level agency, I appreciate \nthe difficulty involved in accomplishing this goal now and realize the \nopposition to this among many of my colleagues. For that reason, I \nbelieve it is important to point out that the reasons I have outlined \nfor eliminating the Department have a dual purpose--they can also serve \nas reasons for improving the Department.\n  Toward that end, I am willing to work with any Member of the Senate \nand House to improve, downsize, or restructure the DOE. I have long \nadvocated positions which are consistent with my beliefs.\n  I am an original co-sponsor of The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999--\nlegislation I believe is essential to fulfilling the DOE's promises to \nAmerica's ratepayers and taxpayers. I have been a strong supporter of \nlegislation and efforts which are aimed at improving our nation's \nenergy security by promoting domestically produced alternative and \nrenewable fuels. Those efforts have included support for extending the \nethanol tax credit, including biodiesel as an alternative fuel under \nthe Energy Policy Act, cosponsoring the Wind Energy Tax Credit, \ncosponsoring the Poultry Litter Tax Credit legislation, and \ncosponsoring legislation to reform the hydropower relicensing process.\n  Briefly, I believe those efforts strengthen the original mission of \nthe Department of Energy. My bottom line is, I want America's taxpayers \nto be assured they are receiving a proper return on their investment.\n  The taxpayers need to have confidence they are receiving the services \nthey deserve. Unfortunately, the record of the Department of Energy is \nevidence in part of our reliance upon foreign oil, by the nuclear waste \nprogram debacle and by the low ratings it receives under the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, and is a record of failure the taxpayers \nshould no longer be forced to bear.\n  I patiently awaited the reforms and savings promised by the \nDepartment and its advocates, but the waiting continues and the savings \nnever developed. As long as this is the case, I will continue to offer \nmy legislation to dismantle the Department of Energy and shift its \nresponsibilities elsewhere.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask it be referred to the proper \ncommittees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 897. A bill to provide matching grants for the construction, \nrenovation and repair of school facilities in areas affected by Federal \nactivities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               federally impacted school improvement act\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, in introducing the Federally Impacted School \nImprovement Act. This bipartisan legislation is designed to renew and \nenhance the partnership between the federal government and schools \nlocated on or around Indian reservations and military bases.\n  For almost fifty years Congress has provided financial assistance to \nschool districts impacted by a federal presence. Up until 1994, \nCongress also provided funding to help these communities defray the \ncost of building and repairing their schools.\n  The loss of this particular revenue over the last five years, \ncombined with the continued under-funding for almost 15 years of the \nimpact aid program in general, has left school districts that serve \nmilitary and Indian children scrambling to finance their routine costs. \nAs a result, many of these schools now have buildings that are \nantiquated, overcrowded and compromise the health and safety of their \nstudents.\n  The Federally Impacted School Improvement Act takes a step toward \ncorrecting this situation by providing matching grants that impacted \nschools can use to address their most pressing modernization needs. \nThis Act authorizes a federal appropriation of $50 million for each of \nthe next five fiscal years for impact aid school construction and \nrepair.\n  Forty-five percent of the funds appropriated under the bill go to \nIndian lands. Another forty-five percent is dedicated to military \nschools. The final ten percent will be reserved for emergency \nsituations.\n  In order to make limited federal funds go farther, our bill calls for \nlocal communities to contribute their share to this effort. Schools and \ncommunities will have to match the federal grants\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\non all but the 10% appropriated for emergencies. This is done to ensure \nthat all--or at least more--impacted schools will have the opportunity \nto use these new grants to improve their facilities.\n  The federal government cannot and should not be all things to all \npeople. However, Congress has a responsibility to ensure that highly \nimpacted school districts, such as Bellevue and Santee, Nebraska, are \nnot shortchanged.\n  The hardships faced by our military personnel, their families and \nindividuals living on Indian reservations are well known. Their \nchildren deserve no less than the best educational facilities.\n  The Federally Impacted School Improvement Act helps to meet our \ncommitment to schools and children impacted by a federal presence. It \nmakes good use of our limited federal resources. It embodies what we \nshould be doing more of--building partnerships between local \ncommunities, taxpayers and government in order to strengthen our \nschools.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I also request \nunanimous consent that the bill and a letter sent to me by the Northern \nNebraska Native American Consortium be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federally \n     Impacted School Improvement Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1950 Congress recognized its obligation, through the \n     passage of Public Law 81-815, to provide school construction \n     funding for local educational agencies impacted by the \n     presence of Federal activities.\n       (2) The conditions of federally impacted school facilities \n     providing educational programs to children in areas where the \n     Federal Government is present have deteriorated to such an \n     extent that the health and safety of the children served by \n     such agencies is being compromised, and the school conditions \n     have not kept pace with the increase in student population \n     causing classrooms to become severely overcrowded and \n     children to be educated in trailers.\n       (3) Local educational agencies in areas where there exists \n     a significant Federal presence have little if any capacity to \n     raise local funds for purposes of capital construction, \n     renovation and repair due to the nontaxable status of Federal \n     land.\n       (4) The need for renewed support by the Federal Government \n     to help federally connected local educational agencies \n     modernize their school facilities is far greater in 2000 than \n     at any time since 1950.\n       (5) Federally connected local educational agencies and the \n     communities the agencies serve are willing to commit local \n     resources when available to modernize and replace existing \n     facilities, but do not always have the resources available to \n     meet their total facility needs due to the nontaxable \n     presence of the Federal Government.\n       (6) Due to the conditions described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (5) there is in 1999, as there was in 1950, a need \n     for Congress to renew its obligation to assist federally \n     connected local educational agencies with their facility \n     needs.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide \n     matching grants to local educational agencies for the \n     modernization of minimum school facilities that are urgently \n     needed because--\n       (1) the existing school facilities of the agency are in \n     such disrepair that the health and safety of the students \n     served by the agency is threatened; and\n       (2) increased enrollment results in a need for additional \n     classroom space.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Modernization.--The term ``modernization'' means the \n     repair, renovation, alteration, or construction of a \n     facility, including--\n       (A) the concurrent installation of equipment; and\n       (B) the complete or partial replacement of an existing \n     facility, but only if such replacement is less expensive and \n     more cost-effective than repair, renovation, or alteration of \n     the facility.\n       (2) Facility.--The term ``facility'' means a public \n     structure suitable for use as a classroom, laboratory, \n     library, media center, or related facility, the primary \n     purpose of which is the instruction of public elementary \n     school or secondary school students.\n       (3) Local educational agency.--The term ``local educational \n     agency'' has the meaning given the term in section 14101 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means--\n       (A) with respect to funds made available under paragraph \n     (1) or (3) of section 4(a) for grants under section 6 or 8, \n     respectively, the Secretary of Education; and\n       (B) with respect to funds made available under paragraph \n     (2) of section (4)(a) for grants under section 6, the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Department of Education to carry out this Act $50,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2001 and such sums as may be necessary for \n     each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated under subsection (a) shall be available to a \n     local educational agency to pay the cost of administration of \n     the activities assisted under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4.

We would be receptive to any federal options for \n     funding the viable construction needs of the Native American \n     students being served by member schools.\n       These Nebraska schools currently educate 98% if all Indian \n     students living on reservation land. The NAC schools \n     currently have significant construction needs ranging from \n     meeting ADA requirements to updating firm alarm systems. \n     Several Nebraska school districts are, or have, passed bond \n     issues for construction of new schools or modernizing old \n     ones. Our school districts only option is Impact Aid or other \n     federally connected funding for construction purposes. The \n     State of Nebraska statutorily exclude state aid as a \n     construction funding mechanism, such aid can only be used for \n     general fund purposes.\n       Please consider the importance of meeting federal treaty \n     obligations. Such treaties mandate the education of the \n     Native American students on reservation land. If state and \n     federal education standards are to be met, a positive \n     learning environment must be met. We thank you for your \n     attention to this matter.\n           Kindest Regards,\n     Florence Parker,\n       Board President, Omaha Nations Public School.\n     Marcia Ross,\n       Board Member, Walthill Public School.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n     C.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntaxpayers with greater notice of any unlawful inspection or disclosure \nof their return or return information; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          taxpayer privacy protection improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to report on the \nimplementation of the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act of 1997. Two \nyears ago, the Congress passed and the President signed into law, \nlegislation I proposed with Senator John Glenn that sought to end the \negregious protection of unauthorized inspections of taxpayer files. \nSomething I prefer to call ``file snooping.''\n  I am pleased to report that, according to a GAO report my office is \nreleasing today, it appears that the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act \nis working. But, we still have work to do. The report demonstrates that \nfile snooping still occurs, but the incidents have become fewer. I \nbelieve this is good news for taxpayers.\n  At the same time, as I stated previously, our work is not done. The \nGAO found that sixteen confirmed cases of file snooping occurred since \nthe enactment of the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, each of which \nhad been appropriately referred for prosecution. Unfortunately, 15 \ncases were declined for prosecution meaning there was only one case in \nwhich taxpayers were notified that their privacy had been violated. In \nthose 15 cases, the affected taxpayers were not assured the opportunity \nto seek the civil recourse available under the law.\n  I believe we have a duty to correct this loophole. Taxpayers not only \nhave a right to know their privacy, entrusted by them to the Federal \nGovernment, has been violated, that we let them down, but that the \nopportunity to seek the relief provided under the law is ensured.\n  Legislation I introduce today, the Taxpayer Privacy Protection \nImprovement Act of 1999, will ensure taxpayers' right to know. In \nshort, it triggers the notification of taxpayers that their files have \nbeen snooped to the point where a case is referred for prosecution \nfollowing the conclusion of a thorough internal investigation.\n  This proposal builds on our previous progress, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Specter, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n          Ashcroft, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Grams):\n\n  S. 899. A bill to reduce crime and protect the public in the 21st \nCentury by strengthening Federal assistance to State and local law \nenforcement, combating illegal drugs and preventing drug use, attacking \nthe criminal use of guns, promoting accountability and rehabilitation \nof juvenile criminals, protecting the rights of victims in the criminal \njustice system, and improving criminal justice rules and procedures, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    twenty-first Century Justice Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Twenty-\nfirst Century Justice Act. Last month, when I announced this \ninitiative, along with my colleagues Senator Thurmond, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Ashcroft, Senator Sessions, Senator Abraham, and Senator Grams, \nI noted that despite some modest gains in the fight against crime, \nviolent crime still touched far too many Americans. Sadly, this has \nbeen borne out in the weeks since.\n  As the recent tragedies in Littleton, CO, and in my own hometown of \nSalt Lake City, UT, remind us, crime in America is still too prevalent \nand violent. The tragic cost imposed on law-abiding citizens requires \nreasoned and thoughtful action to deter these heinous crimes. We must \ncome together as a society to address this problem.\n  Furthermore, we should recognize that there is little the Federal \nGovernment could have done directly to have prevented the tragedies in \nLittleton and elsewhere. There are, however, important steps we can \ntake to address this issue. Our crime bill takes such steps.\n  Now, let me describe for my colleagues how this bill, which is a \nbalanced, comprehensive, and focused plan to fight crime, will expand \ncurrent successful law enforcement practices. It is based on what we \nknow reduces crime. Be it increased methamphetamine abuse in Utah and \nother Western states, further increases in juvenile crime, or the \nthreat of international crime, we know that our plan will make a \nsignificant difference.\n  Our plan maintains and strengthens the current federal assistance to \nStates that has proven invaluable in reducing crime nationally, and it \nadds new initiatives that will further reduce crime at the federal, \nstate, and local levels. I am proud of our plan, and I look forward to \nworking with the administration and my Senate colleagues to enact it.\n  America witnessed an unprecedented growth in crime during the 20th \ncentury. Our plan ensures that we will become the 21st century with \ndecreasing crime rates. Our plan contains four central elements:\n  First, it continues and improves Federal assistance to State and \nlocal law enforcement. Second, it reinvigorates our commitment to \nwinning the war on drugs. Third, it emphasizes holding violent \noffenders accountable by vigorously prosecuting gun crimes. And fourth, \nit includes needed judicial and criminal procedure reforms and \nprotections for the rights of crime victims.\n  Notwithstanding the leadership we have seen here in Congress and by \nmany of our nation's governors, crime in America is still unacceptably \nhigh by historical standards. For example, for 1997--the most recent \nyear for which national crime rate statistics are available--the murder \nrate was 33 percent higher than it was in 1960, and the rape rate was \n413 percent higher than in 1960. In 1997, the aggravated assault rate \nwas 526 percent higher than it was in 1960. Even with the modest \ndeclines in recent years, America still has more violent crime than any \nindustrialized nation in the world. The first obligation of government \nis to protect its citizens from crime. Obviously, despite the recent \ndeclines, we have a long way to go in reducing crime in America.\n  Despite the recent progress--much of it in partnership with Governors \nlike Mike Leavitt of Utah, George Allen and Jim Gilmore of Virginia, \nand George W. Bush of Texas--we cannot become complacent. The most \ntroubling aspect of the Clinton Justice Department's budget is its \nelimination of block grants that have proven so successful in helping \nstate and local authorities reduce crime. We simply cannot become \nindifferent. Remember the war on drugs? During the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, our nation began a national, long-term commitment to \nfight drug abuse. Due to these efforts, drug use began to decline. \nHowever, drug use, especially among teenagers, has exploded since 1992. \nUnless we remain vigilant, the same will happen with violent crime.\n  Permit me to review each of the four main parts to our legislative \ncrime plan in greater detail.\n\n\n  Continuing and Improving Federal Assistance to State and Local Law \n                              Enforcement\n\n  Combined with our ongoing commitment to prevention and treatment, our \nbill extends the authorization for the highly successful partnership we \nhave created with local law enforcement--the Local Law Enforcement \nBlock Grant Program, which the Republican Congress created in the \nContract with America. Since fiscal year 1996, this program has \nprovided more than $2 billion in funding for equipment and technology, \nsuch as radios and scanners, directly to state and local \nlaw enforcement. The authorization for this program will be between \n$600-700 million per year. Although the block grant has been extremely \neffective in assisting state and local law enforcement, the\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nClinton administration budget eliminates funding for this program.\n\n  Our bill also reauthorizes the truth-in-sentencing prison grants at \napproximately $700 million per year. These truth-in-sentencing grants, \nwhich provide funds to States to build prisons, have been instrumental \nin lowering crime by encouraging States to incarcerate violent and \nrepeat offenders for at least 85 percent of their sentence. In January, \nthe Justice Department reported that 70 percent of prison admissions in \n1997 were in States requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of \ntheir sentence. More significantly, the average time served by violent \ncriminals nationally has increased 12.2 percent since 1993. Perhaps the \nbiggest reason for recent declines in violent crime is due to these \ntruth-in-sentencing prison grants. Simply put, violent criminals cannot \ncommit crimes against innocent victims while in prison. Our bill \ncontinues this successful program and makes the program more flexible \nby allowing States to use the funds for jails and juvenile facilities, \nin addition to prison construction.\n  Despite this success, the Clinton administration eliminates funding \nfor the Truth-in-Sentencing program--even though many States have \nchanged their laws due to this federal commitment to assist in prison \nconstruction. Nothing deters and prevents violent crime as well as \nincarcerating violent and repeat offenders.\n  Our bill also includes the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block \nGrant to help States build juvenile detention centers, drug test \njuvenile offenders, establish graduated sentencing sanctions for repeat \njuvenile offenders, and improve juvenile record keeping. This provision \nauthorizes $450 million for the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block \nGrant. It also includes $435 million for prevention programs and \nreauthorizes the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nwithin the Justice Department. The administration's budget eliminates \nfunding for the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant, even \nthough these are the only federal funds dedicated to juvenile law \nenforcement purposes.\n  Finally, our bill reauthorizes and reforms the COPS program re-\ntargeting this assistance to the type of policing we know works--zero \ntolerance for crime, computer tracking of criminal hot spots, and \nholding commanders responsible for results.\n\n\n                A Commitment to Winning the War on Drugs\n\n  The second major part of this legislative addresses drugs. This \nsection focuses attention where only the federal government has the \nability to make a difference--drug interdiction. It also increases the \npenalties for methamphetamine and powder cocaine trafficking. Our bill \nencourages States to keep prisons and jails drug-free to break the link \nbetween drugs and crime--and provides bonus grants to help States do \nthis. And our bill includes a faith-based drug treatment bill designed \nby Senator Abraham. I would especially like to thank and acknowledge \nthe leadership that Senators Ashcroft and DeWine have shown in fighting \ndrugs, particularly methamphetamine. Their leadership has been \ninvaluable on this issue.\n\n\n  Holding Violent Offenders Accountable Through Firearms Prosecutions\n\n  I do not support gun control, but I do believe in crime control. In \naddition to remaining true to truth-in-sentencing and prison \nconstruction, our bill builds on and expands a successful Richmond, \nVirginia program in which the U.S. Attorney's office prosecutes as many \nlocal gun-related crimes in federal court as possible to take advantage \nof federal mandatory minimum sentences and stiff bond rules. This \nprovision does not create additional federal crimes, but instead \nutilizes existing federal statues. This program builds on the Project \nTriggerlock program which was implemented by the Bush administration.\n  This program emphasizes cooperation between state and federal \nprosecutors, as well as the BATF and the local police departments. The \nlast major component of this program is an extensive media campaign to \npromote the message to potential criminals that ``[a]n illegal gun will \nget you five years in federal prison.'' The media campaign also \nencourages citizens to report gun crimes to authorities. This program \nhas been a huge success. Homicides have decreased 50 percent in \nRichmond after this program was implemented. Our bill provides funds to \nimplement this program in major cities across the nation.\n  Again, the Clinton administration's record on gun prosecutions is \ntroubling. Between 1992 and 1997, Triggerlock gun prosecutions dropped \nnearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to 3,765. These are prosecutions of \ndefendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony.\n\n\n            Judicial-Procedural Reforms and Victims' Rights\n\n  The last major element of our crime plan enacts procedural and \njudicial reforms that improve the administration of justice. Our bill \nreforms the Miranda rule to allow voluntary statements in evidence. It \ncodifies common-sense procedural issues, including the ``good-faith'' \nexception to exclusionary rule, and further reforms habeas corpus \nappeals.\n  Our bill also recognizes that the administration of justice requires \ngovernment to safeguard the interests of victims. How can there be \njustice if crime victims feel victimized by the criminal justice \nsystem? The bill ensures that victims are given respect in the criminal \nsystem, ensuring their right to attend trials in federal court, to be \nheard at critical stages such as detention hearings, and to be notified \nwhen the defendant is released or escapes. Our bill also calls for \nratification of a crime victim's rights constitutional amendment to \nensure that these rights are recognized everywhere in America. Our bill \nalso steers necessary funds toward combating violence against women and \nchildren, and strengthens federal mandatory restitution laws.\n  This bill is not a panacea for our crime problem. We are faced, I \nbelieve, with a problem which cannot be solved alone by new laws. It \nis, at its core, a moral problem. Somehow, in too many instances, we \nhave failed as a society to pass to the next generation the moral \ncompass that differentiates right from wrong. This problem cannot be \nsolved by legislation alone. It cannot be restored by the enactment of \na new law or the implementation of a new program But it can be achieved \nby families and communities working together to teach accountability by \nexample and by early intervention when the signs point to violent and \nantisocial behavior.\n  Our bill is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important crime fighting legislation, which will \nstrengthen our nation's ability to protect citizens from the scourge of \nviolent crime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 901. A bill to provide disadvantaged children with access to \ndental services; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n            CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nis one cornerstone of a series of initiatives that are designed to help \nensure that the fundamental needs of children in New Mexico and this \ncountry are met. This cornerstone, the Children's Dental Health \nImprovement Act of 1999, is built on the belief that children must have \naccess to quality, affordable health care. A child who is sick cannot \ngo to school, cannot be expected to learn, and cannot be expected to \ngrow and thrive. For New Mexico, this is a particularly compelling need \nbecause according to the Children's Defense Fund, no state has a \ngreater percentage of uninsured children than New Mexico. Specifically, \nthe bill is designed to increase access to dental services for our \nchildren.\n\n  Some will say: ``Why care about a few cavities in kids?'' In reality, \nthis is a complex children's health issue. Chronically poor oral health \nis associated with growth and development problems in toddlers and \ncompromises children's nutritional status. These children suffer great \npain and cannot play or learn. It is estimated that lack of treatment \nfor these children results in missed school days: an estimated 52 \nmillion school hours annually. Their personal suffering is real. In \nreality, untreated dental problems get progressively worse and \nultimately require more expensive interventions.\n  Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment, or \n``EPSDT,'' program requires states to not only pay for a comprehensive \nset of\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nchild health services, including dental services, but to assure \ndelivery of those services. Unfortunately, low income children do not \nget the dental service they need. Despite the design of the Medicaid \nprogram to reach children and ensure access to routine dental care, the \nInspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported in 1996 that only 18 percent of children eligible for Medicaid \nreceived even a single preventive dental service. The same report shows \nthat no state provides preventive services to more than 50% of eligible \nchildren. Dentist participation is too low to assure access. We are \nfalling short of our obligation to these children.\n  In the past few months, I have had the opportunity to speak to many \nof New Mexico's rural health care providers and have learned that for \nNew Mexico, the problem is of crisis proportions. Less than two percent \nof New Mexico's Medicaid dollars are used for children's oral health \nneeds. My state alone projects a shortage of 157 dentists and 229 \ndental hygienists. Children in New Mexico and elsewhere are showing up \nin emergency rooms for treatment of tooth abscesses instead of getting \ntheir cavities filled early on or having dental decay prevented in the \nfirst place.\n  Tooth decay remains the single most common chronic disease of \nchildhood and according to the Children's Dental Health Project, it \naffects more than half of all children by second grade. Tooth decay in \nchildren six years old is five to eight times more common than asthma \nwhich is often cited as the most common chronic disease of childhood.\n  National data confirm that pediatric oral health in the U.S. is \nbacksliding. Healthy People 2000 goals for dental needs of children \nwill not be met. As this chart shows:\n  52% of our 6 to 8 year olds have dental caries or cavities compared \nto 54% in 1986. Our goal was to decrease this to 35% by the year 2000; \nwe have succeeded in a mere 2% change in this area.\n  Additionally, we have slid backwards in some areas. The Healthy \nPeople 2000 oral health indicators show an increase in the percentage \nof children with untreated cavities. In 1986, 28% of our 6 to 8 year \nolds had untreated cavities compared to now when we find 31% of these \nchildren have untreated cavities.\n  Tooth decay is increasingly a disease of low and modest income \nchildren. A substantial portion of decay in young children goes \nuntreated. In fact, forty seven per cent of decay in children aged 2 \nthrough 9, is untreated.\n  The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 1999 is designed to \nattack the problem from many fronts. First, the bill addresses the \nissue of provider shortage by expanding opportunities for training \npediatric dental health care providers. It allows for the Secretary to \nlook at the reimbursement rates for dental providers as an incentive \nfor dentists to participate in the Medicaid program so that we work \ntoward increasing the actual care provided under the Medicaid program. \nAdditionally, I have looked at the need for pediatric dental research \nto facilitate better approaches for care and it will put into place \ngreater measures for surveillance of the problem. The bill would lead \nto increased accountability in the area of actual treatment once a \nproblem is identified. Finally, I have included a section on health \npromotion and disease prevention to increase the number of children who \nhave access to fluoridated water systems and dental sealants to prevent \ncavities.\n\n  I recognize that this is an ambitious bill and that the issue of \naccess to dental care for children covered by the Medicaid program is a \ncomplex one. I want to thank the various groups that have worked on the \nformulation of this legislation. In particular, I want to thank Drs. \nBurt Edelstein and Heber Simmons of the American Academy of Pediatric \nDentistry for their hard work and excellent information. I also want to \nthank the American Association of Dental Schools, the American Dental \nHygienist Association, the American Dental Association, the Hispanic \nDental Association, the National Dental Association, and the American \nAssociation for Dental Research for their valuable input and I look \nforward to working with them all to ensure that we achieve increased \naccess to oral health care for our children.\n  I am committed to solving the problem of adequate access to dental \ncare for our children and view this as a public health issue that has \ngone unnoticed for too long. I will welcome my colleagues to work with \nme to ensure that these children have healthy smiles instead of chronic \npain from untreated problems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the \nChildren's Dental Health Improvement Act of 1999 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 1995 Institute of Medicine report on dental \n     education finds that oral health is an integral part of total \n     health, and is integral to comprehensive health, including \n     primary care.\n       (2) Tooth decay is the most prevalent preventable chronic \n     disease of childhood and only the common cold, the flu, and \n     otitis media occur more often among young children.\n       (3) Despite the design of the medicaid program to reach \n     children and ensure access to routine dental care, in 1996, \n     the Inspector\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\n     General of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     reported that only 18 percent of children eligible for \n     medicaid received even a single preventive dental service.\n       (4) The United States is facing a major dental health care \n     crisis that primarily affects the poor children of our \n     country, with 80 percent of all dental caries in children \n     found in the 20 percent of the population.\n       (5) Low income children eligible for the medicaid program \n     and the State children's health insurance program experience \n     disproportionately high levels of oral disease.\n       (6) The United States is not training enough pediatric \n     dental health care providers to meet the increasing need for \n     dental services for children.\n       (7) The United States needs to increase access to health \n     promotion and disease prevention activities in the area of \n     oral health for children by increasing access to dental \n     health providers for children.\n TITLE I--EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING PEDIATRIC DENTAL HEALTH \n                             CARE PROVIDERS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States the option to provide Medicaid coverage for low-income \nindividuals infected with HIV; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  early treatment for hiv act of 1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nTreatment for HIV Act. In recent years, exciting scientific \nbreakthroughs have led to an improved understanding of AIDS and \nprovided powerful new treatments for Americans living with HIV disease. \nCommonly known as the protease cocktail, these drugs have helped \ntransform HIV into a manageable chronic disease. To be most effective, \nthe medical community and the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) recommends the use of these treatments early in the \ncourse HIV infection, before the onset of symptoms. Tragically though, \nthe high cost of these drugs means that only those of significant \nfinancial means have access to them.\n\n  In another tragic irony, vulnerable low-income HIV-positive Americans \ncannot receive AIDS-preventing drugs under the Medicaid program until \nthey develop full blown AIDS. By that time, their preventive value has \ngreatly diminished. To correct this glaring flaw in the Medicaid \nprogram, the Early Treatment for HIV Act will ensure that HIV positive, \nlow income patients, will be eligible for medical services immediately.\n  The benefits of this legislation are overwhelming. A report released \nat the 12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva found that treatment for \nHIV early in the course of the disease is both medically and \neconomically effective. Another report by the University of California \nfound that expanding Medicaid to provide wider access to HIV therapies \nwould prevent thousands of deaths and AIDS diagnoses, leading to 14,500 \nmore years of life for persons living with HIV disease over five years.\n  In terms of economic savings, several recent studies have found that \nmoney spent ``up front'' on medications are offset by later savings on \nhospitalizations and other expensive care and treatments for AIDS-\nrelated illnesses. A report by the Medical Associates of Los Angeles \nfound that each dollar spent on combination drugs therapies resulted in \nat least two dollars of savings and overall treatment costs.\n  Mr. President, the Early Treatment for HIV Act will help thousands of \nlow-income people with HIV live longer, more fulfilling lives by \nallowing them to overcome the financial barriers to effective medical \ntreatments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the exchange by law enforcement agencies \nof DNA identification information relating to violent offenders, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            violent offender dna identification act of 1999\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DeWine to \nintroduce the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999. This \nbipartisan measure will put more criminals behind bars by correcting \npractical and legal shortcomings that leave too much crucial DNA \nevidence unused and too many violent crimes unsolved.\n\n  Currently, all 50 states require DNA samples to be obtained from \ncertain convicted offenders, and these samples increasingly can be \nshared through a national DNA database established by Federal law. This \nnational database--part of the Combined Database Index System (CODIS)--\nenables law enforcement officials to link DNA evidence found at a crime \nscene with any suspect whose DNA is already on file. By identifying \nrepeat offenders, this DNA sharing can and does make a difference. \nAlready the FBI has recorded over 400 matches through DNA databases, \nhelping solve numerous crimes. And in my home state of Wisconsin, \nexperience proves that DNA ``sharing'' pays off. We've already had 19 \n``hits'' that have assisted more than 20 criminal investigations. In \nfact, just a week\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nbefore the statute of limitations ran out in a multiple rape \ninvestigation, DNA matching helped identify a serial rapist responsible \nfor three rapes in Kenosha and a fourth in Racine. As a result, he's \ncurrently serving an 80-year sentence. Without DNA databases, suspects \nlike this otherwise might never be discovered--or convicted.\n  As valuable as this system is, it is not as effective as it could--or \nshould--be. The effectiveness of the database is directly related to \nthe number of DNA profiles it contains. For every 1,000 new profiles, \nwe can expect to find at least one match, and with every new profile \nadded, the odds for a match increase. However, there are currently two \nmajor obstacles to the effective functioning of the database. Our \nmeasure would correct these problems and make the database far more \nproductive.\n  First, hundreds of thousands of DNA samples that have already been \ncollected still must be analyzed before they can be entered into the \nnational database. The FBI estimates that there is a backlog of nearly \n400,000 DNA samples from convicted offenders languishing, unanalyzed, \nin state crime laboratories for simple lack of funding.\n  Our measure will reduce the backlog of unanalyzed samples by \nproviding the funding necessary to analyze them and put them ``on-\nline.'' It provides $30 million over two years to erase the backlog of \nthe 400,000 unanalyzed samples and the almost-as-pressing backlog of \napproximately 200,000 more samples that need to be reanalyzed using \nstate-of-the-art methods. For example, in Wisconsin, we have almost \n2,000 samples that have not yet been analyzed, and more than 10,000 \nthat need to be reanalyzed so they can be effectually shared through \nthe national database.\n  Indeed, easing this backlog was the lead recommendation of the \nNational Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence appointed by the \nAttorney General. As the Commission explained, ``the power of the CODIS \nprogram lies in the sheer numbers of convicted offender samples that \nare processed and entered into the database.''\n  Second, for some inexplicable reason, we do not collect samples from \nFederal and D.C. offenders. So while the database can identify a \nsuspect whose DNA is on file in one of the 50 states, it generally \nwon't catch a Federal or D.C. offender. Under current law, that suspect \nwill not be identified; his crime may not be solved; and he could get \noff scot-free. We thought we already closed this loophole through 1996 \nlegislation which provides that the FBI ``may expand [the database] to \ninclude Federal crimes and crimes committed in the District of \nColumbia,'' but Federal officials claim more express authority is \nnecessary. We are not so sure they're right, but there is no need to \nwait any longer.\n\n  Our measure closes once and for all this loophole that allows DNA \nsamples from Federal (including military) and Washington, D.C. \noffenders to go uncollected. Under our proposal, DNA samples would be \nobtained from any Federal offender--or any D.C. offender under Federal \ncustody or supervision--convicted of a violent crime or other \nqualifying offense. And it would require the collection of samples from \njuveniles found delinquent under Federal law for conduct that would \nconstitute a violent crime if committed by an adult. Our proposal was \nprepared with the assistance of the FBI, the Administrative Office of \nthe U.S. Courts, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Parole Commission, \nagencies within the District of Columbia responsible for supervision of \nreleased felons, and the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, modern crime-fighting technology like DNA testing and \nDNA databases make law enforcement much more effective. But in order to \ntake full advantage of these valuable resources, we need this measure \nto make the database as comprehensive--and as productive--as possible. \nViolent criminals should not be able to evade arrest simply because a \nstate didn't analyze its DNA samples or because an inexcusable loophole \nleaves Federal and D.C. offenders out of the DNA database. This measure \nwill ensure that we apprehend violent repeat offenders, regardless of \nwhether they originally violated state, Federal or D.C. law. And, by \ncollecting more DNA evidence and utilizing the best of DNA technology, \nwe also can help exonerate individual suspects whose DNA does not match \nwith particular crime scenes.\n  The Senate has already made clear that issues like these need to be \naddressed. In this year's Budget, we acknowledged that ``tremendous \nbacklogs * * * prevent swift administration of justice and impede \nfundamental individual rights, such as the right to a speedy trial and \nto exculpatory evidence.'' We unanimously concluded that it was the \nSense of the Senate that ``Congress should consider legislation that \nspecifically addresses the backlogs in State and local crime \nlaboratories and medical examiner's offices.''\n  Mr. President, this measure will help police use modern technology to \nsolve crimes and prevent repeat offenders from committing new ones. So \nwe look forward to working with our colleagues and with the Department \nof Justice to move this measure forward and help law enforcement keep \npace with today's criminal.\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \n``Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999,'' with my colleague \nSenator Herb Kohl. Existing anti-crime technology can allow us to solve \nmany violent crimes that occur in our communities--but in order for it \nto work, it has to be used.\n  I have been a longtime advocate for use of the Combined DNA Indexing \nSystem (CODIS), a national DNA database, to profile convicted offender \nDNA. In fact, during consideration of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, I \nproposed a provision under which Federal convicted offenders' DNA would \nbe included in CODIS. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice never \nimplemented this law, though currently all 50 states collect DNA from \nconvicted offenders.\n  One of the purposes of this legislation is to expressly require the \ncollection of DNA samples from federally convicted felons, and military \npersonnel convicted of similar offenses. Collection of convicted \noffender DNA is crucial to solving many of the crimes occurring in our \ncommunities. Statistics show that many of these violent felons will \nrepeat their crimes once they are back in society. Since the Federal \ngovernment does not collect DNA from these felons, however, law \nenforcement's ability to rapidly identify likely suspects is retarded. \nCollection of such data is critical.\n  The case of Mrs. Debbie Smith of Virginia underscores the importance \nof collection of DNA from convicted offenders. Debbie Smith was at her \nhome in the middle of the day when a masked intruder entered her \nunlocked back door. Her husband, a police lieutenant, was upstairs \nsleeping. The stranger blindfolded Mrs. Smith and took her to a wooded \narea behind her house where he robbed and repeatedly raped her. After \nwarning Mrs. Smith not to tell, the assailant let her go. She told her \nhusband, who reported the incident, then took her to the hospital where \nevidence was collected for DNA analysis.\n  Debbie Smith's rape experience was so terrible that she contemplated \ntaking her own life. She continued to live in constant fear until six-\nand-a-half years later when a state crime laboratory found a CODIS \nmatch with an inmate then serving in jail for abduction and robbery. In \nfact, the offender was jailed on another offense one month after raping \nher. There are thousands of other crimes the DNA database can solve. \nWith CODIS we can grant countless victims, like Mrs. Smith, peace of \nmind and bring their attackers swiftly to justice.\n  We need to do everything we can to make sure law enforcement has \naccess to these tools. A major obstacle facing state and local crime \nlaboratories are the backlogs of convicted offender samples. The \nFederal Bureau of Investigation estimates that there are about 450,000 \nconvicted offender samples in state and local laboratories awaiting \nanalysis. Increasing demand for DNA analysis in active cases, and \nlimited resources, are reducing the ability of state and local crime \nlaboratories to analyze their convicted offender backlogs. While I \nintroduced, and Congress passed, the Crime Identification Technology \nAct of 1998 to address the long-term needs of crime laboratories, many \ncrime laboratories need immediate assistance to address their short-\nterm backlogs that will help law enforcement solve crime.\n  This bill would provide about $30 million, over 4 years, to help \nstate and\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\nlocal crime laboratories address their convicted offender backlogs. We \nare asking the FBI to work with private, state and local laboratories \nto organize regional laboratories to analysis backlogged State and \nlocal convicted offender samples. While we have considered many ways to \naddress the backlog of convicted offender samples in state and local \nlaboratories, we believe that the approach outlined in this legislation \nprovides the fastest, most cost-effective and efficient method of \neliminating the backlog.\n  Violent criminals should not be able to evade responsibility simply \nbecause a state lacks the resources to analyze their DNA samples, or \nbecause a loophole excludes certain Federal offenders from our national \ndatabase. This legislation would be a huge asset for our local law \nenforcers in their day-to-day fight against crime. I thank Senator Kohl \nfor his efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 905. A bill to establish the Lackawanna Valley American Heritage \nArea; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n\n          lackawanna valley american heritage area act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould establish the Lackawanna Valley American Heritage Area. This \nlegislation recognizes the significance of Pennsylvania's Lackawanna \nValley, the site of the first state heritage park in the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania.\n  Nearly nine years ago, people in the Lackawanna Valley pursued their \nvision to recognize the cultural, historical, natural, and recreational \nvalues that existed within the region. As such, partnerships were \nformed among federal, state, and local governments, in addition to \nlocal business interests, to move this idea forward. As those \npartnerships evolved, that cooperation produced ``The Plan for the \nLackawanna Heritage Valley.''\n  With the credo of ``community development through partnerships,'' the \nLHVA began developing a wide agenda of community projects that would \ncome to define the term ``heritage park.'' Specifically, the LHVA was \ninstrumental in creating the National Institute of Environmental \nRenewal, a ``living laboratory'' founded with the intention of \nidentification and clean-up of the Lackawanna Valley's scarred \nindustrial landscape. Through an adaptive re-use of a former school \nbuilding, there now exists a 100,000 square foot Education and \nTraining, Research and Development, and Technology Transfer Center.\n  Other projects taken on by the Authority include: construction of the \nLackawanna Trolley Museum; designation of the Lackawanna River Heritage \nTrail; development of the Olyphant Elementary School housing project; \nand the ``Young People's Heritage Festival.'' One of the most \nsignificant undertakings by LHVA partners has been a research document \ncommissioned by the National park Service and the PA Historical and \nMuseum Commission. The study, ``Anthracite Coal in Pennsylvania: an \nIndustry and a Region,'' concludes that, ``the anthracite industry of \nnortheastern Pennsylvania played a critical role in the expansion of \nthe American economy during the second quarter of the nineteenth \ncentury.''\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, with the support of \nSenator Specter, encourages the continuation of local interest by \ndemonstrating the federal government's commitment to preserving the \nunique heritage of the Lackawanna Valley. It would require the \nLackawanna Heritage Valley Authority to enter a compact with the \nSecretary of the Interior to establish Heritage Area boundaries, and to \nprepare and implement a management plan within three years. This plan \nwould inventory resources and recommend policies for resource \nmanagement interpretation. Further, based on the criteria of other \nHeritage Areas established by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands \nManagement Act of 1996, this bill requires that federal funds provided \nunder this bill do not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a culmination of the hard work and \ndiligence of many parties interested in preserving the cultural and \nnatural resources of the Lackawanna Valley. I believe this bill \nrepresents the positive impact public and private institutions can have \nwhen given the opportunity for collaboration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lackawanna Valley American \n     Heritage Area Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a grant program to enable States to \nestablish and maintain pilot drug testing and drug treatment programs \nfor welfare recipients engaging in illegal drug use, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     drug testing and treatment for welfare recipients act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Drug Testing and \nTreatment for Welfare Recipients Act of 1999. This legislation would \nestablish a pilot program encouraging up to 5 States to implement drug \ntesting and treatment programs for people receiving assistance through \nthe Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Block Grant (TANF); the AFDC \nreplacement established through the 1996 welfare reform law. It would \nfund these programs through three year competitive grants,\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\nproviding States with the resources and flexibility they need to \nestablish the most effective drug testing and treatment programs for \ntheir communities.\n  Mr. President, across the nation, welfare caseloads are dropping. \nMore and more welfare recipients are working to provide for their \nfamilies and moving closer to complete independence from public \nassistance. According to the Congressional Research Service, in March \nof 1994 5.1 million families received assistance through the Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children program (AFDC). By September of 1998, \nthose numbers had dropped to 2.9 million families receiving assistance \nthrough the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant \nprogram.\n  This 43% decline in the welfare caseload is encouraging. But it \nshould not stop our efforts to help those hard-to-serve cases still on \nthe rolls. Individuals who continue to receive welfare payments face \ndaunting barriers to employment. One such barrier is drug addiction. \nPeople who are addicted to drugs have great trouble concentrating, \nkeeping set schedules and maintaining basic order in their lives. For \nthem, steady employment is often simply out of reach.\n  According to the Administration's Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, drug abuse has plagued America for over a century. It has torn \nfamilies apart, regardless of socio-economic background as it has \ndestroyed individual lives and spawned crime and social breakdown. \nDrugs pose a threat to the individual, the family, and the community. \nIndividuals dependent on illegal substances cannot take care of \nthemselves, much less their children, and drug dependence often leads \nto other crimes. Desperate to feed their addiction, abusers are often \nforced into theft, assault, or even worse crimes in the search for that \nnext hit.\n  Today, an estimated 12.8 million Americans use illegal drugs. \nApproximately 45% of Americans know someone with a substance abuse \nproblem. And the problem is particularly acute among young people \npreparing to enter adult life and the adult workforce. 25 percent of \n12th graders still use illegal drugs regularly, as do 20 percent of \n10th graders and 12 percent of 8th graders.\n  To combat the debilitating effects of drugs on addicts and those \naround them, this bill would enable States to fund drug testing and \ntreatment programs for welfare recipients in their communities. It \nwould do this by establishing a three year competitive grant program. \nStates would apply for this grant by submitting a drug testing and \ntreatment plan for their welfare recipients. The Secretary of Health \nand Human Services would then award the grant to up to 5 states in the \namount of $1.5 million per year per state for three years, bringing the \ntotal cost of this grant program to $22.5 million.\n\n  The award decision will be based on two factors: (1) the need and \nability of the State to address drug abuse by welfare recipients and \n(2) the ability of the State to continue such testing and treatment \nprograms after the 3 year grant subsidies. Upon receiving the grant, \nStates would be required to distribute the monies to entities already \nreceiving funds through the Federal Substance Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment block grant (SAPT), the primary tool the federal government \nuses to support State substance abuse prevention and treatment \nprograms. The States may allocate the funds in any manner they deem \nappropriate to establish programs that best serve their communities.\n  Mr. President, we often talk about breaking the cycle of poverty, and \nI believe that goes hand in hand with winning the drug war. I would \nlike to read a brief quotation from the Administration's Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy's National Drug Control Strategy. I think \nit makes an important point: ``While drug use and its consequences \nthreaten Americans of every socio-economic background * * * the effects \nof drug use are often felt disproportionally. Neighborhoods where \nillegal drug markets flourish are plagued by attendant crime and \nviolence.'' I have always been a strong advocate of community renewal \nand I truly believe that when we begin building drug-free families, \nsafer streets, safer communities and more opportunities for our \nnation's economically disadvantaged will follow.\n  Treatment for welfare recipients engaged in illegal drug use is the \nmost important form of assistance they will ever receive. The Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy points out that ``Americans who lack \ncomprehensive health plans and have smaller incomes may be less able to \nafford treatment programs to overcome drug dependence.''\n  Mr. President, this bill would put drug treatment dollars in the \nhands of those who need it most. States need these funds to help \nfinance more comprehensive treatment programs not covered by Medicaid. \nComprehensive services are desperately needed for the most serious \nvictims of drug abuse. This grant program constitutes a small \ninvestment that would encourage States to address drug abuse by welfare \nrecipients, further reducing rates of welfare dependency and other \nsocial problems related to drug addiction.\n  Ultimately, our goal is to help individuals provide for their \nfamilies and achieve independence by breaking the cycle of dependency. \nThis legislation will help significantly in that effort and I encourage \nmy colleagues to give it their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-\nby-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 906\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the right to life of each born and preborn \nhuman person in existence at fertilization; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       right to life act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nthe Right to Life Act of 1999.\n  Our Nation's founding document, the Declaration of Independence, \ndeclared for all the world that we hold it to be self-evident that the \nright to life comes from God and that it is unalienable. Life itself, \nthe Declaration held, is the fundamental right without which the rights \nto liberty and the pursuit of happiness have to meaning. As the author \nof the Declaration, Thomas Jefferson, later wrote, ``The care of human \nlife and not its destruction . . . is the first and only object of good \ngovernment.''\n  Almost 200 years after the Declaration of Independence, however, in \n1973, the United States Supreme Court violated its most sacred \nprinciple. In Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court held that the entire \nclass of unborn children--from fertilization to birth--have no right to \nlife and may be destroyed at will. In subsequent cases, the Court has \nzealously guarded the right to abortion that it created. The Court has \nrepeatedly rejected all meaningful attempts by the States to protect \nthe unalienable right to life of unborn children.\n  Those of us who proudly count ourselves to be members of the right-\nto-life movement must not lose sight of our ultimate goal. Our \nobjective is to keep the Declaration's promise by reversing Roe versus \nWade and restoring to unborn children their God-given right to life. In \norder to keep that hope alive in the Senate, I am introducing today the \n``Right to Life Act of 1999.''\n  My bill first sets forth several findings of Congress regarding the \nfundamental right to life and the tragic constitutional errors of Roe \nversus Wade. Based on these findings and in the exercise of the powers \nof the Congress under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, and \nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, my bill \nestablishes that ``the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is \nvested in each human being at fertilization.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill, the \n``Right to Life Act of 1999,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Right to Life Act of 1999''.\n       Sec. 2. The Congress finds that--\n       (1) we, as a Nation, have declared that the unalienable \n     right to life endowed by Our Creator is guaranteed by our \n     Constitution for each human person:\n       (2) the Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 at \n     159), stated: ``We need not resolve the difficult question of \n     when life begins . . . the judiciary at this point in the \n     development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to \n     speculate as to the answer . . .'';\n       (3) the Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 at 156-\n     157), stated: ``If this suggestion of personhood is \n     established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for \n     the fetus' right to life is then guaranteed specifically by \n     the [Fourteenth] Amendment . . .'';\n       (4) the Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade stated that the \n     privacy right is not absolute, and stated (410 U.S. 113, at \n     159) that: ``The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her \n     privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus. . . . The \n     woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy \n     she possesses must be measured accordingly.'';\n       (5) a human father and mother beget a human offspring when \n     the father's sperm fertilizes the mother's ovum, and the life \n     of each preborn human person begins at fertilization;\n       (6) there is no justification for any Federal, State, or \n     private action intentionally to kill an innocent born or \n     preborn human person, and that Federal, State, and private \n     action must assure equal care and protection for the right to \n     life of both a pregnant mother and her preborn child in \n     existence at fertilization;\n       (7) Americans and our society suffer from the evils of \n     killing even one innocent born or preborn human person, and \n     each day suffer the torture and slaughter of an estimated \n     4,000 preborn persons;\n       (8) the intentional killing of preborn human persons occurs \n     in Federal enclaves, in interstate commerce activities, and \n     in the States, estimated at 1,500,000 per year and 33,000,000 \n     since 1973; and\n       (9) the violence of intentionally killing a preborn human \n     person has provoked more violence, carnage, and conflict \n     reaching into homes, schools, churches, workplaces and lives \n     of Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3. RIGHT TO LIFE.\n\n       Upon the basis of these findings and in the exercise of \n     duty, authority, and powers of the Congress, including its \n     power under Article I, Section 8, to make necessary and \n     proper laws, and including its power under section 5 of the \n     14th article of amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, the Congress hereby declares that the right to life \n     guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being \n     at fertilization.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF STATE.\n\n       For the purpose of this Act, the term ``State'' used in the \n     14th article of amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States and other applicable provisions of the Constitution \n     includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, and each other territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 908. A bill to establish a comprehensive program to ensure the \nsafety of food products intended for human consumption that are \nregulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                    consumer food safety act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation Wednesday to \nimprove the safety of the nation's food supply, by increasing \neducational efforts for food processors and handlers and the frequency \nof inspections for some of them. The bill also establishes new \nmechanisms for identifying food processors and handlers who originate \ncontaminated food in order to improve federal recall and food safety \nlaw enforcement action.\n  Farmers produce high quality products and expect them to reach the \nconsumer with the same high quality\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\nstandards observed. Farmers and consumers both have an interest in \nassuring the unquestioned safety of our food.\n  The new global economy is another reason for strengthening the \nnations' food safety laws. With the new global economy, we have food \nmoving around the world without much understanding of where its coming \nfrom, who produced it, and under what conditions. I think it calls for \na much more rigorous food inspections, not only for the safety of \nconsumers, but to safeguard the reputation of the products our farmers \nproduce.\n  Another important feature of the bill is new authority for inspection \nof food and food products at the border as they enter the United States \nfrom foreign countries, and in some cases inspections at food \nprocessing plants located in foreign countries.\n  A similar bill will be introduced shortly in the U.S. House by \nRepresentative Frank Pallone (D-NJ), underscoring the urban-rural, \nproducer-consumer nature of the new drive for improved food safety \nlaws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url":

The order shall bar future claims \n     for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages.

or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence a legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, or offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\n     paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the notice and \n     remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure To Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contact, or a statute enacted before January \n     1, 1999, requires notice of nonperformance and provides for a \n     period of delay prior to the initiation of suit for breach or \n     repudiation of contract, the period of delay provided by \n     contract or the statute is controlling over the waiting \n     period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or \n     State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amended, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c) whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal \n     or State law against the person responsible for that Y2K \n     failure to the extent of recovering the amount of those \n     damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach or repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     element of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation of Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n     (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for who special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determination of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, systems, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee or employee from the business or \n     organization during that 12 months immediatley preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is inmposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n     regarding any actual or potential year 2000 problem of that \n     business or organization which would likely result in \n     actionable Y2K failure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         DODD AMENDMENT NO. 287\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DODD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill, S. 96, supra;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n     supports good faith negotiations between parties when there \n     is a dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) Personal injury.--The term ``personal injury'' means \n     physical injury to a natural person, including--\n       (A) death as a result of a physical injury; and\n       (B) mental suffering, emotional distress, or similar \n     injuries suffered by that person in connection with a \n     physical injury.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (7) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (8) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\n     (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, a \n     defendant knowingly committed fraud if the defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy;

or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The Written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissibility.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\n     the plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint \n     as such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee,\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\n     or employee of such a business or organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Minimum Injury Requirement.--A Y2K action involving a \n     claim that a product or service is defective may be \n     maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to \n     that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Notification.--In any Y2K action that is maintained as \n     a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice \n     required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct \n     notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the \n     action;\n       (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and\n       (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the \n     hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the \n     percentage of the final award which will be paid, including \n     as estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the \n     requested damages were to be granted.\n       (c) Forum for Y2K Class Actions.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     Y2K action may be brought as a class action in a United \n     States District Court or removed to a United States District \n     Court if the amount in controversy is greater than the sum or \n     value of $1,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), \n     computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--A Y2K action may not be brought or removed \n     as a class action under this section if--\n       (A) a substantial majority of the members of the proposed \n     plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;\n       (B) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and\n       (C) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the \n     law of that State, or\n\n     the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other \n     governmental entities against whom the United States District \n     Court may be foreclosed from ordering relief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 293\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for Mr. Lott) proposed an amendment to amendment No. 292 \nproposed by Mr. Lott to the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``with'' and insert \n     ``Instructions to report forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\n     subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to \n     the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy;

or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The Written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissibility.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Minimum Injury Requirement.--A Y2K action involving a \n     claim that a product or service is defective may be \n     maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to \n     that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Notification.--In any Y2K action that is maintained as \n     a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice \n     required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct \n     notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the \n     action;\n       (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and\n       (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the \n     hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the \n     percentage of the final award which will be paid, including \n     as estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the \n     requested damages were to be granted.\n       (c) Forum for Y2K Class Actions.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     Y2K action may be brought as a class action in a United \n     States District Court or removed to a United States District \n     Court if the amount in controversy is greater than the sum or \n     value of $1,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), \n     computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--A Y2K action may not be brought or removed \n     as a class action under this section if--\n       (A) a substantial majority of the members of the proposed \n     plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;\n       (B) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and\n       (C) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the \n     law of that State, or\n     the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other \n     governmental entities\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\n     against whom the United States District Court may be \n     foreclosed from ordering relief.\n       (D) This section shall become effective five days after the \n     date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 294\n\n  Mr. LOTT proposed an amendment to the motion to recommit proposed by \nhim to the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the instructions add the following:\n\n     with an amendment as follows:\n       Strike all after the word ``SECTION'' and add the \n     following:\n\n     1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n     damages. A claim for contribution shall be determined based \n     on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant and of \n     each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy;

or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The Written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissibility.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Minimum Injury Requirement.--A Y2K action involving a \n     claim that a product or service is defective may be \n     maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to \n     that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Notification.--In any Y2K action that is maintained as \n     a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice \n     required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct \n     notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the \n     action;\n       (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and\n       (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the \n     hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the \n     percentage of the final award which will be paid, including \n     as estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the \n     requested damages were to be granted.\n       (c) Forum for Y2K Class Actions.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     Y2K action may be brought as a class action in a United \n     States District Court or removed to a United States District \n     Court if the amount in controversy is greater than the sum or \n     value of $1,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), \n     computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--A Y2K action may not be brought or removed \n     as a class action under this section if--\n       (A) a substantial majority of the members of the proposed \n     plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;\n       (B) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and\n       (C) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the \n     law of that State, or\n\n     the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other \n     governmental entities against whom the United States District \n     Court may be foreclosed from ordering relief.\n       (D) This section shall become effective four days after the \n     date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 295\n\n  Mr. LOTT proposed an amendment to amendment No. 294 proposed by Mr. \nLott to the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``1'' and add the following:\n\n     SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF SECTIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Y2K Act''.\n       (b) Table of Sections.--The table of sections for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\n     time remaining before January 1, 2000, on assessing, fixing, \n     testing, and developing contingency plans to address any and \n     all outstanding year 2000 computer date-change problems, so \n     as to minimize possible disruptions associated with computer \n     failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) Personal injury.--The term ``personal injury'' means \n     physical injury to a natural person, including--\n       (A) death as a result of a physical injury; and\n       (B) mental suffering, emotional distress, or similar \n     injuries suffered by that person in connection with a \n     physical injury.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (7) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (8) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy;

or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16.

Rosenthal, appeared in the \nNew York Times on April 9, 1999.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n       Do Americans understand that while we have been bombing the \n     Serbs, the following took place:\n       Libya was exonerated from responsibility in the destruction \n     of Pan AM 103.\n       Saddam Hussein's closedown of the U.N. search for Iraq's \n     nuclear, chemical and biological weapons went into its eighth \n     month. Richard Butler, the chief arms inspector, was barred \n     Wednesday by the Russians from even entering the U.N. \n     Security Council chamber where his inspection commission was \n     the agenda, marked for death.\n       China's Prime Minister was visiting America getting a great \n     press--plus a step nearer to a trade agreement that will \n     fatten China's economy and armed forces. On the day Zhu \n     Rongji arrived in Washington representing the Communist \n     politburo, President Clinton criticized not China's expanding \n     arrests of political and religious dissidents, but American \n     critics of China.\n       So: do Americans understand that while we fight one \n     dictatorship, fumbling around trying to heighten the war and \n     somehow end it at the same time, three other dictatorships \n     more dangerous to American interests are walking away with \n     America's pants?\n       The Libya deal was possible because the Administration \n     signed off on it. This sweetheart gift to Col. Muammar el-\n     Qaddafi ends the effective sanctions imposed on Libya for \n     harboring two Libyans accused of murdering 270 people in the \n     bombing of Pan AM 103 on Dec. 21, 1988.\n       American intelligence agents are not allowed to ask the \n     suspects now held in the Netherlands if perchance Qaddafi \n     knew what his boys were up to or Syria and Iran were \n     involved--as Western intelligence agencies had long believed. \n     And during the trial itself, Libya's Government is not to be \n     undermined, hear?\n       For Libya, a no-loser. Even if the men are found guilty, \n     the sanctions will remain ended. Italy, Russia, France and \n     other countries have already lined up fat oil and gas deals \n     with Libya. U.S. companies will follow. The deal is \n     disgusting, an insult to the dead and their families, and to \n     all, who fly in U.S. planes.\n       Do Americans understand that the U.S. delegation to the \n     U.N. did not stand up and holler at the barring of Mr. \n     Butler? Let's hope it will when he tries again today.\n       Do they understand that the President denounced U.S. \n     critics of China on the very day that Jeff Gerth and James \n     Risen of The Times were writing that even more Chinese \n     nuclear espionage took place than the reporters had already \n     disclosed? Another chapter in Chinese espionage was written \n     in 1995, reported to Samuel Berger, now the national security \n     adviser, in April 1996, who told the President in July 1997, \n     who ordered tightened security--in February 1998.\n       And do Americans understand that the Administration \n     disgraced itself in the war on Serbia?\n       Slobodan Milosevic, not America, is responsible for driving \n     cold, hungry, terrified Albanian Kosovars from their homes. \n     But Washington's disgrace is that President Clinton and his \n     top people did not know and did not expect that Mr. Milosevic \n     would use the bombing as an opportunity to expel them by the \n     hundreds of thousands. American leadership still does not \n     seem able to plan more than a couple of days ahead.\n       So we need no longer worry about America's credibility; we \n     have none.\n       For a democracy, credibility comes not just from smart \n     weapons but smart leaders, from respect for the intelligence \n     of the public, domestic and foreign, from a measure of \n     honesty. In a democracy, pretense in war or peace is \n     transparent, embarrassing and finally self-destructive.\n       We need not and should not support Kosovar secession. But \n     we helped Mr. Milosevic in his fight with the Kosovars by not \n     foreseeing his mass expulsion plans, and not having our own \n     plans that would treat the Serbian nation as something more \n     than a bombing target.\n       ``When at war, support the troops.'' To me, that means \n     making sure they have the strength they need, the affection, \n     respect--and doable mission.\n       What is does not mean is keeping our mouths shut about \n     misconduct of a war by an American Government--or about its \n     failure to protect American interests in other crises that \n     may inconveniently present themselves. That's not supporting \n     American armed forces, but walking away from them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4395-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST CHURCH OF SAN DIEGO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the First \nUnitarian Universalist Church of San Diego as it celebrates 125 years \nof religious freedom. The First Unitarian Universalist Church of San \nDiego enjoys a rich history in San Diego. Founded in 1873, the Church \nhas continued to grow into a diverse community of over 3,000 members \nwith differing beliefs yet shared values.\n  The First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego is an important \npart of the spiritual lives of thousands of San Diegans. In 1890, \nfounder Lydia Horton helped to pioneer women's rights through the \nChurch. Today, it continues that tradition of activism by working for \nenvironmental protection, gay and lesbian rights, and women's equality. \nIn the local community, the Church is fighting discrimination and \nilliteracy, building schools in underserved neighborhoods, and teaching \nSan Diego's children the value of community involvement.\n  The Church encourages members of its congregation to develop their \nown religious wisdoms, truthful to themselves and respectful of others.\n  For thriving 125 years in San Diego, I salute the First Unitarian \nUniversalist Church of San Diego and wish them many successful years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4395-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4395-S4396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE WORLD CLASS SCHOLARS PROGRAM, ABERDEEN, WA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a constant theme heard in the \neconomic\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\nnews of our country is the dramatic success and sustained growth of our \nnation's economy. My own state of Washington has been particularly \nfortunate in that regard, even give the much-talked about ``Asian \nflu.'' Not all of Washington's communities, however, have been so \nlucky. Among those is Aberdeen, in Grays Harbor County. Unemployment in \nAberdeen is double the state average; over 17 percent of the county \ndepends on public assistance as a primary source of income; and 27 \npercent of the adult population has not completed high school. To \ncombat these issues, the Aberdeen School District and Grays Harbor \nCommunity College came together in 1993 to create the World Class \nScholars program which I am pleased to present with one of my \nInnovation in Education Awards.\n  Recognizing that students were struggling to finish their education \nand would therefore be unqualified for many of the well paying \ntechnology-based jobs in Washington state, local educators created a \nnew path to reach these workers of tomorrow--the World Class Scholars \nProgram. The school district and community college agreed that students \nin the scholars program would automatically be accepted into the local \ncommunity college, receive scholarship assistance and college credit \nfor college-level work completed in high school. In return, students \nmust follow through on a pledge made in the 7th grade to graduate with \na ``B'' average. Students in the program also agree to demonstrate \nleadership and other interpersonal skills, volunteer at school or in \nthe community, and become technologically proficient. This is exactly \nthe kind of jump-start this community needed to encourage students to \ncomplete their education and to ensure that recent graduates have the \ntools necessary to compete for today's high-paying jobs.\n  Each year, the number of students and volunteers involved in the \nWorld Class Scholars program continues to grow. But, perhaps of great \nmention, the number of other school districts participating throughout \nthe county in collaboration with Grays Harbor Community College has \nalso grown. In two years, the first class of high school students will \ngraduate and the community's pledge to provide them with continued \neducation will be honored. Clearly, Aberdeen and surrounding school \ndistricts have needs that are different, perhaps unique, from other \nlocalities throughout Washington state. They have met this problem head \non and are well on the way to making their community a better place to \nlive. The response of the Grays Harbor community perfectly demonstrates \nthat local educators really do know best.\n  In presenting my Innovation in Education Awards, I fall back on this \ncommon-sense idea, that it is parents and educators the who look our \nchildren in the eye every day that know best how to educate them. For \ntoo long, the federal government has been telling local schools that \nWashington, DC bureaucrats know best. Educators across Washington state \nand throughout the country, like those involved in the World Class \nScholars program, deserve more decision-making authority they deserve \nand I pledge to work hard to return that power to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4396-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4396-S4399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMARKS BY DR. HENRY BUCHWALD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I offer for the Record the text \nof a lecture delivered at the Central Surgical Association by Dr. Henry \nBuchwald, Professor of Surgery at the University of Minnesota. Dr. \nBuchwald, a past president of the association, is a highly regarded \nsurgeon, and as we address Medicare reform and related matters in the \nmonths ahead, I believe we would do well to consider his words. At this \ntime, I ask that excerpts of Dr. Henry Buchwald's presidential address \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n  Presidential Address: A Clash of Cultures--Personal Autonomy Versus \n                           Corporate Bondage\n\n                        (By Henry Buchwald, MD)\n\n\n                           personal autonomy\n\n       A constellation of principles embody the personality of the \n     surgeon. At its core are the tradition and the ethos of \n     personal autonomy. One of the distinguished past presidents \n     of the Central Surgical Association, Donald Silver, who has \n     been a role model for me, entitled his 1992 presidential \n     address, ``Responsibilities and Rights.'' He allowed very few \n     intrinsic rights to surgeons, but first among the limited \n     prerogatives he granted was autonomy.\n       As surgeons, we tend to be individualists and to espouse \n     individual responsibility. To us, maturity means being \n     responsible for our actions. We keep our commitments. We view \n     fiscal independence as essential. We take pride in earning a \n     living and, should we have a family, in providing for its \n     needs. To give the gift of an education to our children has \n     been integral to our aspirations.\n       The years of medical school, residency, and the post-\n     postgraduate education of clinical practice finally give \n     birth to a surgeon. This individual has acquired a base of \n     knowledge and the insight to apply facts and rational \n     suppositions to the care of patients. This individual has \n     obtained operating room skills secured by observation, trial \n     and error, repetition, and respect for tissues and tissue \n     planes and has learned the art of being gentle with a firm \n     and steady hand. The surgeon has been sobered by death, by \n     bad results, by the frustration of the inadequacies of even \n     the most modern medical advances, and by the vagaries of \n     human nature that obstruct the best of intentions and \n     efforts. The surgeon has acknowledged fallibility and his or \n     her power to do harm. The surgeon has become comfortable in a \n     profession in which decisions are singular and responsibility \n     is particular. The mature surgeon has achieved personal \n     autonomy.\n       Within our company of surgeons we take just pride in our \n     accomplishments. We are a distinct discipline with a unique \n     body of knowledge. We are, for the most part, successful. We \n     save lives, we increase life expectancy, we enhance the \n     quality of existence. In addition, we have provided society \n     with numerous competent surgical practitioners and built \n     dynasties of surgical educators and researchers--individuals \n     who bridge the present with the future of our profession.\n       Unfortunately, this golden age for surgery and the personal \n     autonomy of the individual surgeon are threatened with \n     imminent destruction by a force that will, if not countered \n     and checked, lead us into corporate bondage. I will term this \n     force administocracy.\n\n\n                           corporate bondage\n\n       Ideally, the role of health care administration is to \n     facilitate the work of physicians and health care personnel. \n     But the chief administrators in our health care institutions \n     and universities are no longer facilitators. They now seek \n     to control. They have been redefining medical practice, \n     clinics, academic departments, and universities on a \n     corporate model, a model that subverts the essential \n     nature of an intellectual society, a model totally alien \n     to the definition of a university as a community.\n       Administrocracy, the term I have coined to epitomize this \n     force, is the rule of centralized administration, based on \n     the top-down control of money, resources, and opportunities. \n     Its primary beneficiaries are the administrative hierarchy. \n     Administocracy has established itself as a new ruling class, \n     an order clearly separated from the toilers in the vineyard \n     of medicine. Administocracy is governance not by facilitation \n     but by intimidation. Administocracy has gained or is gaining \n     control of our medical schools, our teaching and community \n     hospitals, and our current means of providing health care. I \n     will outline administocracy's practices, codified into its \n     own perverted Ten Commandments.\n       I: Thou shalt have no other system. The glory of our \n     nation's democracy, the longest surviving democracy in the \n     history of the world, is its ability to tolerate \n     differences--to take new initiatives and then to retrench, to \n     be liberal and to be conservative--and, concurrently, to be \n     responsible to the will of the governed and to the precepts \n     of fundamental code of principles and individual rights. An \n     autocracy, on the other hand, denies flexibility and \n     governance alternatives. An autocracy's overriding objective \n     and only goal, regardless of any protestations of working for \n     the common good, is its own perpetuation. By definition, such \n     a system denies the will of the governed and refuses \n     recognition of individual rights.\n       Administocracy is, of course, an autocracy. Once in power, \n     administocracy's first order of business is to replicate \n     itself. For example, in 1993 the academic administocracy at \n     the University of Minnesota cut 435 civil service positions, \n     while simultaneously adding 45 more executives and \n     administrators.\\1\\ The Office of the Senior Vice President \n     for Health Sciences at Minnesota, a unit that did not even \n     exist some years ago, now has 25 members.\n       The growth of medical administocracy is the result of \n     genuine problems in the distribution of health care, \n     including cost problems not adequately addressed by the \n     medical profession itself. Our failure, or inability, to take \n     action on these issues has allowed outsiders and opportunists \n     within our own profession to hijack the delivery of health \n     care. Among practicing physicians, a general ennui and a lack \n     of resistance have been the reactions to the administocracies \n     that are becoming our overlords. Perhaps one reason for this \n     seeming complacency is that, individually, physicians feel \n     powerless when faced with the well-organized, implacable \n     machine of administocracy--an entity that knows its purpose \n     and will use any means to attain its goals. Another reason is \n     well expressed by Thurber's paraphrase of\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\n     Lincoln: ``You can fool too many of the people too much of \n     the time.''\\2\\\n       II: Thou shalt make new images. In his classic novel 1984, \n     Orwell beautifully illustrated the power of language and its \n     willful distortion by governments. His use of ostensibly \n     neutral words for disguising uncomforting realities set the \n     standards for the current proliferation of Orwell's \n     ``Newspeak.'' \\3\\ The medical and academic administocracies \n     of today have devised their own Orwellian glossary of \n     deception, often borrowing and redefining phrases from \n     corporate industry and the military.\n       CEO, for chief executive officer, obviously comes from the \n     corporate world. In academia and in hospital administration, \n     it means a titular despot who controls the destiny and income \n     of faculty and staff.\n       Reporting to and chain of command come from the military. \n     These designations of caste and of obedience have not only \n     been fully accepted by members of our profession but actually \n     embraced and fostered by certain of our colleagues.\n       Executive management group means a cluster of deans.\n       Managed care is a euphemism for reducing patient services \n     and physicians' fees to redistribute income to the ever-\n     increasing number of administrators.\n       Utilization review stands for a bureaucratic sleight of \n     hand to justify a predetermined reduction in patient services \n     and health care personnel.\n       Market and consumer mean patient.\n       Market share means the number of patients you can hold \n     hostage in a provider network.\n       Health care team means that the physician is only as \n     essential to patient care as the multitude of people who \n     stare into computers on nursing stations.\n       Vendor means you, the doctor.\n       II: Thou shalt take what is in vain: reengineer. \n     Reengineering is the golden calf of administrocracy and takes \n     in vain much of what we hold sacred. Reengineering would \n     substitute dicta for scientific inquiry, the ``clean sheet'' \n     for methodology, and assumptions for acquired knowledge. \n     Reengineering has never been critically tested, certainly not \n     in academia and hospital administration. No randomized \n     clinical trials of reengineering have ever been conducted.\n       The definitions of reengineering are all quite similar. \n     Michael Hammer and James Champy, two of the principal writers \n     and consultants in the field, define it as follows: ``the \n     fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business \n     processes, management systems, and structures of the business \n     to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary \n     measures of performance such as cost, quality service, and \n     speed.'' \\4\\\n       The stages of reengineering are usually listed by its \n     author advocates as preparing for change, planning for \n     change, designing for change, implementing change, and \n     evaluating change. Obviously, ``change'' is the key message, \n     often spoken of as ``swift and radical change.'' Initiates to \n     reengineering are instructed that it is essential to start \n     this swift and radical change with the proverbial ``blank \n     sheet of paper.'' Besides the logical fallacy of changing \n     that which is blank, the sheet of paper is not blank; it \n     contains our heritage. To start with a blank sheet means to \n     erase the past. This concept of eliminating what we have \n     painstakingly learned denies the most fundamental precept \n     that we, as teachers, have passed on to generations of our \n     students; namely, know the past and build on it. That way \n     offers progress. Paul's First Epistle to the Thessalonians \n     (5:21) states ``Prove all things; hold fast that which is \n     good.''\n       If we do not learn from experience, from accumulated data \n     and analyses, we will continually repeat history, and often \n     bad history. Reengineering is a denial of the methodology of \n     learned skills to deal with the business at hand, a denial of \n     accumulated knowledge, a denial of the wisdom based on that \n     knowledge. It is an abrogation of the scientific method.\n       In too much of the corporate-industrial world, \n     reengineering has been the death blow to the company as \n     family, a place to work with pride until retirement. In its \n     place, reengineering has imposed the lean and mean corporate \n     model of harsh downsizing--an organization devoid of workers' \n     loyalty; characterized by a disregard for the customer in \n     favor of the stockholder, plagued with a heavy load of debt, \n     and ripe for a merger, conglomerate integration, and, \n     eventually, extinction.\n       But enlightened industry has been abandoning reengineering, \n     and the gurus of this nonsense have found it profitable to \n     shift their expensive consultative services to academia and \n     health care. Many of our associates have bitten hard into \n     this apple of poisoned knowledge: Harvard, Tufts, Columbia, \n     Cornell, Stanford, the University of California-San \n     Francisco, Michigan, Henry Ford, and Minnesota are just some \n     of the great institutions that have, to one degree or \n     another, adopted reengineering. Physician-administrators, \n     with little or no experience in the business world, are \n     pushing hard to sell reengineering as a panacea for success \n     and good fortune in the health sciences and in health care. \n     They are huckstering a placebo.\n       The former provost of the University of Minnesota Academic \n     Health Center and current president of Johns Hopkins, Dr. \n     William R. Brody, brought the aforementioned James Champy to \n     a University of Minnesota ``leadership retreat'' in July of \n     1995. At that meeting Mr. Champy, was quoted as saying: ``We \n     live in debate . . . but you may have to exercise powers and \n     say sometimes., `The debate is over. This is the way we are \n     going to be.' . . . visions are not built by groups . . . \n     people in organizations want to be told what to do . . . \n     There is a thirst for leadership, for top-down direction.'' \n     \\1\\\n       Champy gave this advice pro bono. Eventually, however, his \n     consulting firm, CSC Index, was paid $2.2 million by the \n     University of Minnesota to put his philosophy into \n     practice.\\1\\\n       Ever since the Brody mindset took hold of the university's \n     administocracy, I have listened to speech after speech \n     emphasizing that ``everything is on the table'' (freely \n     translated to mean--tell us what you have so that we can \n     take it away from you), and that the ultimate goal of \n     reengineering was the ``reinvention of the academic health \n     center.'' I was also present when straightforward \n     questions about a prospective hospital merger were met \n     with evasion and statements such as ``The negotiations are \n     as yet too delicate to be openly discussed'' and ``I am \n     not at liberty to provide these details.'' Only when the \n     secret discussions had been concluded and the final \n     decisions had already been made were faculty members \n     informed of the swift and radical changes that would \n     forever affect their lives and that these changes were \n     ``non-negotiable.''\n       IV: Thou shalt keep horizontal integration holy. In the \n     application of reengineering to academia and health care, the \n     basic work unit is achieved by horizontal integration across \n     disciplines. The medical community until recently has been \n     discipline oriented. The change to horizontal integration \n     represents a major paradigm shift. This change means that a \n     patient would proceed not from one physician to other \n     disciplinary specialists, as needed, but would be referred to \n     a disease- or system-complex of physicians. This unit has \n     been designated as a disease-based cluster, also called in \n     various institutions a center, an institute, a service-line \n     unit, and an interdisciplinary service program. The disease-\n     based cluster is an imposition on patient care of management \n     by a standing committee.\n       Contrary to the promises of the administocrats, life within \n     the horizontally integrated unit is far from utopian. Because \n     the income allocated to the unit by the administocrats is \n     distributed by formula to the members of the disease-based \n     cluster, the fewer members in the cluster, the more money for \n     those who are retained. That formula encourages the urge to \n     lighten ship. In this cluster, the members of the group have \n     yielded the control of their practice and of their personal \n     income to the group mentality. The surgeon is an employee of \n     this group of primarily nonsurgeons, a fully salaried \n     employee with few, if any, financial incentives.\n       Further, each cluster decides on the optimal time \n     management for its employees. Economic unit pressure will \n     limit the amount of time allocated for teaching and for \n     research. If you want to teach, you will be told that \n     extensive teaching is a luxury that the unit cannot afford \n     for its surgeons. You will be told to limit your time with \n     medical students and to limit the operating room time you \n     offer residents, because this use of time does not serve the \n     market-driven goals of your new workplace. Time spent in \n     laboratory research by members of a clinical unit, especially \n     the unit's surgeons, will be restricted or disallowed, \n     because it would most assuredly decrease the unit's ability \n     to compete in the clinical marketplace. Although the surgeon \n     is the main stoker of the unit's economic furnace, decisions \n     for the individual surgeon's distribution of time will no \n     longer be at his or her discretion, but rather at the \n     discretion of the economic will of the group. And, because \n     the surgeon must spend an extensive amount of time in the \n     operating room, the director of this disease-based cluster \n     will, more than likely, not be a surgeon.\n       Where are the positive incentives for surgeons in the \n     horizontally integrated unit? We have seen that the incentive \n     is not in money, in teaching, or in research. Is it in the \n     practice of our craft? Even that pleasure may not be allowed. \n     Disease management in the cluster will be by what has been \n     termed clinical pathways. This means surgery by the numbers; \n     every surgeon will do the same procedure for a specific \n     problem, in exactly the same manner, with a prescribed set of \n     instructions for the use of nasogastric tubes, drains, \n     antibiotics, alimentation, and so on. This assembly-line \n     concept of surgery represents the ultimate destruction of the \n     autonomy of the surgeon.\n       What will be left? The negative incentives of job security \n     and the threat of punishment for expressions of \n     individuality. Criteria for employment will be obedience to \n     the group and a proper sense of beholdenness.\n       The emergence of horizontal integration in reengineered \n     institutions is being vigorously proselytized by its \n     advocates. Indeed, several plenary sessions at the 1997 \n     meeting of the American College of Surgeons gave podium time \n     to the leading proponents of horizontal integration, but none \n     to its opponents. A more balanced analysis of this ``brave \n     new world'' is needed. In the words of Aldous Huxley: \n     ``Thought must be divided against itself before it can come \n     to any knowledge of itself.'' \\5\\\n       V: Dishonor thy father and thy mother. The professional \n     fathers and mothers of practicing doctors of medicine are the \n     departments of the medical school. For use as surgeons, our \n     professional parent is the department of surgery. Most of us \n     have a\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\n     strong allegiance to the departments that trained us and to \n     those we now represent. We cite the teachings of our \n     department as a justification for what we do and what we \n     believe. We extol the achievements of the heroes of our \n     department, and we have been known to contest between \n     departments with fierce team loyalties. We tell departmental \n     anecdotes into our dotage.\n       Historically, the strongest medical schools have had the \n     most powerful departments. Feudalism may not have been an \n     intellectual success in the Middle Ages, but it has been \n     the appropriate medical school governance system for our \n     golden age of surgery. The independent department of \n     surgery has, as a rule, been financially sound. It is \n     able, therefore, to provide its faculty, in addition to a \n     clinical practice, research opportunities, as well as the \n     time to teach and to travel. The clinical atmosphere is \n     exciting, allowing faculty to interact with questioning \n     residents, and, through grand rounds and mortality and \n     morbidity conferences, offering the best second opinions \n     available anywhere. Independent departments gave birth to \n     independent individuals, who had the imagination, \n     innovative spirit, incentive, and drive to make surgery in \n     the United States the best and the most envied in the \n     world.\n       Reengineering would have us deny our departments, abandon \n     them as mere relics. We are being told to dishonor our \n     parental heritage and to deprive future generations of its \n     nurturing. Horizontal integration is the death knell of the \n     strong department of surgery as we know it. Independent \n     departments that give rise to individualists are anathema to \n     an administocracy, which would replace departmental parenting \n     with the cloning of conformists.\n       The proponents of radical change are proposing that \n     departments, for now, be maintained only for teaching \n     students and lower levels of residents, and that their income \n     will somehow be supplied by the dean of the medical school, \n     to whom they will be indebted. The department chairs who will \n     head these units will no longer be selected for scholarship, \n     clinical acumen, and research accomplishments, but for \n     administrative experience and political aspirations. As the \n     lowest tier of the administocracy, they will not uphold or \n     defend the department. In the future this system will \n     eliminate clinical departments altogether, including their \n     independent research, and delegate the teaching of the \n     basic's of surgery to other than practicing surgeons.\n       VI: Thou shalt kill tenure. Tenure had its origins in the \n     high Middle Ages and into the Reformation when royal edicts \n     protected the person of the scholar and guaranteed safe \n     passage.\\6\\ As the university tradition developed on the \n     continent and at Cambridge and Oxford, tenure became more of \n     a fortification against the internal threat of dismissal at \n     the pleasure of the clerical and political appointees who \n     constituted the administration of these universities.\\6\\\n       In the 1990s, once again, tenure has become a highly \n     charged controversy emerging from the academic cloister into \n     the everyday world. Tenure is under attack in institutions of \n     higher learning throughout the United States. This foundation \n     of academic freedom, which includes the tenets of due process \n     and freedom of expression, is being challenged as unwieldy \n     and as an impediment to progress in today's fast-moving world \n     and economy. It is seen as a barrier to effective top-down \n     university administration. A lifelong commitment of \n     appointment for faculty is being considered an unreasonable \n     limit to a university's competitiveness. Tenure-track \n     appointments per se are becoming more and more difficult to \n     obtain, and the possibility of abolishing tenure is a current \n     reality.\n       In the field of medicine we have traditionally not been \n     strong advocates of the tenure system. Most surgeons, in and \n     out of academia, have usually thought of tenure as the \n     subterfuge of the weak and unaccomplished, the refuge of \n     idlers and ne'er-do-wells. For my part, however, I am a \n     strong proponent of tenure on principle and from experience. \n     I have seen the University of Minnesota administocracy \n     attempt to kill tenure. I have seen an outside consultant \n     lawyer, hired by the Board of Regents, write a new tenure \n     policy, subsequently put forth by the Board of Regents, that \n     would have seriously restricted many aspects of academic \n     freedom, denied due process, and allowed the disciplining of \n     faculty for not having ``a proper attitude of industry and \n     cooperation.'' I have seen the provost of the Academic Health \n     Center become the leading opponent of tenure at the \n     University of Minnesota and promise the state legislature to \n     destroy tenure in exchange for increased funding for his \n     personal vision of reengineering.\n       That threat to tenure has gone hand in hand with, and has \n     served as the primary impetus for, unionization efforts by \n     faculty, a turning to collective bargaining, the terminal \n     polarization of a university into ``them'' and ``us.'' The \n     union movement has been successful in some institutions and \n     almost successful in others. We must recognize that the \n     alternative before us is not between tenure or no tenure, but \n     between tenure or membership in a trade union.\n       Centuries of reflection, turmoil, and hard-earned victories \n     for freedom of expression within institutions of higher \n     learning are embodied in tenure. That 1000-year-old legacy \n     should not be swept aside by the know-nothing approach of \n     ``reinventing the university.'' In the final analysis, tenure \n     is the only protection that allows university faculty open \n     criticism of the administocracy. Make no mistake about it, \n     without tenure the outspoken individualists in the academic \n     departments of surgery will be among the first to be fired \n     for insubordination, for not having a proper attitude. \n     They will be fired without due process and without the \n     least concern for their productivity, hard work, loyalty, \n     and demonstrable accomplishments. If not for tenure, many \n     of our predecessors would not have survived to found and \n     to sustain the Central Surgical Association. If not for \n     tenure, many of us in this room would not be signing our \n     names as professor of surgery.\n       VII: Thou shalt not commit to more than one career option. \n     Once it was considered laudable in academia to pursue more \n     than one career option--to be a researcher, a teacher, a \n     consultant, as well as a practicing clinician. In the system \n     of administocracy, such pursuits are adulterous, and they are \n     prohibited. William Kelley, the apostle of linear career \n     tracks, has made the laboratory doctors the highest order in \n     the academic departmental hierarchy.\\7\\ They follow a \n     standard tenure track, spend little time with patients, and \n     obtain their income from grants and from the efforts of their \n     clinical-tract colleagues. Clinicians are confined, in turn, \n     to patient activities, can have no laboratories, and may do \n     only clinical research. Their primary job is to make the \n     money needed by a two-track department. If these clinical \n     doctors cannot keep up with the overall monetary demands, a \n     third and fluid group of physicians, fresh out of residency, \n     may be hired to see patients on a strict salary basis and to \n     generate a sufficient overage of income to maintain the \n     lifestyles of the nonclinicians.\n       Where does the double-threat, triple-threat, or even \n     quadruple-threat academic surgeon of yesterday and today fit \n     into such a system? He or she does not fit. Where is there \n     allowance for the person who has honed his or her clinical \n     judgment and operating room technique to achieve superb \n     clinical outcomes and is also known as an eminent researcher, \n     an outstanding teacher, and, possibly, an administrator-\n     educator in the field of surgery? We may not find such \n     renaissance individuals in the university of the first \n     century of the third millennium. Those who exist today--many \n     of them in this room--are the equivalents of the dinosaur. \n     Honored today for their stature, their breed is destined for \n     extinction.\n       VIII: Thou shalt steal. If the goal of administocracy is \n     power, the means to achieve that goal is the control of \n     money. For most of us, our incomes have been primarily \n     derived from patient care on a fee-for-service basis. In the \n     academic centers we ourselves allocated a percentage of our \n     income to research, to resident education, to travel, and to \n     departmental needs, as well as to paying a tithe to the dean. \n     Currently, we are being forced to acquiesce to a seizure of \n     our income at its source for redistribution outside of our \n     control, consent, and often, knowledge. The imposition of \n     layer upon layer of administrators and managers siphons off \n     money to pay for their income, for the maintenance of their \n     staff, and for the fulfillment of their, not our, \n     aspirations. What finally trickles down to surgeons is a \n     small fraction of the income we generate. In my opinion, this \n     is theft.\n       The proliferation of health care provider organizations has \n     given rise to a boom in building construction and occupancy \n     to provide for the newly created health care managers. CEOs \n     of managed care empires now take home millions of dollars \n     annually. This is not capitalism but the embodiment of the \n     Communist Manifesto: ``From each according to his abilities; \n     to each according to his needs.'' \\8\\ Apparently, \n     administocrats have the greatest needs. We have seen the \n     advent of a plethora of executives, echelons of supervisors, \n     authorizers of services, accountants, marketing and sales \n     personnel, secretaries, telephone operators, and so on--all \n     to do what we were able to do with a relatively minimal \n     support staff. What feeds these engines of power? Fewer \n     available patient services, less compensation for services, \n     and an unparalleled redistribution of what we, the surgeons, \n     earn. Whereas surgeons have a long and honorable history of \n     providing care free of charge to the needy, the new system, \n     through gatekeepers, restricts care for the needy and, \n     through capitation, provides income to the greedy.\n       IX. Thou shalt bear false witness. The administocracy \n     rewards or punishes faculty members in promotion and tenure \n     proceedings, bestows awards and recognition, and grants \n     institutional honors. The threat and implementation of both \n     false-positive and false-negative witnessing are standard \n     procedures in academic advancement and in the closure of \n     academic careers. In certain institutions this method of \n     control has extended to the misuse of the legal arm of \n     central administration and the subversion of the internal \n     judicial system of the university. Administocrats and their \n     attorneys have made up rules as they go, with no basis for \n     them in institutional regulations, the ``Calvin-ball'' \\9\\ \n     approach to adjudication. For those who insist on believing \n     that not all individuals in power can be corrupt and that \n     decency at some level must still exist, I cite the words of \n     17th century aphorist, Jean de La Bruyere: ``Even the best-\n     intentioned of great men need a few scoundrels around them; \n     there are some things that you cannot ask an honest man to \n     do.'' \\10\\\n       X: Thou shalt covet. Finally, we come to coveting (Exodus \n     20:17): ``Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, . . . \n     nor anything that is thy neighbor's.''\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\n       The administocracy does indeed covet your ``house,'' \n     because space is power. The personal space that you occupy \n     outisde of the hospital and clinic, your office and your \n     laboratory, is controlled by the administocracy. Allocation \n     decisions are made not to facilitate your work and not as an \n     incentive for productivity, but as a threat to achieve \n     conformity and to guarantee compliance with their policies. \n     When income is limited and proscribed, when the surgeon has \n     become a 100% employee, then space and the use of that space \n     become powerful inducements for faculty recruitment and \n     retention. Space become a means to form a faculty to fit the \n     new corporate mold. More than ever, space becomes a weapon to \n     enforce compliance and to deny personal autonomy.\n       If money and space have been removed from the surgeon's \n     control, how about the control of an individual's research? \n     Here, too, administocracy has moved in. The formerly \n     automatic forwarding of a properly prepared grant application \n     has recently been subjected to additional internal \n     institutional review and the threat of an institutional \n     refusal to forward certain grant applications. This newly \n     assumed institutional power has been termed a violation of \n     academic freedom by a regional president of the American \n     Association of University Professors.\\1\\ Ongoing grants have \n     been challenged by administocrats, with attempts at mandating \n     personnel changes on a faculty research team. Faculty peer \n     committees to supervise proper contract relations with \n     industry have been disbanded and replaced by an administrator \n     or a group subservient to the administocracy. Autonomy of \n     research has been replaced by research at the pleasure of the \n     administocracy.\n       There is, unfortunately, no limit to coveting. According to \n     Horace: ``The covetous man is ever in want.'' \\11\\\n\n\n                               resolution\n\n       Although I coined the term administocracy, all else in this \n     version of the Ten Commandments, as perverted by this new \n     corporate bondage, is based on what has happened, is \n     happening, and will happen. For many of us, certain, if not \n     all, of the forces and events outlined are already part of \n     our personal histories. Those fortunate enough to have been \n     spared thus far will not be so favored in the future. I hope \n     no one in this audience suffers from ``mural dyslexia,'' \\12\\ \n     the inability to read the handwriting on the wall.\n       My intent in this narrative has been to express, in words \n     and by examples, the manifestations of a calamitous reality \n     that is altering the basic fabric of our professional lives, \n     as well as the quality of medical care. We cannot elect \n     simply to observe this transformation. The structures we \n     stand on are disintegrating. If we continue to be complacent, \n     if we do not oppose the powerful economic elements arrayed \n     against us, if we take little interest in understanding the \n     nature of our enemies, then surgery, as a discipline, and we, \n     as surgeons and as independent practitioners, free to act \n     within the boundaries of our conscience, will lose our \n     culture, as well as our personal autonomy.\n       I have tried in these remarks to outline a brief \n     differential diagnosis of this malady of encroaching \n     administoracy, in order that we may formulate practical \n     deterrents. I ask you to consider, each for your own \n     situations, a workable, achievable alternative to \n     administocracy, the forging of an ethical governance for \n     academia, income distribution, and administration by \n     facilitation. All of us need to take an active role in this \n     process of evolution and innovation, to take it now, and to \n     commit to it in the years to come.\n       Further, to maintain the individuality we prize, we have to \n     realize that, individually, we are easy pickings. We must \n     work together, as a community of surgeons, in our academic, \n     cultural, and political organizations to defend our values. \n     Ironic as it may be, we will need to give up some of our \n     precious autonomy to safeguard that very autonomy. In his \n     Republic, Plato expressed the concept of banding together as \n     fundamental to preserving individualty: `` . . . a state \n     comes into existence because no individual is self-\n     sufficient. . . .'' \\13\\\n       A satisfactory resolution of this clash of cultures will \n     not be achieved quickly or easily. This contest will not be \n     decided by the sprinters. Victory will belong to the \n     marathoners. Fortunately, surgeons are trained for the long \n     haul.\n\n\n                                closure\n\n       I would like to close with one final quotation, four \n     questions of self-examination from the Talmud, which express \n     my personal aspirations: ``Have I lived honorably on a daily \n     basis? Have I raised the next generation? Have I set aside \n     time for study? Have I lived hopefully? \\14\\\n\n\n                               references\n\n       1. Robson B.

They have been \ninvaluable members of my Operations Team over the past several months, \nand their efforts have not gone unnoticed.\n  Since I was elected in 1994, my staff and I have made an oath of \nservice, commitment, and dedication. We dedicate ourselves to quality \nservice. America's future will be determined by the character and \nproductivity of our people. In this respect, we seek to lead by our \nexample. We strive to lead with humility and honesty, and to work with \nenergy and spirit. Our standard of productivity is accuracy, courtesy, \nefficiency, integrity, validity, and timeliness.\n  My spring interns have not only achieved this standard, but set a new \nstandard on the tasks they were given.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and \nwomen in our labor force that put their health and safety on the line \nevery day at work. Today, we observe the passage of the landmark \nOccupational Safety and Health Act, signed into law 29 years ago, and \nthe tenth anniversary of Workers' Memorial Day.\n  Mr. President, today is a chance for all of us to celebrate, and to \nmourn--to recognize the strides we've made on worker safety, and to \nmourn those who have lost their lives while they were simply doing \ntheir job.\n  Although the workplace death rate has been cut in half since 1970, \n60,000 workers still die every year from job hazards, and six million \nmore are injured. In Wisconsin our workplace accidents rate of 11.4 \nworkplace accidents per 100 workers is higher than the national \naverage. This is not a statistic anyone should be proud of, but it does \nhelp us maintain our focus as we work toward stronger laws, stricter \nenforcement, and safer workplaces.\n  We need to work together to protect the workers that have built our \ncommunities and helped them thrive. Unfortunately we still hear stories \nof workers like Vernon Langholff, who in 1993 fell 100 feet to his \ndeath when a corroded fire escape collapsed beneath him while he was \ncleaning dust from a grain bin. Just this year a company in Jefferson \nCounty was convicted in a state court for the recklessness that caused \nLangholff's death. In 1996 the company was fined $450,000 for its \ndeliberate indifference to worker safety--because they delayed spending \nthe $15,000 it would have taken to fix the fire escape and prevent \nLangholff's death. Stories like this remind us that an unsafe workplace \ncan mean disaster for everyone involved--it can bring untold tragedy to \na family, it can bring serious, long-term financial and legal \nrepercussions for an employer.\n  The consequences of delaying the repair of a fire escape or ignoring \nsafety\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nprocedures can often be tragic, and they are always preventable. To \nprevent more tragedies on the job, we've got to make sure workers can \njoin unions without employer interference or intimidation, we must help \nprotect whistleblowers who call attention to dangerous working \nconditions, and above all we've got to fight back against attempts in \nCongress to weaken OSHA laws.\n  I do not understand the yearly assault on worker safety in Congress. \nAgain this year, the Safety Advancement for Employees Act, or SAFE Act \nhas been introduced. This legislation takes away a worker's right to an \non-site inspection to investigate a hazard, or permitting OSHA to issue \nwarnings instead of citations. This bill isn't OSHA re-form, it's OSHA \nde-form. This bill would more appropriately be named the ``UNSAFE'' \nact.\n  Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues to fight back any \nattempt to weaken the protection of Wisconsin's workers. It's time to \nmove the workplace forward to the 21st Century, not back to the dark \nages.\n  I am proud to stand with this country's workers in the fight for the \ndignity, respect and safe workplace they deserve. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in this important and worthy battle.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4400-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

The National Association of Letter \nCarriers in Alabama collected more than 500,000 items last year alone, \nand I would like to encourage my colleagues to support the letter \ncarriers' food drives in their States, districts, and hometowns in \norder to make this worthy event a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4400-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE VILLA TRAGARA\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

McMillen, a native of Virginia's Albemarle County, who is \nretiring from the Defense Logistics Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, \nthis month after a distinguished civilian career spanning more than \nthirty-six years. Ms. McMillen, who currently directs the Agency's \nbusiness management office, has devoted her professional life to \nsupporting the logistics needs of military men and women assigned \naround the world in defense of our freedom. Her accomplishments are \nmany and her reputation for innovative, visionary leadership is \nunparalleled. Her contributions to the National Defense will be missed, \nso as she transitions to new opportunities, I want to say thanks to her \non behalf of a grateful nation.\n  Ms. McMillen's career is noteworthy for many reasons, but her \nremarkable rise through the civil service ranks speaks to the real \nvalue of the work she has done for our warfighters over the years. \nStarting as a GS-3 clerk in Richmond's Defense General Supply Center, \nshe soon transitioned into professional and leadership positions, but \nnever lost her appreciation of the unique challenges faced by junior-\nlevel employees. With each assignment came additional responsibilities \nand a reputation for cutting through business-as-usual obstacles. Over \nthe years her abilities developed, her contributions grew, and she rose \nto the top of her career field. For all the challenges she successfully \nmet, Ms. McMillen's enduring contribution will be all those employees \nto whom she served as an active mentor. The next generation of DLA's \nprofessional logisticians has countless members who would not be making \ntremendous contributions to the Agency if not for her help, \nencouragement, and motivation along the way.\n  Mr. President, I am proud and honored to ask my colleagues to join me \nin congratulating Ms. Ruby McMillen on her retirement from the Federal \nCivil Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4400-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4400-S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN GATHERING OF JEWISH HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to have printed in the \nRecord, the remarks made by Benjamin Meed, President of the Warsaw \nGhetto Resistance Organization, on the 56th anniversary of the Warsaw \nGhetto Uprising. Mr. Meed made these remarks to the Congregation Emanu-\nEl in New York City.\n  The material follows:\n\n                        Remarks of Benjamin Meed\n\n       Governor Pataki, Senator Schumer, Mayor Giuliani, \n     Comptroller Hevesi, Members of the U.S. Congress, Ambassador \n     Sisso of Israel and Members of the Israeli Consulate, State \n     and City Officials, Members of the New York Legislature, Boro \n     President, Distinguished Guests, fellow survivors, and dear \n     friends.\n       Today, Jews gather to pay tribute to the memory of our Six \n     Million brothers and sisters murdered only because they were \n     Jewish; We gather to honor the fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto; \n     to grieve; and to continue asking the questions: Why did it \n     happen? How could the civilized world allow it to happen? Why \n     were we so abandoned? Six million times, why?\n       This year's national Days of Remembrance theme is dedicated \n     to the voyage of the SS St. Louis. It is a story of refuge \n     denied; it is a tale of international abandonment and \n     betrayal. Why were they refused entry into this country? How \n     can we ever understand why this was allowed to happen? Today, \n     it is inconceivable to us just how that ship in those days \n     was turned away.\n       Today 54 years ago the American soldiers came across Nazi \n     Germany slave labor camps and liberated Buchenwald and saved \n     many of us who are here present today. Our gratitude will \n     remain with us forever. We will always remain grateful to \n     these soldiers for their kindness and generosity, and we will \n     always remember those young soldiers who sacrificed their \n     lives to bring us liberty.\n       Today, wherever Jews live--from Antwerp to Melbourne, from \n     Jerusalem to Buenos Aires, from New York to Budapest--we come \n     together to remember to say Kadish collectively.\n       Remembering the Holocaust is now a part of the Jewish \n     calendar. We are together in our dedication to Memory and our \n     aspiration for peace and brotherhood. Yom Hashoah, the Days \n     of Remembrance, time to collectively bear witness as a \n     community.\n       And what lessons did we derive from these horrible \n     experiences? The most important lesson is obvious--it can \n     happen again the impossible is possible again. Ethnic \n     cleansing, genocide, is happening as I speak. It can happen \n     to any one or any group of people. The slaughter in Kosovo \n     and in other places must be brought to an end.\n       Should there be another Holocaust, it may be on a cosmic \n     scale. How can we prevent it? All of us must remain \n     vigilant--always aware, always on guard against those who are \n     determined to destroy innocent human life for no other reason \n     than birthright.\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n       It is vital that we remember, it is our commitment to those \n     who perished, and to each other; a commitment taken up by \n     your children and, hopefully, by the generation to come. What \n     we remember is gruesome and painful. But remember we must. \n     Over the years, we have tried to make certain that what \n     happened to us was communicated and continues to be told, and \n     retold, until it becomes an inseparable part of the world's \n     conscience.\n       And yet, some fifty years after the Holocaust, we continue \n     to be repulsed by revelations about the enormity of the \n     crimes against our people. And we are shocked to learn of the \n     behavior of those who could have helped us, or at least, not \n     hurt us, but who, instead, actually helped those whose goal \n     was to wipe us out. Sadly, many of those who claimed they \n     were neutral were actually involved with the German Nazis. \n     They were anything but not neutral.\n       The world has now learned that the Holocaust was not only \n     the greatest murder of humanity, the greatest crime against \n     humanity, but also the greatest robbery in the history of \n     mankind. Driven from our homes, stripped of family \n     heirlooms--indeed of all our possessions--the German Nazis \n     and their collaborators took anything that was or could be of \n     value for recycling. They stole from the living and even \n     defiled the Jewish dead, tearing out gold fillings and \n     cutting off fingers to recover wedding bands from our loved \n     ones who they had murdered.\n       But the German Nazis did not--could not--do it alone. The \n     same people who now offer reasonable sounding justifications \n     for their conduct during the Holocaust were, in those darkest \n     of times, more than eager to profit from the German war \n     against the Jews.\n       None of the so-called ``neutral'' nations has fully assumed \n     responsibility for its conduct during the Holocaust. The \n     bankers, brokers, and business people who helped Nazi Germany \n     now offer some money to survivors, but they say little about \n     their collaboration. They utter not a word about how they \n     sent fleeing Jews back to the German Nazis' machinery of \n     destruction, nor about how they supported the Nazis in other \n     ways--no admission of guilt; no regret; no expression of \n     moral responsibility.\n       We must guard against dangerous, unintended consequences \n     arising from all that is going on now. Hopefully, family \n     properties and other valuables will be returned to their \n     rightful owners. But the blinding glitter of gold--the \n     unrealistic expectations created by all the international \n     publicity--has diverted attention from the evil which was the \n     Holocaust.\n       For five decades, we survivors vowed that what happened to \n     our loved ones would be remembered and that our experiences \n     would serve as a warning to future generations. We must \n     continue to make sure that the images of gold bars wrapped in \n     yellow Stars of David do not overshadow the impressions of a \n     mother protecting her daughter with her coat, upon which a \n     Star of David is sewn, or of a young boy desperately \n     clutching his father's hand at Auschwitz/Birkenau before \n     entering the gas chambers.\n       The search for lost and stolen Jewish-owned assets has \n     generated enormous publicity and excitement, but it also has \n     created serious concerns. Gold, bank accounts, insurance \n     policies and other assets have become the focal point of the \n     Holocaust. That somehow minimizes Germany's murderous role.\n       Great care must be taken to find a balance. The various \n     investigations must continue to uncover the hidden or little \n     publicized truths about the so-called neutral countries that \n     collaborated, and to recover what rightfully belongs to the \n     victims, survivors and their families.\n       The focus should never be shifted from the moral and \n     financial responsibility of Germany for the slaughter of our \n     people--acts for which there is no statute of limitations, \n     acts for which Germany remains eternally responsible. Our \n     books should not and cannot be closed.\n       Let us Remember.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4401-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEATH OF FORMER SENATOR ROMAN L.

Res. 89) designating the Henry Clay Desk \n     in the Senate Chamber for assignment to the senior Senator \n     from Kentucky.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senator proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to support this \nresolution submitted today by Senator McConnell assigning the Henry \nClay Desk in the Senate Chamber to the senior Senator from Kentucky. \nThis resolution will ensure that the Henry Clay Desk will forever stay \nwithin the family of Kentucky Senators.\n  The Senate has a proud tradition of passing this type of resolution. \nDuring the 94th Congress, for example, the Senate adopted a resolution \nassigning the Daniel Webster Desk to the senior Senator from New \nHampshire. And, during the 104th Congress, the Senate agreed to a \nresolution ensuring that the Jefferson Davis Desk would forever reside \nwith the senior Senator from Mississippi.\n  Let me take a brief moment to reflect on the life and legacy of Henry \nClay. Henry Clay began his political career in the Kentucky House of \nRepresentatives in 1803, at age 27, and remained in public service \nuntil his death in 1852. During Clay's long and distinguished career, \nhe served his state and his nation in a wide range of capacities \nincluding speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Speaker of \nthe United States House of Representatives, and, of course, as a U.S. \nSenator for fifteen years. Clay also served President John Quincy Adams \nas Secretary of State for four years, and received his party's \nnomination for President in 1824, 1832, and 1844.\n  Henry Clay's ability to facilitate compromise was quickly recognized \nin Washington, and he became well-known as a highly-skilled negotiator. \nThis skill, coupled with his knack for convincing and persuasive \nspeech, made Clay the ideal appointment in 1814 to help negotiate the \nTreaty of Ghent that concluded the war with Great Britain. And, during \nClay's quest to save the Union in 1820, he earned his reputation as \n``The Great Compromiser'' by helping broker the Missouri Compromise. \nHis leadership, however, did not end there. He also went on to play a \nsignificant role in crafting the Compromise of 1850.\n  Henry Clay's lifetime of public service is indeed worthy of \nrecognition. He will always be a role model for public servants because \nof his dedication to the people of Kentucky and to our great Nation, \nand lives on his history as one of the greatest Senators of all time. \nIn fact, Henry Clay's portrait is displayed just off the Senate floor \nto honor his designation in 1957, as one of history's ``Five \nOutstanding Senators.'' Clay certainly deserves today's honor of \ncommitting his former desk to Senator McConnell and to the senior \nSenators from Kentucky who will follow.\n  Mr. President, let me say today that I think Senator McConnell is \nfollowing in the footsteps of Henry Clay. He has done a tremendous job \nrepresenting the good people of Kentucky for the past 15 years. And, on \na personal level, I would like to say that I have developed a genuine \nappreciation for Senator McConnell's courage, his political insight, \nand his keen and candid advice on a wide range of subjects. I value him \nas a friend, a confidant, and an advisor, and look forward to many more \nyears of service with him here in this chamber.\n  Mr. President, I am proud today to support this resolution submitted \nby Senator McConnell. It is his strong desire to maintain the heirloom \nof the\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nClay desk in the family of Kentucky Senators for the years to come. I \nurge the Senate to adopt this resolution and ask that it be included in \nthe collection of the Standing Orders of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, over the last several years--according to \nour colleague from North Carolina, over the last 40 years--we have \nheard multiple warnings about the Y2K computer problem. We have heard \nhow this problem will overwhelm our Nation's transportation networks, \nfinancial institutions, business sectors, and State and local \ncommunities.\n\n  I bring to the attention of the Senate this afternoon another \ninstitution that could be overwhelmed by the rush to prepare for the \nnew millennium, and that institution is one of our direct \nresponsibilities--the Federal courts.\n  Just over a month ago, the Judicial Conference of the United States--\nthe principal policymaking body for the Federal courts, chaired by the \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court--asked Congress to create \nnearly 70 new permanent and temporary judgeships: 11 on the appellate \nlevel and 58 in Federal district courts.\n  This was an unusually large request by the Judicial Conference. It \nwas also an urgent request.\n  The Judicial Conference has made biennial pleas for help from \nCongress. Every 2 years, the Conference has recommended additional \njudgeships to be created in order to maintain currency with the \ncapacity of the judicial system of the Federal Government of the United \nStates with the caseload that system was being asked to accommodate.\n  I am saddened to have to state and to indicate to my colleagues and \nthe American people that Congress has not created so much as one new \nFederal judgeship since December of 1990--almost 9 years ago.\n  Since December of 1990, appellate filings have increased by more than \n30 percent. District court filings have grown by more than 20 percent. \nBut this increase is not equally distributed across the Nation.\n  In my home State of Florida, we have seen a worse--a much worse--\nsituation. The Middle and Southern Districts of Florida have seen case \nfilings increase by over 60 percent in the last 9 years without one \nadditional Federal judge being added to the Middle or Southern \nDistricts.\n  What has been the consequence of this failure of Congress to respond \nto the legitimate request of the Federal judiciary for additional \nresources to mediate these additional case demands? This has resulted \nin over 1,100 criminal defendants having cases currently pending in the \nMiddle District of Florida. On the civil side, more than 5,900 cases \nhave yet to receive final disposition.\n\n  The reasons for this need are many. But one stands out in the context \nof the legislation we are now debating, the legislation to turn \nresponsibility for Y2K litigation to the Federal courts; and that is, \nthe increasing willingness of Congress to federalize what were \nformerly, and I believe properly, State civil and criminal legal \nissues.\n  In other forums we have addressed the federalization of criminal \nstatutes, and thus I will not dwell on that subject today. But just \nsuffice it to say this one fact: It has been now some 135 years since \nthe end of the Civil War. Of all of the Federal criminal statutes \nenacted since the end of the Civil War, 30 percent of them have been \nenacted since 1980, or in the last 19 years. So we are in an era in \nwhich there has been a rush to create new Federal criminal statutes.\n  While we can and should debate the merits of this trend, what cannot \nbe debated is the fact that this has dramatically increased the burdens \non the Federal courts and their ability to dispense justice. This trend \nis no less prevalent on the civil side as it is on the criminal side.\n  In the last Congress, we considered major legal overhauls that would \nhave preempted State tort and property laws.\n  In 1998, Chief Justice Rehnquist stated:\n\n       [S]hould Congress consider expanding the jurisdiction of \n     the federal judiciary, it should do so cautiously and only \n     after it has considered all the alternatives and the \n     incremental impact the increase will have on both the need \n     for additional judicial resources and the traditional role of \n     the federal judiciary.\n\n  Unfortunately, the legislation we are considering today runs counter \nto that sage advice. The very nature of the Y2K problem means that \nmultiple\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nplaintiffs will have similar claims against common defendants--a \nsituation ripe for a profusion of class action lawsuits. By giving the \nFederal judiciary original jurisdiction over Y2K class actions, \nCongress will sentence Federal courts to overburdened caseloads far \nbeyond the crisis that we currently face.\n\n  I want to make it clear that I recognize the seriousness of the Y2K \nproblem and the need to address some of the related legal issues. \nSenators Bennett and Dodd deserve tremendous credit for their \ncommittee's assessment of how the U.S. Government is preparing for the \nY2K problem.\n  I commend Senator McCain for his forward-thinking focus on the legal \nramifications of the millennium bug. But I have serious reservations \nabout making Federal courts a clearinghouse for Y2K lawsuits of any \nkind. Proponents of this measure have argued that it is necessary to \nfederalize the Y2K litigation in order to establish national uniformity \nin this area of the law.\n  This view runs counter to basic tenets of federalism. According to \nthe National Governors' Association, 39 States currently have \nlegislation enacted or pending that could resolve this issue at the \nState level. As such, the burden of proof falls on the proponents of \nthis legislation to show why the Federal Government, contrary to two \ncenturies of tradition of State responsibility for civil litigation, is \nin the best position to deal with this issue. Such an action of \nfederalization amounts to a theft of what has traditionally been the \nState responsibility for these types of cases. As such, I will oppose \ncloture on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, thus far, I know of no plan whatsoever to address the \nmassive new workload that legislative action such as the federalization \nof Y2K cases could impose on the Federal judiciary, particularly the \nU.S. district courts.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider not only the potential legal cases \nthat will be generated by the Y2K challenge, but also to thoughtfully \nconsider where those cases should best be heard. I believe the \npresumption should be that those cases should be heard where most of \nour civil litigation is heard, which is in State courts. I do not \nbelieve that the proponents of this change have effectively advocated \nfor the necessity of changing that basic tradition in American \njurisprudence.\n  We must be vigilant, as Members of Congress, to avoid legislative \naction that will increase the workload on our Federal courts without a \ncommensurate increase in judicial resources. If we fail to do so, the \nend result will be justice delayed and justice denied.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/28/senate-section/article/S4403-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
