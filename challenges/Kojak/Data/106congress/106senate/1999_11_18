Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator outlining for us \nwhat the intent is for the day. I hope that part of what we are going \nto do is to work on completing the bankruptcy bill. I say to my friends \nin the majority that we only have a few amendments remaining. I have \nspoken to Senator Leahy and his staff, and I am ready to offer a \nunanimous-consent request. I will not ask that the Senator accept this, \nrecognizing that he must speak with the manager of the bill, Senator \nGrassley. But what I would like to do is ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments numbered 2517, 2537, 2538, 2539, 2658, 2666, 2667, \n2747, 2748, 2753, 2759, 2761, 2763, and 2670, and any amendment agreed \nupon by the two managers be the only amendments--those I have just read \nand those agreed to by the two managers--in order to S. 625, the bill \nto amend title 11, United States Code, and for other purposes, and that \nfollowing the disposition of all the above-described amendments, the \nbill be immediately advanced to third reading; that the Senate then \nproceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 833; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill, as amended, \nbe inserted; that the bill be advanced to third reading; that a vote \noccur on passage of the bill without any intervening action, motion or \ndebate; that the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference \nwith the House, and the Senate bill be placed back on the calendar.\n  Mr. President, that is the unanimous-consent request that I spread \nacross the Record of the Senate, recognizing that at this time there \nwill not be an objection to it. We will make this unanimous-consent \nrequest at some later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I am not asking, Mr. President, that there be objection. I \nam not asking unanimous consent at this time.\n  I say to the majority that we have enumerated 14 amendments. Seven of \nthem have tentatively been agreed upon or they will be withdrawn. Only \nseven amendments are now between completing the bankruptcy bill and not \ncompleting it this year. The only two amendments of the seven that I \nunderstand are causing any controversy are the ones dealing with gun \nmanufacturers and clinic violence.\n\n  On the gun manufacturing amendment, the proponents have agreed to a \n70-minute time agreement, and on the amendment relating to clinic \nviolence, the proponent has agreed to 30 minutes. So there is really \nnot much left to complete this bill. I hope that during the day there \ncan be discussions ongoing to complete this bill. We would be willing \nat any time the majority wants to lock in these amendments; we would be \nwilling to come back and I would propound this unanimous consent \nrequest, or we could have the majority do so, so that this bill could \nbe completed in a reasonably short period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14752-5", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the first session of the 106th \nCongress comes to a close, I want to remind my colleagues that the \naftermath of our nation's largest foreign policy initiative this year \nand a 78-day air war, will be our nation's biggest foreign policy \nconcern next year.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I opposed our nation's ``sign or we'll \nbomb'' diplomacy that ultimately led to the decision to conduct the air \nwar over Kosovo and Serbia earlier this year. Instead, I believed that \nwe should have done all that we could to negotiate a real diplomatic \nsolution. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the conflict, I came to \nthe Senate floor and commented that ``some good always blows in an ill \nwind.''\n  The ``good'' that I saw in the ill wind of the bombing campaign was \nthe opportunity for NATO and the United States to provide the impetus \nfor a lasting peace throughout Southeastern Europe. Since that time, my \nstaff and I have spent hours working hard to ensure that some good does \nblow in and that we do not lose this opportunity to promote peace, \nstability and prosperity in that region of our world.\n  To ensure the future of Southeast Europe, it is important to \nunderstand its past. Every student of history is well aware that this \ncentury's two\n\n[[Page S14753]]\n\nmost horrific wars had deep roots in the Balkans, but few people are \naware of the level of violence, bloodshed, hatred and destruction that \nhas been commonplace in the region for centuries. Indeed, the Balkans \nhave been the site of numerous wars and countless battles, and have \nbeen fought over by every major regional power since the days of the \nRoman legions.\n  Over the last 10 years, regional ethnic tensions have resulted in yet \nanother nightmare for the people of the Balkans. And for the third time \nthis century, Europe, reluctantly, has turned its attention to their \nsouthern neighbors.\n  Their concern can be attributed to self-interest; an attempt to get \nSoutheast Europe to settle down so as to avoid any possible spillover \nthat could bring unrest to their nations, and a genuine concern over \nthe ethnic cleansing and human rights violations in the region. To do \nthis, Europe has involved the international community, and in \nparticular, the United States, which, for the first time in our \nhistory, has immersed itself politically and militarily in the region.\n  Our willingness to get involved and lead should have come earlier. \nIndeed, when conflicts began in Bosnia in the early 1990's, it was \nreported that a key foreign policy official of the Bush Administration \nmade the statement that ``we have no dog in this fight.'' History \nrecords that nothing could have been further from the truth. According \nto Ambassador Richard Holbrooke in his book, ``To End A War'':\n\n       Europe believed it could solve Yugoslavia without the \n     United States; Washington believed that, with the Cold War \n     over, it could leave Yugoslavia to Europe. Europe's hour had \n     not dawned in Yugoslavia; Washington had a dog in this \n     particular fight.\n\n  The overconfidence of Europe and the disengagement of the United \nStates contributed greatly to the tragedy of Slavonia, Krijna and \nBosnia-Herzegovina. When we finally realized it was important for the \nU.S. to get involved, we dealt with, and thus, legitimatized three war \ncriminals--Slobodan Milosevic, Franco Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic--at \nthe Dayton Peace Accords.\n  Unfortunately, the legitimitization of Milosevic caused us to \ncontinue to have a relationship with him at a time when we should have \nbeen working with opposition leaders to get rid of him. Then, when he \nshowed his true colors, we were reluctant to be as aggressive as we \nshould have been. We misjudged him, we underestimated him, and now \nwe're paying the price for our mistake.\n  As a result, we have spent at least $18 billion in operations in \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia and elsewhere. We will, no \ndoubt, spend billions more. In addition, we have placed a tremendous \nstrain on the equipment and personnel of our Armed Forces due to our \npast and present involvement in peacekeeping missions in Southeast \nEurope. Also, the State Department has paid an incredible amount of \nattention to the Balkans. And finally, we have complicated our \nrelations with other nations on the international scene--primarily, \nRussia and China.\n  A November 1 article written by Elizabeth Sullivan, foreign-affairs \ncorrespondent for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, indicates that the \nRussians harbor resentment and incredulity towards the United States \nover our assuming an air of moral superiority regarding their actions \nin Chechnya. They see our attitude as a double standard, which affects \nour ability to appeal to their better instincts. She writes:\n\n       The Kremlin is resolutely turning a deaf ear to U.S. \n     admonitions for restraint in Chechnya. The criticisms have \n     inflamed anti-U.S. feelings in Russia where it's bitterly \n     recalled that NATO's unpopular bombing killed hundreds of \n     Yugoslav civilians. It is the first big display of lost U.S. \n     influence after Kosovo.\n\n  It is clear that instability in Southeast Europe has the potential to \nthreaten America's overall interests throughout the rest of Europe. \nHowever, a full-fledged integration of Southeast Europe into the whole \nEuropean community would remove the burden and expense of maintaining a \nconstant peacekeeping force, end years of diplomatic wrangling and \npolitical posturing, and more important, end the death and destruction \nthat has plagued the region.\n  Recently, I met with a number of Ambassadors from the Balkans region \nin the LBJ room here in the Capitol. They made it very clear to me that \nthey are ready to work together. I was pleased that they realized they \nhave a symbiotic relationship--a relationship that must be cultivated \nin order to bring about peace and implement a modern, free-market \neconomy. The Holy Spirit was definitely present in that room. There was \nan aura of enlightenment among those leaders, and we must capitalize on \nthe momentum of this cooperative spirit if we are to successfully bring \nthe region into the broader European fold.\n  Consider that not so many years ago, no one would have thought that \nEuropean political and economic cooperation, let alone union, was \npossible. After all, two world wars had been fought in the trenches and \non the fields of Europe, fostering tremendous ill-will among many \nnationalities.\n  Today, those feelings have largely dissipated. Germans, French, \nItalians--all share the same currency. They cross national boundaries \nfreely. They work cooperatively to solve economic problems because it \nis in their collective best interest. We are seeing that in terms of \ncompetition right now. The Ambassadors I met with see this cooperation \nand wish it for their nations, but, they are also quite frustrated with \nthe lack of speed by the international community in responding to the \nhumanitarian and economic needs of the region.\n  The NATO air war triggered immense human suffering which has not yet \nbeen fully remedied. Here are some facts:\n  The refugee exodus from Kosovo decimated the economies of surrounding \nnations, especially in Macedonia. Macedonia's reaching out to help \ntheir fellow man was done at a great sacrifice to their economy and the \nquality of life of their people.\n  In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), there are still 500,000 \nrefugees from Slavonia, Krijna, and Bosnia. Another 150,000 were \ndisplaced during the Kosovo bombing.\n  In Kosovo, the international community has had to deal with 700,000 \nrefugees who have returned after the conflict. 500,000 of these \nrefugees are still officially considered ``internally displaced \npersons,'' without any place to call their own.\n  Kosovo has turned into an armed camp where soldiers from numerous \ncountries are forced to keep the peace and prevent further bloodshed.\n  The lack of an effective internal police force has led to virtual \nchaos, where organized crime and illegal drug trafficking is said to be \nrampant and a cause of great concern among its citizens.\n  On this last point, a senior official from the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, told me that the reason there \nis no effective police force in Kosovo is because there aren't enough \nqualified or even interested individuals willing to join the force. The \nofficial told me that if the crime problem in Kosovo isn't checked, it \nwill spread to the entire region and into the rest of Europe.\n  Indeed, this point was illustrated again in the November 1 Elizabeth \nSullivan article for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. She wrote:\n\n       The scope of the gun, drug and prostitute trade fanned by \n     the Kosovo conflict is also becoming clear. [Last week] \n     Italian and Swiss police busted a ring that allegedly \n     smuggled millions of dollars in Swiss weapons to Kosovo, and \n     Albanian prostitutes out to Italy, using humanitarian aid as \n     a cover.\n\n  The growing crime problem was definitely a topic of concern for the \nAmbassadors I met with. I was amazed that they considered organized \ncrime and drugs their No. 1 or No. 2 concern to be addressed. Think of \nthat, organized crime and drugs as their No. 1 or No. 2 concern in the \nregion.\n  The fact of the matter is, the bombing has had a terribly \ndestabilizing effect on the region, and a very real impact on the \nhumanitarian situation and basic human existence as well, one that has \nnot been widely reported to the American people. The T.V. cameras are \ngone now. You know how it is: out of sight, out of mind, and we have \nmoved on to other issues.\n  Although it's hard to grasp the extent of the problem, for the last \nseveral months, the U.S. has been working through the United Nations \nand the International Committee for the Red\n\n[[Page S14754]]\n\nCross to deal with the needs of the region. Both the UN and the Red \nCross claim that they will be able to keep people fed, clothed and \nsheltered through the upcoming winter. Yet, I have received a number of \ncredible reports in recent weeks which indicate that in fact we will \nwitness a humanitarian catastrophe in the region in the months ahead \nbecause of a lack of shelter, heat, food and medical care.\n  I am aware that there are individuals in the foreign policy community \nwho are opposed to providing significant assistance to the people of \nSerbia. They believe that humanitarian suffering will lead to political \ndiscontent which will, in turn, lead to a popular movement that will \nbring about the removal of Slobodan Milosevic. I disagree.\n  With the exception of South Africa, crippling sanctions have not \nsuccessfully brought about a change in political leadership. Just look \nat Saddam Hussein in Iraq. We don't know what is going on there \nanymore.\n  To emphasize this point, Professor Julie Mertus of the Ohio Northern \nUniversity wrote an excellent piece which was recently published in the \nWashington Post. Professor Mertus specializes in international law. \nHere is what she has to say:\n\n       How does a freezing and hungry Yugoslavia advance U.S. \n     policy goals? Certainly Milosevic will not be hungry this \n     winter. The idea is that the pain and suffering among the \n     lowest strata of society will ``trickle up'' to the higher \n     echelons. Protests by discontented citizens will lead to \n     policy changes and perhaps even the removal of Milosevic. The \n     problem is that humans do not behave this way. Cold, \n     dispirited citizens do not take to the streets. Rather, they \n     draw up inside their own homes and try to survive. If the \n     going gets tough, they try to exit, often leaving the \n     country. Only the few with hope continue to fight, and even \n     they cannot persist for long when they are isolated from \n     supportive networks.\n\n  Our sanctions policy has allowed Milosevic to blame Serbia's \nfaltering economy, declining humanitarian situation and international \nisolation on the West. He has been able to deflect the ire of the \nSerbian people who have little access to independent media.\n  We must pursue specific courses of action that will help us get rid \nof Milosevic once and for all.\n  No. 1, we must continue to squeeze Milosevic so that his allies \ninside and outside the Serbian government will see that he is \nvulnerable and his hold on power is tenuous. Milosevic is an indicted \nwar criminal, and we have to make his allies understand that his fate \nis their fate. In other words, leave now, or pay later.\n  No. 2, we should work with our allies to announce a detailed \nhumanitarian and economic aid package that would be available to the \npeople of Serbia once Milosevic is removed. The importance of this kind \nof package to the success of democratization was underscored recently \nwhen several of us met with the leaders of the anti-Milosevic force \nright here in the Capitol.\n  They talked about how important it was we have a clear, defined \npackage that says, if he goes, here is what we are willing to do.\n  No. 3, we should provide as much assistance as we can, including such \nthings as heating oil, food, clothing and direct financial assistance, \nas soon as possible to the Serbian opposition groups, particularly the \nmayors, who are struggling to bring about democratic change.\n  No. 4, we should continue to support President Djukanovic of \nMontenegro with whom I met two weeks ago. He is a bright and energetic \nleader and a key ally for peace and prosperity in Southeast Europe.\n  No. 5, we must undertake a massive effort to overrun Milosevic's \nmonopoly control on Serbia's mass media. Milosevic's distorted \ninformation must be countered with the truth; a commodity we must get \nto the Serb people whatever way possible.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I held a meeting recently with a number of \nambassadors and senior embassy staff from the nations of Southeast \nEurope to get their reaction to the Stability Pact initiative. And they \nwere honest; they said things were not going well. They were very clear \nthat it was essential that the United States be at the table to provide \nleadership and contribute our fair share.\n  Without our presence, they are not confident that our NATO allies \nwill make good on the promises they made at the end of the war. And, \nquite frankly, I think it is up to us to make it clear to our European \nallies that we expect them to adhere to their commitment.\n  We are going to be at the table. We are going to have leadership. We \nare anteing up, and it is time for you to ante up and make good on your \npromises.\n  The best way I can summarize the attitude at the meeting I had with \nthe ambassadors, and the meeting I had with the Serbian opposition \nleaders is a word in Serbo-Croatian--``edemo''--which means, ``let's \nget going!''\n  On balance, I believe there has been some real progress made on a \nnumber of fronts in our policy towards Southeast Europe in recent \nmonths. The Stability Pact is moving ahead--albeit slowly and indeed \nneed of some additional leadership, particularly ours. The policy \ntoward sanctions seems to be finessed a bit and real work finally is \nbeing done on the ground in the region to deal with humanitarian \nconcerns. I am pleased the administration is starting to soften up on \nthis a little bit.\n  The administration is meeting with Serbian opposition leaders and \nfinancial support is beginning to trickle into the movement. \nSoutheastern European nations are beginning to think regionally with \nthe understanding they have a symbiotic relationship in their efforts \nto promote and develop their economies. That is wonderful.\n  Although in many respects, things are much better off today than they \nwere after the war, the momentum has to be increased significantly, and \nthat is the challenge of this Congress and this administration.\n  The administration, working through the State Department, bears the \nresponsibility of bringing about real change in Serbia and honoring the \ncommitments the United States has made to friendly governments in \nSoutheast Europe. Congress has an obligation to provide oversight and \nsupport to the administration's policies towards the restoration of \npeace and stability in the region.\n  To that end, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the next \nsession of Congress to loosen some of the restrictive language that was \nplaced in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill, language that the \nState Department claims has made it difficult, and continues to make it \ndifficult, for them to do the kinds of things they would like to be \ndoing in Southeast Europe.\n  The Senate has already made a positive start with the recent \nunanimous passage of the Serbia Democratization Act. I believe we need \nto build on that progress.\n  Southeast Europe is strategic to our national interests and key to \nour efforts to maintain peace in the world. Until the nations of \nSoutheast Europe are welcomed into the broader European community, \nthose efforts will remain unfulfilled. The United States must provide \nthe leadership because we do ``have a dog in this fight.''\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was presiding when the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio was talking about the problems the U.N. faces in \nKosovo. I share all of the concerns the Senator from Ohio expressed. In \naddition to that, since I am the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nReadiness Subcommittee, I have another concern, and that is the \ndeployment of troops in 1995 into Bosnia, then again to Kosovo, and the \nway they are being deployed today has put us in an apparent condition \nin terms of our state of readiness.\n  It is very unfortunate that during this administration we have had a \ncut in our force strength by approximately 50 percent, only to find out \njust last week that two of our Army divisions are now rated at C-4. \nThat means they are not capable of combat today. Those\n\n[[Page S14755]]\n\ntwo divisions are the 10th Army Division, of which most are located in \nBosnia, and the 1st Infantry Division located in Kosovo.\n  This means that if something should happen, we are not in a ready \ncondition to defend America, where we do have national security \ninterests which, in my opinion, we do not have and never had in either \nBosnia or Kosovo. I stood side by side with the Senator from Ohio in \ntrying to keep us from making that deployment. We were not successful. \nI do believe we should be looking very soon at any way we can bring our \ntroops back to a state of readiness, to do what we are supposed to be \ndoing, the No. 1 function of Government, and that is to defend America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14755-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VIEQUES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been a little disturbed not knowing \nthe certainty of the schedule and how long we will have to get some \nthings done at the last minute. I want to bring up one issue that has \nto be discussed briefly, and that is the issue of the range that has \nbeen used for 58 years on the island of Vieques located 6 miles off the \nshores of Puerto Rico.\n  I am concerned about this because we started using this range 58 \nyears ago. We have become dependent upon it because it is the only \nrange we can use that offers an integrated three-level type of \ntraining--first, high-altitude bombing; second, the type of protection \nthat comes from the ships to the shore using live fire; and third, the \nMarine expeditionary amphibious movements. All three of those can be \ndone simultaneously and have been done successfully over the last 58 \nyears.\n  The problem we have with this range is that there is no place else in \nthe Western Hemisphere that we can actually give the training to our \ntroops. Right, now we have deployed into the Persian Gulf the U.S.S. \nKennedy. Because this President put a moratorium on training in \nVieques, only half of those deployed on the U.S.S. Kennedy have ever \nhad the necessary training should they have to become involved in \ncombat.\n  We have scheduled for the 18th of February the deployment of the \nU.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group. If this battle group goes through the \nMediterranean and goes to the Persian Gulf, the chances are better than \n50-50 they will see combat. If we do not allow them to have the \ntraining on the island of Vieques prior to their deployment, they will \nhave to go into combat very likely without ever having any live \nordnance training. This goes for the pilots flying the F-18s and the F-\n14s that will be deployed off the U.S.S. Eisenhower.\n  I was there 3 weeks ago and watched them during their training, but \nthey were unable to use live ordnances and use that range. It goes for \nthe 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit and the others who would be deployed \nat the same time.\n  I would like to quote, if I could, Gen. Wes Clark. Of course, he is \none for whom we all have a great deal of respect. We watched the way he \nworked commanding the European forces and the NATO forces. He said:\n\n       The live fire training that our forces were exposed to at \n     training ranges such as Vieques helped ensure that the forces \n     assigned to this theater--\n\n  We are talking about Kosovo, those 78, 79 days--\n\n       were ready-on-arrival and prepared to fight, win and \n     survive.\n\n  What General Clark is saying is, we were successful. Even though we \nshould not have been in Kosovo to start with, once we made that \ndecision, we were successful in dropping our cruise missiles in there \nand our bombs because of the training those pilots had on the island of \nVieques.\n  Capt. James Stark, Jr., the commanding officer of the Roosevelt Roads \nNaval Station, said:\n\n       When you steam off to battle you're either ready or you're \n     not. If you're not, that means casualties. That means more \n     POWs. That means less precision and longer campaigns. You pay \n     a price for all this in war, and that price is blood.\n\n  We are talking about American blood. I am very proud of all the \nmilitary, uniformed and others. This is the first time in the years I \nhave served in the Senate that they have been willing to stand up for \nsomething they know is right, not knowing for sure where the President \nis going to be on this issue.\n  The President has imposed a moratorium on training on the island of \nVieques. We are going to try our best to encourage him, for the lives \nof Americans, to allow us to use it to train those people who are on \nthe U.S.S. Eisenhower, ready to be deployed.\n  Richard Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, said:\n\n       Only by providing this preparation can we fairly ask our \n     service members to put their lives at risk.\n\n  In a joint statement between the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, they said: Vieques provides integrated live-fire training \n``critical to our readiness,'' and the failure to provide for adequate \nlive-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will place \nthose forces at unacceptably high risk during deployment.\n\n  This is military language to mean casualties, those who can be killed \nin action.\n  I am proud of Admiral Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and \nGeneral Jones, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, when they say: \nWithout the ability to train on Vieques, the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle \nGroup and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit scheduled for deployment \nin February 2000 would not be ready for such deployment ``without \ngreatly increasing the risk to those men and women who we ask to go in \nharm's way.''\n  Lastly, Admiral Murphy, the Commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, \nsaid: The loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives.''\n  It is a very serious thing. I sometimes listen to the complaints we \nhear from some of the Puerto Ricans, but mostly from the people of the \nisland of Vieques, who say: Wait a minute. How would you like to have \nbombs dropped and live ordnances fired where you are?\n  You can't do anything about that. They actually have a 10-mile buffer \nrange between the bombing range and where people live.\n  I happen to represent the State of Oklahoma. We have a very fine \norganization there called Fort Sill, where we do all our artillery \ntraining. I have said on the floor here several times before that, \nwhile on Vieques they have a 10-mile buffer zone, we have only a 1-mile \nbuffer zone in the State of Oklahoma between a population of 100,000 \npeople living in Lawton and the live-fire range.\n  So let me just wind up and conclude by saying that many of us, \nincluding Senator Warner, the chairman of our Armed Services Committee, \nare asking the President and pleading with him to work out some type of \narrangement to, at the very least during this interim while we are in \nrecess, provide for training on the island of Vieques because if that \ndoes not happen, we will lose American lives.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I would like to address several topics \nthat I think may be of interest to those who are following the debate \nin the Senate. One in particular has become a focal point of the news \nmedia across the United States and literally around the world. That was \nthe crash of the EgyptAir aircraft just a few weeks ago and the loss of \nover 200 lives.\n  I find it interesting, as we try to piece together all the \ninformation to determine what happened in that aircraft disaster, how \nlimited we are with\n\n[[Page S14756]]\n\nrespect to investigative tools. We have the so-called black box which \nhas the flight data information. We are poring through that to try to \ndetermine what was happening mechanically on that plane when it went \ndown. Then we have the audio recording which is now the focus of all \nsorts of international speculation. We listen to that audio recording \nfor sounds, for words, and then try to piece together this mystery to \ndetermine what happened in the cockpit of that plane which led to this \nloss of life.\n  This is more than just to satisfy curiosity. This investigation is \nbeing undertaken, as most are, to determine whether there is something \nwe can or should do to change the way aircraft are maintained and flown \nto protect those who are passengers. These investigations are \ncritically important. We often come up with information about a \nmechanical failure. We then set out to repair it. We decide that planes \nwon't go back up in the air until that is taken care of. If there is \nhuman error--that will happen in most accidents--we at least get to the \nbottom of the equation and understand what is going on.\n  The thing I find absolutely incredible, in 1999, is that we are \ndealing with such primitive tools when it comes to investigating \naircraft disasters. The idea of an audio recording in a cockpit goes \nback to the 1930s. That was the state of the art then. But today, \ntechnology is far more advanced and I would suggest that we need to \nupdate plane safety by putting a video camera in the new planes' \ncockpits so we can determine what is happening in a crash.\n  The obvious is not being used. If you walk into a bank, if you walk \ninto most office buildings, a casino, a convenience store, or stand in \nfront of an ATM machine, you will be on a video camera which will \nreflect your conduct and your activities. Think what a difference it \nwould make today if there had been a video camera in the cockpit of the \nEgyptAir aircraft.\n  The obvious question is, Why haven't we done this? The technology is \nthere. It is a question of will. It may be a question of legislation. \nThat is why I have written not only to the head of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration as well as the Department of Transportation and the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, urging them to expedite this \nquestion about whether or not we can safely install a video camera in \nthe cockpit of aircraft to make certain that if there is an accident, \nso that we have another tool available to determine the reason for the \ndisaster. We wouldn't be involved in all this speculation with the \npeople of Egypt about the utterance of a prayer and whether that meant \nthis was a suicide mission or something far different if we had a \nvideotape we could refer to. We could find out who was at the controls \nand what they did at those controls. We would have an obvious clear \nanswer to the question.\n  As I went through this, I was amazed. I stopped and thought for a \nmoment, why in the world are we still stuck with a tape recording of \nvoices and sounds in the investigation of this aircraft disaster? I am \nurging my colleagues, those who feel as I do, to join me in this effort \nto make certain we bring the very best technology to the cockpits of \naircraft, not only in the United States but those who serve the United \nStates, so the day may come that if there is a disaster, we will have a \nfinal and complete answer, not just to satisfy curiosity but, even more \nimportant, to make sure passengers across the world can at least have \nsome piece of mind knowing we have done everything we can to make \nairline safety our top and highest priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14756-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14756-S14757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CLOSING DAYS OF THE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the closing days of this session--it is interesting--\nwe have spent almost a year debating 13 appropriations bills. Now we \nare trying to bring them to a close. We have some six or seven bills \nthat will finally be lumped together in a huge package which literally \nno single Member of the Senate will ever read.\n  It will come to the floor. And then weeks afterwards, when people \npore through the details, they will call us in our offices and say: Did \nyou know there was a paragraph in this bill which has an impact on some \npeople or some businesses? In all honesty, we don't. We rely on our \nleadership and other appropriators. Frankly, we rely on a system that \nis flawed, a system that allows this to happen too often. It is an \nunfortunate system and, frankly, reflects the fact that this Congress \nhas been very unproductive.\n\n  When Members of the Senate return to their homes and are asked by \naverage families in their States, what did you accomplish to make life \nbetter for the families of America, we will be hard pressed to point to \nany significant thing we have done.\n  If we pay attention to the polling data of what Americans are worried \nabout and what families are concerned about, we have missed the boat \nentirely. We have missed it entirely, when it comes to the question of \nthe relationship between American families and their health insurance \ncompanies. Time and time again, when asked, these families respond that \nthey are concerned about the fact doctors are no longer making \ndecisions, nurses are no longer making decisions. Decisions are being \nmade by insurance companies and their clerks.\n  We are down to the wire. Most of the major issues that are on the \nminds of the American public are being buried in this session of the \nCongress. Most of the bills, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights, that \ncould have helped working families are being stifled and gutted. The \nSenate passed a bill several months ago which was an embarrassment. It \nwas, in fact, a protection bill for the insurance companies. It didn't \nprotect patients. It protected the CEOs of companies that are making \nliterally millions of dollars off health care in America.\n  Over the steadfast opposition of the Republican leadership, the House \nof Representatives took a different course. They overwhelmingly \napproved, 275-151, a bipartisan bill with strong protections for all \nprivately insured Americans. What a contrast. The Senate came up with \nan insurance version of the bill; the House came up with a version for \nAmerican families.\n  Well, keep hope alive. Can there be a conference? Can we come \ntogether? Can we finally come up with a bill to protect American \nfamilies? No. The honest answer is the Republican leadership in the \nHouse and the Senate refuse to convene the conference to come up with \nthe bill and the House leadership has rigged the naming of conferees so \nthat their conferees are all members who opposed the House passed bill. \nSo we leave and close this session at the end of 1999 no better than \nwhen we started. We have nothing to say to the families across America \nwhen they ask whether we have taken any steps to protect them when it \ncomes to their relationship with these insurance companies.\n  I am glad 68 Republicans in the House of Representatives broke from \ntheir leadership and voted with the Democrats for a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights. The bill the Senate passed on July 15 did absolutely nothing \nwhen it came to protecting Americans and dealing with their concerns \nabout health insurance.\n  Let us take a look at some of the differences between the two bills \nintroduced in the House and the Senate. This chart shows the Senate \nRepublican bill and the bipartisan bill passed by Republicans and \nDemocrats in the House of Representatives. It goes through a long \nlitany of things American families tell us they want to see in their \nhealth insurance policies: protecting all patients, whether they are \nemployed in a small or large business or bought their own insurance; \nthe ability to hold plans accountable if they make the wrong decision \nabout medical care; the definition of medical necessity; access to \nspecialists; access to out-of-network providers--the list goes on and \non--can a woman keep her OB/GYN as her primary care physician if that \nis the person with whom she is comfortable.\n  Some plans say no. Many women across America think that is a decision \nthat should be made by them and their doctors. That is in this bill. \nAnd as we go through all of these, we find the bipartisan bill that \npassed the House of Representatives basically provides all these \nprotections.\n  Look at the scant protections provided by the Senate Republican bill. \nYou can see why many people across America think we have failed in our \nmost important mission. The bill\n\n[[Page S14757]]\n\npassed by the Senate excluded more than 100 million Americans from \nbasic protections of health insurance reform. Most of the provisions \napplied only to the 48 million Americans in big employer-sponsored \nplans. It failed to provide basic protection to millions of others.\n\n  In my State, Caterpillar Tractor Company's workers would have been \ncovered by the Senate bill; Motorola's employees would have been \ncovered. John Deere's would be covered. But America's small business \nemployees would be left behind by the Senate Republican bill. A farmer \nin Macoupin County, IL, who pays for his own family's insurance, and \npays a lot for it, wouldn't be safe from insurance abuses. Public \nschool teachers, policemen, women, firemen, and so many others would be \nout of luck.\n  I will return to this in a moment. I will speak to another issue, \nwhich I believe the Senator from Massachusetts is going to address. \nThat is the perilous situation we find ourselves in in the closing \nhours of the session when it comes to the critical question of fairness \nin organ allocation.\n  We have a situation across America where over 4,800 Americans die \nevery year waiting for an organ transplant. There are people in your \nState and mine sitting by the telephone hoping for the call that tells \nthem they have a chance to live. It is hard to believe this has become \na political issue. In fact, it has. An effort by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to make organs available across America to \nthose in need is being stopped by an organization and a special \ninterest group that really has put profit ahead of human well-being. I \nhope we can address this and address it forcefully. Let it be known on \na bipartisan basis that we want to take the politics and the special \ninterests out of organ allocation, that our dedication is to the men \nand women and children sitting by those telephones waiting for word of \nthe availability of an organ.\n  At this point, I yield the floor to my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, the House of Representatives will \ntake up one of the most important bills to come before this Congress, \nnow labeled the Ticket To Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, \nwhich is intended to move us closer to opening the workplace doors for \nthe disabled in communities across the country.\n  It is a sad day when the U.S. Congress finds it necessary to attach a \ncontroversial provision to the legislation that could jeopardize the \nopportunity for large numbers of people with disabilities to fulfill \ntheir hopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives.\n  A decade ago, when Congress enacted the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, we promised our disabled fellow citizens a new and better life in \nwhich disability would no longer put an end to the American dream. Too \noften, for too many Americans, that promise has been unfulfilled. The \nTicket To Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act is basically the \nlegislation that Senator Jeffords of Vermont and I, Senator Roth, and \nSenator Moynihan urged the Senate to accept and had been accepted by \nthe Senate by a 99-0 vote. Now the title is the Ticket To Work and Work \nIncentives Improvement Act, and it will dramatically strengthen the \nfulfillment of that promise.\n  We know that millions of disabled men and women in this country want \nto work and are able to work. But they are denied the opportunity, \nprimarily because they lack the continued access to needed health care. \nAs a result, the Nation is denied their talents and contributions to \nour community.\n  Eliminating the health care barriers to work will help large numbers \nof disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency and enable them to \nbecome equal partners in the American dream. The Ticket To Work and \nWork Incentives Improvement Act removes these unfair barriers to work \nthat face so many Americans with disabilities. It makes health \ninsurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work, \nor develops a significant disability while working; it gives people \ngreater access to the services they need to become successfully \nemployed; it phases out the loss of cash benefits as income rises, \ninstead of the unfair sudden cutoff that workers with disabilities face \ntoday; it places work incentives in communities, rather than \nbureaucracies, to help workers with disabilities to learn how to obtain \nthe employment services and support they need.\n  For far too long, disabled Americans have been left out and left \nbehind. It is time for us to take the long overdue action needed to \ncorrect the injustices that have unfairly been placed upon those with \ndisabilities. We should not have this legislation brought down by a \ncontroversial provision that does not belong in this bill--a provision \nthat is effectively what they call around here a ``poison pill.'' A \nprovision that endangers the legislation.\n  I want to say that for a time it looked as if we were going to see a \nsuccessful achievement for this legislation, and I want to commend my \ncolleague and friend, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, for his \nstrong leadership, as chairman of our Human Resource Committee. He has \nworked long and hard for this legislation. If we are able to achieve \nit, his role in support of it and also in its development is enormously \nimportant.\n  On the unacceptable amendment that I had mentioned, it is the \namendment which would effectively undermine the proposal of the \nSecretary of HHS on Final Rule for organ transplantation. There is an \nexcellent editorial in the Washington Post, dated 11-17-99. It puts \nthis issue in perspective. It says:\n\n       Congress has not quite given up the year-long attempt to \n     block rules that would make the Nation's organ transplant \n     network more equitable. House leaders are maneuvering to undo \n     a deal reached by conferees allowing the rules to go into \n     effect, even threatening to block an unrelated authorization \n     for research and training at children's hospitals if the \n     organ rules are not further delayed.\n\n  This was written at a time when they were threatening to hold up the \nhelp and assistance that pediatric hospitals need to train \npediatricians, to make sure that pediatric hospitals were going to be \ntreated fairly and equitably, as other teaching hospitals.\n  There is broad and wide bipartisan support for the proposal to \nsupport teaching in pediatric hospitals. But that was going to be the \nmessenger, and the poison pill was going to be the language which, as I \nunderstand, would be a part of the legislation that we will see later \non in the day.\n  Let me continue with the Post editorial:\n\n       The rules issuance last year touched off furious counter-\n     lobbying by the supporters of the small local transplant \n     centers who feared that a new system based more on finding \n     the patients with the most urgent need, and less on keeping \n     organs near home, would force small centers to close. Never \n     mind if it also would save lives. Currently, when an organ \n     becomes available, it is offered locally first and then \n     regionally. That leads to situations in which people languish \n     on long waiting lists in some places, while the wait in other \n     regions is much shorter. The wealthy can get on multiple \n     waiting lists and fly to wherever a liver or kidney becomes \n     available. Since some 4,000 people a year die while waiting \n     for an organ, you would think a proposal to purge the \n     distribution system of some of its inefficiencies would have \n     been welcome. Instead, local transplant centers turn to \n     Congress, which twice attached riders to appropriations bills \n     delaying the regulations' effective date. They also turned to \n     State governments, many of which passed laws that bar and \n     prevent organs from being transferred out of State. Finally, \n     conferees reached a compromise that would delay the rules 6 \n     more weeks, then let them go into effect.\n\n  Mr. President, that agreement was broken with the language that has \nbeen included on the disability legislation. By breaking that \nagreement, the lives of tens of thousands of desperately ill people are \nput at risk. Every year, thousands of people die while waiting for \ntransplantation--and at least one person every day dies because the \ntransplantation system is not equitable. The language included on the \ndisability legislation violates fundamental fairness--the fairness of \nthe bargaining process in which an agreement was reached between the\n\n[[Page S14758]]\n\nSecretary and the appropriators, and the fairness of the organ \nallocation system.\n  Mr. President, I will take only a moment or two more--because the \ntime is moving on--to refer to the Institute of Medicine report, which \nreally is the authoritative report on this whole issue. I will mention \nrelevant parts of the institute report, and focus on the conclusion \nthat the Institute of Medicine had on the whole question of developing \nrules on fairness for organ transplantation--the question of how to \nbest address the moral issues and the ability of people to be able to \nbe treated fairly under a system of organ distribution.\n  The Institute of Medicine's analysis shows that patients who have a \nless urgent need for a transplant sometimes receive transplants before \nmore severely ill patients who are served by different OPOs. There is \nno credible evidence that implementing the HHS's recommendation would \nresult in closure of smaller transplant centers.\n  Mr. President, that fear about the fate of small centers is the heart \nof the argument of those that have put on this rider. A rider that has \nno business being put on this legislation.\n  The Institute of Medicine analysis further found that there is no \nreason to conclude that minority and low-income patients would be less \nlikely to obtain organ transplants as a result. Likewise, data does not \nsupport the assertion that potential donors and their families would \ndecline to make donations because an organ might be used outside the \ndonor's immediate geographical area.\n  The Institute of Medicine recommended that HHS--and this is on page \n12 of the report--should exercise the legitimate oversight \nresponsibilities assigned to it by the National Organ Transplant Act, \nand articulated in the Final Rule, to manage the system of organ \nprocurement and transplantation in the public interest.\n  Federal oversight is needed to ensure that high standards of equity \nand quality are met. Those high standards of equity and quality were \nincluded in the Secretary's excellent recommendation. By tampering with \nthose, we are undermining enormously powerful and important health \npolicy issues. And this extremely controversial rider is added onto \nunderlying legislation which is so important to millions of disabled \nindividuals in our country. Individuals who thought--when this \nlegislation moved through with very strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate, and then through the final months, has moved through the House \nof Representatives, and has the strong support of President Clinton, \nand has had the bipartisan support here in the Congress--thought that \nthere was going to be a new day for those who have physical or mental \nchallenges and disabilities to have the ability to participate in the \nworkforce and become more productive, useful, active, and independent \ncitizens in this country, and also to be able to contribute to the \nNation in a more significant way.\n  I certainly hope we can work through this process because the \nlegislation, which as I mentioned, has been completed and supported in \na bipartisan way, is a lifeline to millions of Americans and deserves \npassage.\n  I see my friend and colleague, Senator Jeffords, who has been \ninstrumental in having this legislation advanced. I am glad to see him \non the floor at this time. I hope he will address the Senate on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14758-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended until 1 p.m. with the time equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \nI would be happy if he desires to more fully discuss what we have done. \nI was not here to hear his full speech. I thank him. We have worked \ntogether. He was here years before I came to the Senate. In 1975, we \nhad the initial big step forward for the disabled and were able to set \nup the 94142, as it was called then, to make sure all children got a \ngood education, and specially those with disabilities.\n  As we have walked through this over a period of many years, we have \nfought year by year to remove block by block what the disabled \ncommunity has had to face. Finally, we are at that point where we are \nopening the final door to allow them to do what all disabled want to \ndo, and that is to have a meaningful life, to be able to seek \nemployment, and get employment without having the doors slammed because \nthey lost their benefits.\n  I can't thank the Senator enough for what he has done. Also, there \nare others, some who have left this body, such as Bob Dole, who was \nanother leader for the disabled. I praise him also for the work he did, \nand especially in this area where he helped us introduce the bill that \nwe were so happy to be able to cosponsor and to see it put into the \nfinal steps.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts profusely for all he has done. \nI would be happy to yield for any further comment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I mentioned earlier, this has been a continuing \nprocess beginning with the passage of the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, when we put into law protections for the disabled so they wouldn't \nbe discriminated against in the workplace based upon their disability.\n  As the Senator knows very well, that has been enormously important \nand has been effective. But as the Senator has pointed out, with this \nlegislation complimenting what has been achieved with the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act, we can open an entirely new dawn for millions \nwho have some disability.\n  As we are getting closer to achieving that, I am sure the Senator \nagrees with me that when we finally have the President's signature on \nthis, there will be people saying: What has taken them so long? This is \nsuch a commonsense approach. But as the Senator knows, this has been a \nbattle every step of the way. There have been those who have felt that \nif we do this for this particular group, we might be establishing some \nform of precedent that may be used somewhere down the road, and worry \nif we know where it might lead.\n  There are a number of strong negative voices out there. Nonetheless, \nI think with the leadership of the Senator from Vermont and others--he \nmentioned certainly Senator Dole, Senator Weicker, and our good friend \non our human resources committee, Tom Harkin, who is generally \nrecognized in this body as one of the real authorities on disability \nissues--this has been a common effort of this institution. It is an \narea of public policy where this institution has done what it is \nchallenged to do; and that is to find common ground in a bipartisan way \nto address a common concern that affects millions of Americans and make \nprogress on it.\n  I again thank the Senator from Vermont for the opportunity to work \nwith him. We still have a ways to go to make sure the legislation \nactually reaches the people and addresses the regulations in the way it \nis intended. But I think this is going to be enormously important--and \nI hope soon to finally have the President's signature on this \nlegislation. We are much closer today than we have ever been in the \npast.\n  I join with the Senator to thank him for his good work. We hope to \nsee that this is actually put into place and implemented so it will \nbenefit those that it should benefit.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for those comments and for all the work he has done.\n  I am delighted to stand before you today, to speak about an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation. The bill we are sending to the \nPresident today, a bill I know he is eager to sign into law, will have \na tremendous impact on people with disabilities. In fact, this \nlegislation is the most important piece of legislation for the \ndisability community since the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  My reason for sponsoring this particular piece of legislation is \nquite simple. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 addresses a \nfundamental flaw in current law. Today, individuals with disabilities \nare forced to make a\n\n[[Page S14759]]\n\nchoice . . . an absurd choice. They must choose between working and \nreceiving health care. Under current federal law, if people with \ndisabilities work and earn over $700 per month, they will lose cash \npayments and health care coverage under Medicaid or Medicare. This is \nhealth care coverage that they need. This is health care coverage that \nthey cannot get in the private sector. This is not right.\n  Once enacted, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will allow \nindividuals with disabilities, in states that elect to participate, \ncontinuing access to health care when they return to work or remain \nworking. In addition, those individuals who seek it, will have access \nto job training and job placement assistance from a wider range of \nproviders than is available at this time. Currently, there are 9.5 \nmillion individuals with disabilities across the country who receive \ncash payments and health care coverage from the federal government. \nApproximately 24,000 of these individuals live in my home state, \nVermont. Once enacted, the Work Incentives Improvement Act will \nactually save the federal government money. For example, let's assume \nthat 200 Social Security disability beneficiaries in each state return \nto work and forgo cash payments. That would be 10,000 individuals out \nof the 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the country. \nThe annual savings to the Federal Treasury in cash payments for just \nthese 10,000 people would be $133,550,000! Imagine the savings to the \nFederal Treasury if this number were higher. Clearly, the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999 is fiscally responsible legislation.\n  I began work on this bill in 1996. Though it was a long and sometimes \ndifficult task, many hands made light work. Senator Kennedy, Ranking \nMember on the HELP Committee, joined me in March of 1997. Senators Roth \nand Moynihan, Chairman and Ranking Member on the Finance Committee \nsigned on as committed partners in December of 1998. Last January, 35 \nof our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, joined us in \nintroducing S. 331, the Senate version of this legislation. One week \nlater, in a Finance Committee hearing, we heard compelling testimony \nfrom our friend, former Senator Dole, a strong supporter of this \nlegislation. A month later, we marked this legislation out of the \nFinance Committee with an overwhelming majority in favor of the bill. \nFinally, on June 15th, with a total of 80 cosponsors, we passed this \nlegislation on the floor of the United States Senate, with a unanimous \nvote of 99-0.\n  Four months later, over 35 of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, took to the floor of their chamber, and spoke \neloquently for their version of this legislation. Later that day, the \nbill passed the floor of the House with a vote of 412-9. Since then, \nthe Senate and House Conferees have been working diligently in effort \nto reach common ground. I am very pleased today, that the differences \nin policy in the two different bills have been resolved and consensus \nhas been reached on a conference agreement. This agreement does not \ncompromise the original intent of the legislation, retaining key \nprovisions from S. 331.\n  From my perspective, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 \nrepresents a natural and important progression in federal policy for \nindividuals with disabilities. That is, federal policy increasingly \nreflects the premise that individuals with disabilities are cherished \nby their families, valued and respected in their communities, and are \nan asset and resource to our national economy. Today, most federal \npolicy promotes opportunities for these individuals, regardless of the \nseverity of their disabilities, to contribute to their maximum \npotential--at home, in school, at work, and in the community.\n  I have been committed to improving the lives of individuals with \ndisabilities throughout my Congressional career. Providing a solid \nelementary and secondary education for children with disabilities, so \nthat they will be equipped, along with their peers, to benefit from \npost-secondary and employment opportunities is crucial. When I came to \nCongress in 1975, Public Law 94-142, the Education for all Handicapped \nChildren Act, now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA), was enacted into law. IDEA assures each child with a \ndisability, a free and appropriate public education. I am proud to be \none of the original drafters of this legislation which has reshaped \nwhat we offer to and expect of children with disabilities in our \nnation's schools.\n  In addition, I have been committed to providing job training \nopportunities for individuals with disabilities. In 1978, I played a \ncentral role in ensuring access to programs and services offered by the \nfederal government for individuals with disabilities through an \namendment to the Rehabilitation Act. I believe that this amendment \nalone laid the foundation for significant legislation that followed, \nincluding the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with \nDisabilities Act of 1988, now the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, \nboth of which I drafted. Most importantly, this legislation opened the \ndoors for the most comprehensive piece of legislation of all, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This legislation prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in employment, public \nservices, public accommodations, transportation, and telephone service.\n  These laws have forever changed the social landscape of America. They \nserve as models for other countries who recognize that their citizens \nwith disabilities are an untapped resource. In our country, individuals \nwith disabilities are seen everywhere, doing everything. Just this past \nweekend, thousands of physically disabled individuals participated in \nthe New York City Marathon, as they have been doing for years. The \nexpectations that these people set for themselves and the standards we \napply to them have increasingly been raised, and now in many \ncircumstances equal those set and applied to other individuals.\n\n  Unfortunately, one major inequity remains. That is, the loss of \nhealth care coverage if an individual on the Social Security disability \nrolls chooses to work. Individuals with disabilities want to work. They \nhave told me this. In fact, a Harris survey found that 72 percent of \nAmericans with disabilities want to work, but only one-third of them do \nwork. With today's enactment of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of \n1999, individuals with disabilities will no longer need to worry about \nlosing their health care if they choose to work a forty-hour week, to \nput in overtime, or to pursue career advancement. Individuals with \ndisabilities are sitting at home right now, waiting for this \nlegislation to become law. Having a job will provide them with a sense \nof self-worth. Having a job will allow them to contribute to our \neconomy. Having a job will provide them with a living wage, which is \nnot what one has through Social Security.\n  In addition to continuing health care coverage and providing job \ntraining opportunities for individuals with disabilities, this \nlegislation offers many other substantial long-term benefits. The Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999 will give us access to data \nregarding the numbers, the health care needs, and the characteristics \nof individuals with disabilities who work. Furthermore, this \nlegislation will provide the federal government as well as private \nemployers and insurers, the facts upon which to craft appropriate \nfuture health care options for working individuals with disabilities. \nIt will allow employers and insurers to factor in the effects of \nchanging health care needs over time for this population. Hopefully, it \nwill even improve the way in which employers operate return-to-work \nprograms. Through increased tracking of data, we will learn the \nbenefits of intervening with appropriate health care, when an \nindividual initially acquires a disability. We will also learn the \nvalue of continuing health care to a working individual with a \ndisability. If an individual, even with a severe disability, knows that \nhe or she has access to uninterrupted, appropriate health care, the \nindividual will be a healthier, happier and thus more productive \nworker.\n  I would like to take the time now to briefly outline the major \nprovisions which have remained as part of this legislation. The \nconference agreement retains the two state options of establishing \nMedicaid buy-ins for individuals on Social Security disability rolls, \nwho choose to work and exceed income limits in current law, as well as \nfor those who show medical improvement, but still have an underlying \ndisability.\n\n[[Page S14760]]\n\nFor working individuals with disabilities, the conference agreement \nextends access, beyond what is allowed in current law, to Medicare. In \naddition, the legislation before us today retains several key \nprovisions from S. 331, including, the authority to fund Medicaid \ndemonstration projects to provide access to health care to working \nindividuals with a potentially severe disability; the State \nInfrastructure Grant Program, to assist states in reaching and helping \nindividuals with disabilities who work; work incentive planners and \nprotection and advocacy provisions; and finally, most of the provisions \nin the Ticket to Work Program.\n\n  In order to control the cost of this legislation, compromises were \nmade. Although the purpose of the State Infrastructure Grant Program \nand the Medicaid Demonstration Grant Program remain the same, the terms \nand conditions of these grants were altered in conference. As a result, \nstates are not required to offer a Medicaid buy-in option to \nindividuals with disabilities on Social Security, who work and exceed \nincome limits in current law, prior to receiving an Infrastructure or a \nMedicaid Demonstration Grant.\n  Also in Conference, the extended period of eligibility for Medicare \nfor working individuals with disabilities has been changed from 24 to \n78 months. During this extended period, the federal government is to \ncover the cost of the Part A premium of Medicare for a working \nindividual with a disability, who is eligible for Medicare. S. 331 \nwould have extended such coverage for an individual's working life, if \nhe or she became eligible during a 6-year time period.\n  I would like to note two changes to the Ticket to Work program made \nduring Conference. The new legislation shifts the appointment authority \nfor the members of the Work Incentives Advisory Panel from the \nCommissioner of Social Security to the President and Congress. In \naddition, language regarding the reimbursements between employment \nnetworks and state vocational rehabilitation agencies was deleted in \nConference. The new legislation gives the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity the authority to address these matters through regulation.\n  Although several changes have been made from the original Work \nIncentives bill, I am still very pleased with what we are adopting \ntoday. This is legislation that makes sense, and it will contribute to \nthe well-being of millions of Americans, including those with \ndisabilities and their friends, their families, and their co-workers. \nToday's vote provides us the opportunity to bring responsible change to \nfederal policy and to eliminate a misguided result of the current \nsystem--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, you \ndon't get health care. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 \nmakes living the American dream a reality for millions of individuals \nwith disabilities, who will no longer be forced to choose between the \nhealth care coverage they so strongly need and the economic \nindependence they so dearly desire.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the many people who contributed to \nreaching this day. I especially thank the conferees, Majority Leader \nLott, Senators Roth and Moynihan, and in the House, Majority Leader \nArmey, and Congressmen Archer, Bliley, Rangel, and Dingell. I also \nthank their staff who worked so closely in effort to reach this day. \nFrom my staff, I thank Pat Morrissey, Lu Zeph, Leah Menzies, Chris \nCrowley, and Kim Monk. I want to recognize and extend my appreciation \nto the staff members of my three fellow sponsors of this bill; Connie \nGarner in Senator Kennedy's office, Jennifer Baxendell and Alexander \nVachon with Senator Roth, and Kristen Testa, John Resnick, and Edwin \nPark from Senator Moynihan's staff. Finally, I wish to thank Ruth Ernst \nwith the Senate Legislative Counsel for her drafting skill and \nsubstantive expertise, her willingness to meet time tables, and most of \nall, her patience.\n  In addition to staff, we received countless hours of assistance and \nadvice from the Work Incentives Task Force of the Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities. These individuals worked tirelessly to \neducate Members of Congress about the need for and the effects of this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I would like to urge my colleagues in both chambers to set \naside any concerns about peripheral matters and to focus on the central \nprovisions of this legislation. Let's focus on what today's vote will \nmean to the 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the \nnation. At last, these individuals will be able to work, to preserve \ntheir health, to support their families, to become independent, and \nmost importantly, to contribute to their communities, the economy, and \nthe nation. We are making a statement, a noble statement and we must do \nthe right thing. Let's send this bill to the President.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, how \nmuch time remains in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). We are in morning business until \n1 o'clock, with the time equally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The remaining time on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we reflect at the end of this \nlegislative session on our accomplishments, it is my belief that there \nare very few things we can go back home to tell the American people we \nachieved.\n  100 Senators and 435 Members of the House of Representatives came to \nWashington, DC, at the beginning of the year and listened closely to \nPresident Clinton's State of the Union Address where he outlined a \nprogram and some objectives, many stood and cheered. The applause lines \nwere frequent during the course of that speech. People of both \npolitical parties left the State of the Union Address saying they were \nnow energized and invigorated to go forward and address the issues \nfacing America, and we began the legislative process.\n  For me, it is the 17th time I have been through this. It is hard for \nme to remember another session of the Congress as unproductive as this \nsession of the Congress. When it came to issues that the people and \nfamilies across America care about, this Congress refused to do \nanything. This wasn't a titanic struggle between the Republican \nconservative agenda and the progressive agenda of the Democrats where \nwe brought issues to the floor and fought over amendments from one side \nto the other. That is what we are supposed to see on Capitol Hill. That \ndidn't happen because there was no agenda on the other side. The \nRepublican leadership had no agenda.\n  Recently, a Republican Congressman said we considered this year a \n``legislative timeout.'' When timeouts occur during the course of an \nNFL football game, most people leave the room and go to the \nrefrigerator; if America's families had left the room and gone to the \nrefrigerator, they would have spent a lot of time there this year if \nthey were waiting for Congress to do something. We didn't do it. We \ndidn't respond. Now we have to go home, as we should, and explain it.\n  Let me state some of the issues we failed to act on this year, issues \nthat make a difference to families across America. The Patients' Bill \nof Rights: The relationship of a person, a family, a business, to their \nhealth insurance company. That is pretty basic. When we asked America's \nfamilies, they said that is the No. 1 concern. We want to make certain, \nwhen we go in a doctor's office, that the doctor makes the decision, \nnot some clerk at an insurance company off in Topeka, KS.\n  I know from my experience in Illinois, as most others know from their \nown personal experiences, many times doctors are being overruled. I can \nrecall a doctor who said to me a mother came in the office with an \ninfant and the baby had been complaining of a headache on the right \nside of his head for several months. The doctor asked if it was always \ncomplaining about one side of the head, and the mother said yes. The \ndoctor thought: I had better take an MRI to see if there might be a \nbrain tumor. Before he said that to the mother, he looked at her file \nfor the name of her insurance company. He said, excuse me, left the \nroom, got on the phone and called the insurance company. He said: The \nmother presents herself with an infant complaining of headaches for \nseveral weeks and\n\n[[Page S14761]]\n\nmonths on one side of the head. It is my medical decision and opinion \nwe should have an MRI to determine whether there is a possibility of a \nbrain tumor.\n  The voice on the other end of the phone said: No; no. The insurance \ncompany that pays for the bills declines that procedure.\n  That doctor had to walk back to that room and not even tell the \nmother what had happened. He was bound by his contract not even to \ndisclose that his medical judgment had been overruled by an insurance \ncompany clerk.\n  That is the state of health care in America. Families who go into \nthose doctors' offices, confident the patient-doctor relationship is a \nsacred one that can be trusted, are beginning to think twice. They \nappeal to Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans: Do something; \nrestore our faith in our medical system. Restore quality health care. \nPass a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  No, not in this Congress. This Congress and the Senate on July 15 \npassed a bill friendly to the insurance companies--as if they needed \nanother friend on Capitol Hill--a bill which, frankly, didn't address \nthe most basic issues families worry over every single day.\n  I won't even get into the question of expanding medical insurance \ncoverage. We wouldn't even utter those words on Capitol Hill for fear \nit might bring down charges of radicalism, the idea that the 44 million \nuninsured Americans who grow in number every year might have their \nGovernment care enough to do something. We are not in that business \nwith the Republican-controlled Congress. We don't talk about those \nthings--like the aunt who is somewhere off in the distance, never \nreferred to by a family.\n  We don't talk about medical coverage for all Americans. Families talk \nabout it. Families talk about their kids turning 23 years of age, \ncoming off the health insurance policies of their moms and dads, and \nwhether they have a chance to be covered. Families talk about whether \nor not someone with a preexisting condition can find insurance in this \ncountry. We don't talk about it in Congress, no. The insurance \ncompanies don't want Members to talk about it. The special interests \nruled this session of Congress.\n  We see in the Republican legislative landfill of the 106th Congress \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, an issue we failed to address.\n  The nuclear test ban treaty: Just a few weeks ago, possible one of \nthe worst decisions made by Congress in a decade, a decision to turn \ndown a treaty where the United States not only would have the moral \nleadership in the world but enact a treaty that backs it up and says to \ncountries around the world: If you are not a nuclear power, don't \nbecome one. If you have nuclear weapons, don't test them. Let's stop \nthis nuclear arms race in place.\n  This nuclear test ban treaty failed in the Senate on a largely \npartisan vote. It was a sad day for America. It was a sad day for a \ncountry which has tried to lead the world and say to countries such as \nIndia and Pakistan, stop what you are doing, don't keep this arms race \ngoing and develop nuclear weapons that could mushroom into a war that \nwould destroy not only people in those two countries but in many other \nnations. This Congress, this Senate, failed to enact a nuclear test ban \ntreaty.\n  We failed to enact any legislation to deal with school construction. \nTake a look at the numbers: There will be more kids showing up for \nclasses in the next 10 years than we have been serving in the last 10 \nor 20 years. Those kids need teachers, they need classrooms, they need \nmodern schools, schools where they have the electricity to make certain \nthey can sustain the computer technology, schools that are safe, \nschools where kids have a positive learning environment. When the \nPresident made this proposal for school construction, it was greeted \nwith disbelief and disapproval on the other side of the aisle. We have \ndone nothing in this session of Congress to deal with school \nconstruction.\n  Campaign finance reform: Is there a more basic issue for the future \nof Congress? Will we ever change the current system which has become a \nbidding war among special interests where Members of the Senate such as \nmyself literally have to be on the phone day and night, begging for \nmoney for a campaign that costs millions of dollars? If you are not \nindependently wealthy and cannot write a big check to sustain your own \ncampaign in the Senate, you spend most of your time begging for money. \nIs that what Americans want in the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives? I don't think so.\n  A bipartisan bill--Senator John McCain, a Republican, of Arizona, and \nSenator Russ Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin--said we can clean up \nthis system, but this Congress failed to enact meaningful campaign \nfinance reform. Only 55 Senators--45 Democrats and 10 Republicans--came \nforward in support of this most basic change in reform.\n  As part of the legislative landfill of the 106th Congress, \nRepublicans were successful in not passing campaign finance reform.\n  Minimum wage increase? The minimum wage in this country is $5.15 an \nhour. When you calculate that out, it means a little over $10,000 a \nyear in income. Can any of us consider a life on $10,000 a year and \nwhat it would mean? Keep in mind, these are men and women who get up \nand go to work every single day and make $5.15 an hour. Inflation eats \naway at it, at a wage that was already too low to be livable. We tried \nthis year to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents an hour each year \nover the next 2 years, saying it is only fair that working men and \nwomen have that help from their Government. We were resisted on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Ultimately, they came up with their own \npackage. They do not do it over 2 years; they do it over 3 years, which \ncosts those wage earners $1,200 a year in income to take that approach. \nMr. President, $1,200? You might say that is not that big a deal. It is \nif you are making $10,000 a year; it is a very big deal.\n  The Republican approach representing special interests in stopping \nthe minimum wage increase prevailed. They also added in there some tax \nbreaks that, frankly, cannot be taken seriously because they did not \npay for them. There we have it--the minimum wage issue into the \nlandfill.\n  This is one you will remember, the juvenile crime control bill. You \nwill remember it because it came up right after Columbine High School. \nIt was an effort by the Senate to pass a sensible gun control law. When \nthe final vote was cast, it was 50-50. Vice President Al Gore came to \nthe floor, broke the tie, and we enacted the bill which said as \nfollows: When people buy guns at gun shows, we want to know if they \nhave a history of violent mental illness or a criminal record.\n  In an effort to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids, we \npassed a sensible gun control measure, sent it across the Rotunda to \nthe House of Representatives, where it literally died because the \nNational Rifle Association and the gun lobby decided they did not want \nto pass any gun control bills this session. This Nation, which was \nshocked by the occurrences at Columbine and so many other schools, had \na chance to pass sensible gun control legislation and failed. We will \ngo home now to face our constituents, many of whom live in cities where \ngun violence is a commonplace occurrence, and have to tell them this \nCongress failed to pass any sensible gun control legislation.\n  Smaller class size--thank goodness the President prevailed in his \nnegotiations. The President's goal, and one I share, is to reduce class \nsize in the early grades so quality teachers can meet with kids right \nwhen they are starting their education and help them along. You take \nthe kids who are the best and the brightest and you give them the \nbiggest challenges. You take those who may be suffering from some \nlearning disability, you diagnose their problem and try to deal with it \nat an early age. You take the kids who do not learn as quickly and give \nthem special attention. For teachers to achieve that, they need smaller \nclass sizes. If you put 30 kids in a classroom, the teacher is lucky to \nmaintain discipline, let alone meet the special needs of individual \nstudents.\n  So the President said, and I agree: We need to focus 100,000 teachers \ninto reducing class size across America. Until a few days ago, the \nRepublicans had opposed this. Finally, the President prevailed. \nFinally, we are moving forward on this initiative which we started last \nyear that serves school districts all across America, not just in\n\n[[Page S14762]]\n\nthe cities but in the towns and suburbs alike.\n  Look at the efforts to help family farmers. We finally came through \nwith that on a bipartisan basis. It is one of the things we achieved \nthis year. But it begs the question, to leave it at that, because next \nyear if we do not change the basic Federal farm policy, the so-called \nFreedom to Farm Act, we are going to see a rerun, unfortunately, of \nwhat we saw this year--farmers literally struggling to survive. As \nprices across the world have plummeted, they cannot make a decent \nincome.\n  In my home State of Illinois, a State that has a very strong farm \nsector, just a few years ago the average net farm income for a farmer \nwas about $48,000 a year. This year it will be about $25,000. That is \nabout half. But $13,000 of the $25,000 will come from Federal payments. \nThe other about $12,000 will come in farm operations. We cannot sustain \na farm economy where half the income of farmers in Illinois and \nMinnesota or Nebraska comes from the Federal Treasury. The law has to \nbe changed, and this year we did not take up a change in the law as we \nshould have.\n  The last point I would like to make before I yield to my colleague \nfrom Minnesota is this. The Patients' Bill of Rights is an issue we \nhave to return to as the highest priority in the next Congress. When \nyou consider the lives of people who are dependent on this action, you \nunderstand the severity of it. I will tell one quick story.\n  Take a look at this little girl here. She is Theresa. She lives in \nYorkville, IL. Her dad is a police officer and her mom stays at home to \nlook after her. She suffers from a rare disease known as spinal \nmuscular atrophy. It is a very debilitating disease. As you can see, \nshe is on a ventilator, and I met a couple of kids just like this. This \nis what her mother says:\n\n       She was hospitalized from September 2nd last year until \n     February 15 of this year due to fighting the insurance \n     company for certain provisions we could not do without in our \n     home.\n       We had to fight and fight with the insurance company for \n     things the doctors had said were needed [for Theresa.] So we \n     fought for 2\\1/2\\ months. We eventually did get everything \n     that we needed, except it was a very long battle.\n\n  Can you imagine having your family separated that long because the \ninsurance company did not want to help?\n\n       Theresa caught RSV in the hospital while we were waiting \n     for the appeal to go through. That is why she now has [a \n     ventilator and tracheotomy.]\n\n  That is a real life family. Theresa's dad is a policeman. Theresa and \nher family would not be protected by the Republican version of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They would not have the benefit of an appeals \nprocess in a timely fashion so they could get a good answer, a sensible \nmedical answer for this little girl. Instead, they are embroiled in \nmonth after month of weary debate with the insurance company. That is \nhealth care in America for too many American families. This Congress \nhas failed, utterly failed to address this critical issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the work \nincentives and ticket to work legislation. This is a day I have looked \nforward to for a long time.\n  It is a great day for the disabled in America. By passing this \nlegislation, we are going to make it easier for them to return to work \nand become self-sufficient. We are going to give those who want to try \nto return to work the tools they need to support themselves and to \nescape from the dependency on a monthly Government check.\n  For years, the Social Security disability program has provided a \nvital safety net to assist those who fall on hard times and need help \nwhen they become sick or injured and cannot support themselves. It has \ndone this job well. But for the many disabled people who have wanted to \nreturn to work and could be able to work, the disability program has \nnot worked as well. It has not properly equipped them to return to the \nworkforce. It has not given them the tools they need to move off the \ndisability rolls. In fact, fewer than 1 percent of those who go on the \ndisability rolls--that is currently 4.5 million people--never return to \nwork because the program does not provide an adequate support network \nor resources for these Americans to move back into the workforce.\n  For these disabled people, the disability program has become a black \nhole. Once they fall in, they cannot escape. The bill we hope to pass \ntoday or tomorrow finally gives these Americans new hope, the ladder \nthey need to climb out of that hole. The Ticket To Work and Work \nIncentives Improvement Act modernizes the disability program and moves \nit into the modern age and provides more options for the disabled who \nwant to work. It provides them with a ticket that can be used to help \nacquire skills to reenter the workforce.\n  Under the old system, these workers had only one option if they \nwanted to return to work; they had to work through their State \nvocational rehabilitation programs. This option will still be open to \nthem, but now they will also be able to use their ``ticket'' to go to \nother provider networks and employers to obtain skills and jobs. In \nshort, the ``ticket'' expands opportunity for training and choices for \nrehabilitation for the disabled, and gives them the ability to tap into \nthe power of the free market.\n  This legislation also addresses the most pressing need for most of \nthose who want to leave the disability rolls and return to work--the \navailability of adequate health care. Many of these potential workers \ncontinue to require a high degree of medical care even after they \nreturn to work. Obtaining this care--and paying for it--is often a high \nhurdle to cross, especially for those who move back to the workplace in \nentry and lower-level positions. Under the bill we are dealing with \ntoday, we expand continued Medicare coverage for the disabled and also \nincrease Medicaid funding to the States to help them address the \nproblems.\n  All in all, this bill is win-win. It is a winner for the disabled \ncommunity and a winner for the American taxpayers and all of us who pay \nSocial Security taxes. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that \nfor every 1 percent of disability recipients who return to work, the \nSocial Security disability trust fund saves $3 billion. That is serious \nmoney. If this legislation only works partly as well as we expect, it \nwill make a tremendous difference for the future of the trust fund and \nour ability to look after the neediest Americans.\n  It's been almost 5 years since Congress began looking into problems \nwith the disability program. In 1995, when I was the chairman of the \nHouse Social Security Subcommittee, we began holding hearings on \npossible changes we could make to Social Security to help the disabled. \nAfter those hearings, former Congresswoman Barbara Kenelley and myself \nwrote reform legislation that passed in the House in 1998 by a vote of \n410-1. While my bill died in the Senate last year because Senator \nKennedy put a hold on my bill and some shenanigans by the White House, \nit is at the core of the legislation we are passing today and I am very \nproud of that. We have worked very hard to make sure the ticket-to-work \nportion of this reflects the bill that passed the House last year 410-\n1.\n  This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. It will \ntruly make a difference for many Americans who need it the most, and I \nthink it will stand as one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation to pass during this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S14763]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a while--though it is not clear \nwhen--it is my understanding that Congressman Obey from Wisconsin--and \nI see Senator Feingold from Wisconsin on the floor right now--is in the \nHouse with any number of different motions to adjourn before this \nconference report is acted upon.\n  We will eventually get this huge omnibus conference report. Those of \nus from the midwest dairy States are indignant about what has been \ndone. It goes beyond dairy. Later on, believe me, we are going to have \nplenty of time to talk about dairy farmers. We are going to talk about \nwhat it means to dairy farmers, what it means to our States, and what \nit means to the country when, in a conference committee, provisions \nthat extend the Northeast Dairy Compact and also block what Secretary \nGlickman was trying to do with the milk marketing order reform are put \ninto the overall bill.\n  What I want to focus on is the process. To focus on the process, one \nmight say, is a little bit too inside Washington politics, but I do not \nthink so because actually, I say to my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, this is, in a way, what makes people most \ndistrustful of what we do.\n  By the way, I am not going to argue that everything we do should be \nlooked upon with suspicion by citizens. I am not going to engage in an \nacross-the-board indiscriminate bashing of the whole political process. \nBut I will say, if people do not believe in the process, they do not \nbelieve in the product.\n  Again, what has happened, in all due respect to the negotiators, is \nby not getting the work done on these appropriations bills and by \nputting all of this into an omnibus bill, we have had a few people \nnegotiating. If the majority party in a conference committee wants to \nroll the minority party, they can do so. That is what they have done in \nthe House by basically putting in this provision that extends the \nNortheast Dairy Compact and blocks the milk marketing order reform.\n  We had a vote on this in the Senate. We voted against extending the \ndairy compact. It was a square and fair debate and vote. Then, in a \nconference committee, completely unrelated to the appropriations bills, \ncompletely unrelated to what the scope of the conference committee was \nsupposed to be, these provisions were put back in the bill in the dark \nof night. House Majority Leader Armey announced they had done it, and \nSenate Majority Leader Lott announced the provision was in. There was \nnever debate and discussion. They tucked into the conference report \nthis huge monstrosity of a bill that hardly any of us have had a chance \nto read yet, which will be coming over here sometime.\n  I come to the floor to say to Congressman Obey in the House: I \napplaud your efforts. What we have is raw politics--just get this \nthrough. That is what they have done with this Northeast Dairy Compact. \nThey could not do it on the floor of the Senate. They stuck it in a \nconference report. They did it in the dead of night. They did it \noutside any public scrutiny. And now they present it to us in a \nconference report as a fait accompli. They set up a continuing \nresolution that goes into next week.\n  They figure out ways of jamming people, and it is unclear as to what \nleverage we have left. But, as Congressman Obey is doing in the House, \nI am sure those of us who are from Wisconsin and Minnesota in the \nSenate intend to speak out. We intend to be very clear about what has \nhappened, and we will do all we can as Senators. We will go from there.\n  I say to my colleagues that almost as much as the final product, I \ncame to the floor of the Senate to strongly dissent from the way it was \ndone.\n  I understand the rules. I understand what it is all about when people \nhave figured out a way to roll Senators. I think that is what the \nmajority leader, the Senate majority leader, and House Majority Leader \nArmey have done. I think that is what the Republicans have done in this \nconference committee. There is no question about it.\n  But I want people in Minnesota to know that we will continue to speak \nout about this, even as we see less and less opportunities for our \nleverage. We will fight in whatever way we can. We will certainly not \nbe silent about this.\n  When this bill comes over, I would think, I say to my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, we can probably expect a considerable \namount of discussion about not only the impact on dairy farmers and \nwhat it is going to mean for a lot of people who are going to go under \nwho are already struggling enough, but I think also, I say to Senator \nFeingold, who has been such a reformer, the way it has been done, the \nwhole process, which I think is profoundly antidemocratic, with a small \n``d''--not up-or-down votes, late at night, tucked into a report; by \nwhom, when, how, not at all clear, and then design rules in such a way \nyou can just roll it through--we will certainly be speaking out loudly \nand clearly about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while presiding and listening to some of \nmy distinguished colleagues talking about the lack of productivity of \nthis session of the legislature, there are a few things that were very \nproductive and that we can be very proud of when we go home and say we \nwere able to get certain things done.\n  Before doing that, though, and to ensure I get one point out before \nusing up the time that is allotted, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois named a number of issues that he thought were somewhat \ndisgraceful--for example, the fact that we do not have more gun control \nlegislation.\n  Maybe because of my roots back in Oklahoma, I find it very difficult \nto understand this mentality, that somehow guns are the culprit as \nopposed to the people, and somehow that honest, law-abiding Americans \nshould have to be disarmed, should have to give up their guns, while \nthe criminal element would not be giving up their guns.\n  Time and time again, every survey that has been done, every study \nthat has taken place, has come to the conclusion that the problems that \nwe have are of a criminal element. There are people out there who are \nnot getting adequately punished, and they will continue to have \nfirearms.\n  I will just make one statement. It seems incredibly naive to me \nanyone could believe that if we pass a law that makes it illegal for \nall citizens to own guns, somehow the criminal element, who by their \nvery definition and nature, are criminals, will comply with the law.\n  Also, it seems very frustrating to me that we have a President of the \nUnited States who wants to have all kinds of legislation to take away \nguns from law-abiding citizens and at the same time turns 16 terrorists \nloose on the streets of America; that we have a President of the United \nStates who will make speeches--as this President made some 133 times, \nincluding in two State of the Union Messages--that now, for the first \ntime in contemporary history, the first time since the dawn of the \nnuclear age, there is not one--I repeat, not one--missile aimed at \nAmerican children tonight. When he made that statement, he knew full \nwell that in at least one country, China, there were a minimum of at \nleast 13 American cities that were targeted at that very moment. So we \nare living in a very dangerous world.\n\n  I listened to the concerns that we have on the nuclear test ban \ntreaty. As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I would like to kind of lead into that to at least \nexplain to thinking people that we did the right thing by not \nunilaterally disarming with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is \nnot verifiable.\n  First of all, I can say--and I do not think anyone can challenge this \nstatement--we are now in the most threatened position that we have been \nin, in the history of America. By that, I mean for things that have \nhappened in the last 7 years in three broad categories.\n  First of all, we have a President of the United States who, through \nhis veto messages, starting in 1993 in vetoing the defense \nauthorization bills, and then succeeding bills since that\n\n[[Page S14764]]\n\ntime, has done so, so that we would have to cut down the size of our \nmilitary, so that we now have ended up having a force strength of one-\nhalf of what we had in 1991 and 1992 during the Persian Gulf war.\n  It is not a matter of the President vetoing defense authorization \nbills and taking money out of our defense system to put into his \nfavorite domestic social programs, but at the same time he has deployed \nour troops to places all over the Earth where we have no national \nsecurity interests. So now we have troops in Bosnia.\n  I remember in December of 1995, when we were on the floor trying to \npass a resolution of disapproval, to stop the President from sending \nour rare military assets to places such as Bosnia. We lost it by three \nvotes. The President said: Let me do this. If we defeat this \nresolution, and if we get to send troops into Bosnia, I promise they \nwill be home for Christmas 1996. Here we are. We are getting close to \nChristmas 1999 and the troops are still not home. There is no end in \nsight.\n  We have the same thing in Kosovo. We have had serious problems. I \nhave gone over to Kosovo, I am sure, more than any other Member has, \nonly to find out this is a war that has been going on for 600 years, a \nwar where the two sides alternate in who is the good guy and who is the \nbad guy. Ethnic cleansing has taken place historically for 600 years on \nboth sides; both on the Serbian side and the Albanian side.\n  So it was a horrible awakening I had when I was over there, right \nafter we went in there with cruise missiles, where we had refugees in \ndifferent places such as Tirana, Albania. I can remember walking \nthrough the refugee camp. The people were well cared for. They were \ndoing quite well. But then they looked at me and said: When are you and \nAmerica going to do something about our problem?\n  I said: What is your problem?\n  They said: Well, we're refugees.\n  I said: Why should we in the United States be as concerned about that \nas other countries?\n  They said: Because it is because of you that we are refugees. It is \nbecause the ethnic cleansing was not accelerated until the time that \nthe bombs started being dropped on that town.\n  So we now have a weakened defense system because we have starved it \ninto a degree of weakness. Yet we are living in a time when virtually \nevery country has weapons of mass destruction.\n  And now we find out that in conventional warfare we are not superior \nanymore. Wake up America. We are not superior anymore. We found out the \nother day that two of our Army divisions are ranked as C-4, which means \nthey are not capable of combat. And what are these divisions? These \ndivisions are the 10th Army Mountain Division in Bosnia and the 1st \nInfantry Division in Kosovo.\n  It is not the fault of our troops. They are put in places and they no \nlonger have combat training, so they are not capable of combat without \ncoming out of there and training for at least 6 months.\n  So if we are down to 10 Army divisions because of this President, and \n2 of them are rendered incapable of combat, that is 8 Army divisions. \nWe had 19 during the Persian Gulf war. So that is what has happened to \nour military.\n  Just the other day I was very proud of Gen. John Jumper, who had the \ncourage to stand up and say publicly that we are no longer superior in \nair-to-air and air-to-ground combat. Our strategic fighters are not \nsuperior to those others on the market. He stated the SU-35, as made by \nthe Russians, is on the market right now, the open market. It is for \nsale. Anyone can buy it--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, anybody else--and it \nis better than anything we have, including the F-15 and the F-16.\n  We have to face up to this. It is a threat from the conventional side \nas well as from missiles.\n  I will make one comment about the missiles. Again, we hang this on \nPresident Clinton. In that same veto message in 1993, President Clinton \nsaid: I'm vetoing this bill. And I'm vetoing it because it has money in \nit for a national missile defense system, which we do not need because \nthere is no threat out there. Yet we knew from our intelligence that \nthe threat would be there and imminent by fiscal year 1998. And sure \nenough, it was.\n  So here we are with the combination of all these countries out there \nthat have every kind of weapon of mass destruction: Biological, \nchemical, or nuclear. Yet we have countries such as China and Russia \nand now North Korea that have the capability of delivering those \nwarheads to anywhere in America right now, when we are in Washington, \nDC. They could fire one from North Korea that would take 35 minutes to \nget here. There is not one thing in our arsenal to knock it down \nbecause this President vetoed our national missile defense effort.\n\n  Now the American people have awakened to this, and we have enough \nDemocrats who are supporting Republicans to rebuild our system and to \ntry to get a national missile defense system deployed. Unfortunately, \nit couldn't happen for another 2 years, maybe 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years.\n  That gets around to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty about which my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois was talking. I think probably the \nbest thing that could have happened to us for our national security was \nto defeat that. If we don't have a national missile defense system, \nthen what do we have to deter other countries from launching missiles \nat the United States?\n  What we have is a nuclear stockpile. We have nine weapons in the \nnuclear stockpile. Because of the President's moratorium, they haven't \nbeen tested for 7 years. We don't know whether or not they work. I \nsuggest it might be better not even to have nuclear weapons than to \nhave weapons but not know whether they work. That is exactly what we \nhave right now. If we had passed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \nthere would be no verification, there would be no way in the world we \nwould have known whether or not our stockpile was working because they \nhadn't been tested.\n  I can remember quote after quote after quote by the people who were \nso much involved in this from our energy labs. They all said--I had the \nquotes; I don't have them in front of me right now--that if we can't \ntest these nuclear weapons, there is no way we can determine whether or \nnot they work. It is a very unsafe thing for America. These were the \ndirectors of the labs responsible for this nuclear arsenal.\n  So of the nine weapons we have, which I have listed here, we only \nhave one we have adequately tested enough to know whether or not it \nwould work. That is the W-84 warhead that we know would work.\n  This would have been a real disaster for America. People kept saying \nPresident Eisenhower was for a comprehensive test ban treaty, that \nPresident Bush was, that President Reagan was. That isn't true at all. \nThis flawed treaty was a zero-yield treaty. We would only have had the \nword of our adversaries that they would not test their nuclear \narsenals.\n  We keep our word in America; we don't test our arsenal. But we don't \nhave any idea whether or not they are going to test theirs. In fact, \nduring the course of the debate, both China and Russia said they would \nnot comply with the zero yield. There is no way in the world we can \ndetect that, that we would know what our adversaries were doing. That \nwould, for all practical purposes, be unilateral disarmament.\n  I am asked back in Oklahoma by people who have good street sense, why \nis it the liberals in Congress are so committed to disarming our \ncountry, to taking our money that we are supposed to have to defend \nAmerica and putting it into these various discretionary social \nprograms? I have to explain to them that the people in Washington, and \nsome of the Senators in this Chamber, are not like the people of \nOklahoma. I think President Clinton honestly believes that if we all \nstand in a circle and hold hands and we unilaterally disarm, everyone \nwill love each other and it won't be necessary to have a defense \nsystem.\n\n  That is what we are up against. In a very respectful way, I have to \ndisagree with many of the things my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois stated.\n  I think we have had a very successful session. We have ensured a \nsound Social Security retirement system. We have improved educational \nopportunities for our children. Along this line, the major disagreement \nwe had was that the Democrats thought the decisions should be made here \nin Washington; Republicans want to use the\n\n[[Page S14765]]\n\nsame amount of money but not make the decisions in Washington but send \nthat money to the school districts. The school board in Tulsa, OK, is \nmuch better equipped to know what their education needs are in Oklahoma \nthan we are in this August body of the Senate. The Democrats say the \nanswer is not school buses, not computers, not the physical facilities \nthat are available; it is 100,000 teachers. I think the more we can \nsend these decisions back to the local level, the better the people of \nAmerica will be served.\n  I believe we have had a good session. I am not pleased with the way \nit is turning out right now. The old saying we have heard so many times \nin the past that there are two things you never want to watch while \nthey are being made--one is sausage and the other is laws--becomes very \ntrue during the last few days of legislative sessions.\n  I think we have done a very good job. I think we did the right thing \nin defeating the unverifiable test ban treaty. I think we have passed \nlegislation of which America will be very proud. I am anxious to end \nall this fun we are having and go home and tell the people in Oklahoma \nabout it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).

Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate on a \nnumber of occasions recently to talk about the issue of prescription \ndrugs for the elderly.\n  I think there is a particularly relevant point to make this afternoon \ngiven the very extensive press coverage we have seen on this issue in \nrecent days.\n  Over the weekend, David Rosenbaum in the New York Times had an \nexcellent article on the issue. In the last couple of days, Time \nmagazine had another very lengthy piece on the question of prescription \ndrugs for seniors. And both of these articles ultimately make the point \nthat Congress probably is not going to be able to agree on legislation \nduring this session. The authors offer considerable skepticism about \nthe ability of Congress to come together on a very difficult issue. \nBoth of them, to some extent, go off into what I think are secondary \nquestions--the questions of the role of the Internet, and the question \nof patents on drugs. Those are important matters.\n  But what is central and what the Congress needs to do on a bipartisan \nbasis is pass legislation that would make it possible for frail and \nvulnerable older people to get insurance coverage that would provide \nfor their medicine.\n  For example, if you are an elderly widow who is 78, maybe having \nearly signs of Alzheimer's, and you spend more than half of your \ncombined monthly income of Social Security and pension on prescription \nmedicine--those are the kinds of letters that seniors are sending to \nme--it is not going to help you a whole lot to get a 10- or 15-percent \ndiscount because you shop over the Internet. Certainly, the role of the \nInternet in prescription drugs is going to be important. There will be \na lot of issues. But to provide relief for the Nation's older people, \nwhat Congress needs to do on a bipartisan basis is pass legislation \nthat provides insurance coverage making it possible for older people to \npay these big bills. Patent issues and the question of the Internet are \nmatters that are important, but what is needed is legislation that \nprovides real relief.\n\n  Part of the effort to win bipartisan support for prescription drug \nlegislation is coming to this floor and, as the poster says, urging \nseniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. Send them \nto each of us here in the Senate in Washington, DC.\n  I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate and actually \nreading from these letters. I have three today that I think tell an \nimportant story.\n  One is from a senior citizen in Medford, OR, in my home State. \nAnother is from a senior citizen from Grants Pass, OR, and a third is \nfrom a senior citizen in O'Brien, OR, all of which reflect the kind of \nconcerns I know are out there. Hopefully, as seniors learn about our \ncampaign and see that we are urging them to send us copies of their \nprescription drug bills, it can help bring about bipartisan support for \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  I am very proud that I have been able to team up in recent months \nwith Senator Olympia Snowe on bipartisan legislation. I have been of \nthe view that nothing more can happen in Washington, DC, unless it is \nbipartisan. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is a bill that uses marketplace \nforces and unleashes the forces of the private sector in an effort to \nmake medicine more affordable for the Nation's older people.\n  What is sad is that our elderly are in effect hit by a double whammy. \nMillions of them can't afford their prescriptions. Medicare doesn't \ncover medicine. It hasn't since the program began in 1965.\n  On top of the fact that seniors don't have Medicare coverage, when \nthey walk into a pharmacy--I see our friend from New Hampshire, our \ncolleague who has a great interest in health care. As he knows, when a \nsenior walks into a drugstore in New Hampshire, Oregon, or Kentucky, \nand can't pay for their prescription medicine, in addition they are \nsubsidizing the big buyers of prescription drugs. The HMOs and the \nhealth care plans are in a position to negotiate a discount. They get a \nbreak on their prices. The seniors, people who are spending half their \nmonthly income on prescriptions, are, in effect, subsidizing those big \nbuyers.\n  The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation, fortunately, has been able to \ngenerate a lot of interest in the Senate. Senator Snowe and I are proud \nto have the support.\n  For example, more than 54 Members of the Senate--more than half the \nSenate--are now on record saying they would support a tobacco tax to \npay for prescription drug benefits for older people. That strikes me as \nappropriate.\n\n  Medicare spent more than $12 billion last year picking up the costs \nof tobacco-related illnesses, and more than 50 Members of the Senate \nare now on record as saying they would be willing to support additional \nfunding to help the vulnerable seniors from whom we are hearing.\n  Let me read a little bit from some of these letters because I think \nthey sum it up. One I received in the last couple of days from Grants \nPass says:\n\n       No way can I afford to pay for my medicine. I did get a \n     refill on Pepcid.\n\n  That is an important medication this elderly woman is taking now in \nGrants Pass, OR.\n\n\n[[Page S14766]]\n\n\n       I do hope you can do something to help us seniors.\n\n  When she writes, ``No way can I afford to pay for my medicine,'' that \nessentially sums it up.\n  We can talk about people buying prescription drugs over the Internet; \nwe can talk about the patent issue, both involving substantial sums of \nmoney. Whatever that person needs in Grants Pass--and the letter goes \non to say she has no insurance coverage for her medicine--seniors need \nlegislation that actually provides coverage through the insurance \nsystem to help pay for prescription drugs.\n  Another letter comes from Medford, OR. We can see the stack of bills \ngoing to a pharmacy in Medford, Southern Oregon Health Trust Pharmacy. \nThis individual has spent $1,664 recently on prescription drugs in \nMedicare. She is sending bills to our office. Unfortunately, she \ndoesn't get any help through the various insurance coverages she has. \nThis is representative of what we have been hearing. She also goes on \nto point out that this large stack of bills she sent me does not even \ninclude some of the over-the-counter drugs she is taking such as \nibuprofen.\n  These cases illustrate very well why our country cannot afford not to \ncover prescription medicine. All of these articles, including Time \nmagazine, are always questioning whether the Nation can afford to cover \nprescription medicine. I have contended for some time now we cannot \nafford not to cover prescription medicine. These bills I have been \nreading from on the floor of the Senate show seniors can't afford drugs \nthat help to lower cholesterol, help to lower their blood pressure. \nThese are drugs that help older people to stay well.\n  Prescription drug coverage for seniors has been a priority ever since \nmy days with the Gray Panthers before I was elected to Congress. \nFrankly, it is much more important today than ever because these drugs \nthat so many seniors write that they cannot afford today help seniors \nto stay well. The variety of anticoagulant drugs that help to prevent \nstrokes, as I have commented on the floor of the Senate in the past, \nmight cost $1,000 a year for an older person to buy them to stay \nhealthy. Compare that to the costs incurred if a senior suffers a \nstroke. If a senior cannot get an anticoagulant drug to help stay \nhealthy and avoid a stroke, that senior might incur expenses of more \nthan $100,000.\n  The question for the Senate is, Are we going to help frail and \nvulnerable seniors with prescription drug coverage that will cost just \na fraction of the expenses that will be incurred through Medicare Part \nA, the hospital portion, and Medicare Part B, the outpatient portion, \nif the senior cannot get help and ends up getting sick and, very often, \nincurring extraordinary expenses?\n\n  The third letter I read comes from a woman in O'Brien, OR. She has \nspent more than $2,000 through November of 1999 on her prescription \ndrugs, and just in recent days she has taken on a job in hopes she will \nbe able to pay for her prescriptions. She is 78 years old. At present, \nshe has her Social Security and Medicare. She now has taken on a small \njob in hopes she will have the funds to pay for her prescription \nmedicine. She writes that she hopes the Snowe-Wyden legislation becomes \nlaw.\n  Other colleagues have different approaches. We appreciate that. What \nis important is we move forward together. Let's show the authors of all \nthese recent articles in Time magazine, in the New York Times, and \nvarious other publications that are skeptical about whether the \nCongress can tackle a big issue such as this; let's prove them wrong. \nLet's show, in spite of a fairly polarized political climate in America \ntoday, when there is an important program, this Congress can come \ntogether.\n  I will keep coming to the floor and urging seniors to send in copies \nof their prescription drug bills. The poster lays it out: Send their \nbills to their Senator in Washington, DC. The Snowe-Wyden legislation, \nSPICE, for the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, is a \nbill that, on a bipartisan basis, can be supported in the Senate. If \nother colleagues have different ideas, let's get them out on the table. \nLet's come up with a marketplace approach to holding down the costs of \nmedicine.\n  These bills show access to coverage is very key, but holding down the \ncosts of medicine is very key as well. There is a right way and a wrong \nway to hold down those costs. The right way is to use a model such as \nthe health care system for Members of Congress. That is what is behind \nthe Snowe-Wyden legislation that provides choice, competition, and \nmarketplace forces for holding down medicine.\n  There is a wrong way--the various approaches that call for price \ncontrols. The real danger behind price controls is that the costs for \nanybody who is not in the price control group will be shifted on to \nother Americans who are having difficulty paying for medicines as well. \nIt would not be a particularly useful thing for the Senate to come up \nwith a price control regime for folks on Medicare and then have the \ncosts shifted over to a divorced woman who is 27 years old with two \nchildren who is working her head off to try to help her family and help \nthem pay for expenses and then her bills would go up because costs \nwould be shifted to her.\n  I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate and reading \nfrom these bills. Today I have read accounts from Medford, from Grants \nPass, and from O'Brien. Seniors cannot afford today to cover \nprescription drugs.\n  When public opinion polls are taken, coverage of prescription drugs \nfor older people is now one of the top two or three concerns in \nAmerica--not just for seniors but for all Americans; certainly for the \nsandwich generation. Perhaps a young couple in their forties who have \nto try to provide some assistance to a parent who could not afford \nprescription medicine is following this issue. It is not just a \nseniors' issue; it is an issue for families; it is an issue for the \nquality of life of our country.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is a bipartisan bill where more than 50 \nSenators have already indicated they will support the funding mechanism \nin prescription drug coverage as one way to proceed.\n  I am sure our colleagues have other ways to go. But what is important \nis to show the skeptics across this country who are writing in \nmagazines and saying in news reports that nothing can be done that we \ncan come together on a bipartisan basis and provide real relief for the \nNation's older people.\n  I hope seniors will, as this poster indicates, continue to send \ncopies of their prescription drug bills to us in the Senate, each of us \nin Washington, DC, because I intend to keep coming back to this floor \nagain and again until we can secure passage of this legislation.\n  I do not want to see the attention of the Senate diverted to \nquestions of the role of the Internet and patents and the variety of \nmatters because, while they are important, they do not go to the heart \nof what is needed in this country. What is needed in America for the \nmillions of seniors who are spending half of their income on \nprescription drugs--and that is what I have been describing on the \nfloor of the Senate--is insurance coverage. They need coverage which \nwill pick up that part of their insurance bill that goes for \nprescription drugs. That is what the Snowe-Wyden legislation does on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  We are going to keep coming back to the floor of this body to talk \nabout the need for prescription drug coverage for the elderly. There \nare bipartisan proposals to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I read an editorial this morning in the \nWall Street Journal that made incorrect\n\n[[Page S14767]]\n\nstatements about both the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, \nand the Northeast Dairy Compact. In fact, the editorial was totally, \nfactually wrong. If the editorial writers would have checked their \nfacts, they would have known that.\n  Basically, the writers used arguments of opponents of the Northeast \nDairy Compact, and they used those arguments without any determination \nof whether they are accurate or not. This time they used the arguments \nto go after the distinguished majority leader and others who supported \nthe compact. They have used the so-called facts other times, but, \nagain, they have always used them in the same wrong arguments.\n  I have referred many times to the major GAO study that was issued on \nmilk prices. I have referred to the detailed OMB study on the compact. \nOpponents never offer any proof for their arguments. I am fed up with \nthe Compact being criticized as a back room deal because I remind \neverybody that we actually had a vote on it, albeit in the form of a \ncloture motion, but we had a vote on it on the floor of the Senate and \na majority of Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, voted for it. \nThe majority voted for it this year. Now those who oppose it are using \nfilibusters and parliamentary dodges because they know that they lost \nthe vote.\n  I am fed up with opponents attacking the compact as a special \ninterest cartel, a compact which is made up of family farms, \nconsidering the largest opponent of the compact is Philip Morris, the \ntobacco giant which owns Kraft. The supporters are family farmers; the \nopponent, Philip Morris. It does not sound as if the supporters are \nreally a cartel.\n  I am fed up when opponents of the compact say milk prices are higher \nin New England when typically milk prices are higher in Wisconsin and \nMinnesota than they are in New England. The places that do not have the \ncompact and who are attacking it the most charge their consumers more \nfor milk on average than the area that does have the compact.\n  GAO did a study of this and they looked at milk prices during the \nfirst six months after the Compact was implemented. GAO found that \nconsumers in New England were able to buy milk considerably cheaper \nthan in Wisconsin or Minnesota. The editorial writers and opponents of \nthe compact do not point this out. Why do they not point this out? \nBecause it points to the success of the compact and does not support \nthe arguments made by the cartels that are opposed to it.\n  Let me read some examples from the GAO report. For example: In \nFebruary, 1998 the average price of a gallon of whole milk in Augusta, \nME, was $2.47. The price in Milwaukee, WI, was $2.63, and in \nMinneapolis, MN., it was $2.94 per gallon.\n  Take another New England city, Boston. In February 1998, the price of \na gallon of milk was $2.54 as compared to Minneapolis, where the price, \non average, was $2.94 a gallon.\n  Or let's look at the cost of 1 percent milk for November 1997. In \nAugusta, ME, it was $2.37 per gallon, the same average price for Boston \nand New Hampshire and Rhode Island. But in Minnesota, the price was \n$2.82 a gallon, in other words, 45 cents more per gallon in the area \nthat opposes the compact as compared to the much lower price in the \narea that has the compact.\n  I could go on and on and compare low New England retail prices with \nhigher prices in cities outside of New England. I invite anybody to \nreview this GAO report.\n  There is another report on the compact that was done by OMB. They \nissued a report which found the retail milk prices in New England, \nafter the Compact was in place, were, on average, lower than for the \nrest of the Nation.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial page writers have ignored both the \nGAO report and the OMB report. Why? These are factual and objective \nreports that the Journal should have reviewed.\n\n  It is clear that our compact is working perfectly by benefiting \nconsumers, local economies, and farmers, something that is not stated \nin the editorial that attacked Senator Lott.\n  I am especially fed up when opponents say the compact blocks \ninterstate trade in milk when OMB reports the compact has increased the \nsales of milk into New England as neighboring farmers in New York, who \ndid not have the Compact, take advantage of it. OMB reported that while \nthe Compact was in force for the first six months, there was an 8 \npercent increase in milk sales into the region. Instead of blocking \ninterstate commerce, I would say an 8-percent increase in interstate \ncommerce is an 8-percent increase in interstate commerce.\n  I am fed up when opponents say the compact does not help dairy \nfarmers stay in business, when it greatly increases their income. My \nbest guess is dairy farmers, just as wheat, corn, or soybean farmers, \nwhen their income increases, they are more likely to stay in business. \nI recognize the Nation's major opponent of the compact, Kraft, owned by \nPhilip Morris, does not want farmers to have the additional income the \ncompact provides. But opponents of the compact should not argue it does \nnot give farmers more income when, in fact, it does.\n  Opponents of the compact say farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota are \ngoing out of business, even though this is comparing apples with \noranges. Even though the compact doesn't have an effect on them, they \nsay we should not have a compact in the Northeast. Let farmers in the \nMidwest set up their own compact. I would vote for a compact for them \nor any other reasonable proposal that helps their farmers. Do not \ncondemn one section of the country that is doing fine and protecting \ntheir farmers when, if they wanted to, they could do exactly the same \nthing in their own part of the country.\n  I wish to mention for a minute what the compact replaces. Opponents \nof the compact prefer prices to be set by Federal bureaucrats. \nSupporters of the compact prefer pricing to be determined by consumers \nand local representatives, not by the Federal Government. The Governors \nand legislators in the six New England States had five goals in mind \nwhen they enacted the compact into law in each of their States. They \nwanted to assure fresh local supplies of milk to consumers at lower \nprices than found in most of the Nation. They wanted to keep dairy \nfarmers in business. They wanted to protect New England's rural \nenvironment from sprawl and destructive development, and they wanted to \ndo this without burdening Federal taxpayers.\n\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has delivered beyond the \nexpectations of those Governors and State legislatures. The compact \nprovided an added benefit. It has increased interstate trade into the \nregion as neighboring farmers have taken advantage of the compact.\n  This great idea, coming from those six New England States, has \ncreated a successful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and \nconsumers throughout New England.\n  Thanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of \nbusiness has declined throughout New England for the first time in many \nyears.\n  It is unfortunate that some still favor Federal bureaucrats running \nthis farm program. We ought to instead be blessing this compact. Here \nis something not run by the Federal Government, not costing the \ntaxpayers anything, but being done by the people who are affected by \nit. Indeed, half the Governors of the Nation, half the State \nlegislatures in the Nation, asked that the Congress allow their States \nto set their own dairy policy through interstate compacts that cost \ntaxpayers nothing. It costs taxpayers nothing. Let me say it again: It \ncosts taxpayers nothing. Why do people oppose a program that is not \ncosting taxpayers anything and affects just the people in the region \nwho want it?\n  This dairy compact passed with overwhelming support in almost all \nthese States--Republicans and Democrats in the legislatures; Republican \nand Democratic Governors. Major environmental groups have endorsed the \nNortheast Dairy Compact. A New York Times and National Geographic \narticle discussed the importance of keeping dairy farmers in business \nfrom an environmental standpoint.\n  Consumer prices are lower, farm income is higher, and no increased \ncosts to taxpayers. One wonders, why does anybody oppose it?\n  One asks, why is it opposed? The answer is simple: Huge milk \nmanufacturers, such as Suiza, headquartered in\n\n[[Page S14768]]\n\nTexas, Kraft, which is owned by the tobacco giant Philip Morris, and \nother processors represented by the International Dairy Foods \nAssociation oppose the compact because they want to keep the money \nthemselves. They do not want the farmers to have any of these profits.\n  Even the most junior investigative reporter could figure out the \nanswer. All anyone has to do is look up the donations made by these and \nother giant processors. All the negative news stories about the compact \nhave their genesis in the efforts of these giant processors and their \nfront organizations.\n  I say this again on the floor, just so people understand, because it \nwas an unfair editorial in singling out the distinguished majority \nleader of the Senate using facts which bear scrutiny. Indeed, one of \nthe corporation front organizations, Public Voice for Food and Health \nPolicy, apparently could not continue to exist when it was obvious that \ntheir policies were determined by corporate dollars rather than good \npolicy. They had to close up shop when they lost their conscience.\n  I have detailed the close alliances between their lead executive who \nhandled compact issues for them and the job he negotiated to represent \nthe huge processors a couple of times on the Senate floor.\n  I will give the press another lead on the next public interest group \nwhose funding should be investigated--the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica. Indeed, one of their officers--formerly from Public Voice--is \nbeing taken around Capitol Hill offices by lobbyists representing \nprocessors. A glance at who funds their functions and efforts will be \nas instruction as investigations of Public Voice.\n  Why should Philip Morris or Kraft want to use these organizations \ninstead of directly going to the editorial boards of the New York Times \nor the Washington Post to badmouth the compact? The question does not \nneed me to provide the answer.\n  What would be the best attack--whether true or not--on the Compact \nthat might swing public opinion?\n  It might be to simply allege that milk prices are higher for children \nin the school lunch program. Who would the editorial boards more likely \nlisten to regarding school children: a public interest group or a \ntobacco company?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks the 1-year anniversary of the \nInternet tax moratorium and the setting up of a commission to look into \nthe manner in which we tax the Internet. This moratorium was to last \nfor 3 years, and the commission was to meet and begin the process of \ntrying to determine how best to deal with the variety of proposals to \nplace taxes on the use of the Internet, products which are sold over \nthe Internet, and services which are supplied over the Internet.\n  Obviously, the Internet represents a watershed mark possibly in \nhistory as to economic activity. It is a period in which we have seen \nthe Internet become an economic engine of immense proportions for our \nNation and for the world. The Wall Street Journal reported on October \n18 that electronic commerce not only positively affects economic \nactivity but has had a very positive impact on reducing the rate of \ninflation.\n  Products sold over the Internet are actually forcing down prices as \ncompetition occurs and products, such as prescription drugs, have been \nfound on the Internet to be 28-percent cheaper and apparel 38-percent \ncheaper. The overall index found that products generally were about 13-\npercent cheaper on the Internet. The Internet has not only been a \nwonderful economic engine; it also has been a force for maintaining and \ncontrolling inflation during this period of dramatic prosperity.\n  Of course, the Internet is growing at an incredible rate. Over the \nlast 12 months, Internet economic growth has been about 68 percent, \nwhich is a huge rate of growth compared to a national economic rate of \ngrowth which is somewhere in the 3- to 4-percent range, if we are \nlucky. The role of the Internet in our society is immense today and is \ngetting even more significant.\n\n  The question is, How do we deal with it in the context of taxes? \nThere is a large number of communities and a number of States in this \ncountry that wish to assess on Internet transactions their local sales \ntax activity, much the same as they attempt to assess catalog sales. \nThere are something like 30,000 jurisdictions which could assess taxes \non the Internet.\n  The effect, of course, of having this diffuse and extraordinarily \nlarge group of taxing authorities--50 States and 30,000 \nsubjurisdictions of those States--with a potential of taxing the \nInternet at various rates could, quite simply, grind to a halt this \nwonderful engine of economic activity and prosperity into which our \nNation has gone.\n  Literally, if we allow the Internet to be subject to this variety of \ntaxes and this variety of tax authorities, and the imagination and \ncreativity we always see from various Government entities when it comes \nto taxing, literally we could end up stopping the Internet as an \neffective force for economic expansion and prosperity.\n  Furthermore, the concept of taxing the Internet, which is clearly a \nnational and really a global instrument of commerce, appears, to me at \nleast, to fly in the face of our Constitution. The commerce clause of \nour Constitution is pretty specific. Section 8, clause 3, of the \nConstitution reads:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with \n     the Indian Tribes.\n\n  There can be nothing that is a form of commerce more among the \nseveral States than the Internet as it presently is expanding, growing, \nand becoming a force for economic activity.\n  Thus, the taxing of the Internet by all these different entities \nwould clearly, in my opinion, raise serious constitutional problems. In \nfact, the Supreme Court addressed this issue when it came to catalog \nsales in the Quill case, where the Supreme Court essentially ruled that \nStates, unless they have a nexus relationship with the seller of the \nassets, do not have traditionally the ability to tax that transaction.\n  Secondly, Congress needs to look at the issue of taxation because of \nthe extraordinary, as I have mentioned, chilling effect it would have \non commerce generally. We, as a nation, as the creators and inventors \nof the Internet and, therefore, controllers not only of the initial and \nexpanding technology, but also of the language which dominates the \nInternet, have put ourselves essentially as a nation on a rocket sled \nof economic activity. We have expanded and accelerated at an \nextraordinary speed past the rest of the world towards economic \nprosperity.\n  I recall, rather vividly, in the late 1980s when the ``woe is me'' \ncrowd was saying that Japan was going to overtake the United States in \nall functions of economic activity, and that our economic model for \nprosperity simply could not compete with the Japanese economic model of \nprosperity, which was intimidating and which remains significant.\n  But the fact is that it did not work out that way. It did not work \nout that way because America's strength is our entrepreneurship and our \ninventiveness. We took that entrepreneurship and inventiveness and we \ncreated this massive new vehicle for economic activity called the \nInternet. Thus, instead of being overwhelmed by our friends and \nneighbors and allies in the industrial world, we have, instead, \nexploded past them in the ability to produce prosperity and economic \nactivity, in large part because of the Internet and the offspring of \ntechnology which it has created.\n  So we do not want to do anything which jeopardizes the unique and \nspecial international lead that we have in this area. Yet allowing \nthousands of different jurisdictions to tax the Internet would do \nexactly that. It would jeopardize that lead and undermine and, as I \nsaid, possibly bring to a complete halt the use of the Internet as an \nelement of commerce.\n  The third thing we must be sensitive to in this area of the Internet \nis the international implications beyond the questions of trade. It has \nbeen suggested by people at the U.N. that the U.N. should start to fund \nitself by putting in place a tax on e-commerce and e-mail. At first it \nwas an outrageous suggestion, but it is the type of suggestion you get \nat the U.N. from people\n\n[[Page S14769]]\n\nwho represent nations which maybe do not have as much of a financial \ninterest in it as we do and know that we would end up paying the tax, \nour Nation would end up paying the burden. But the fact that has been \nsuggested is just a sort of crack of the door behind which, if it were \nfully opened, you would see an international initiative of significant \nproportions to place taxes on the Internet.\n  As a result, if we have essentially come to the table, having already \nsoiled our hands with taxing the Internet, it will be very \nextraordinarily difficult for us to resist, whether it is the U.N. or \nwhether it is some other nation that also tries to pursue this course \nof action. It is essential, for the purposes of seeing an expansion of \nthis technology and this form of economic activity, that we dampen down \nand restrict and as aggressively as we can resist having other nations \npursue the path of taxation of Internet transactions.\n  Obviously, the U.N. has no right to step into this ground. In fact, \nas chairman of the appropriating committee that has jurisdiction over \nthe U.N., I put specific language into an appropriations bill, which \nhopefully will pass today, that says the United States will not spend \nany money at the U.N. should the U.N. pursue this course of action, \nwhich I am sure they will not. This was some idea put forward by \nsomebody there, but I do not think it speaks to the majority at the \nUnited Nations.\n  But those are three core reasons why we have to be extraordinarily \nsensitive to what the tax policy is relative to the Internet.\n  The reason I raise this is because it took 8 months for the Internet \ncommission to get started. That was not their fault. Really, it was the \nfault of those bodies which had the obligation of appointing membership \nto the commission. Actually, under Governor Gilmore, this commission \nhas done an excellent job of meeting. Governor Gilmore's position \nrelative to taxation over the Internet is exactly the position that \nshould be pursued. However, I am not sure he has a majority position \nwithin the commission. I hope he does.\n  But in order for us to assure this threat to our commerce does not \noccur, I believe we should extend this moratorium. Since we had at \nleast 8 months of delay before we got this commission up and running, I \nthink we should have an extension which recognizes that the commission \nshould have the full 3-year period; therefore, we should extend the \nmoratorium for another year, at a minimum, on the Internet.\n  I happen to think it should be extended beyond that, well beyond \nthat, because I believe certainty in the area of taxation is one of the \nkey issues for maintaining economic activity. If people participating \nin an economic activity can predict what their tax obligations are and \nwhat the tax implications will be to an economic initiative, then they \nare much more likely to be willing to invest capital and take the risks \nnecessary to pursue that initiative. But if they cannot predict their \ntax liability, then that limits and dampens down the desire to put \ncapital and take risks in a certain economic activity. We have seen \nthat historically.\n  So I do believe very strongly that we should not only be extending \nthis moratorium for a year but that we should be extending it for a \nseries of years beyond the 3-year moratorium that presently exists.\n  Let's face it. The economic benefit which this Nation has seen as a \nresult of this truly revolutionary event--in the history of economics, \nI suspect this is going to go down with the industrial revolution as \none of the most significant turning points in the history of prosperity \nand the way nations generate wealth.\n\n  The benefits which we, as a nation, have obtained as a result of \nthis, as a result of being the incubator, the developer, and now the \nprovider in expertise in the area of the Internet, and the use of the \nInternet for commerce, the benefits which we have received, as a \nnation, are basically incalculable: the amount of new jobs which have \nbeen created; the number of people whose standard of living has been \nincreased; the number of people who have been able to purchase goods at \nless of a price; and the number of people who have simply had a better \nchance to participate in prosperity.\n  The Nation as a whole has seen economic activity and economic \nprosperity that has been a blessing to everyone, in large part because \nof this huge expansion in e-commerce and in the Internet as a force. \nThose benefits dramatically exceed any benefit which we would obtain by \nallowing a large number of different States or municipalities to start \ntaxing the Internet for the purposes of expanding their local \ngovernments.\n  It is the classic situation of the goose that lays the golden egg, to \nsay the least. We have confronted a goose that is laying a lot of \ngolden eggs for America, and for the prosperity of America, and for the \nopportunity of America to create jobs. For America to maintain its \nplace as a world leader, we should not make the mistake of maybe not \ncutting off the goose's head but nicking that goose with thousands of \ndifferent taxes which may cause it to, unfortunately, stumble or even \nbe stopped as a result of allowing the creativity and the imagination \nof our various government units across this Nation to begin to tax the \nInternet.\n  So I hope as we wrap up this session we will consider this. \nObviously, we probably are not going to get it in this major omnibus \nbill, although I tried to do that and it was rejected in committee--an \nextension of the Internet moratorium.\n  I do hope when we come back next year this will be a priority item--\nto make it clear, to make an unalterable statement to the community \nwhich is developing and promoting this incredible engine of prosperity \nthat we are not going to stop them by turning loose the forces of \ngovernment and taxation on them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take a moment to react to an \neditorial which I read this morning in the Wall Street Journal which \nhad so many errors and erroneous comments that it shocked me to find \nout that such a fine newspaper as the Wall Street Journal would carry \nthis.\n  I have been in Congress now 24 years, and as a result of unusual \ncircumstances, for many years I had been sort of the leader of dairy \nfor the Republicans in the House. That occurred because I was elected \nduring the Watergate year. During the Watergate year, there were 92 \nfreshmen Representatives who were elected and only 16 were Republicans. \nSo all of us who came in that year immediately got seniority because \nthere were not any other Members around.\n  I got to be the ranking member on the dairy subcommittee my first \nyear. During that time, some 24 years, one thing I could be assured of \nwas that any time something was going to come to the benefit of the \ndairy farmers, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the \nWashington Post would all write adverse editorials. Why is that? Well, \ndo the dairy farmers buy any advertising in these newspapers? Of \ncourse, they don't. Who does buy the advertising? It is those who \npurchase milk. What is their motivation? To keep the dairy farmers \ngetting the least money possible so they can maximize their profits. \nAnd they have done a masterful job.\n  But they also have a propensity, either because they, without any \nchecking, believe everything told to them by the processors who pay for \ntheir ads or they just ignore the truth. The Wall Street Journal \narticle of this morning was a very typical example. I will run through \nsome of the facts that were utilized in this great paper to point out \nthe errors.\n  First of all, they make statements which are just not true. They say \nwe have to have a compact because our\n\n[[Page S14770]]\n\nfarmers are less efficient than the Midwestern farmers. Well, that is \nabsolutely not true. Both are very efficient. The differences in the \ntwo areas are dramatic, but they are not relative to efficiency. \nObviously, the Midwest farmers have an advantage because they are \ncloser to the grain markets. They have more people producing cheese, \nand they have soils that are preferable to many of the other areas of \nthe country, especially New England. So they have an advantage, not a \ndisadvantage, by being not only efficient--and I don't think our \nfarmers are any more efficient than theirs --but having lower costs to \nstart with. So to make the statement that it is all based upon \ninefficiency is absolutely ridiculous.\n  Then this statement: Never mind that this milk costs consumers to the \ntune of about 20 extra cents a gallon. This is absolutely false. In \nfact, one of the ironic aspects of this whole argument occurred back \nwhen the compact first went into effect and the Midwestern farm \nrepresentatives said: We will show them. We will show that this is all \ndue to efficiency and all those kinds of things. So they asked OMB, not \nGAO or whoever else. Why? Because OMB was sympathetic to the \nadministration at that time and they wanted help from the White House \nto try to back up their arguments.\n  Well, what happened? OMB did an analysis of the impact of the compact \nand found out just the opposite. Do we hear them quote that anymore? \nNo. I have to bring it up every time. They still--either their friends \nin the newspapers that make the money off advertising or sometimes they \ndo it themselves--ignore the fact that the study they asked for came \nback saying that, contrary to what they were telling people, actually \nthe consumers in New England, where the compact was in effect, paid 5 \ncents less a gallon--not 20 cents more a gallon, 5 cents less a \ngallon--than the average in the rest of the country. But they still \nprint something which they know is absolutely incorrect.\n  Also, for a conservative newspaper such as the Wall Street Journal--I \nwouldn't give that same label to the New York Times and the Washington \nPost--the Wall Street Journal should recognize that all of these \nStates, all six States, are taking advantage of the Constitution which \nsays that States can, if they want to, ask Congress for permission to \ncreate a commission to allow them to join together to sort of control \nor impact interstate commerce.\n  Well, the States have the right to do that and the States did do it. \nThe New England States got together and said: Well, let us take a look \nand see what we can do to have a more organized pricing system. One has \nto understand a little bit about how the farming goes. If you are a \ndairy farmer, you have milk and you have to get rid of it. It is going \nto last about 3 days before you will have to throw it out. So you are \nat the mercy of the market. You can form cooperatives and things such \nas that, but no matter what you do, the milk has to go somewhere or it \nis going to spoil.\n  The thought was, instead of leaving ourselves at the mercy --and this \nis the basic part of the situation--of the processors, the people who \nbuy the milk, who can sit there 2\\1/2\\ days and say: Well, it is going \nto be worthless tomorrow; I will give you 5 cents a gallon--well, it \nnever gets quite that bad, but that is the kind of power they have. \nThey don't want to lose that power. They want to be able to dictate to \nthe dairy farmers the price they are going to get. The New England \nfarmers got together and worked with their various legislators and \ndecided, why don't we set up a commission that would have consumers \nrepresented, processors represented, farmers represented, and the \ngeneral interest of the public represented. We will set what the price \nwill be, keeping in mind that we don't want to end up with a huge \nsurplus. We want to make it fair but make sure the consumers don't lose \non this--in fact, maybe even gain--and the dairy farmers will gain \nbecause they will have a stable market situation.\n  It worked so well that, as I said, the price to consumers actually \nwent down. I could speak at length on that, but it went down. The \nfarmers got a significantly better price overall. They were happy. The \nprocessors got a fair price, and they haven't screamed, those that are \nparticipating in it. It is a good system. That is the problem with it. \nIt is a good system.\n  Why does that scare the processors? They would rather get the lowest \nprice possible to pay to the farmers and so they have lost that \ncontrol. But to the Midwest, it shakes them up because what was their \ndream? Their dream was that all of the dairy farmers in the United \nStates would go out of business except in the Midwest. And they are so \nsure they could provide all the milk the country needs, so why do we \nnot put them out?\n  Well, the commission worked. The price to consumers has gone down, \nthe farmers are getting a fair price, and the processors are not being \ninjured in any way. That is why 25 States, now a total of 25, including \nNew England, have said that is a great idea. Everybody is happy. What a \nwonderful situation.\n  The processor is happy, consumers are paying less in price, and \neverybody is happy. So why don't we join? Well, that, of course, has \nnow made it a big threat to the Midwest. Because if the whole country \ngoes to compacts, the farmers will stay in business, and the market \nexpansion that the Midwest was hoping for won't occur.\n  That is why we are here today. The States have recognized that it is \nessential to make sure their farmers survive. Why is that? The basic \nconcept of the law right now, from the 1930s and rewritten in the Farm \nAct of 1947, said it is critical that we ensure that every area of this \nNation has an adequate supply of fresh milk. That is basic law; that \nis, to make sure that when you go to your store, there is always some \nfresh milk for you there. That is the basic law. All these States that \nare going into compacts are saying: We want to make sure that our area \nof the country has an adequate supply of fresh milk, and we ought to be \nable to do that. So that is what the real fight is about.\n  We have already had the editorial I anticipated in the Post. The Wall \nStreet Journal came through right on time with one I anticipated. \nTheirs is so incredibly inaccurate in what they cite, it was a little \nembarrassing, on behalf of the paper, to read that. I expect the New \nYork Times will follow suit probably in the next couple of days.\n  I want to make sure these facts are out there. What this Nation needs \nis stable farming. We all love our farmers. I can't think of Vermont or \nNew England without the cows on the hillside. I can't think of what the \nSoutheast would be without the ability of their farmers to produce \nmilk. And they have, because of the weather situation and all, special \nproblems in the Southeast, being able to produce milk at reasonable \nprices. But they are doing very well. They want to form a compact. The \nsame is true in other parts of the country. What is wrong with people \nin the region getting together and deciding how to do it?\n\n  Another argument raised, which will be one for other editorials, is \nthat it causes higher prices for WIC--Women, Infants and Children--and \nfood. That is all taken care of by the commission. Farmers in the \nMidwest, right now, on an average, receive significantly more in the \nchecks they get on a weekly or monthly basis--what they call the \n``mailbox price.'' They do better than the rest of the country. So they \nare not the ones suffering. They have advantages, as I pointed out, in \ncost of production and those things. They are doing well. They just \nwant to be sure they can perhaps have a better future by shipping more \nmilk.\n  Incidentally--and I will leave you with this because the statements \nare that this is somehow infringing on commerce and the ability of \npeople to sell--they can bring their milk down now and sell it in the \nNew England area. Why don't they? It costs too much to ship it down \nthere. But the market is open; it is not closed out. There are no \nbarriers built up to where the farmers can ship milk. In fact, the New \nEngland compact is in place right now, but a great deal of the milk \ncomes from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and wherever else anyone \nwants to ship it.\n  The New England area itself is a negative producer. So we depend upon \nmilk coming from other areas. When you come in, you know you are going\n\n[[Page S14771]]\n\nto be bound by the price that is established by the commission. That, \nagain, represents consumers, producers, the dairy farmers, the \nprocessors, the people who buy it, and it protects programs such as \nWIC. It is working so well. That is the problem.\n  Just remember, the reason for all the controversy right now is that \nthis program is working so well for consumers, processors, and the \nproducers, and it is a danger to those who want to do away with our \nlocal farming businesses.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Member present, so I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business for not to exceed 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the reauthorization \nof the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am pleased that it appears Congress \nwill accomplish this vital task before we adjourn for the year.\n  The reauthorization of the Compact is more critical now than ever \nbefore. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently predicted that milk \nprices for dairy farmers will be reduced 40 cents per gallon in \nDecember as a result of the announced drop in the basic formula price \nthis past week. This translates into a 30 percent reduction in blend \nprices in December and will continue on into next year with additional \ndeclines in prices expected throughout the winter. The Dairy Compact \nwill blunt the 40 cent per gallon drop in farm milk prices by one-half \nand will, by itself, make the difference between continuing in business \nand closing down for many small dairy farmers.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact is a proven success and is critical to \nthe survival of dairy farmers in Maine and throughout New England. The \nCompact has a proven track record of quantifiable benefits to both \nconsumers and farmers. The Compact works by simply evening out the \npeaks and valleys in fluid milk prices, providing stability to the cost \nof milk and ensuring a supply of fresh, wholesome, local milk. The \nCompact works with market forces to help both the farmer and the \nconsumer. As prices climb and farmers receive a sustainable price for \nmilk, the Compact turns off. When prices drop to unsustainable levels, \nthe Compact is triggered. The Compact simply softens the blow to \nfarmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile fluid milk \nmarket.\n  It is important to reiterate that consumers also benefit from the \nCompact. Not only does the Compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding \ndramatic fluctuation in retail cost of milk, it also guarantees that \nthe consumer is assured of the availability of a supply of fresh, local \nmilk. Let's remember that under the Compact, New England has lower \nretail fluid milk prices than many regions operating without a Compact.\n  Moreover, the Compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy \nproducers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven it does not harm \nfarmers or taxpayers from outside the region. A 1998 report by the \nOffice of Management and Budget showed that, during its first 6 months \nof operation, the Compact did not adversely affect farmers from outside \nthe Compact region and added no federal costs to nutrition programs. In \nfact, the Compact specifically excepts the Women, Infants, and Children \n(WIC) program from any costs related to the Compact.\n  The reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact is also important \nas a matter of states rights. We often hear of criticism of the inside-\nthe-beltway mentality that tells states, we here in Washington know \nbetter than you, even on issues traditionally under state and local \ncontrol. Mr. President, that is wrong. In the Northeast Dairy Compact, \nwe have a solution that was approved by all the legislatures and \ngovernors of the New England States. It is supported by every state \ncommissioner in the region and overwhelmingly--if not unanimously--by \nNortheastern dairy farmers. We in Congress should not be an obstacle to \nthis practical, workable, local solution.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to refrain from holding up this critical measure \nfor Maine and for our Nation's dairy farmers. To small farms in my \nState and in states throughout New England, this is not just a matter \nof profit margins; it is a matter of their survival.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is November 18. It has been \nalmost 6 months since the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill and \nmore than 5 months since the House followed suit with its own \nlegislation.\n  Since that time, the students at Columbine High School went home. \nThey spent a summer trying to heal the wounds of one of our Nation's \ngreatest tragedies, and they returned to school more than 2 months ago.\n  Many of those students touched by the tragedy even came to Washington \nto plead for our help. Yet this body has done nothing to stop future \nincidents of gun violence and nothing to fix our broken juvenile \njustice system.\n  The Columbine incident shocked this Nation and, I believe, this \nCongress. Watching events unfold on television made even the most \nskeptical observers realize that something should be done about gun \nviolence. We have witnessed a number of other instances of gun violence \nin the media since then. In Atlanta, we saw a depressed day trader gun \ndown his family and colleagues. In California, a bigot killed a postal \nworker just because he was Filipino, and then wounded five others in \nthe North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills. Again, the \npictures of those young children being led away from the scene of the \ntragedy were heart wrenching.\n  But since Columbine, more than 2,000 more children have died from \ngunshot wounds, about 12 to 13 a day, in incidents of gun violence that \ngo relatively unreported and with outcomes not so public. These \nincidents will never stop until we do something to stop them. The death \nrate will never be diminished unless we stand up and take action.\n  When will the Congress realize that the time has come to move \nforward? The conference committee, which was appointed at the last \nminute before the August recess, has met but once, over 3 months ago. \nNo issues have been resolved. The entire juvenile justice bill remains \nin doubt, in limbo.\n  Democrats in both Houses have been ready and willing to meet for \nmonths. Democrats are ready to discuss the merits of our differences \nand to reconcile them. The time has come to stop running away from the \nissue of gun violence. The time has come to enact some meaningful \nprovisions to stem this tide of violence sweeping our schools and to \ninstitute some much-needed change to the system of juvenile justice in \nthis Nation.\n  The Senate spent more than a week in May debating and voting on \ndozens of provisions to stem the tide of youth violence in this country \nand to try to curb the flood of guns reaching children and criminals. \nBut still we have faced delay after delay, and the delays come in many \nforms--political maneuvering, parliamentary tactics; for example, my \nclip ban was blue slipped, and other tactics.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to come together to make some tough \ndecisions and move forward with the Nation's business. No longer can we \nstand by, and I hope the Nation will not let us stand by, to allow the \nNational Rifle Association to dictate the legislative needs of this \nCongress. The future of this bill rests squarely with the Republican \nleadership in both the House and\n\n[[Page S14772]]\n\nthe Senate. They have said they want to make progress with our gun \nlaws, and they have it within their power to do so.\n  The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill is not an overreaching \nstatement of where we want to go with gun control. I, for example, \nbelieve we should have universal registration and licensing of \nfirearms, and in the next session I will introduce my legislation. I \nbelieve we should allow the Federal Government to set safety and \nconsumer standards for guns, and I believe we should ban outright \npossession of military-style assault weapons. But none of these \nmeasures were even discussed in the Senate debate.\n  The provisions, rather, are very small in our bill. They are \nreasonable, and they can make a difference in the lives of our \nchildren. None of them are controversial, and every one of them, by \nvirtually every poll, has a dominant majority of the American people \nsupporting them. Let me describe what I am talking about.\n  That bill contains just four commonsense provisions to address gun \nviolence. Does anyone in this Nation truly believe juveniles should be \nable to buy assault weapons? The answer is going to be no. That is one \nprovision in Senator Ashcroft's bill which would prohibit juveniles \nfrom possessing assault weapons.\n  Does anyone in this country truly believe the children from Columbine \nwho went to a gun show and bought two assault weapons as juveniles with \nno information, no data check, no nothing--does anyone believe that \nloophole should not be closed? I do not believe so.\n  In Memphis, TN, not too long ago, a 5-year-old took a pistol off his \ngrandfather's bureau and brought it to kindergarten to kill the teacher \nbecause the teacher had given that child a timeout the day before. \nStories are legion about children mistaking real guns for play guns and \nshooting their friends.\n  The third provision is simple. It would require a safety lock with \nevery gun sold. Does anyone believe guns should not be sold without \nsafety locks? I do not believe so.\n\n  Finally, there is my provision which would plug a major loophole in \nthe 1994 assault weapons legislation. That legislation, in fact, says \nyou cannot today manufacture, transfer, sell, or possess a clip, drum, \nor strip of more than 10 bullets manufactured in the United States. \nThat is the law today. The loophole is to permit the foreign \nimportation of these clips, and they are coming into this country by \nthe tens of millions with literally tens of thousands of them in drums \nof 250 rounds. They come in, as a matter of fact, from the United \nKingdom, and they come in from 20 different countries throughout the \nworld.\n  My provision would simply close that loophole and prohibit the \nimportation. It actually passed the House by unanimous consent, and \nboth the Speaker and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee have \nassured me personally that they see no problem with it and would \nsupport it.\n  These are the four provisions relating to guns. Other than that, this \nbill contains countless provisions to stem the tide of youth violence. \nI sit on the Judiciary Committee. I have worked on this bill. I have \nworked on it with Senator Hatch. Part of this bill is a gang abatement \nact. It provides a Federal helping hand to local law enforcement \nagencies to fight criminal street gangs that are now crossing State \nlines and moving into so many of the cities of our Nation. You, Mr. \nPresident, were mayor of a great city. You know this to be the fact. \nThis is an important part of this legislation.\n  It also contains the James Guelff Body Armor Act which contains \nreforms to take body armor out of the hands of criminals and put it in \nthe hands of police. It is named after a San Francisco police officer \nby the name of James Guelff who went to a call at the corner of Pine \nand California Streets and came across a Kevlar-clad sniper with \nthousands of rounds of ammunition and a number of guns. He had a .38 \nrevolver. As he speed loaded his revolver, this officer was shot in the \nhead and killed. It took 150 police officers to equal the firepower of \none sniper clad in Kevlar with high-powered weapons.\n  The Senate bill also establishes a new $700 million juvenile justice \nblock grant program for States and localities, representing a \nsignificant increase in Federal aid to the States for juvenile crime \ncontrol programs. These programs include additional law enforcement and \njuvenile court personnel, juvenile detention facilities, and prevention \nprograms to keep juveniles out of trouble before they turn to crime, \nsomething both of us know, as past mayors, is vital if we are going to \nreverse juvenile crime in this country.\n  The bill encourages increased accountability for juveniles, and it \nimplements a series of graduated penalties that ensure that subsequent \noffenses are treated with increasing severity, so that if you are going \nto be a continuing offender, the sentences are going to reflect that.\n\n  The bill also reforms juvenile record systems through improved record \nkeeping and increased access to juvenile records by police, courts, and \nschools, so that a court or school dealing with a juvenile in my State, \nCalifornia, can know if they have committed violent offenses in \nArizona, or a juvenile in your State, Ohio, had committed violent \noffenses in another surrounding State.\n  It extends Federal sentences for juveniles who commit serious violent \ncrimes.\n  All of these commonsense provisions now remain in legislative \npurgatory. I am here to urge, once again, the majority to proceed with \nthe conference, come to a compromise, and move this bill. That \ncompromise should preserve intact the Senate-passed gun control \nlegislation--four targeted measures--commonsense, reasonable; I call \nthem no-brainers. Every poll shows a dominant majority of Americans \nsupporting each of these. And they represent together a bare minimum of \nwhat we should do this year to stem the gun violence that is \nincreasingly common on our streets and in our schools.\n  School has now been back in session for several months, and this \nCongress is about to adjourn for the year. So far, it looks as if we \nare going to be receiving a failing grade from the American people. \nThere is still time to buckle down, to do the work, to pass the test \nthat this Nation gave us so many months ago. What a wonderful Christmas \ngift it would be for the people of America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, would \nthe Senator mind stating how long he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would be very happy to tell the Senator. Less than 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection. I thank the Chair and thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Madam President, I would like to make a few remarks about \na serious problem for people in our country who do not live in our \nNation's cities; that is, the loss of satellite TV access to network \nprogramming.\n  We all know that modern technology has made it possible to broadcast \nTV programming directly from satellites. Nationwide, over 11 million \nhouseholds subscribe to satellite TV. That number increases by over 2 \nmillion households every year.\n  Rural areas have come to depend on network coverage that satellites \nprovide.\n  In my State, Montana, where over 35 percent of homes depend solely on \nsatellite broadcasting for their TV reception, obviously this \ndevelopment has been a real boon.\n  While satellite broadcasting has improved the quality of life for \nfolks in rural America, it has not been perfect. Satellite systems have \nnot been able to carry local broadcast stations. So local viewers have \nnot always been able to get local broadcasting.\n  This is not just a problem for satellite subscribers; it is a problem \nfor local television broadcasters and for the fabric of local \ncommunities. Local\n\n[[Page S14773]]\n\nbroadcasters play a key role in our communities. They provide local \nnews, local weather, and public service programming.\n  Viewers depend on these local broadcasts to find out what is going on \nin their community: When the school board, the PTA, and the city \ncouncil are meeting, or when there is a parade or a fundraiser for \ntheir church or a civic group.\n  Local broadcasters are vital to our communities. They provide jobs, \nand they allow local businesses to grow through advertising. In short, \nthe importance of local broadcasting is evident in all parts of \ncommunity life.\n  Local broadcasters also provide network programming: NBC, ABC, CBS, \nand FOX. Nineteen of the 20 TV stations in Montana are affiliated with \nsome of these networks or with PBS. These stations air national news, \nsports, and entertainment at times of the day when people with jobs and \nkids can watch them.\n  Without local broadcasts, you might miss the evening network news \nbecause it comes on before you get home from work or because it airs \nlate at night. People want local network coverage because it works in \ntheir own lives and in their local community.\n  Until now, technology has not provided for rebroadcast of local \nsignals by satellites. Many rural residents have not been able to get \ndecent reception over the air.\n  Of course, we in the Senate cannot change technology or geography, \nbut what we can do is change the law. We can make local-into-local \nbroadcasting a reality, and we should.\n\n  Last spring, we passed H.R. 1554. At the time, we neglected an \nimportant responsibility. The language we passed would have required \nthe turnoff of network programing to many rural satellite viewers. It \nwould have done nothing to help the many local broadcasters in smaller \ncities and towns. It was an oversight.\n  Following the vote, I wrote a letter to the conference asking they \npay attention to the needs of the many viewers, communities, and \nstations that had been ignored. Twenty-three of my colleagues, from \nboth sides of the aisle, signed the letter.\n  As you know, Madam President, the conference on the satellite bill \nhas paid little attention to our request. The language of the \nconference report, now titled the ``Intellectual Property and \nCommunications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999,'' includes some important \nnew provisions.\n  It does allow satellite viewers in poor reception areas, the so-\ncalled ``grade B contour'' viewers, to continue to get network \nprogramming from satellites. Without this, many satellite viewers will \nlose their network TV at the end of next month.\n  It also includes a loan guarantee that will make it possible for all \nlocal stations to broadcast on satellite, not just those in the very \nlargest cities and towns.\n  Without this, the other local-into-local provisions of the act are an \nempty promise to rural and small town America that depends on \nsatellites.\n  Last week, the House passed the conference language by a near \nunanimous vote. But in the Senate, a few Members--and I might say, on \nthe other side of the aisle--are blocking a vote on this conference \nreport. They say: We promise to have more hearings. We should have \nanother committee look at this.\n  They might as well say: Let them watch the radio.\n  The Senate should act now to ensure that the conference report \nlanguage becomes law. It is clear the majority of the Senate is ready \nto vote to approve the measure, just as the House did. Instead, we are \noffered a weakened version attached to the omnibus appropriations bill, \nwhich we will get sometime soon, and a weak promise to do something \nnext year.\n  This is a no-brainer. There are many people in rural America who \nwould like to add satellite TV, network programming from their local \nstations. It is that simple. We have it within our power today to very \nsimply pass a provision and provide for the financing, a loan \nguarantee. We all know it is going to pass. We all know we are going to \ndo it. But there is one Senator who wants it in his committee. And I \nsay, that one Senator represents a State where there are a lot of \npeople who I think want local-into-local broadcasting from the \nsatellites.\n  There are millions of Americans who depend on their satellites and \nwant local network coverage--not national network coverage--or at least \nthe option to get both local and national.\n  This is a no-brainer. I get more mail on this subject than any other \nsubject. I daresay, Madam President, you probably get a lot of mail on \nthis subject, too. I know a lot of Senators probably get as much mail \non this one subject as any other. And we can simply solve it today very \neasily. It makes no sense for us not to.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14773-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14773-S14774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF T. MICHAEL KERR\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments regarding \nthe nomination of T. Michael Kerr to be Administrator of the Wage and \nHour Division of the Department of Labor. I held up this nomination \nuntil I could secure an agreement regarding the issue of unauthorized \nbreak time from the Secretary of Labor, outlined in a letter I will \nsubmit for the Record.\n  The need for this agreement with the Secretary was precipitated by a \ncase pending before the Wage and Hour Division regarding an employee \nexceeding the allotted time for a rest/period break, and an employer \ndeducting from the employee's compensation the time taken in excess of \nthe break time.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act does not require employers to provide \nits employees with a rest period/breaks. Nevertheless, many employers \noffer short breaks to their employees. Although the duration of a \nvoluntary break is up to the employer, the breaks generally run between \n5 and 20 minutes.\n  The Department of Labor does recognize that employers have the \nflexibility to determine the number of breaks and the length of breaks \nthat they offer to their employees. The Department of Labor has taken \nthe position that when an employer allows its employees to take a short \nbreak and an employee abuses the break time policy by exceeding the \ntime that the employer allotted for the break, the employer must still \ncompensate the employee for the first 20 minutes of the break.\n  Further, the Department of Labor has taken the position that if an \nemployer offers its employees a compensable break of less than 20 \nminutes in duration, and an employee's break time exceeds the time that \nthe employer allotted for the break, then the employer's only recourse \nagainst the employee is disciplinary action (such as a reprimand or \ntermination), or elimination of the rest period.\n  Under the agreement I reached with the Secretary, the Department of \nLabor will conduct a complete review of its policy regarding \nunauthorized breaks. That review will be completed by February 1, 2000. \nUpon completion of the review, the Department of Labor will submit its \nfindings in writing to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the relevant \ncommittees in the House and the Senate. The review will include \nconsideration of what outcome is in the best interest of the employee \nif the employee exceeds the allotted time of a rest period/break: \ndisciplinary action against the employee (such as a reprimand or \ntermination); elimination of the rest period/break option; or \ndeductions of compensation for the time in excess of the allotted break \ntime.\n  Also, the Secretary committed the Department of Labor will assure \nthat the resolution of any cases in which unauthorized break times are \nat issue, will be consistent with the findings in their review.\n  This is an important review of what is clearly an outdated policy. I \nlook forward to the outcome of their review, and I thank the staff at \nthe Department of Labor for working in good faith with my office, and \nthe Secretary for working to a quick resolution of this issue so this \nnomination can move forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Secretary of Labor be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S14774]]\n\n\n\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: This is a follow-up to the meeting of \n     our respective staffs yesterday. While the Department of \n     Labor recognizes that employers have the flexibility to \n     determine the number and length of breaks they offer to their \n     employees, the Wage and Hour Division has taken the position \n     that if an employer offers a break of less than 20 minutes in \n     duration, the time the employee spends on that break \n     typically is compensable hours worked under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act.\n       Most of the Wage and Hour Opinion Letters that address this \n     issue involve authorized breaks. However, on several \n     occasions, the Wage and Hour Administrator has stated that \n     short unauthorized breaks may also count as hours worked. \n     Wage and Hour has taken the position that if an employee \n     exceeds the time allotted for an authorized break, an \n     employer may take a disciplinary action against the employee, \n     or the employer may eliminate the option for rest periods/\n     breaks.\n       I am committing the Wage and Hour Division and the \n     Solicitor's Office to carefully review our policy with \n     respect to the compensability of unauthorized break time \n     under the FLSA. Our review will specifically include those \n     instances in which employees exceed the time allowed for a \n     rest break. We will also consider what outcome is in the best \n     interests of the employee if the employee exceeds the \n     allotted time for a rest period/break, including the option \n     of deductions of compensation for the time taken in excess of \n     the allotted break time.\n       As part of our review, we will consider the statutory text, \n     relevant legislative history and regulatory material, case \n     law, previous Wage and Hour Opinion Letters, changing \n     technology and any information that your office or a member \n     of the public may provide. We will complete our review of \n     this matter by February 1, 2000, and transmit our conclusions \n     and supporting rationale in writing to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Members of the relevant committees in the House and \n     the Senate.\n       It is important that all officials of the Wage and Hour \n     Division interpret and apply the law in a uniform manner, and \n     so advise the public. I will instruct the Wage and Hour \n     Division to assure that the resolution of any cases in which \n     unauthorized break time are at issue is consistent with the \n     outcome we reach in our overall review.\n       I very much appreciate your interest in these important \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alexis M. Herman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14774-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMPENSATING CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WORKERS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, yesterday, my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, and I introduced legislation that is, frankly, long \noverdue.\n  For more than 2 years, I have been concerned that the Department of \nEnergy was not taking seriously the complaints of a number of workers \nin Oak Ridge, Tennessee who are ill and who believe that their \nillnesses are linked to their employment at the DOE site in Oak Ridge. \nIn November of 1997, two years ago, I wrote to the then-Surgeon \nGeneral, Dr. David Satcher, to request that the Centers for Disease \nControl, CDC, come to Oak Ridge to try to determine whether a pattern \nof unexplained illnesses was present and, if so, if its cause could be \ndetermined. The CDC study, like others before it, looked at a narrow \nsample of individuals and did not produce conclusive results.\n  Since then, I have been working to get the Department of Energy to \nacknowledge that there is a problem, that certain of its current and \nformer workers are ill, and that they should work with us to address \nthe situation. This legislation--which we developed in conjunction with \nthe Department--is an important step in that direction.\n  It says, for the first time, that if mistakes were made, and if harm \nwas done to workers who helped this country win the Cold War, we need \nto act now to remedy those mistakes. It represents a recognition on the \npart of the government that if people have illnesses that are linked to \ntheir employment at a Department of Energy facility, they deserve \ncompensation. That is progress, and I am proud to be a part of it.\n  Our bill has three parts. The first section, the Energy Employees' \nBeryllium Compensation Act, would provide compensation to current and \nformer workers who have contracted chronic beryllium disease or \nberyllium sensitivity while performing duties uniquely related to the \nDepartment of Energy's nuclear weapons production program. There are \napproximately 90 Oak Ridge workers who have been diagnosed with either \nchronic beryllium disease or beryllium sensitivity to date, and a total \nof 2,200 Oak Ridge workers who were potentially exposed.\n  The second section, the Energy Employees' Pilot Project Act, would \nestablish a special pilot program for a specific group of 55 Oak Ridge \nworkers who are currently the subject of an investigation by a panel of \nphysicians specializing in health conditions related to occupational \nexposure to radiation and hazardous materials. This section authorizes \nthe Secretary of Energy to award $100,000 each to those Oak Ridge \nworkers whose illnesses are determined to likely be linked to their \nemployment at the Oak Ridge site.\n  Finally, our bill creates the Paducah Employees' Exposure \nCompensation Fund, which would compensate those current and former \nworkers at the Paducah, KY gaseous diffusion plant who were exposed to \nplutonium and other radioactive materials without their knowledge, and \nwho develop one of a specified list of conditions linked to radiation \nexposure. I want to note that there are workers at the K-25 gaseous \ndiffusion plant in Oak Ridge who were exposed to the same contaminants \nas those in Paducah, and workers in Portsmouth, Ohio who were similarly \naffected as well. It is my hope that these two groups of workers would \nbe added to this section of the legislation, upon the conclusion of the \nDepartment of Energy's investigation into what happened at these two \nsites, if the facts so warrant. Their absence at this time should in no \nway indicate that either the sponsors of this bill or the Department of \nEnergy believe that they were not similarly affected. I strongly \nbelieve that workers at all of the DOE sites must be treated equally in \nthis process, and I am committed to doing all I can to ensure that that \nis the case.\n  Let me just remind my colleagues who it is we are talking about. We \nare talking about workers who participated in the Manhattan Project, \nmen and women who helped to ensure the superiority of America's nuclear \narsenal, and who directly contributed to our nation's victory in the \nCold War. We owe them a debt of gratitude. And if we put them in harm's \nway without their knowledge, it's time for us to make that right. This \nbill is a step in that direction. I look forward to its consideration \nby the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14774-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14774-S14777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PAIN RELIEF PROMOTION ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on June 23, 1999, Senator Lieberman and I \nintroduced S. 1272, the Pain Relief Promotion Act, which addresses two \nspecific concerns. First, it provides federal support for training and \nresearch in palliative care. Second, it clarifies federal law on the \nlegitimate use of controlled substances. On October 27, 1999 the House \npassed its companion measure H.R. 2260 by the resounding bipartisan \nvote of 271 to 156. It is my hope that the Senate will soon have the \nopportunity to debate and vote on this important legislation.\n  In anticipation of that debate, and in light of inaccurate \ncharacterizations of the second aspect of our bipartisan legislation, I \nbelieve it is important for me to ensure that the Record reflects \nprecisely how this bill will--and will not--affect current federal law \nwith regard to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) oversight of the \nuse of federally controlled substances.\n  To understand the effect the Pain Relief Promotion Act will have on \npain control, we must begin with what the law is now. The Controlled \nSubstances Act, CSA, of 1970 charged the DEA with the responsibility of \noverseeing narcotics and dangerous drugs--including powerful \nprescription drugs which have a legitimate medical use but can also be \nmisused to harm or kill. In asserting its authority over these drugs, \nCongress declared in the preamble of the Controlled Substances Act of \n1970 that ``Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic \nin controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the \ninterstate incidents of such traffic'' (21 U.S.C. 801 (6)).\n  In 1984, Congress amended the CSA due in part to a specific concern \nregarding the misuse of prescription drugs in lethal overdoses. The \nthen Democratic-controlled House and a Republican Senate further \nstrengthened the Act, empowering the DEA to revoke a physician's \nfederal prescribing\n\n[[Page S14775]]\n\nlicense if he or she uses it to endanger ``health and safety'' \nregardless of whether state law has been violated (21 U.S.C. 824, \nreferencing 21 U.S.C. 823). The chairman of the Health subcommittee in \nthe House agreed: ``Drugs legally manufactured for use in medicine are \nresponsible for a substantial majority of drug-related deaths and \ninjuries'' (Rep. Waxman, Hearing of July 31, 1984, Hearing Record No. \n98-168, p. 365). Congress' view was that while the states are the first \nline of defense against misuse of prescription drugs, the Federal \nGovernment must have its own objective standard as to what constitutes \nsuch misuse--and it must have the authority to enforce that standard \nwhen a state cannot or will not do so. Congress' 1970 and 1984 \ndecisions have been upheld time and time again by federal courts.\n  It is clear that federal law is intended to prevent use of these \ndrugs for lethal overdoses, and contains no exception for deliberate \noverdoses approved by a physician. Nowhere in the Controlled Substances \nAct has death or assisting death ever been considered a ``legitimate \nmedical purpose'' for use of these drugs. In the past, physicians who \nwere involved in the use of these drugs for suicide or other lethal \noverdoses have lost their federal authority to prescribe controlled \nsubstances on the grounds that they had endangered ``health and \nsafety.''\n  In 1997, Congress passed the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act \nof 1997 without a dissenting vote in the Senate and by an overwhelming \nmargin of 398-16 in the House. President Clinton stated in signing the \nbill that ``it will allow the Federal Government to speak with a clear \nvoice in opposing these practices.'' He further warned that ``to \nendorse assisted suicide would set us on a disturbing and perhaps \ndangerous path.'' I would add only that authorizing a federal agency to \nendorse the use of controlled substances for assisted suicide would \nsimilarly ``set us on a disturbing and perhaps dangerous path.''\n  In November 1994, the State of Oregon adopted by referendum the so-\ncalled ``Death with Dignity Act,'' allowing physicians to prescribe \nmedication for the purpose of assisting patients' suicides. The week of \nthat vote, Professor George Annas of Boston University pointed out the \ninconsistency between the Oregon referendum and the Controlled \nSubstances Act in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. He \nquestioned whether such a state law was compatible with existing \nfederal laws governing federally controlled drugs, ``since the drafters \nof the federal statute certainly did not have this purpose [assisting \nsuicides] in mind.''\n  However, on June 5, 1998, overturning a previous determination by her \nown DEA Administrator, the Attorney General issued a letter carving out \nan exception for Oregon so it can use federally-controlled substances \nfor assisted suicide. She claimed that Congress did not ``intend to \noverride a state determination as to what constitutes legitimate \nmedical practice in the absence of a federal law prohibiting that \npractice.'' The Pain Relief Promotion Act will respond to the Attorney \nGeneral's challenge, by clarifying that the intentional misuse of these \ndrugs to cause patients' deaths is not authorized by Congress in any \nstate, nor has it ever been.\n\n  On October 27, 1997, Oregon's ``Death with Dignity Act'' became \neffective. In the first year at least 15 patients have committed \nsuicide with doctor's assistance under the new Oregon law. We really do \nnot know the total number, because all reporting of cases is left \ncompletely in the hands of the doctors themselves, and the Oregon \nHealth Division admits it has no idea how many unreported cases there \nare. But regarding those 15 reported cases we know one thing: Every one \nof those patient's deaths was caused by a federally controlled \nsubstance, prescribed with a federal DEA registration number, using \nfederal authority. Today, without any decision to this effect by \nCongress or the President, the federal government is actively involved \nin assisting suicides in Oregon.\n  To hear some of the critics of this bill you might think that the \nPain Relief Promotion Act creates a new authority on the part of the \nDEA to revoke doctors' registrations if they use controlled substances \nto assist suicide. On the contrary that authority has existed for 29 \nyears and it exists now. Attorney General Janet Reno was very clear on \nthis matter in her letter of June 5, 1998: ``Adverse action under the \nCSA may well be warranted . . . where a physician assists in a suicide \nin a state that has not authorized the practice under any conditions, \nor where a physician fails to comply with state procedures in doing \nso.''\n  What does this mean for current law and practice? First, the DEA has \nfull authority to revoke a DEA registration for assisting suicide in \nany of the 49 states where assisting suicide is not authorized by state \nlaw. While critics of the Pain Relief Promotion Act have said that \nempowering the DEA to investigate physicians in such cases will have a \n``chilling effect'' on the treatment of pain, the fact is that such \nauthority already exists in 49 states.\n  What about the one State, Oregon, where the Attorney General said the \nDEA will not take adverse actions against physicians for assisting \nsuicide in compliance with the Oregon law? Even in Oregon many cases of \nassisting suicide remain illegal under state law. The state law \nauthorizes assisting the suicide of those who are terminally ill, but \nnot others. Under the Attorney General's determination, then, the DEA \ncan continue to review cases of assisting suicide to make sure they do \nnot involve those who are not terminally ill, and it can scrutinize \nwhether a given use of pain medication was really intended to assist \nsuicide. All aspects of the Oregon guidelines for legally valid \nassisted suicide are also subject to DEA investigation, since the \nAttorney General has only authorized physicians to use federally \ncontrolled drugs for assisted suicides when they fully comply with \nthose state guidelines.\n  Thus, as interpreted by the Attorney General, a registration to \nprescribe federally controlled substances can be revoked under the \ncurrent Controlled Substances Act if these substances are used to \nassist suicide in any state in the Nation, with the exception of \ncertain cases of assisted suicide that Oregon has legalized for the \nterminally ill. If DEA scrutiny of doctors' prescribing practices were \ngoing to ``chill'' the practice of pain control, that would already be \noccurring under current law.\n  How does the Pain Relief Promotion Act impact this situation? It \nestablishes that, for the first time in federal law, the use of \ncontrolled substances for the relief of pain and discomfort is a \n``legitimate medical purpose,'' even if the large doses used in \ntreating pain may unintentionally hasten death. Intentionally causing \ndeath or assisting in causing death remains forbidden. Thus this bill \ndoes not increase the DEA's regulatory authority at all. On the \ncontrary, its only effect in 49 states (and even in Oregon, in cases \ninvolving those who are not terminally ill) is to provide new legal \nprotection for physicians who prescribe controlled substances to \ncontrol pain.\n  In Oregon, this bill eliminates the Attorney General's artificial \nexception designed to accommodate assisted suicides that are no longer \npenalized under Oregon law. The DEA can meet its responsibility here \nsimply by looking at the reports required by Oregon law, in which \ndoctors must identify the drugs used to assist suicide. Those records \nwill make it clear whether federally controlled drugs were used; and \nsince the physician is clearly reporting that his or her own intent was \nto help cause death, there will be no question of murky intentions or \nambiguity. Thus this bill will not lead to any increase in the DEA \ntrying to ``second guess'' or infer physicians' intentions, even in \nOregon.*****-*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: J1S/13-J1S/14 -Date: -\nSubformat:\n  What of any unreported cases in which physicians assist the suicides \nof terminally ill patients? Those assisted suicides are already a crime \nunder Oregon law, and thus already subject to adverse action by the DEA \nas well under the Attorney General's interpretation. Only if a \nphysician officially reports the case to the Oregon Health Division is \nhe or she exempted from state criminal penalties. So those cases are \nalready covered by the same DEA authority that currently applies to \nassisted suicides in the other 49 states.\n  Let me take this situation step by step.\n  First, removing the Oregon exception to the existing nationwide \npolicy cannot increase any ``chilling effect'' on\n\n[[Page S14776]]\n\npain relief outside of Oregon, because the bill does not increase one \niota the authority of the DEA to investigate the misuse of controlled \nsubstances to assist suicide outside of Oregon. In fact, in those \nstates its only effect is to provide a more explicit ``safe harbor'' \nfor the practice of pain control, which is a significant advance and \nimprovement for doctors and terminally ill patients. This is also true \nof assisted suicide cases within Oregon that do not comply with the \nstate's reporting requirements or other guidelines. In all these cases, \nthe Pain Relief Promotion Act gives the DEA no new mandate to \ninvestigate cases of assisted suicide more directly. Rather, it is \nexpected to follow its longstanding practice of generally deferring to \nstate authorities and allowing them to take the lead in investigating \npossible wrongdoing.\n  Second, no new questioning of physicians' intentions is warranted to \naddress the cases of assisted suicide that are now permitted under \nOregon law. To be free of criminal penalties under state law in Oregon, \na doctor who assists a suicide must submit a report to Oregon \nauthorities that includes information on the drugs prescribed to assist \nthe suicide. The Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, can obtain those \nreports from the Oregon authorities. It already has the authority to \nsubpoena them, if necessary; again, our legislation has no impact on \nthis.\n  Thus, even in Oregon, this bill will not result in any increase in \nDEA oversight or investigations of doctors based on their prescribing \npatterns or the dosages they use for particular patients. This is \nclearly stated in the House Judiciary Committee report on this bill, H. \nRep. 106-378 Pt. 1, pp. 12-13.\n  It follows that if this bill is enacted, any doctors in Oregon who \nprescribe controlled substances for pain relief need not fear any \nincrease in DEA scrutiny of their practices, and therefore should not \nin any way be deterred from prescribing adequate pain relief.\n  This bill cannot have a ``chilling effect'' on pain control, but will \nhave the opposite effect. For the first time, it will place in the \nControlled Substances Act, as the American Society of Anesthesiologists \nnotes, ``recognition that alleviating pain in the usual course of \nprofessional practice is a legitimate medical purpose for dispensing a \ncontrolled substance that is consistent with public health and safety, \neven if the use of such a substance may increase the risk of death.'' \nThe American Medical Association says this bill, ``provides a new and \nimportant statutory protection for physicians prescribing controlled \nsubstances for pain, particularly for patients at the end of life.'' As \nthe American Academy of Pain Management observes, this will protect the \nability of ``prescribers to relieve pain without fear of regulatory \ndiscipline.''\n  Those who are concerned about the possibility of a negative impact on \npain relief if we pass this bill need to answer this question: do they \nbelieve that now the Drug Enforcement Administration is having a \nchilling effect on pain relief because federally controlled substances \ncannot be used to assist suicide in 49 states and even, in many cases, \nin Oregon?\n  If the answer is ``no,'' then there is no basis to be concerned about \nthis bill--for this bill will not increase investigations or oversight \ninto the dosages of drugs used for pain relief, and in fact instructs \nthe DEA to be even more sensitive to physicians' need to prescribe \nlarge doses of these drugs for pain control.\n  If the answer is ``yes,'' then there is a great need for this bill--\nbecause for the first time it adds specific protections for doctors who \nprescribe controlled substances for pain control--resulting in a \ndecrease in any ``chilling effect'' that may exist under current law.\n  Let me quote from the American Medical Association:\n\n       The bill would not expand existing criminal penalties in \n     the CSA for persons whose unauthorized use of a controlled \n     substance leads to someone's death. . . . The bill would not \n     expand the DEA's authority concerning jurisdiction, \n     investigations or enforcement regarding the CSA. In fact, the \n     inclusion of a recognition of the ``double effect'' in the \n     CSA provides physicians in all jurisdictions an additional \n     statutory protection in cases of alleged [physician-\n     assisted suicide]. The bill has the potential, through its \n     educational provisions, of sensitizing law enforcement \n     personnel to the multiple issues of end-of-life care and \n     prescribing.\n\n  It is noteworthy that although the Justice Department expressed \nconcern about the portion of the bill that would prevent the use of \nfederally controlled substances to assist suicide in Oregon, it agrees \nthat the bill would aid, and not hinder, pain relief. In a letter dated \nOctober 19,1999, the Justice Department wrote that the bill ``would \neliminate any ambiguity about the legality of using controlled \nsubstances to alleviate the pain and suffering of the terminally ill by \nreducing any perceived threat of administrative and criminal sanctions \nin this context. The Department accordingly supports those portions of \n[the bill] addressing palliative care.''\n  This bill makes it easier, not harder, to use controlled substances \nto relieve pain. That is why so many major medical organizations, \nincluding the National Hospice Organization, the American Academy of \nPain Management and the American Society of Anesthesiologists, as well \nas the AMA, strongly support its enactment.\n  Some may wish to abolish the Controlled Substances Act altogether. \nThey may think that the federal government's longstanding insistence on \nmonitoring the distribution of these powerful drugs is an unwarranted \nintrusion into medical practice. I disagree with that stand, but at \nleast it can be understood as a consistent position. What is untenable \nis the claim that this particular bill, which clearly improves the \nlaw's sensitivity to medical judgments on pain control, somehow \nmysteriously worsens that situation. Once we understand what the \ncurrent law is and what this bill does, that claim simply does not make \nsense.\n  In short, the Pain Relief Promotion Act will foster pain control. It \nwill improve existing law by adding significant new legal protections \nfor physicians and pharmacists who prescribe and dispense controlled \nsubstances for pain control. It will reduce, and in no way increase, \nany possible ``chilling effect\" that could deter adequate pain control. \nAnd by clarifying federal law so the federal government will not \nfacilitate the medical institutionalization of assisted suicide in any \nstate, this legislation may help discourage doctors from simply \nsuggesting assisted suicide instead of working to address their \npatients' real problems of uncontrolled pain. As protectors of public \nhealth and safety we should be encouraging doctors to kill the pain, \nnot the patient.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following two \neditorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 4, 1999]\n\n                    Don't Kill the Pain-Relief Bill\n\n                          (By Wesley J. Smith)\n\n       Last week, by a vote of 271-156, the House approved the \n     Pain Relief Promotion Act, designed to promote effective \n     medical treatment of pain while deterring the misuse of \n     narcotics and other controlled substances for assisted \n     suicide. The bill's passage prompted an outpouring of \n     hyperbole and misinformation from opponents. Here are the \n     facts about the act:\n       It would not outlaw assisted suicide, Critics accuse \n     Congress of ``overturning'' Oregon's assisted-suicide \n     referendum. Would that it did. In fact, the act would outlaw \n     only the intentional use of controlled substances to cause \n     death. Lethal substances not controlled by federal drug \n     regulations could still be prescribed legally on Oregon for \n     use in assisted suicide.\n       It would not interfere with states' rights. Under the \n     Controlled Substances Act the federal government, not the \n     states, has the authority to determine what is and is not a \n     proper medical use of the drugs specified in the act. Thus, \n     as an editorial in the (Portland) Oregonian noted, it is the \n     Oregon law that ``barges into an area of long-standing \n     federal jurisdiction.'' Thus passage of the act would return \n     national uniformity to the enforcement of federal drug laws.\n       It merely reaffirms existing federal law. Because the act \n     declares that assisted suicide is not a ``legitimate medical \n     purpose'' under the Controlled Substances Act, critics have \n     wrongly accused supporters of granting new authority to the \n     Drug Enforcement Agency to punish doctors. In fact, DEA has \n     had that authority for nearly 30 years. Since 1980 it has \n     brought more than 250 enforcement actions for violating the \n     federal legal standard of ``legitimate medical purpose.''\n       The medical community overwhelmingly favors it. Proponents \n     of the bill include the American Medical Association, the \n     National Hospice Organization, the Hospice Association of \n     America, the American Academy of\n\n[[Page S14777]]\n\n     Pain Management, the American Society of Anesthesiologists \n     and the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians. \n     (True, support isn't unanimous. Dissent within the medical \n     community has been led by the Rhode Island Medical \n     Association.)\n       It has broad bipartisan support. Seventy-one House \n     Democrats voted for the bill, and its Senate sponsors include \n     Joe Lieberman (D., Conn.), Chris Dodd (D., Conn.) and Evan \n     Bayh (D., Ind.).\n       It would enhance pain control. If the act becomes law, pain \n     control will for the first time be specifically identified in \n     federal law as a proper use of controlled substances--even if \n     the use of pain-controlling drugs has the unintended side \n     effect of causing death. That is a much-needed legal reform, \n     because many doctors fail to treat pain aggressively because \n     they fear the government's second-guessing. Several states \n     have recently passed similar laws, leading to dramatic \n     increases in the use of morphine and other palliative \n     medications.\n       The Pain Relief Promotion Act looks likely to pass the \n     Senate. If President Clinton truly feels our pain, he will \n     sign it the moment it hits his desk.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Oregonian, July 1, 1999]\n\n                    Kill the Pain, not the Patients\n\n\n Congress should allow doctors to use controlled drugs for aggressive \n                   pain treatment instead of suicide\n\n       It's no secret to any reader of this space that we oppose \n     Oregon's venture into physician-assisted suicide.\n       But last year, when the American Medical Association and \n     the National Hospice Organization came out against a bill in \n     Congress giving medical review boards the power to deny or \n     yank the federal drug-prescribing license to physicians who \n     prescribed these drugs to assist in suicides, we took their \n     concerns seriously.\n       The groups argued that the proposed law could reverse \n     recent advances in end-of-life care. Doctors might become \n     afraid to prescribe drugs to manage pain and depression--\n     things that, when uncontrolled, can lead the terminally ill \n     to consider killing themselves in the first place. We thought \n     then that the problem could be worked out and that it was \n     possible to keep doctors from using federally controlled \n     substances to kill their patients without also preventing \n     them from relieving their terminally-ill patients' agonies.\n       This Congress's Pain Relief Promotion Act proves it, and \n     the proposed legislation comes not a moment too soon. A new \n     report by the Center for Ethics in Health Care at Oregon \n     Health Sciences University shows that end-of-life care in \n     Oregon--which fancies itself a leader in this area--is far \n     from all it should be. Too many Oregonians spend the last \n     days of their life in pain.\n       There's no real need for that--and the Pain Relief \n     Promotion Act of 1999 would go a long way toward addressing \n     these systemic and professional failures here and elsewhere. \n     The proposal would authorize federal health-care agencies to \n     promote an increased understanding of palliative care and to \n     support training programs for health professionals in the \n     best pain management practices. It would also require the \n     Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop and \n     share scientific information on proper palliative care.\n       Further, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would clarify the \n     Controlled Substances Act in two essential ways.\n       One, it makes clear that alleviating pain and discomfort is \n     an authorized and legitimate medical purpose for the use of \n     controlled substances.\n       Two, the bill states that nothing in the Controlled \n     Substances Act authorizes the use of these drugs for assisted \n     suicide or euthanasia and that state laws allowing assisted \n     suicide or euthanasia are irrelevant in determining whether a \n     practitioner has violated the Controlled Substances Act.\n       Technically, of course, the bill does not overturn Oregon's \n     so-called Death with Dignity Act. But it would thwart it, for \n     all practical purposes, because it makes it illegal for \n     Oregon doctors to engage in assisted suicide using their \n     federal drug-prescribing license. Suicide's advocates may \n     think of some other method, but none seems obvious.\n       Is this a federal intrusion on a state's right to allow \n     physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia?\n       To hear some recent converts to states' right talk, you \n     might think so. But you could just as easily argue that \n     Oregon's assisted suicide law intrudes on the federal domain. \n     The feds have long had jurisdiction over controlled \n     substances, even as states kept the power to regulate the way \n     physicians prescribe them. At best, it's a gray area.\n       You'll recall that the Department of Justice declined to \n     assert a federal interest in all of this when it plausibly \n     could have, shortly after Oregon voters approved assisted \n     suicide. It's probably better--and high time--that Congress \n     asserts that interest explicitly.\n       This act would establish a uniform national standard \n     preventing the use of federally controlled drugs for assisted \n     suicide. That, in itself, should advance the national debate \n     on this subject in a more seemly way than, say, the recent \n     efforts of Dr. Jack Kervorkian.\n       Beyond that, it's high time that Congress made clear that \n     improved pain relief is a key objective of our nation's \n     health-care institutions and our Controlled Substances Act. \n     The Pain Relief Promotion Act will do all this. No wonder the \n     American Medical Association and the National Hospice \n     Organization are now on board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14777-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRISON CARD PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President. I would like to alert my colleagues to an \nissue raised by H.R. 434, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative, regarding trade with Israel under the \nU.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Agreement. Notwithstanding our free-trade \nagreement with Israel, the CBI provisions of this legislation would \nunfairly discriminate against U.S. imports from Israel.\n  Under that legislation, most U.S. textile products made with Israeli \ninputs, such as yarn, fabric or thread, would not be eligible for duty \nfree treatment when assembled into apparel in the Caribbean. To \nillustrate the contrast with current law, today, if a U.S. company uses \nIsraeli yarn in manufacturing fabric, the products made from such \nfabric would be eligible for CBI benefits. The trade bill creates a \nunilateral change from the status quo in our trade with Israel and a \nmajor barrier to U.S. companies using Israeli-origin inputs.\n  I would like to submit for the Record a letter from the Economic \nMinister of the Israeli Embassy that was sent to each of the Members of \nthe Senate Finance Committee urging Congress to treat Israeli inputs on \npar with U.S. inputs in this trade legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Embassy of Israel,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to you, as well other members of \n     the Committee on Finance, to ask for your support during the \n     Committee's mark-up of the U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade \n     Enhancement Act (also known as the ``CBI'' trade parity bill) \n     to ensure that it does not impose an economic barrier against \n     U.S. imports of Israeli-origin inputs, such as yarn, fabric \n     or thread, under the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Agreement \n     (``FTAA'').\n       My Government urges the inclusion of a provision in the CBI \n     legislation that will enable U.S. companies to continue \n     utilizing Israeli-origin inputs in producing American-made \n     products without making such products ineligible for CBI \n     duty-free trade prefrences.\n       The current CBI trade program provides preferential tariff \n     treatment to apparel made from U.S.-formed components that \n     are finished in a CBI-eligible country. Currently such \n     components may be cut from fabric, or formed from yarn, \n     originating either in the United States or Israel. The \n     legislation before the Committee incorporates a U.S.-only \n     fabric and thread forward rule of origin. The CBI bill \n     recently approved by the House Ways and Means Committee also \n     incorporates a U.S.-only ``yarn forward'' requirement for \n     knit-to-shape products. Either bill in its current form would \n     adversely affect Israeli exports to the United States. Market \n     conditions would all but require U.S. companies to halt \n     imports of Israeli inputs so as not to disqualify their \n     products from the duty-free trade preference to be extended \n     unilaterally to CBI-eligible countries. The loss of sales to \n     the U.S. market would harm\n\n[[Page S14778]]\n\n     both Israeli companies and U.S. companies that supply raw \n     materials used in the manufacture of Israeli inputs, such as \n     nylon yarn.\n       I am bringing this matter to your attention because the \n     legislation to be considered by the Finance Committee should \n     not damage U.S.-Israeli trade. Protecting against such harm \n     can be accomplished by providing in the legislation that \n     Israeli-origin inputs will, for purposes of CBI preferences, \n     be treated no less favorably than U.S. inputs. Such a \n     provision would ensure that restrictive consequences of the \n     proposed legislation would not adversely affect U.S.-Israeli \n     trade.\n       The legislative measure that we are asking you to support \n     is consistent with previous trade measures approved by your \n     Committee and enacted into U.S. law to preserve U.S.-Israeli \n     trade under the FTAA. Such a provision would preserve the \n     status quo in U.S.-Israeli trade, a goal that has been \n     endorsed previously on a number of occasions by the \n     Committee. It is not intended to create any new benefit for \n     Israeli products.\n       In sum, our objective is to ensure that the CBI trade bill \n     does not withdraw the practical benefits of the U.S.-Israel \n     Free Trade Area Agreement and our mutual goal of expanding \n     bilateral trade. I would very much welcome the opportunity to \n     review this issue with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ohad Marani,\n                                                Economic Minister.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I do not think that it is the intent of the CBI \nlegislation to undermine our trade with Israel. Preserving our existing \ntrade with Israel will not in any way lessen the trade benefits we \nextend to the CBI countries. And it is critically important that we \nconsider our existing trade agreement with Israel as we develop further \ntrade measures. I urge my colleagues to address this issue as this bill \nmoves forward, so that we do not prejudice our trade with Israel under \nthe U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14778-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14778-S14779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE REPORT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

S. 623 would authorize the \n     appropriation of about $688 million (in 1999 dollars) for the \n     Bureau to complete the GDU. Adjusting for anticipated cost \n     growth, CBO estimates that implementing this legislation \n     would require the appropriation of $793 million over the \n     2000-2017 period. Most of the outlays from such funding would \n     occur after 2004. We estimate that enacting the bill would \n     reduce offsetting receipts (a credit against direct spending) \n     by less than $200,000 a year between 2002 and 2006, but would \n     result in increased offsetting receipts of about $7 million a \n     year starting in 2007.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact on S. 623 over the next five \n     years is shown in the following table. The costs of this \n     legislation fall within budget function 300 (natural \n     resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                 ---------------------------------------\n                                   2000    2001    2002    2003    2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION \\1\\\nEstimated Authorization Level...       0      24      33      47      31\nEstimated Outlays...............       0      16      27      41      47\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Most of the costs of implementing S. 623 would occur after 2004. In\n  addition, to the bill's discretionary costs, it would increase direct\n  spending by less than $200,000 a year over the 2000-2004 period. (That\n  estimated annual effect would continue through 2006, but S. 623 would\n  reduce direct spending by about $7 million a year after 2006).\n\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary funds, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 623 would cost $131 million \n     over the 2000-2004 period, $450 million over the 2000-2009 \n     period, and $793 million over the 2000-2018 period. \n     Initially, the bill would have no significant impact on \n     direct spending, but after 2006, S. 623 would increase \n     offsetting receipts by about $7 million a year.\n\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       Estimates of funds needed to meet design and construction \n     schedules were provided by the Bureau. CBO adjusted those \n     estimates to reflect anticipated cost growth during the \n     construction period, as authorized by the bill. For purposes \n     of this estimate, CBO assumes that S. 623 will be enacted \n     during fiscal year 2000 and that the authorized amounts will \n     be appropriated. Estimates of outlays are based on historical \n     spending patterns for similar projects.\n\n\n                   spending subject to appropriation\n\n       Red River Valley Water Supply Project.--S. 623 would \n     authorize the appropriation of $200 million (in 1999 dollars) \n     for the Bureau to construct facilities to meet the water \n     quality and quantity needs of the Red River Valley. Based on \n     information from the Bureau, CBO expects that construction \n     would begin during fiscal year 2004 and would be \n     substantially completed in 2007. Assuming appropriation of \n     the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that design and initial \n     construction would about $75 million over the 2000-2004 \n     period.\n       Municipal, Rural, and Industrial Water Systems.--The bill \n     also would authorize the appropriation of $200 million (in \n     1999 dollars) for the Bureau to make grants to North Dakota \n     to construct municipal, rural, and industrial water \n     systems. The bill would authorize the appropriation of an \n     additional $200 million (in 1999 dollars) for the Bureau \n     to construct, operate, and maintain, on a nonreimbursable \n     basis, municipal, rural, and industrial water systems on \n     certain Indian reservations. CBO estimates that \n     implementing both of these provisions would cost about $45 \n     million between 2000 and 2004.\n       Operation and Maintenance.--During construction of the Red \n     River Valley Water Supply Project, operation and maintenance \n     costs of the GDU would be covered by using funds appropriated \n     for construction. Once the facility is completed in 2007, S. \n     623 would authorize the appropriation of amounts necessary \n     for the Bureau to operate and maintain a certain portion of \n     the facility. Based on information from the Bureau, CBO \n     expects the facility to be put into use in 2007. At that \n     time, we estimate that an additional appropriation of about \n     $3 million would be required each year for operation and \n     maintenance.\n       S. 623 also would authorize the appropriation of additional \n     amounts necessary for the operation and maintenance of \n     wildlife mitigation and enhancement facilities, including \n     wildlife refuges. Based on information from the Bureau, CBO \n     estimates this work would cost about $1 million annually \n     starting in 2001.\n       Natural Resources Trust.--S. 623 would authorize the \n     appropriation of $25 million for the Secretary of the \n     Interior to make annual contributions to the Natural \n     Resources Trust, a nonfederal corporation (currently known as \n     the Wetlands Trust). The amount to be contributed in any \n     fiscal year would equal 5 percent of the amount appropriated \n     in that year for the Red River Valley Water Supply Project \n     and for non-Indian municipal, rural, and industrial water \n     supply systems. CBO estimates this provision would cost $6 \n     million between 2000 and 2004.\n       Recreational Projects.--The bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of $6.5 million for the Bureau to construct, \n     operate, and maintain new recreational facilities, provided \n     that the Secretary of the Interior has entered into \n     agreements with nonfederal entities to provide half of the \n     cost of operating and maintaining any such facilities. CBO \n     estimates that implementing this provision would cost about \n     $1 million between 2000 and 2004.\n       Oakes Test Area Title Transfer.--S. 623 would authorize the \n     Secretary to convey the Oakes Test Area, an experimental \n     irrigation facility in North Dakota, to the local irrigators. \n     The Bureau currently spends less than $200,000 annually to \n     operate and maintain the facility. These amounts are subject \n     to appropriation and are reimbursed by users of the facility. \n     Reimbursements are deposited in the Treasury as offsetting \n     receipts and are unavailable for spending without \n     appropriation action. Based on information from the Bureau. \n     CBO expects that the title transfer would occur during fiscal \n     year 2002. Starting in that year, this provision would yield \n     annual discretionary savings of less than $200,000.\n\n\n                            direct spending\n\n       Offsetting Receipts from Repayment Contracts.--Under \n     current law, the GDU water\n\n[[Page S14779]]\n\n     supply features are not expected to be put into service, and \n     thus will not generate offsetting receipts from repayment \n     contracts. According to the Bureau, under S. 623 the unit \n     would be placed into service during 2007 and the agency would \n     start to collect repayments from project beneficiaries in \n     that year. Repayments would be deposited in the Treasury as \n     offsetting receipts and would be unavailable for spending \n     without appropriation. CBO estimates that these receipts \n     would total about $7 million a year starting in 2007.\n       Oakes Test Area Title Transfer.--CBO estimates that under \n     the bill, the Secretary would transfer ownership of the Oakes \n     Test Area to local users in 2002. This transfer would reduce \n     offsetting receipts that are collected from irrigators under \n     current law to reimburse the Bureau for operating costs. \n     Thus, CBO estimates that this provision would reduce \n     offsetting receipts by less than $200,000 a year starting in \n     2002.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in outlays that are subject to pay-\n     as-you-go procedures are shown in the following table. For \n     the purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the budget year and the succeeding four years are \n     counted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                         By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays............................................       0        0        0        0        0        0        0       -7       -7       -7\nChanges in receipts...........................................

TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to call attention to the fact that \ntoday, November 18, 1999, is the birthday of the very distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, my friend. I would \nlike to say lifelong friend; I just haven't had the pleasure of knowing \nhim all of my life. The day after tomorrow, I will be 82 years old, if \nthe Lord lets me live. So I can't say he is my lifelong friend, but he \nhas been my friend over all the years he has served in the Senate.\n  I wish him a happy, happy birthday. He is a Senator who doesn't look \nup to the rich. He doesn't look down on the poor. He is a good man on \nthe inside and on the outside. And he is a man who sticks by his \nprinciples.\n  He is a Republican. I am a Democrat. But neither he nor I puts \npolitical party above everything else. We know that political party is \nimportant, but there are other things in this life that are even more \nimportant. He recognizes that. His handclasp is like the handclasp of \nour ancestors. His word is his bond, as was the word of our ancestors.\n  I could say much more. I will simply say he is a Christian gentleman, \na gentleman first, last, and always. My wife Erma and I extend to him \nour very best wishes on his birthday and our prayers and hopes that he \nwill enjoy many, many more happy birthdays.\n  He is rendering a tremendous service to his country and to his State. \nI hope the people of Alaska realize what a treasure this man is. He \nworks for Alaska every day in the Senate. We know that. He is \neffective. He is forceful. He is genuine.\n  Erma and I join in wishing him a happy birthday and expressing our \ngood wishes also to his lovely wife, Catherine, and to his children.\n  I yield to the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank Senator Byrd for yielding me the \ntime. I join in wishing a very happy birthday to our friend from \nAlaska. He makes the Senate a better place. He keeps us lively. He \nworks hard. He makes sure we get our job done, and he does it with a \nlot of alacrity sometimes. He will get right up in your face and make \nsure you understand. That helps to clear the subject up in many \ninstances.\n  He is a great guy. I am honored to be able to serve in this \ninstitution with the great Senator from Alaska who does so much for our \ncountry and certainly for his State of Alaska. I will not tell his \nwife, the lovely, charming wife to whom he is married, what his age is \ntoday because I assume she doesn't know what his actual age is. We will \nkeep that a secret. But happy birthday to our great friend.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield because I think this is \nthe most appropriate time to add my wishes as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wish to identify with the warm and generous remarks \nmade by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I agree \nentirely with his comments and with the views he has expressed. I think \nhe and I speak for our caucuses in our admiration collectively for the \nSenator from Alaska. We may not always agree, but there isn't anyone \nwho cares more deeply about this institution, about his State, and \nrepresents himself more effectively on the Senate floor and with his \ncolleagues than the Senator from Alaska.\n  It is an honor for me to be one of those who have had the good \nfortune of working with him. I respect him immensely, and I, too, join \nin wishing him the happiest of birthdays. I wouldn't be surprised at \nall if Catherine knows exactly how old he is today.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14780-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14780-S14781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14780]]\n                MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                           Motion to Proceed\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the short-term continuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I speak \non behalf of 11 million Americans, at least, many of them residents of \nthe State of Alaska. We haven't solved the satellite home viewer \nmatter. I don't see why we can't. It is very simple. All we have to do \nis put that loan guarantee in, which is very simple. If there are any \nwrinkles, they can easily be worked out. It makes no sense for us to go \nhome without passing the loan guarantee provision so that the satellite \nviewers can rest assured and so that those who are going to put up \nsatellites and develop satellites for local-to-local coverage are able \nto do so. I cannot understand, on behalf of those 11 million Americans \nwho can't understand, why in the world we don't do something that is \npretty simple.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield to me to respond?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have not propounded a unanimous consent request other \nthan to proceed to the short-term continuing resolution so that Senator \nByrd may begin to discuss an issue of concern to a number of Senators. \nI intended to talk to the Senator from Montana and others about trying \nto enter into an agreement with regard to time.\n  On the issue to which he referred, I think it is very important that \nwe do take action in this final bill we will be taking up in the next \nday or so, or today, that will make sure the satellite bill is passed \nso that people across this country will continue to receive service \nfrom the networks on their television sets in the future in order to \nhave this so-called local-to-local service where you get your local \nstation on your local satellite. We are going to have to have some \nprocess, some way to get that service into rural areas and smaller \nareas such as those in Montana, Alaska, and in Mississippi. I am \ncommitted to getting that done. So is the Senator from Alaska, Mr. \nStevens. We are going to get that done.\n  We are going to have to have a very carefully thought out loan \nguarantee system that will get the satellites up, to get the towers \nthat are necessary to make sure that that is done. The problem we have, \nas with so many other issues we have been dealing with in the last \nweek, is getting all of that done in the last few hours to make sure we \nget it done right without the whole process being held up as we go \nforward.\n  I will talk to the Senator privately, but he has my assurances--\nSenator Daschle and I will put a colloquy in the Record--that we are \ngoing to get this done. We are going to get it done early next year. If \nthere are dilatory tactics, we will have a bill that has been carefully \nmassaged by all of the relevant committees, not just one. We will \neither get it done straight up or we will look for another vehicle. \nThis is something to which we are committed, to which I am committed, \nand I know the Senator from Alaska is committed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator from Montana--\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska \nwithout losing my rights to the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I certainly won't make a long statement. I still am very \ncommitted to the loan guarantee provisions that were in the Satellite \nHome Viewer Act. But I am also convinced that we would have a period of \ntime to get the regulations ready to proceed with that guarantee \nprogram. It would take roughly 6, 7 months.\n  I am going to ask the FCC to start preparing those regulations now. \nWe have the commitment that we will have a loan guarantee bill before \nus, and we will be voting on it sometime in April. We will not delay \nthe loan guarantee program for rural America by what we have done. I \nwas assured of that, and I am assured in my own mind that it will work. \nWe will be right on time by the time we get this bill.\n  We have a commitment coming that we will either have an improved \nauthorization for a loan guarantee or we will vote what was in the bill \nwe took out last night. I urge my friend to understand that we have not \nabandoned the loan guarantee program. Coming from where I do, I would \nnever abandon it.\n  When I came to the Senate, the Army ran the communications system of \nAlaska; the U.S. Government owned all of the telephones in Alaska. Now, \nwhen you look at the distance we have come in a relatively short time \nof my service in the Senate, we are going to do the same thing with \nsatellite communications in a very short period of time, in a new way, \nconsistent with private enterprise, on a guarantee program rather than \na Government loan program.\n  We need to have certainty to what we are doing. I know it will take a \nlong time to get the regulations ready. We did not agree to delaying \nthe loan guarantee program last night; we delayed the authorization for \nit, and we will have that authorization by April of next year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I hear my \ngood friend from Alaska and the majority leader. They have States that \nhave the same concerns as do we. Not for a moment do I doubt the \nintentions of both of the Senators. They are two of the most honorable \nmen I have had the pleasure to know. They are wonderful people.\n  But I also know how the Senate operates. I also know that the best \nintentions often don't materialize and something happens. I also know \nthat some of the regulations I suspect the Senator talked about--it is \na lot easier for the FCC to write regulations than not knowing in the \nabstract what the regulations are. I don't know what they can really do \nthat is substantive or effective in the next several months, or \nwhatever it takes.\n  I also know that the only objection to us proceeding really is one \nSenator who, for some reason, thinks he should have jurisdiction over \nthis. It is an ``inside baseball'' objection. It is not a substantive \nobjection in any great way.\n  I also know there is a lot in this omnibus bill that was written \npretty quickly, where many minds got together to get something done. I \nalso know that necessity is the motherhood of invention. If we want to \ndo this, we will find a way to get it in.\n  I am suggesting that a vast majority of Members of this body want to \ndo it. I suggest that 90 percent want to do it. There is an objection \nnot based on substance but based on another reason.\n  I very much appreciate the desire of the Senator from West Virginia \nto speak. But I might say that my objecting to proceeding here does not \ndeprive the Senator from speaking. He will find ample opportunity, and \nI support his right to be able to speak. This is so black and white, so \nmuch of a no-brainer, and there are millions of Americans in rural \nAmerica who want this thing, and there is so little reason not to do \nit.\n  So I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield the floor. I believe the Senator \nfrom West Virginia was prepared to proceed to discuss his issue. I \nthink he probably will do that. We will see what might be done to \naddress concerns Senators may have, and we will be back later.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I checked with my office. TEA 21, the \nhighway bill, had a loan guarantee program. It took 16 months for the \nregulations to be drawn before there was one guarantee made. We have \nthe process to be started on the Satellite Home Viewer Act to create \nregulations for a new loan guarantee program, and I said it could be \ndone in 6 months. My staff tells me I was very conservative; it will \ntake much longer than that. We will have the law for authorizing the \nloan guarantee done by the end of April.\n  I do not believe that those who agree with me that there should be a \nloan guarantee program should be worried about the deletion of that \nauthorization now. The problem on the loan guarantee program is to \ncommence the drafting and, really, the presentation of the new program. \nIt will be entirely new. It is not similar to any conduct of a loan \nguarantee program in history. So it will take a considerable amount of \ntime.\n\n[[Page S14781]]\n\n  I want the Record to note there is no reason to oppose this bill and \nparticularly to oppose this continuing resolution on the basis of the \ndeletion of the loan guarantee program from the Satellite Home Bureau \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in the rush to complete work on an omnibus \nappropriations bill that will attract enough votes to pass both \nChambers of Congress without incurring a veto from the White House, a \nnumber of important measures that should have been in the conference \nreport have ended up on the cutting room floor. One of those issues is \nmountaintop mining.\n  I am extremely disappointed at the shortsightedness of the White \nHouse, as well as some Members of Congress, on this issue. We had a \nchance on the omnibus package to right a wrong, to remedy the crisis in \nWest Virginia's coal fields that was triggered by a recent Federal \ncourt ruling. But the White House blocked that effort, leading the \ncharge to exclude the proposed legislative remedy from the omnibus \nbill. As a result, thousands of coal miners in West Virginia, and \nthroughout Appalachia, are facing a bleak and uncertain future.\n  Particularly troubling to me is that the ammunition used to defeat \nthis proposal, the ammunition used to keep it out of the omnibus \npackage, was, in large part, a campaign of misinformation, led by the \nWhite House.\n  My proposal is not antienvironment. The White House would have you \nbelieve otherwise. My proposal would not weaken or in any way alter the \nClean Water Act. Let the White House hear! The White House would have \nthe people believe otherwise. Let me say it again. This amendment which \nis cosponsored by Mr. McConnell, the senior Senator from Kentucky; Mr. \nRockefeller, the junior Senator from West Virginia; and Mr. Bunning, \nthe junior Senator from Kentucky, would not weaken or in any way alter, \nmodify, change, repeal, amend, or undermine the Clean Water Act.\n  I know the White House has tried to mislead people into believing \nthat it would. It would not. Fie on the White House! fie for attempting \nto mislead the people. Now, one can honestly believe what he is saying \nand can mislead or one can mislead with the intention of misleading.\n  All the Byrd-McConnell amendment would do is preserve the status quo \nuntil an environmental impact assessment, which is already underway, is \ncompleted and regulations resulting from it are issued. That \nenvironmental impact assessment was not put in motion by the White \nHouse; it was put in motion by a court action last December.\n  No laws would be weakened by the Byrd-McConnell amendment. No \nregulations would be discarded. The legislative remedy that is proposed \nby this amendment is not an either/or proposition. This amendment would \npermit carefully controlled mountaintop mining while allowing work to \ncontinue on a broad environmental study that could spur better \noversight and more environmentally friendly mining practices nationally \nin the years ahead. In my book, that is a win/win situation.\n  This mountaintop mining proposal is an effort to stand up for \nAmerica's coal miners--and the railway workers, and the truckers, and \nthe suppliers, and all who are involved directly or indirectly with \nmining. This proposal is an effort to stand up for the coal miners and \nthe hundreds of thousands of jobs and the scores of other industries \nthey support. Allowing this opportunity to slip through our fingers \nwould be a grievous mistake.\n  We can't control what the people at the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue say. We can't control how they treat America's coal miners. But \nwe can speak up for what we believe here in the Senate. We can send our \nmessage to the White House.\n  To get that message across, I hope to offer an amendment. I could \nspeak at length on the omnibus appropriations bill when it comes before \nthe Senate. We could be here another week. We could be here another 2 \nweeks.\n  They say time is running out for the continuing resolution. Madam \nPresident, time is running out for the coal miners and their families, \nand for the retired coal miners, and their wives, or their widows, and \ntheir families. Time is running out for them. The President wants this \nAppropriations Bill sent to him, in Greece. Indeed! What are we going \nto send to the coal miners who have been working for this country \nbefore he was born? What are we going to send them?\n  I have seriously considered this matter. This issue merits the time \nand the attention of Congress. I am prepared to give it some time.\n  I don't want to hold this measure up interminably. I want to see \naction on it. I want to vote. I want to vote on this amendment--the \nByrd, McConnell, Rockefeller, Bunning, et al. amendment.\n  So, I take these few moments to speak the truth, to try to set the \nrecord straight on the impact of this amendment, of which I am the \nchief cosponsor, and to give this body, and hopefully the other body, \none more chance this year to protect the jobs and the livelihoods of \nthousands of working men and women in West Virginia and throughout \nAmerica, and to give the White House one more chance to reverse its \ncurrent position and protect the jobs of the coal miners.\n  We are not just talking about coal miners; we are also talking about \nthe coal industry; we are talking about other laborers--the truckers, \nthe railway operators, the barge operators who go up and down the Ohio \nand other rivers. It isn't just the coal miners union that is \nconcerned. The AFL-CIO is concerned. Take another look! Take another \nlook at those who are opposed and who work against legislation that \nwill benefit the working men and women of America.\n  On October 20, a Federal district court in West Virginia issued an \nopinion in a lawsuit involving Federal regulatory agencies that \nvirtually set off an explosion in the coal fields. Mining companies \nimmediately announced that there would be hundreds of coal miners who \nwould be cut off, and new mines which were in the plans by companies to \nbe built, would be scuttled.\n  In some instances, a new mine costs $50 million; it costs $75 million \nin some instances; and in some instances it costs $90 million, or more, \nto open a new mine. What mining company is going to invest $90 million \nin a new mine when the Federal judge issues a ruling such as this? \nThere is no predictability at all in the future.\n\n  Before the court issued its opinion, as part of a settlement the \nmining industry in West Virginia was operating under two memoranda of \nunderstanding--two memoranda of understanding that had been agreed \nupon. Hear this: Two memoranda of understanding. I didn't have anything \nto do with those memoranda of understanding. Who agreed? Who entered \ninto agreements concerning mountaintop mining? Who entered into \nagreements concerning mountaintop mining? Who entered into the \nmemoranda of understanding? These were agreed upon by the Federal and \nState regulatory agencies. Hear me now! These were entered into and \nagreed upon by the regulatory agencies--both State and Federal--that \noversee mining permits.\n  What are those agencies that entered into this agreement? The Federal \nOffice of Surface Mining, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the \nState Division of Environmental Protection, the Environmental \nProtection Agency. These are this administration's regulatory agencies. \nThis administration's regulatory agencies entered into those \nagreements.\n  Let me say that again. Hear me.\n  Who entered into those regulations? Who were the parties to those \nagreements? This administration's regulatory agencies, the EPA, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior through the \nOffice of Surface Mining, and the West Virginia Division of \nEnvironmental Protection--Federal and State agencies--created these \nagreements, devised these memoranda of understanding. They weren't \ncreated by me. The administration's own Environmental Protection \nAgency, the great Federal protector of our land, water, and air, helped \nto write and signed onto these memoranda of understanding.\n  Do you, my friends, really believe that the EPA signed agreements \nthat weakened environmental protections?\n\n[[Page S14782]]\n\n  Let me say to the White House: Do you believe that your own \nEnvironmental Protection Agency signed onto agreements that weakened \nenvironmental protections? No. No. These memoranda of understanding--\ncalled MOUs--put into place stronger environmental protections in West \nVirginia.\n  Listen to this: These MOUs put into place stronger--get it, now--\nstronger environmental protections and regulations in West Virginia \nthan exist in any other State in the Union. Hear me, environmentalists; \nyou ought to be fighting for this amendment. You ought to be urging us \non in our fight for this amendment. I am an environmentalist. Who was \nthe majority leader of the Senate when SMCRA was passed in this body, \nthe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act? Who was the majority \nleader of the Senate then? Who stood up for you environmentalists then?\n  West Virginia at one time was the only State in the United States \nthat had no wildlife refuge. I put money in Appropriations bills, to \nbring the first wildlife refuge to West Virginia, the last State among \nthe 50 that got a wildlife refuge. Hear me, environmentalists. Who put \nthe money in for the Canaan Valley Wildlife Refuge--that West Virginia \nrefuge was the 500th in the nation? I did.\n  I am an environmentalist. Who put the $138 million in for the fish \nand wildlife's national conservation and training facilities at \nTerrapin Neck, three miles out of Shepherdstown, WV? Who fought 5 years \nin the Senate Appropriations Committee for that $138 million? Who \nfought for it in the House-Senate conferences? This Senator; this \nenvironmentalist fought for it.\n  Nobody wants a cleaner environment than I do. But I hope I also have \nsome common sense. We know that in West Virginia the great core \nindustries have fueled the powerplants of the Nation, have fueled the \nwar machine of the Nation. The coal industry, the steel industry, the \nglass industry, the chemical industry, these and other core industries \nhave employed hundreds of people in West Virginia. The core industries \nare still there, but they are diminishing. There were 125,000 coal \nminers in West Virginia when I first ran for the House of \nRepresentatives in 1952. Today, there are only 20,000, give or take, in \nWest Virginia.\n  These core industries cannot always be what they once were. But there \nare those who want coal mining stopped now. They want it stopped \ntonight. They want it stopped tomorrow. Shut it down! That is what they \nwant. But we can't do that. It can't be done overnight. People have to \nwork. Children have to eat. Widows have to live. We have to continue to \noperate the mines. We are trying to develop other industries in West \nVirginia--high-tech industries. I have tried to encourage Federal \nagencies to look to West Virginia for a better quality of life, for a \nsafer life, where the people who work can at last buy a home, where \npeople want to work and will turn in a good day's work.\n  We are trying to diversify our industries. It takes time. I have put \nappropriations into the corridor highways of West Virginia, so that \nother industries will be encouraged to come into West Virginia and to \nexpand. They won't come where there are bad roads. They need an \ninfrastructure that will support their industries and their people. It \ntakes time. It can't be done overnight. Those environmentalists who \nwant it done overnight, it can't be done overnight.\n\n  Those MOUs established stronger environmental protections and \nregulations in West Virginia than exist in any other State in the \nNation, bar none. I say to the Administration, your own regulatory \nagencies agreed and worked out those regulations, and now you, the \nWhite House, want to turn your back on your own environmental agency, \non your own Army Corps of Engineers, on your own Office of Surface \nMining.\n  Peter heard the cock crow three times, and then he hung his head in \nshame. He denied his Lord thrice and then hung his own head in shame \nand walked away.\n  White House, hang your head in shame!\n  But the court's opinion, throw all these things out the window. The \nMOUs, the agreements that have been entered into by this \nadministration's regulatory agencies, are all thrown out the window. \nThe court ruled that the way in which the agencies were operating did \nnot follow the letter and intent of the law.\n  Hear that. I helped to create those laws. I supported the Clean Water \nAct. I supported the Surface Mining and Control Reclamation Act. I \nsupported it. But the court ruled that the way in which these agencies \nwere operating did not follow the letter of the law and intent of the \nlaw.\n  Congress passed the law. The court disagreed with the way in which \nthe Federal regulatory agencies and the State regulatory agency \ninterpreted the law. But the court was wrong. There are 20,000 miners, \n20,000 voices that come from the coal fields who say that the court was \nwrong. Its decision was completely contrary to the intent of Congress \nin passing those two laws, the Clean Water Act and the Surface Mining \nand Control and Reclamation Act.\n  While I disagree with the court, the ball is here. It is in our court \nnow because the judge in his ruling said if application of Federal \nregulation prevents certain activities in the Appalachian coal fields \n``it is up to Congress.'' That is this body and the other body. He said \n. . . ``it is up to Congress''--and the legislature--``to alter that \nresult.''\n\n  So we have accepted the responsibility. The judge said it is up to \nCongress. We, who are supporting this amendment, have accepted that \nresponsibility and we are trying to do something about it. We are being \nimpeded and we are being undercut by the White House, by my own White \nHouse.\n  Almost immediately after the judge issued his ruling, confusion \nreigned. There was chaos in the coal fields. Layoff notices went out. \nMining companies announced that they might not make significant \ninvestments in the State that had long ago been planned. That is real \nmoney that has to be spent. Those are real risks they take on. As a \nresult of the court ruling, coal companies, truckers, barge operators, \nrailroads--none of them had any certainty that the investments they \nmight make today would be justifiable tomorrow.\n  Some say, it's just a West Virginia problem. You tell the people of \nKentucky that. Tell the people of Pennsylvania that. Too bad for West \nVirginia. But I am here to say to my colleagues it is a national \nproblem. Look out. Look out. That cloud that is over West Virginia is \nheaded your way next, Kentucky. And Mitch McConnell knows that. That is \nwhy he is a cosponsor of this amendment. That cloud just over the \nborder, that cloud is just over the horizon in West Virginia. You will \nbe next. And they know it. Look out, it is coming your way next. But if \nyou want to head it off, the opportunity is here with this amendment. \nThis is the time to head off this dragon. Beat it back. Take the sword \nthat I offer, that Mitch McConnell offers, that Jay Rockefeller offers, \nthat Senator Bunning offers, and all the other Senators whose names are \non this amendment offer--take this sword. Take this sword, and fight \nfor the working men and women of this Nation, and do it now.\n  Some may say, ``I would like to. I would like to sign up. I am \nwilling to put on the suit of armor--but what about the environment? We \ncan't upset the environment.''\n  Let me assure my colleagues and the people who are watching out \nthere--let me assure you, this amendment is not the toxic monster it is \npurported to be by some of the environmental organizations and by this \nWhite House. It is not the toxic monster they purport it to be. In \nfact, this amendment puts into place in West Virginia--get this--this \namendment puts into place in West Virginia the tougher environmental \nstandards prescribed by the very MOUs that this administration's own \nEPA helped to negotiate. But you certainly would not know that from all \nof the frothing at the mouth by people who either have no idea what \nthey are talking about, or who, for some reason, are deliberately \ntrying to mislead the people of this country. They either have no idea \nof what they are talking about or they are deliberately and dishonestly \ntrying to mislead.\n  Those who have expressed opposition to this amendment, including the \nWhite House, claim it would harm\n\n[[Page S14783]]\n\nclean water protections under both the Clean Water Act and SMCRA. There \nis not a word--not a word--of that true, and they ought to know it, the \npeople who are saying it. As a matter of fact, as far as I am \nconcerned, they do know it. But they certainly ought to if they don't.\n  This amendment would not harm the Clean Water and the Surface Mining \nReclamation Acts, would not harm those protections. This amendment \nwould not lay a hand on those protections. It would not touch--not \ntouch them. It would not even brush up against them. This amendment \nspecifically states --now hear this, hear this Senators--this amendment \nspecifically states:\n\n       Nothing in this section modifies, supersedes, undermines, \n     displaces or amends any requirement of or regulation issued \n     under the Federal Water Pollution Act commonly known as the \n     Clean Water Act, or the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977.\n\n  What could be plainer? What could be clearer? What could give greater \nassurance than these words that are in the amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield to my friend, Senator McConnell. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the Senator from West Virginia is referring to the \nsentence in a letter from John Podesta, the Chief of Staff of the \nPresident, which says:\n\n       As you know, this is consistent with the President's \n     opposition to appropriation riders that would weaken or \n     undermine environmental protections under current law.\n\n  I say to my friend from West Virginia--I ask him, that is simply \nincorrect, isn't it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. They are not telling the truth, are they?\n  Mr. BYRD. They are not telling the truth.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. They either know it, in which case they are not \ntelling the truth, or they are woefully uninformed, aren't they?\n  Mr. BYRD. They either know they are not telling the truth or they are \nwoefully uninformed; exactly, preeminently precise.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The President came to Hazard, KY, this year, and he \nbit his lip, and he felt our pain. And he said: What can we do for you? \nI am here in Appalachia to find out what I can do for you, to make life \nbetter.\n  This is it, isn't it? I say to my friend from Virginia. This is what \nthey can do for us to make life better?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is it, that is it, and it has my fingerprints on it, \nand it has your fingerprints on it, may I say to my dear friend from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And we have 20,000, 15,000 coal miners jobs in \nKentucky, and 65,000 additional jobs that would not be there but for \ncoal. And the only impression we can get from this is, they don't care.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. What other impression could one get?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Because we have made it clear to them, haven't we, \nwhat this is all about? It does not change current law at all?\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not change current law at all. It doesn't touch \ncurrent law.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the White House has pressed for changes in \nthis amendment. The White House, according to Mr. Podesta's letter to \nthe Speaker and Mr. Podesta's letter to me, wants a ``time limited \nsolution.'' This amendment is limited to 2 years or to the completion \nof the ongoing Federal study which was ordered by a court in December \nof last year and the issuance of any regulations resulting from that \nstudy.\n  The White House argues that because the district court has stayed its \nruling, the jobs of thousands of miners in West Virginia and hundreds \nof thousands of workers in mining and related jobs on the east coast \nare no longer threatened. The White House is wrong.\n  The court, when it ordered the stay, said this stay has no legal \nbasis. In other words, he said: The only reason I am issuing this stay \nis to pour a little oil on troubled waters, let the waters calm down a \nlittle bit. All this chaos and confusion flows from my decision; I am \ngoing to put a stay on that. You can have a little time to get your \nbreath.\n  But he said there is no legal basis for it, which means that the \ncourt could lift the stay. When Congress gets out of town, who knows, \nthe court may lift that stay. The court itself, as I say, noted that \nthere is no legal basis for the stay, but, in fact, that the stay was \nissued in response to the uproar created by the court's ruling. That is \nwhy we have a stay.\n  The administration, whose representatives had been working with me on \nthe language of this amendment, said to me there is no need now for any \nlegislation. Do not believe it.\n  The White House argues that because the district court has stayed its \nruling, the jobs of thousands miners in West Virginia and hundreds of \nthousands of workers in mining and related jobs on the east coast are \nno longer threatened. The court could lift its stay. Let me say again, \nthe court itself noted that there was no legal basis for the stay.\n  We have no assurances as to how long that stay will remain in place. \nIt provides no comfort for coal miners. It provides no comfort for \nmining companies who want to invest in new mines to employ more miners \nthan their sons. It provides no comfort to others whose jobs rely on \ncoal, such as the trucking industry, the barge industry, the railroad \nindustry, the suppliers. To them, the stay is a stay. It is more like a \nweekend pass. That stay has placed a cloud of uncertainty, a cloud that \nhangs over the mining industry in West Virginia, a cloud that is \nsprouting long, gray tentacles that will stretch across the skies of \nother States.\n  I ask my colleagues and those who are watching--and I hope the White \nHouse is watching--just how many companies do you think are going to \nsign up to any real commitment of financial resources and invest the \nmillions of dollars that it takes to operate? How many of them are \ngoing to sign up with this stay hanging over their heads? Why would \nthey want to?\n  The permitting process was going along swimmingly before the judge's \ndecision. It was going along under the regulations that were agreed to \nand created by the White House's own regulatory agencies: the EPA, the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Interior Department through the \nOffice of Surface Mining. Fifty-nine of 62 pending permits could not be \napproved under that stay. There are 62 pending permits; 59 of these \ncould not be approved under that stay, according to the West Virginia \nDivision of Environmental Protection as of Monday of this week.\n\n  If this amendment is not adopted, there are those who will point to \nthis day and call it a victory for environmental protection, but those \nindividuals have not lifted a finger--they have not lifted a finger, \nhave not lifted the smallest finger--to help the many residents of \nAppalachia who do not have safe water piped into their modest homes for \ntheir little children to drink. They do not carry banners. They do not \ncarry banners and placards and write letters and lobby Congress about \nthe fact that those same streams they applaud themselves for protecting \nfrom rock and dirt are being polluted by the wastewater of communities \nthat are too poor to build sewage plants.\n  These head-in-the-clouds individuals peddle dreams of an idyllic life \namong old growth trees, but they seem to be ignorant of the fact that \nwithout the mines, jobs will disappear, the tables will go bare, the \ncupboards will be empty, schools will not have the revenue to teach the \nchildren, and towns will not have the income to provide even basics. \nBut what do they care? They will have already thrown down their \nplacards and their banners and gone off somewhere else.\n  These dreamers--I know, I have been down there. They have been \ncarrying their banners around some of the meetings that I have \naddressed. They might as well talk to the trees. I am speaking for the \ncoal miners. I lived in a coal miner's home. I grew up in a coal \nminer's home. I ate from a coal miner's table. I slept on a coal \nminer's bed. I lived under a coal miner's roof.\n  Loretta Lynn sings the song ``I'm a Coal Miner's Daughter.'' I \nmarried a coal miner's daughter more than 62 years ago. My wife's \nbrother died of\n\n[[Page S14784]]\n\npneumoconiosis. He died of black lung, contracted in the coal mines. \nAnd his father died under a slate fall--under a slate fall. He died in \nthe darkness. He died in the darkness.\n\n  Many times I have gone to the miners' bath house and pulled back the \ncanvas cover and peered into the face of a coal miner whom I knew and \nwho had been killed under a slate fall or killed by being run over by \nan electric motor.\n  Many times I have walked those steep hillsides and helped to carry \nthe heavy--and I mean heavy--coffins of miners who died following the \nedict of the Creator, when he drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of \nEden, saying: In the sweat of thy brow shall thou eat bread. And those \ncoal miners know what that means.\n  But this court ruling will take away the right of thousands of coal \nminers and truckers and railroad workers and barge operators to earn \ntheir bread in the sweat of their brow.\n  Hear me, coal miners! If you do not know now who your friends are, \nyou soon will know. These dreamers would have us believe that if only \nour mountains--if only our mountains--remain pristine, new jobs will \ncome. ``Or,'' they suggest, ``perhaps coalfields residents should \nsimply commute to other areas for employment.'' To these individuals I \nsay, ``Get real!''\n  Those of you in the White House, who have been working behind my back \non this amendment, go down there and talk to those coal miners. Tell \nthem what you have done.\n  You do not have to drive the dangerous, winding, narrow roads over \nwhich these workers would have to commute each morning and evening.\n  When the picket signs are gone, when the editorials in the big city \npapers are lining bird cages, the people of the small mining \ncommunities will be left. You will be gone. You have thrown down your \nbanners. You have thrown down your placards. You have thrown down your \ncandles. But those people of the small mining communities will still be \nthere. They will be left to repair the economic damage.\n  Mining will be part of the economic base of my State for the \nforeseeable future, and new ways must be explored to make mining \npractices more environmentally friendly. And I am for that. At the same \ntime, we have to recognize that the amount of coal reserves in West \nVirginia is finite. We must continue to broaden our State's economic \nbase. But such change cannot happen over night.\n  A new economic base cannot spring from the ocean foam. It cannot \nemanate from the brain of Jove, like Minerva, fully clothed and in \narmor. That effort requires time. And it requires money. And if you \nwant to know the worth of money, try to borrow some. It requires the \ndevelopment of improved infrastructure, better highways, more modern \nhighways, up-to-date highways, safer highways, like those Appalachian \ncorridors that I have been trying for years to build, and for which I \nhave been horse whipped orally and with the pen. I do not mind. I know \nfor whom I am working. I am working for the people of West Virginia, \nand always will as long as the Lord lets me stand.\n  Water and sewer systems, accessible health care, safe schools--these \nare the kinds of basic facilities and programs that I have been \npromoting for many years. I do not carry my banner today and throw it \ndown when the speech is over and go on somewhere else. Those coal \nminers are still there. And they are going to still have my attention, \nmy respect, my reverence.\n  In a letter threatening a veto of legislation containing this \namendment, the White House claimed to be prepared to discuss a solution \nthat would ensure that ``any adverse impacts on mining communities in \nWest Virginia are minimized.'' Well, talk is cheap. But any real \nsolution to minimize economic impact on these West Virginian \ncommunities won't be cheap.\n  Back in July, the President of the United States appeared in Hazard, \nKY, where he delivered an address to the people of Appalachia. \nAppalachia is my home. I was married there. Our first daughter was born \nthere. Our second daughter was born there. I went to school there. I \ngraduated from high school there in Appalachia.\n  The President of the United States expressed great sympathy for the \neconomic distress in these mountainous States. It was an uplifting \nspeech. He is very capable of giving uplifting speeches. It was a \nspeech that reached out to the human spirit and built great \nexpectations. Calling on corporate America to invest in rural America, \nPresident Clinton said: ``This is a time to bring more jobs and \ninvestment and hope to the areas of our country that have not fully \nparticipated in this economic recovery.'' And I say: Amen, brother! \nAmen.\n  I agree with that message. It is the right thing to do. We should be \nbringing jobs to Appalachia. We should be bringing new businesses, too. \nBut how can one peddle hope while undercutting the real jobs and \nbusinesses that do exist in Appalachia? If we don't act now, if the \ncourt lifts its stay, we will be back here a few months from now \nbattling this issue all over again. It may not just be West Virginia \nthen. It may be your own States, Senators. It may be your people, \nSenators. It may be your families.\n\n  There may be an appeal of the judges ruling, and that appeal may lead \nto a more equitable outcome. However, that appeal may simply maintain \nthe judge's decision and put us squarely back where we have been in \nrecent weeks, trying to address the matter Congressionally--trying to \nreaffirm well-established Congressional intent that has been followed \nfor the past 20 years while striving for improvements in the way mining \nis conducted.\n  In the meantime, with the scales tipped against them, mining families \nmust hold on to a crumbling ledge. The heel is poised above their \nfingertips, ready to mash down.\n  We have a pretty good idea who the opponents of this effort are. But \nwhat of the supporters? Let me tell you who is standing by us: The \nUnited Mine Workers of America; the National Mining Association; the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce; the Bituminous Coal Operators Association; \nthe AFL-CIO--hear that, White House, the AFL-CIO--the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers; the Association of American Railroads; \nthe United Transportation Union; the Norfolk Southern Railroad; CSX \nRailroad; the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; the International \nUnion of Operating Engineers; the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way \nEmployees; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; the Transport \nWorkers of America; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Utility Workers \nUnion of America; American Electric Power.\n  You see, the environmentalists sent a letter to the White House, and \nthey listed a few organizations that were supporting their opposition \nto this amendment. But listen to this list, too. This amendment has its \nfriends.\n  I continue with the reading of the list: the Southern States Energy \nBoard; the Southern Company; the United Steelworkers of America; the \nIndependent Steelworkers Union--it isn't just coal miners, you see; \nthese are brothers--the Laborers International Union of North America; \nthe American Truckers Association; the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters; the American Waterways Operators; the International Union of \nTransportation Communications; the American Federation of Teachers; the \nAmerican Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees--White House, it isn't just \nRobert Byrd and Mitch McConnell and Jay Rockefeller and Senator \nBunning, Pete Domenici, Larry Craig, and Phil Gramm, and the fine \nSenator who sits in the Chair, Pat Roberts. It isn't just these. It \nisn't just the House delegation, the three Members of the House from \nWest Virginia. These are not alone.\n  It is also the National Council of Senior Citizens.\n  These groups--representing millions of citizens--agree with us that a \nlegislative remedy is needed, and is needed now. They agree that there \nmust be a balanced approach. What this amendment does is simple. It \nestablishes a fair, moderate balance between jobs and the environment, \nwhile also providing for additional review and regulation once the \nenvironmental impact study is complete.\n  It is time to put aside whatever animosity exists between the coal \nmining industry and the environmental movement.\n  I am not much for making predictions, but I can make this one: the\n\n[[Page S14785]]\n\ncoming years will bring us more challenges like this, when the \nenvironment and the economy must be harmonized. Today is a test of our \nability to deal those challenges ahead.\n  This nation can put a man on the moon. Surely, we can adopt a \nsolution to this problem that protects the environment and protects \njobs of the coalfields.\n  This amendment seeks to go back to the regulations and the agreements \nthat made up the status quo ante before the judge's order--that is all \nwe ask--the status quo ante agreed upon by the administration's EPA, by \nthe administration's Army Corps of Engineers, by the administration's \nDepartment of the Interior, the Office of Surface Mining. That is what \nwe ask. And we ask not only for justice, but we ask also for mercy for \nthe coal miners and the other working people of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the cosponsors and sponsors \nof this amendment be printed in the Record, and they are as follows:\n  Senators Byrd, McConnell, Rockefeller, Bunning, Reid, Craig, Bryan, \nHatch, Bennett, Murkowski, Crapo, Enzi, Burns, and Kyl. I have not put \nforth any big effort to shop this around. I also add Senators Breaux, \nShelby, Gramm, and Grams, as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first thank my friend from West \nVirginia for his leadership on this extraordinarily important issue to \nmy State and to his and, for that matter, to all the people of \nAppalachia where coal is mined.\n  Thanks to my friend from West Virginia, I had a unique experience \nlast week. As the proud possessor of a zero rating from the AFL-CIO, I \nhad never been invited to a rally by the United Mine Workers of \nAmerica. Thanks to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, who I \nassume warned the crowd to say nice things or at least to refrain from \nthrowing anything, I joined him on the west front of the Capitol last \nTuesday and had an opportunity to watch Senator Byrd in action in a \ndifferent environment. I have seen him many times on the floor, always \npersuasive and always effective, but never before a rally largely of \nhis people and my people who make their livelihood mining coal.\n  I must say, it was a memorable experience. If I ever do my memoirs, I \nsay to my friend from West Virginia, that experience will be in it. We \nhave joined together today. And there are many others on this side of \nthe aisle, and I hope we will have some on that side of the aisle, who \nhave had enough of this administration declaring war on legal \nindustries engaged in an honest effort to keep the engines of this \ncountry moving forward. We have a number of Republican Senators from \nthe West, and they all informed us over the years about the war on the \nWest. Senator Domenici and Senator Craig have educated some of us \nsoutherners about the problems they have had. And I am pleased to say I \nhave supported them over the years, without exception, in their efforts \nto preserve those jobs in the mining industry out west.\n\n  Well, I would say the war on the West is moving east, and we are \nbeginning to feel the sting. Even though this amendment was generated \nby a very poorly reasoned district court decision in the Federal court \nin West Virginia, let me say that is just the beginning, as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia has pointed out; it is just the beginning.\n  All the Byrd-McConnell amendment seeks to do--not just for coal \nmining but for hard rock mining as well--is to restore us to the \nexisting law, at least with regard to coal mining, as the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia has pointed out. The letter from the White \nHouse, from Chief of Staff John Podesta to the President, either lies \nor is woefully ill informed.\n  It is clear to this Senator that the people downtown don't care what \nthe facts are. They don't care about the 20,000 coal miners in West \nVirginia and the 15,000 coal miners in Kentucky. They really don't \ncare. I don't think they have bothered to read the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia because, as he pointed out a few moments ago \nwith regard to coal mining, we are seeking to reestablish the status \nquo, agreed to and entered into by the most radical EPA in the history \nof the country. There is no question in my mind that whenever any \nenvironmental group in America hiccups, it is felt downtown. Anytime \nthey object to anything, the administration falls in line.\n  It has been fascinating to watch this issue develop because it pits \nthe environmentalists against the unions--truly a Hobson's choice for \nthe administration. When they had to pick a side between the \nenvironmentalists and the coal miners in West Virginia and in Kentucky, \nit is pretty clear whose side they chose. They don't care about these \njobs. They are not interested in reading this amendment. They really \ndon't care what is in the amendment. They are willing to sacrifice the \n20,000 coal-mining jobs in West Virginia and the 15,000 coal-mining \njobs in Kentucky in order to score points with a lot of \nenvironmentalists--who, I assume, enjoy having electricity all the time \nso they can read their reports--decrying the people who work in the \nindustry so important to our States. Clinton and Gore are determined to \nput the agenda of the fringe environmental groups and Presidential \npolitical concerns ahead of the needs of coal miners in Appalachia.\n  As I said earlier in a colloquy with the Senator from West Virginia, \nand as he referred to in his speech, the President came to Appalachia \nlast summer. He happened to have picked my State. He came to Hazard, \nKY. It was a large crowd. They were honored to have him there. The \nmayor of Hazard is still talking about it. It was one of the high \npoints of his life. The President looked out at the people in Hazard, \nmany of whom make a living in the coal mines, and he said, ``I am here \nto help you.''\n  Well, Mr. President, we need your help. I assume the whole idea \nbehind coming to Kentucky was not to increase unemployment. My \nrecollection of what that visit was about was how the Federal \nGovernment could actually produce new jobs for the mountains--something \na lot of people have talked about and few have been able to deliver. \nWell, we would like to have new jobs, Mr. President, but I can tell you \nthis: We would rather not lose any more of the few jobs we have \nremaining. That is not a step in the right direction.\n\n  We don't have as many coal jobs as we used to. The production is \nabout the same. The employment is much smaller. Every time there has \nbeen an improvement in the coal-mining industry--whether on top of the \nmountain or underneath the mountain--safety has gone up, and that is \nimportant. But employment has gone down. We are not yet ready to walk \naway from coal in this country. We have not built a new nuclear plant \nin 20 years and are not likely to build any more. These people are \nengaged in an indispensable activity. They would like to have a little \nsupport from down on Pennsylvania Avenue. Where is the compassion? \nWhere is the concern about these existing jobs in a critically \nimportant industry for our country?\n  Senator Byrd has really covered the subject, and there is not much I \ncould add, other than just to read once again what this amendment is \nabout. Nothing in our amendment modifies, supersedes, undermines, \ndisplaces, or amends any requirement of or regulation issued under the \nFederal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean \nWater Act, or the Surface Mining Act of 1977. So in response to this \noutrageous and ridiculous court decision, we have not proposed changing \nthe law. The judge, in his decision, has made it clear that he expects \nus to clear this up. He is inviting us to legislate. That is what we \nare hoping to do.\n  The EPA, the Office of Surface Mining, the Corps of Engineers, and \nother\n\n[[Page S14786]]\n\nrelevant agencies are in the process of conducting a thorough \nenvironmental impact study. At the conclusion of this process, if any \nof these agencies believe it is necessary, they may create new \nenvironmental regulations addressing the practice of mountaintop \nmining. Some might say that Senator Byrd and I and others are trying to \ndelay the inevitable. I argue just the opposite. I argue that, by \nmaintaining the status quo and allowing the EIS to move forward, you \nallow coal operators the ability to make the long-term plans essential \nto the viability of this industry.\n  So there are only two things you need to remember about our \namendment: No. 1, it doesn't alter the Clean Water Act. No. 2, it \ndoesn't alter the Surface Mining Act. It seeks to preserve the status \nquo.\n  I say to all of you who you are going to be down here asking us \nsomeday to help you save jobs in your State because of some outrageous \naction on the part of this administration--and some of you have done \nthat already--we need your help. We need your help. This is an \nextraordinarily important vote to our States. The honest, hard-working \npeople who make their living in the mines are under assault by this \nadministration, and we would like to call a halt to it. We hope we will \nhave your help in doing that.\n  Let me conclude by thanking again the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis extraordinary leadership on this important issue to his State and \nto my State and, frankly, we believe, to a whole lot of other States \nbecause the principle is very sound. We call on our colleagues from the \nWest--even those of us who have been voting with you over the years \nweren't quite sure what it was all about, but we have figured it out. \nThis whole thing is moving its way east. We need your help.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I forgot to mention the specific names of \ntwo Senators cosponsoring this amendment. The two are Nevada Senators, \nMr. Reid and Mr. Bryan. I wanted to mention their names for the Record.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from West Virginia \nhas included our two colleagues from the State of Nevada. Today, Nevada \nis probably the lead mining State in our Nation as it relates to the \nproduction of gold.\n  For the last hour you have heard probably some of the most eloquent \nstatements spoken on this floor on the issue of coal mining. The Byrd \namendment does not deal only with coal, although it is extremely \nimportant, and the public attention of the last week has been focused \non a judge's opinion about coal, coal mining in West Virginia, \nKentucky, Pennsylvania, and up and down the Appalachia chain of this \ncountry.\n  But the amendment also has something else in it that my colleague \nfrom West Virginia and I agreed to some time ago: When we talk on this \nfloor about mining, when we talk about the economy of mining, the \nenvironment of mining, and the jobs of mining, we would stand together; \nthat we would not allow our political differences to divide us. Because \nif you support the economy of this country, you have to stand together.\n  I am absolutely amazed that the Speaker of the House or the senior \nSenator from West Virginia would get a letter from the White House of \nthe kind to which both he and the Senator from Kentucky have referred. \nLying? I hope not. Uninformed? I doubt it. Here is the reason I doubt \ntheir lack of information.\n  For the last 7 years, this administration has been intent on changing \ncurrent mining law. I am referring primarily to the law of 1872. I am \nreferring primarily to hard-rock mining on public lands, because the \nlaws that the Senator from West Virginia referred to that were passed \nin 1977, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, have become \nlaw, and established the principles and the policies under which we \nwould mine the coal of America.\n  Then, on top of that, came the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, \nand the National Environmental Policy Act--all of them setting a \nframework and a standard under which we could mine the minerals and the \nresources of this country and assure our citizens it would be done in a \nsound environmental way.\n\n  As the laws of West Virginia, which are the laws of America, which \nare the laws this Senate passed, apply to coal mining, at least in the \ninstances of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, they, too, \napply to the mining of the west--to hard-rock mining, to gold mining, \nto silver mining, to lead and zinc mining, and to open-pit gravel \noperations of America.\n  Yet there is an attorney--not a judge, not an elected U.S. Senator, \nbut an attorney--who sits at a desk at the Department of Interior and \nupon his own volition 2 years ago decided he would rewrite the mining \nlaw of this country--a law that had been in place since 1872, tested in \nthe courts hundreds of times, and that in every instance one principle \nstood out and was upheld. That was the principle of mill sites and how \nthe operating agency, primarily the BLM, could, upon the request of a \nmining operation under a mining plan uniform with its processes, ask \nfor additional properties under which to operate its mine. \nConsistently, for over 100 years, the Federal agencies of this country \nhave granted those additional mill sites.\n  The attorney I am referring to, prior to his job with the Secretary \nof Interior, was an environmental activist. In the late 1980s, he wrote \na book. His book decried the tremendous environmental degradation that \nthe mining industries of America were putting upon this planet. In that \nbook, he said there is a simple way to bring the mining industry to its \nknees. ``If you can't pass laws to do it, you can do it through rule \nand regulation.'' Those are his words. He wrote it in the book, which \nwas well read across America.\n  When I asked that solicitor to come before the subcommittee I chair, \nwhich is the Mining Subcommittee, I quoted back to him his own words \nand said: If that is not what you said, then what are you doing now? He \ndidn't say yes, but he didn't say no. Here is what he did say. He said: \nI have reached out to every State director of every BLM operation in \nthis Nation, and I have asked them if the process I have overruled by \nmy decision is a process that has been well used by the agency. He said \nthey responded to him: Not so--very lightly used and only used in \nrecent years.\n  The tragedy of that statement is that it was a lie because the \nFreedom of Information Act shows that every State director wrote a \nletter to the solicitor a year before I asked him the question and \nevery State director of every State office of the Bureau of Land \nManagement said this is a practice in our manuals and has been used \nconsistently since the 1872 law was implemented.\n  What did solicitor John Leshy do before the Mining Subcommittee of \nthe Senate? He perjured himself. That is what he did. And the Freedom \nof Information Act shows that.\n  I would say to the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nKentucky, my guess is that the informational mind that wrote the letter \nthat John Podesta sent to you came from an agency that had already \nperjured itself before the U.S. Senate. I know that as fact. I give \nthat to you on my word and with my honor.\n  Therefore, in the Byrd-McConnell amendment is a provision that said: \nMr. Leshy, you cannot arbitrarily or capriciously overturn over 100 \nyears of mining law. That is not your job. You are a hired attorney. \nYou are not an\n\n[[Page S14787]]\n\nelected Senator or a President. That is our job--to change public \npolicy and to do it in a fair and sound environmental way.\n\n  We are all environmentalists. The senior Senator from West Virginia \nsaid it so clearly. I say what I mean. And we all know as politicians \nand public people that none of our colleagues have ever run on the \ndirty air or the dirty water platform. We are all proud of our \nenvironmental records. We want the air and the water to be clean.\n  But have you ever driven to the mountains of the west or the \nmountains of West Virginia? They are rugged and steep. We must craft \nunique policies and procedures to mine the wealth from underneath those \nmountains. It is a tough struggle. We know it. We have learned in the \nlast decades to do it in a much better way than our forebears. That is \ncalled good environmental policy and good stewardship.\n  Every one of us is an environmentalist. But we are not radical \npreservationists who would deny the thousands of working men and women \nin West Virginia and Kentucky no food for their table, no money in \ntheir pocket, or no education for their children. If you don't like the \nenvironment here, get in a car and drive down the road. To heck with \nyour job and to heck with you.\n  I understand the young person in urban America today sitting at his \nor her keyboard, working the high-tech economy of our country, saying \nto the Senator from Idaho, West Virginia, and Kentucky: What are you \ntalking about? Does it make much sense? We want a clean environment. \nSave the mountains of West Virginia, Idaho, Nevada, and Kentucky, and \nthe plains of Texas.\n  Let me say to that marvelous young American sitting at his or her \nkeyboard: As you touch that keyboard tonight, and it lights up for you \nand it energizes, it is the electricity generated by the coal of West \nVirginia that gave you the power to reach the Internet and to reach the \nstars beyond. That power surge through connections created of gold and \nsilver came from the mines of Idaho, from the mines of Nevada, and from \nthe Western States.\n  Please, America, broaden your vision of what it takes to make the \nleading economy of the world work so well.\n  It is our clean air, it is our clean water, and that we are proud of. \nBut 60 percent of America's electricity is generated out of the coal \nmines of America, and the connections that create the fluidity of the \nflow of that electricity so there is less restriction is the gold and \nthe silver of the West. That is what makes our country work so well. \nThat is what makes our country the cleanest country in the world.\n  Our leadership, our policy, our clean coal technology, our ability \nnot to tear up the Earth anymore--but when we do, we replace it, we \nreshape it, we change it--that is our law that causes it to happen. \nThat is the law that this Senate crafted. So, no, we cannot be extreme \nnor can we be radical. We have to offer balance and we will offer that \nin the context of the best environment we can create.\n  I will not forget, when I asked Alan Greenspan to come before the \nRepublican Policy Committee this spring to talk about surplus and how \nwe handle them, afterwards I said: Mr. Greenspan, you watch our economy \neveryday; why is it so good? Why is it literally pulling the rest of \nthe economy of the world with it? Last month, unemployment in this \ncountry was 4.1 percent; average wage, $13.39 an hour, the highest \naverage wage ever and the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years. And we \ndo it with the cleanest of the environments of the developed nations of \nthe world. Why do we do it? Mr. Greenspan said it well: We just know \nhow to do it better than anybody else. We know how to mine better than \nanybody else. We know how to create economies better than anybody else \nand, in almost every instance, we do it with the minimal form of \ngovernment regulation.\n  The Senator from West Virginia makes a very clear case. It isn't that \nWest Virginia was trying to do it better. They were. It is that this \nWhite House won't support this effort. They have not chosen to follow \nthe route of the environmental community. They have chosen to follow \nthe word of a few radical preservationists who would ask young \nAmericans to turn on their computers tonight to the light of a candle. \nIf it is the light of a candle that will lead this world, computers \nwill not turn on, the economy will not energize, and the men and women \nof West Virginia will go hungry.\n  I support the Senator from West Virginia because he supports mining, \nas I do. It is time our Senate and the House bring balance to this \nissue. I hope they support attaching this critical amendment to the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I note the presence of the Senator from Louisiana on \nthe floor. I inquire if the Senator wishes to speak at some point on \nthis subject.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I do wish to speak. I am happy to \nwait until the Senator has completed his remarks, if he could let me \nknow how long he will be.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will speak, then the Senator from Texas will \nspeak, and then I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Louisiana \nbe permitted to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my distinguished senior colleague who has \nbeen daunting and relentless in his pursuit of his amendment, which is \na very good amendment, an amendment which deserves to be passed.\n  What is fascinating to me has been said before by others. I will go \nback to the letter from John Podesta at the White House, the Chief of \nStaff to the President. He said that any solution that would undercut \nwater quality protection under the Clean Water Act, or under SMCRA, the \nSurface Mining Control and Recreation Act, simply is unacceptable, and \nthat the President's opposition to appropriations riders that would \nweaken or undermine environmental protections under current law would \nbe unacceptable.\n  I emphasize as strongly as I possibly can he is wrong in that \nstatement. The fact that he is wrong in that statement is of the utmost \nimportance to our colleagues if they or their staffs are listening as \nthey come to a decision about this amendment. If he were right, that \nwould be an entirely different matter. However, he is not right. To \nmake it perfectly clear, we have included that in the legislation that \nSenator Byrd and Senator McConnell put forward. I will read it again \nfor those who may not have been listening before: Nothing in this \nsection modifies, supersedes, undermines, displaces or amends any \nrequirement of or regulation issued under the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act or the Surface Mining Control Reclamation Act of 1977.\n  It would be law. It is the case, in any event. We added this not \nbecause we thought it would be fortuitous to add it, not because we \nneeded to add it, but because it was true at the outset. We did it to \nmake the point even clearer for those who would raise this point.\n  Senator Byrd made the points most clearly and most powerfully. This \namendment, on which we are asking for support, simply puts into law the \nmemorandum of understanding which I hold in my hand, which has been \nsigned off by the Environmental Protection Agency, by the Office of \nSurface Mining in the Department of Interior, and by the Corps of \nEngineers. The signatures are here--the signature from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, a very high senior official, the \nsignature from the Regional Director at the Office of Surface Mining, \nthe signature from the brigadier general of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, and the signature from an official in West Virginia.\n  The point is the Environmental Protection Agency has approved, and \nthe OSM and the Corps of Engineers have approved and given their \nofficial written stamp of approval in writing, right here. This equals \nthis amendment. There is no difference therein. I am not one who either \nbaits or ridicules the environmental movement nor do most of my \ncolleagues.\n  This country is constructed under the republican nature of its form \nof government as a system of checks and balances. I have a tremendous \ninterest in health care public policy. I spend a lot of time being \nupset with the Health Care Finance Administration called HCFA. There \nare people, obviously, who are upset by EPA. By and large, I\n\n[[Page S14788]]\n\nthink EPA tries to do within its own understanding the best job it can. \nBy and large, I think one of the reasons the environmental condition of \nour country is gradually improving, although slowly, is because some of \nthose people take positions which are not popular with members of this \nbody or the other body or with Governors or with the public. I do not \nridicule what they do.\n  However, I do think they know in their hearts that what Senator Byrd \nand Senator McConnell and some of the other Members are trying to do is \ncompletely consistent with the intent of Congress, in fact, in the case \nof SMCRA, for over the last 20 years.\n  Let me say this before I talk about the importance of mining in West \nVirginia and the problems of simply potentially eradicating coal \nmining--not just across West Virginia and Kentucky but, if this were to \nbe extended and this were to catch fire, eradicating the potential for \nthe 57 to 60 percent of electricity which is fueled by the use of coal \nacross this country--that there is a balance. I recognize, sometimes \nwhen people say that, people say that is a word they use to get out of \nthis situation or that situation. But this country has to run on a \nbalance. One cannot simply say to southern West Virginia, to central \nWest Virginia, to northern West Virginia, to other parts of our \ncountry: We are going to make these enormous changes, very radical in \ntheir content today because tomorrow will be a new day, because \ntransition in America somehow just simply happens, and we move from one \nsort of a core industry type of economy in West Virginia to a modern, \ntotally smokeless type of economy, and there does not need to be any \ninterruption. So we will come in and we will stop this business called \nmountaintop mining.\n  In the process of that, we are probably, unless this amendment is \nagreed to, going to stop much of the underground mining of West \nVirginia and Kentucky and the 13 to 16 States in this country that \nproduce coal because the effect under the law, under the judge's rule, \nsays this can happen.\n  I want my colleagues to understand something about my State of West \nVirginia. We are not on the coasts. We do not have the advantage of the \ntrade that flows to the Atlantic coast or the Pacific coast. We do not \nhave the advantage yet, entirely, of the access that comes from the \ninterstates that cut through our mountains and would allow us to become \npart of the flowing economy that so much of the rest of the Nation \nsimply takes for granted. But most importantly, let me say to my \ncolleagues, and let them hear this, please, with understanding: Only 4 \npercent of the land of West Virginia is flat. Only 4 percent of the \nlandmass of West Virginia is flat. All of the rest of it is going \nuphill or going downhill, either at great steepness, very great \nsteepness, or somewhat lesser steepness; it is not flat. Only 4 percent \nis flat.\n  Imagine, then, trying to construct an economy, an economy developing, \nmuch less the life of schools, the life of families, the life of \nrecreation, the life of a State, on 4 percent of the land and then \nmoving up the side of hills, where one can do that, and hoping the \nwinter will pass quickly because it is very hard to plow those roads. \nIt becomes a very difficult situation in the southern part of our \nState.\n  You cannot simply say we mine coal today and we do biotechnology and \ninformation technology tomorrow. You cannot walk across the Grand \nCanyon in one step.\n  Senator Byrd and the junior Senator from West Virginia, together, in \ndifferent ways, have been trying very aggressively, over the last \nnumber of years, to modernize the economy of West Virginia. We have \nbeen doing so with a respect for our basic industries--steel, \nchemicals, coal, wood, natural gas, et cetera--but also understanding \nthat the world is changing, that we are globalized. This Senator has \nspent the last 15 years making trips back and forth to various Asian \ncountries, trying to globalize the economy of West Virginia through \nreverse investment and through the increase of exports. Indeed, the \nincrease of exports in the last 5 years has gone up by 50 percent in \nWest Virginia. So we are making progress.\n\n  But we do not start from the base that so many other States have. So \nwhat happens in southern West Virginia if the Senate or the Congress \nturns its back on this amendment is something I would like people to \nthink about. We would lose approximately $2 billion in wages. Senator \nMcConnell, in his very good remarks, mentioned 4.1 percent of people \nare unemployed in this Nation. That is not true in the part of the \nState that we are talking about, in West Virginia. The counties I would \nmention would be six. In McDowell County there is over 14 percent \nunemployment today. The reason it is not higher is because so many of \nthe people who were there have left. If they had stayed there, the \nfigure would be much higher.\n  In Mingo County, which has a lot of coal reserves of very high \nquality--that is high Btu, low-sulfur-content coal--it is over 14 \npercent, over 14 percent. The national average is 4.1 percent--that is \nterrific, in Connecticut, Colorado, other places. I am proud of that, \nhappy for that. But in Mingo County it is 14 percent. In Boone County \nit is less than that; it is 13.9 percent. A lot of our low-sulfur, high \nBtu, highly desirable for the making of steel coal is produced in that \ncounty; Logan County, 13.5 percent; Lincoln County, almost 11 percent; \nWyoming County, almost 11 percent.\n  Can one understand what that means to me as a human being, much less \nas a U.S. Senator, when one struggles in land which is so steep, so \ndesperately steep, land which used to be, many millions of years ago, \nhigher than Mt. Everest? Because that is what the Appalachians were; \nthey were the tallest mountains in the world. Over these millions of \nyears, they have been ground down, but they have not been ground down \nto a level where economic activity is readily accessible. We cannot put \nthe great big highways so easily into that kind of terrain.\n  Senator Byrd has done a remarkable job in trying to do that. But not \nall those roads have been built, and only a couple of those have been \nbuilt in southern West Virginia because the cost per mile is so \nprohibitively high. Even if the Federal Government provides the money, \nthe State can't match it. So progress is slow.\n  I also want to say something that is very important to me personally. \nThis Surface Mining Act goes back to when I was Governor. The Senator \nfrom Idaho made those comments. I did not agree with everything the \nSenator from Idaho said, incidentally, about either the Environmental \nProtection Agency or other things, but I agree with the thrust on what \nhe wants to do with this amendment. But I was Governor of West Virginia \nat that time. We were faced with this question of what we were going to \ndo about surface mining and the Federal act.\n  I will say two things. One is that I have known for a long time, and \nI have been told by many people in and out of government, that a good \ndeal of the Federal act was based upon what it was that we were doing, \nwhat it was I was causing to happen as Governor in West Virginia, in \nthe way that surface mining was carried out. In other words, West \nVirginia, I will then say from that statement, has a higher level of \nrequirements of surface mining than do other States and higher, in \ngeneral terms, I might say, than the Federal Government.\n  But I also want to say Cecil Andrus, who is from the West and was \ntough--he was a tough Department of Interior Administrator, Secretary \nof the Interior--gave West Virginia something called primacy on surface \nmining.\n  All of this we are talking about--surface mining being the opposite \nof underground mining; anything that is not underground is surface; \nwhether it is mountain mining or surface mining, it is all up above the \nground--he gave us primacy. We were the first State in the Nation and \nthe only State for quite a period of time to receive primacy.\n  What he was saying by that is that you in West Virginia do your \nsurface mining reclamation so well that we are going to give you the \nauthority to go ahead, and we will back out of it completely; we have \nno jurisdiction anymore; you have jurisdiction unless you start to do \nthings which are wrong. Then we will take it back.\n  I was very proud of that. That caused me to have some of the views I \nhave today.\n  When we talk about not gutting the Clean Water Act or not gutting \nSMCRA, we in West Virginia cannot afford to gut, so to speak, those \nFederal\n\n[[Page S14789]]\n\nacts in a far more intense way than most other States because if we do, \nwe are hurt by them much more than other States because of the \nenormously mountainous, hilly nature of our State, with only 4 percent \nof it being flat. All the rest of it goes up or it goes down at one \nlevel or another. We have to respect the laws.\n  Mountain mining has changed a bit over the years in the sense that it \nhas gotten rather larger in the area it covers. Most of us in Congress \nunderstand that mountaintop mining in West Virginia is never going to \nbe the same. In fact, the congressional delegation in the House and the \nSenate wrote an article in the West Virginia papers in which we said it \nis true, it never is going to be the same.\n  It may be possible we cannot afford to have, as far as the mountains \nare concerned, these enormous areas that are mined all at once. But \nwhen somebody comes along and says, oh, you should do that, you should \nrestrict the size because you can't fill valleys, they are wrong. Under \nthe Federal law, they are wrong. The Federal law specifically provides \nfor that. I will not read it. I will simply hold it up. Here it is in \nSMCRA. It specifically provides for being able to do valley fill.\n  If the Federal judge who made this decision in West Virginia wants to \neliminate that--but then again, in his opinion recently, he said: \nNothing I am saying here is anything on the basis of merit; it is all \non the basis of saying we want a little peace and calm so that the \nFederal Government, the Congress, can litigate on this matter and \ndecide what needs to be done, which is why Senator Byrd, Senator \nMcConnell, and a number of us went ahead with this amendment.\n  We did have a system whereby the two sides--I do not even like to use \nthe words ``two sides''--the environmental community and the industrial \ncommunity, could come together and work together. We had a system in \nwhich one of the people who works with me spent 5 weeks in the coal \nfields working with the environmental people, working with the State \npeople, working with the mining people, working with the union people. \nThey came very close to almost a total agreement on what should be \ndone. There was only one area on which they could not reach final \nagreement. It was something called a buffer zone. They could have \nreached a final agreement. Then the Corps of Engineers came along and \nblew the whole thing out.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to understand there is a role and a place \nfor reason, compromise, balance, and sensible action in all of this. \nThis world is not divided between people who are strictly environmental \nin their purposes and people who are strictly for jobs in their \npurposes. There has to be that balance.\n  Global warming is a fact. I do not dispute the science. I look around \nme; I feel the temperature; I understand what is going on. On the other \nhand, at the same time I have those feelings in my bosom, having to \nspeak grown up as an adult, as a VISTA volunteer in the southern coal \nfields of West Virginia, that these people who are mining coal--the \ncoal miners Senator Byrd talks about so eloquently--are doing what they \nknow how to do and doing it the best way they possibly can.\n\n  If we are not able to get our amendment accepted, if the judge lifts \nthe stay, if his decree goes into effect, mining will more or less \ncease to exist in West Virginia because nobody will invest; nobody will \nsay: All right, let's just wait for a couple of years and then we will \ncome back and look at West Virginia. That will not happen. It will be \nmore or less the end of mining in West Virginia, not just in southern \nWest Virginia, but it will probably be all over West Virginia because \neverywhere there are effects of the judge's opinion.\n  We have to have both. We have to have a way for people to provide the \nelectricity the Senator from Idaho talked about to turn on those \ncomputers. We have to have a way to light up this Senate and to light \nup the homes of people all over America. As I indicated, 57 to 60 \npercent of all the electricity in this country is made by coal. It is \nnot made by nuclear power. It is not made, at this point, by natural \ngas. It is made by coal. It is a fact of life. Reasonable people \nunderstand that.\n  You cannot just obliterate that and pretend there are not going to be \nconsequences. Nobody wants economic devastation. I do not think any of \nour colleagues want economic devastation on the State of West Virginia. \nI do not think that is in their hearts; I do not think that is what is \nin their minds; but that is what is in the process of happening unless \nthis Byrd-McConnell amendment is, in fact, agreed to and becomes part \nof the national law. All it will do is put into law precisely what the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Office of Surface Mining, and the \nCorps of Engineers have officially signed off on as policy.\n  The stakes are tremendously high in West Virginia, and the stakes are \ntremendously high not only in Kentucky but all across this country. \nThis is kind of a watershed decision we are about to make. Are we going \nto find some kind of a compromise, a way of working things through, or \nare we going to deem each other to be enemies, one to another, one on \none side, one on the other--one environmentalist, who either feels or \nis deemed to feel they have no interest in jobs--which I doubt because \nenvironmentalists are people, too--or on the other side coal miners who \nthen turn on environmentalists as being totally hostile people. All \nthat does is degrade the content of public discussion and degrade the \npossibility of a reasonable resolution.\n  I hope very much this amendment will be adopted. I regret very much \nthe White House has been so difficult on this whole matter, having \ngiven their word to the senior Senator from West Virginia and then \nreversed it the next day, having given their word on matters of steel \nduring the course of a campaign in the northern part of our State and \nthen reversed their view on that. One almost wonders whether or not \nthere is an assault that is taking place on West Virginia.\n\n  But we are struggling. We know that along with two or three other \nStates, we have more economic problems than any other State in the \ncountry. We live with that. We live with that every day. We try our \nvery best. Senator Byrd, and this Senator, and our congressional \ndelegation, try our very best every single day to try to improve the \neconomic situation of our State, bringing in new industry that does not \ncreate any kind of pollution or industries that are entirely smokeless \nand entirely of a new order. But it cannot be done, as Senator Byrd \nsaid, overnight.\n  So you cannot have a crashing decision which descends on the good \npeople of southern West Virginia and northern West Virginia that \ndeprives them not only of their self-respect but of their ability to \neat, to get medical care, or to exist as human beings.\n  We have not distinguished ourselves in this country in taking men or \nwomen in their 40s or 50s or 60s, and saying: All right. You are \nfinished as a coal miner. Now we are going to train you to do something \nelse. We talk about it all the time, but we do not do it. We do not \nknow how to do it. The Canadians do; we do not.\n  So to banish people into oblivion is not something which is common \nwith the practices of the soul of America, any part of the soul of \nAmerica, or any part of the soul of this body. That is what would \nhappen, however, were this amendment to fail.\n  I commend to my colleagues the integrity of the Byrd-McConnell \namendment; I commend to my colleagues the honesty and the environmental \nsoundness of the Byrd-McConnell amendment; and I commend to my \ncolleagues the enormous crisis which potentially will take place if it \nfails because, as has been said, what starts in West Virginia--because \nthis has now been picked up by the national movement--will move from \nState, to State, to State, to State.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would my distinguished colleague briefly \nyield for a comment in connection with something he said?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I certainly will.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when I went up to Rhode Island on Saturday, \na few weeks ago, to attend the funeral services of the late Rhode \nIsland Senator John Chafee, the national press people--the Washington \nPost, the New York Times--who were right on that plane indicated that \nthe administration was supportive of that amendment. That was on \nSaturday.\n  I had run the language by the administration's representatives, who \ncome\n\n[[Page S14790]]\n\nto this hill often. I hoped the administration would support the \nlanguage. So I was quietly running the language to the administration \nand certainly getting the support of the administration--if not openly, \nat least they were not opposed to it. We were working with them \ntacitly.\n  The very next day the tune changed, and the newspapers announced the \nadministration was against the Byrd amendment. So they flip-flopped \nover night; they made a 180-degree turn over night. One day I had the \nconfidence of them. They were looking at the language, making any \nresponses they wished to make to express their viewpoint. The next day \nthey were 100 percent on the other side.\n  So I say this amendment is a test. I say to the working men and women \nof America, do not believe the pretty words you may hear. Pretty words \nare easy. And I have heard pretty words myself. Watch what happens with \nthis amendment, I say to the working men and women of America. Watch \nwhat happens to this amendment. See if the actions of those who say \nthey are your friend do match those pretty promises.\n  I thank my distinguished friend and colleague. I am pleased to \nassociate myself with his remarks. Well done, my friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my senior colleague and I yield the floor, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14790-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SOMETHING IS OUT OF BALANCE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is easy when you come to work every day \nin the most historic and important building in the world to forget you \nare part of history--to forget you are in a sacred place where history \nhas been made in the past. But it is even easier to forget you are \nmaking history now.\n  But I am reminded that we are making history now when I listen to \nSenator Byrd speak with righteousness on behalf of the working people \nof West Virginia. And might I also say, I have never heard a more \neloquent speech in the Senate than Senator Craig's speech that he gave \nearlier.\n  Having heard those speeches--including Senator McConnell's and \nSenator Rockefeller's--I do not want to rise to talk about the \nsubstance. I do not think you can improve on what they had to say. But \nthere is an important point, at least in my mind, that I want to make; \nand that is, something is wrong in America. Something is out of balance \nin America.\n  If tomorrow in West Virginia a sub-species of crickets develop that \nhave legs 6 millimeters longer than crickets as we know them, or that \nhave brown or white specks on them, they would be protected before the \nlaw. They would be protected by the Endangered Species Act. There would \nliterally be thousands of people who would be willing to troop to West \nVirginia and hold signs and demand that this new sub-species of \ncrickets be protected.\n  But yet when the livelihood of people who hear that alarm ring at \n4:30 a.m. in the morning--and if you grew up in one of those houses--I \nknow Senator Byrd did--the next sound you would hear is those two feet \nhitting the floor. It is predictable. You know what is going to happen, \nwhether it is raining or whether it is not raining. These are people \nwho get up every day, who work hard, who struggle to make ends meet, \nwho sit down around the kitchen table on the first day of the month and \nget out that stub they got with their paycheck. Then they take the back \nof an envelope, or a piece of paper, and they try to figure out how \nthey are going to be able to pay their bills, and who they can get by \nwithout paying this month. They contribute to America by producing \nthings America needs.\n  I think something is out of kilter in America when our laws are more \nfocused on protecting sub-species of crickets than they are focused on \nprotecting people who earn a living with the sweat of their brow and \nwith their hands.\n  I think something is very wrong in America when there does not seem \nto be much focus on working men and women. And what was moving to me \nabout Senator Byrd's speech is he was speaking on behalf of the people \nwho work with their hands, and who work for a living, and who often do \nnot have much of a voice in American Government.\n  I am not here to criticize people who have focused, in some cases, \ntheir lives, their civic activity, and their leisure time activity on \nthe environment. But I think something is wrong when, in focusing on \nthe environment, we forget about people who work for a living and are \naffected.\n  I think, in some cases, environmentalism has gone too far. I think, \nin some cases, that it has become anti-growth. Maybe that makes sense \nif you live in a fancy air-conditioned house and if your children have \ngone to college. If you have boundless opportunities, it makes sense to \nsay we need to protect the environment at all costs and that there is \nno burden that is too great to bear. After all, the person saying that \nalready has a piece of the American pie and has already generally lived \nthe American dream.\n  But I think what Senator Byrd has reminded us of is that not every \nAmerican has lived the American dream. Not every American has gotten a \npiece of the pie.\n  I think when we have focused so much on a sub-species of crickets, it \nis about time that people in the Senate stand up and say: What about \npeople who make a living in the mining industries of this country--\npeople who have had placed on their livelihood less weight by American \nlaw than we place on the assumed well-being of subspecies of crickets? \nI think something is out of balance in America. I think we need to \nbring it back into balance. I think we need to remind people who are so \nconcerned about one particular element of the environment that there is \nno more basic part of the environment than the ability of the people in \nWest Virginia, or Kentucky, or Texas, or any other State in the Union \nto make their house payment, or their ability to earn a livelihood, or \ntheir ability to have self-respect in their own worth of what they do.\n  We are not talking about tearing down America's environmental laws. \nNo country in history has a better environment than we have. No country \nhas spent more resources and legitimate effort on their environment \nthan we have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14790-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14790-S14791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nshall not--there are some of us who would like to speak on this debate \nconcerning this particular issue and who have been waiting for a while. \nCould we get some sequence of order perhaps?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Landrieu is \nto follow, and Senator Kohl is to follow Senator Landrieu. There is no \nUC. Senator Landrieu was the last covered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. As far as I am aware, we have gone back and forth from the \nDemocrat side to the Republican side. I have listened to five other \npeople speak. I have been well served by hearing their speeches. I will \nbe as brief as I can.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be in \norder of sequence on the Democratic side as we move back and forth.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if we could \nsimply accommodate every speaker, while realizing that we are waiting \nfor the omnibus bill to come over from the House, may I suggest we \namend that unanimous consent request so that the Senator be recognized \nin the order of the sequence we have, but that when the omnibus bill \ncomes over from the House, it continue to take precedence?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding the Senator appropriately asked for \nan extension until 6. It is my understanding the Senator from Louisiana \nwants to speak for only 10 minutes, or less. The Senator from Minnesota \nwants 5 minutes. I think if we could get an order, we could contain it \nwithin the time and everybody would be satisfied. I ask the Senator \nfrom Alaska how long he wants to speak.\n\n[[Page S14791]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In responding to my friend from Massachusetts, about 6 \nminutes. I am satisfied if we go back and forth, as suggested, it would \nconcur with the unanimous consent agreement pending.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that following the Senator from \nTexas, the Senator from Louisiana be recognized for 10 minutes; \nfollowing that, the Senator from Alaska be recognized for 5 minutes; \nthe Senator from Minnesota for 5 minutes; and I would like to follow \nthe Senator from Minnesota for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT.

To clarify that, when the District of Columbia \nappropriations conference report and its parts arrive, that will be \ntaken up at that point regardless of the order. But then, of course, \nwhen that is completed, we can go back to this order.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, may I ask the distinguished majority \nleader: I think we have such a tight containment here, there are some \nwho have some problems off the floor. So it may be that he would be \nheld up by about 5 minutes, I think, in total.\n  Mr. LOTT. If it is something like that, it should not be a problem. \nBut they are voting in the House at this time, so the papers will be \nheaded this way. Rather than holding up the debate getting started, I \nthink with the order we have lined up, we should be all right. I think \nwe could extend the colloquy to the point where we couldn't do the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the majority leader then permit us to put in place \nthe request we have made?\n  Mr. LOTT. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is obvious that there are a lot of \npeople who want to speak. Let me sum up by saying that in an era where \nI think we have gotten Government out of balance, where extremist \nelements are determined to impose their will and their values--often at \nthe expense of the jobs of people who work with their hands and who, in \nthe process, contribute to America--when we become callous to the needs \nof working people by catering to people who are often quite well off \nand quite successful and quite comfortable, who, in some cases, would \nput their interests and their hobbies ahead of working people, it is \nvery important that we have someone such as Senator Byrd who pulls us \nback to reality.\n  I think Senator Byrd mentioned my name as a cosponsor. But just in \ncase he did not, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am proud to support this amendment. I think the \nadministration has become dominated by people who are more concerned \nabout specific elements of the environment, as they define it, than \nthey are concerned about the environment based on good science. I think \nthey are more concerned about their values than the well-being of the \npeople who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in America.\n  It is easy for a planner or an idealist to set out a policy and act \nas if destroying the livelihood of a coal miner is as irrelevant as \nsimply overturning a regulation. But we know the difference between a \nregulation and the livelihood of a coal miner. It is because we know \nthe difference that we are here.\n  I hope this amendment passes. I hope it sends a clear signal that the \nClinton administration has become an extremist administration in terms \nof the environment. This is a bipartisan effort. I think it is \nimportant. I think it pulls us back to the center in recognizing we \nwant a better environment. But we want to look at costs and benefits. \nWe want to look at science. When we are putting thousands of people out \nof work, we ought to stop and reflect on what we are doing. Senator \nByrd is asking us to do that today. I am proud to join him in this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am appreciative of the 10 minutes \ngranted to speak on a different subject. I understand that mining is an \nimportant issue and deserves our attention. Until it is resolved, we \nwill probably be working for many days. I know that the Senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia feels very passionately about this issue, and other \nMembers may want to add their remarks as the evening goes on, so I will \ntry to be brief.\n  A week from tomorrow, many of us will head home to be with our \nfamilies and celebrate Thanksgiving. In my mind, it is extremely \nappropriate that Thanksgiving falls in this month, which many of you \nknow is National Adoption Month. For like Thanksgiving, National \nAdoption Month is a time not only for celebration but also for \nreflection.\n  So let me begin with some facts about adoption that people may find \ninteresting in hopes that this would be something the American people \nwill embrace. In 1992, the last year for which adoption statistics were \navailable, there were 127,000 children adopted in the United States. \nForty-two percent of these children were adopted by step parents or \nrelatives; 15 percent of these adoptions were from foster care; 5 \npercent adopted children from other countries; and 37 percent of these \nchildren were adopted by private agencies.\n  The poster behind me is a collage of just a few of the 130,000 \nlegally freed children awaiting permanent families. Some of them are \nonly children and some are sibling groups, some are younger children \nsome are older. Although they are all different, all of these beautiful \nchildren are looking for someone to love and care for them and to make \nthem a part of their home.\n  The fact remains that there are half a million children in foster \ncare. By way of comparison, allow me to refer to a hometown landmark, \nthe Superdome. The Superdome has hosted several superbowls--the Saints \nhave never been to one there, but other teams have. We can seat about \n80,000 people in the Superdome. To get an accurate vision of the number \nof children, picture 5 superdomes filled with children, one in every \nseat. That is a lot of children--if you think about one in each seat in \nfive Superdomes--in need of homes in America.\n  The average age of children in foster care is 9.5 years. The problem \nis many children spend the average of 3 years in foster care. Three \nyears is too long to live without the love and security of a permanent \nfamily. We need to shorten that time. If a child has to be removed from \ntheir biological parents because of terrible, unfortunate \ncircumstances, they should spend a short time in foster care and then \nbe placed permanently with a loving family. Seventy percent of the \nchildren available for adoption and foster care are under the age of \n10. They should not spend their tender years without a home.\n  True, we are making progress and we should be proud. In 1996, 28,000 \nchildren in foster care were placed in permanent homes. It is projected \nthat, in 1999, the number will be 36,000, an increase of about 30 \npercent.\n  In celebration of those who made this progress possible, the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption instituted a wonderful idea that we \nhope will go on year after year, The Congressional Angels In Adoption. \nWe asked all of our colleagues to send in recommendations for \nindividuals in their respective States and districts who had done \nsomething extraordinary in the area of adoption. I would like to submit \nfor the Record a list of the 55 families who have been nominated and \nselected for the first 1999 Angels In Adoption Awards.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        1999 Angels in Adoption\n\n       Freddie Mac Foundation, Virginia, Nancy Kleingartner, \n     Bismarck, North Dakota, Jeff and Earletta Morris, \n     Marshalltown, Iowa, Earl and Judy Priest, Caldwell, Idaho, \n     Dave Thomas, Dublin, Ohio, Peter and Mary Myers, Sikeston, \n     Missouri, James and Denise Jones, Grand Rapids, Michigan, \n     Fletcher Thompson & Jim Thompson, Spartanburg, South \n     Carolina, Carol McMahon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Lori and \n     Willie Johnson, Russellville, Arkansas, Candice Mueller, \n     Ewing, New Jersey, Joan McLaughlin, Morristown, New Jersey, \n     Carol Stoudt, Fargo, North Dakota, Bill and Laura Trickey, \n     Kansas City,\n\n[[Page S14792]]\n\n     Missouri, Tom and Debbie Ritter, Warrentown, Missouri, Debbie \n     Breden, O'Fallon, Missouri, Senator Gordon and Sharon Smith, \n     Hope Marindin, Chevy Chase, Maryland, Doreen Moreira, Cabin \n     John, Maryland, Sky Westerlund, of Lawrence, Kansas.\n       Doug and Mary Spangler, Kansas City, Vivian Robinson, \n     Harrisburg, Illinois, Reverend George Coates, Eldorado, \n     Illinois, Ms. Gloria King of Oakland, California, Becky and \n     Mike Dornoff, Williamsburg, Michigan, Steve and Cherie \n     Karban, Rapid River, Michigan, James L. Gritter, Traverse \n     City, Michigan, Ms. Sidney Duncan, Detroit, Michigan, Anne \n     Pierson, Lancaster, Philadelphia, Jane Sarnes, Lexington, \n     Nebraska, Peggy Soule, Rochester, New York, Laurence and Jane \n     Leach, Raleigh County, West Virginia, Judge Gary Johnson, \n     West Virginia, Hays and Gay Town of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, \n     David and Jane Zatz Redmond, Washington, Dennis and Shirley \n     Smithson, Nashville, Tennessee, Anne Desiderio, Albuquerque, \n     New Mexico, Francis Ann Mobley, Daytona Beach, Florida, Kurt \n     and Stacy Stahl, Lake Oswego, Oregon, Sallie Olson, Lake \n     Oswego, Oregon.\n       Ruth Ann Gaines, Des Moines, Iowa, Larry and Jackie Bebo, \n     Berthoud, Colorado, Gary Cerkvenik and Kim Stokes, Britt, \n     Minnesota, Aimee Oullette, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Bill and \n     Brenda Baker, Redfield, South Dakota, Richard and Karen \n     Butler, Faith, South Dakota, Reverend Ed and Diane \n     Nesseslhuf, Vermillion, South Dakota, Debbie Hoffman, Sioux \n     Falls, South Dakota, Melvina and Louie Winters, Pine Ridge, \n     South Dakota, Geraldine Bluebird, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, \n     Scott and Val Parsley, Madison, South Dakota, Mrs. Brenda \n     Edusei, Bedford, New Hampshire, Debra Klopert, St. Louis, \n     Missouri, Jessica Dennis of Rosedale, New York.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Here are some examples from around the country. I will \nread into the Record just a few. First of all, the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption has recognized the Freddie Mac Foundation of \nVirginia, nominated because of countless contributions to the promotion \nof adoption. In this year alone, Freddie Mac has donated millions of \ndollars to help fund programs for adoption and foster care. Their \ncommitment and dedication demonstrates their unique understanding that \nthere is more to a home than four walls. We thank the Freddie Mac \nFoundation for their effort.\n  I will read a few more brief entries to give an example of some of \nthe people that were honored. My friend, the Senior Senator from \nArkansas, submitted a family from Russellville, Arkansas, Lori and \nWillie Johnson. In an increasingly self-absorbed world, Lori and Willie \nJohnson remind those around them of the meaning of the word \n``selfless.'' They are the proud parents of 17 children, 13 of whom are \nadopted and have special needs. Because of their love and dedication, \nthese children have a family to call their own.\n  From Spartanburg, South Carolina, we have selected Fletcher Thompson \nand Jim Thompson, nominated by our colleague in the House, James \nDemint. Having practiced adoption for over 25 years, they are rightly \nconsidered adoption experts. They place over 100 children a year. They \npractice law in a way that helps build families and brings hope to \nchildren and joy to parents. We thank them for their great work.\n  I would also like to mention, the Angel from Idaho--since the Senior \nSenator from that State was on the floor earlier speaking about the \nimportant mining issue,--as Co-chair of the Congressional Coalition he \nnominated Earl and Judy Priest from Caldwell, Idaho. For over 25 years, \nthe Priests have opened their hearts and home to children of all ages \nand abilities. They are parents of five children, three of whom are \nadopted. In addition, they have fostered 160 other children.\n  Hays and Gay Town, from my own home State of Louisiana, founded and \npersonally funded an agency that has placed over 200 children. They \nhave also reached out to help young mothers in crisis.\n  There are many examples, from California to New York to Louisiana to \nMichigan. There have been examples of judges, attorneys, parents who \nhave adopted children, advocates in the community, agencies, who are \nreally contributing to making our goal of finding a home for every \nchild in America and the world a reality.\n  In closing, I would like to remind my colleagues, of several pieces \nof pending legislation concerning adoption. First, we look forward to \npassing, with Senator Helms' and Senator Biden's leadership, the Hague \nConvention on Intercountry Adoption. This treaty will, for the first \ntime, lay out a framework for international adoption. Mr. Chairman, as \na lawyer and a former prosecutor, you most certainly know the \nimportance of laying out a legal framework to prevent fraud and abuse, \nreduce costs and make the process easier for families adopting abroad. \nTogether with Senator Abraham, I have introduced the Adoption Awareness \nAct to fund a nationwide campaign promoting adoption. Through this \ncampaign, we hope to encourage potential adoptive parents to open their \nhomes to a waiting child.\n  Finally, we hope to be able to increase the present adoption tax \ncredit from $5,000 to $10,000.\n  As you can see, there is a lot of work we have to do when we come \nback. I want to take this opportunity, once again, to recognize all of \nour ``Angels in Adoption,'' and to thank my colleagues for all the good \nwork they have done on this issue. I look forward to working with them \nwhen we return to make the reality of a permanent and loving home real \nfor so many children who need it.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14792-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14792-S14793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BYRD-McCONNELL MINING AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we all owe a tremendous debt of \ngratitude to the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  What we have now is a situation concerning mining in the U.S. where a \ncrucial decision is either going to be made to maintain an atmosphere \nwhere mining can continue or through the prevailing attitude within the \nClinton administration to simply drive this industry offshore.\n  The Clinton administration, by its actions, evidently opposes the \nworking people of America who are involved in mining.\n  Those opposing Senator Byrd's proposal basically are destroying the \nentire coal industry which exists west of the Mississippi--the mine \nworkers whose jobs depend on that industry, the railroad workers, the \nbarge men, and the truck drivers.\n  I think it is important to note that Senator Byrd's amendment directs \nthe application of the Clean Water Act to be returned to the way it was \nat the beginning of October of this year.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment does not change the law. It does not change \nany practice that has been followed over the years. It is our job to \nchange the law--not the White House and not the courts.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment gives the Congress and the Federal agencies \ntime to apply existing law without destroying the coal mining industry \nof this country--time to apply the law, or make such adjustments that \nare necessary in a way that protects the environment, the coal mining \nindustry, and all those who depend upon that industry for their well-\nbeing.\n  We are looking for a balance. The administration's proposal throws \nthis out of balance.\n  The amendment goes further. There are two additional issues involved.\n  One deals with the recent Solicitor's opinion that would throw out \n127 years of precedent on the size of mill sites--only 5 acres per \nclaim, if followed through with, this would make mining on public lands \nabsolutely impossible.\n  I do not know how many Members have an idea about what it takes to \nmake up a mine. The mine needs a mill site, grinding and crushing \nfacilities, shops, processing plants, tailings disposal, headquarters, \na water plant, parking lots, and roads. This simply cannot fit on the \nspace provided within the 5-acre mill site per claim. It simply can't \nbe done. This is how they propose to eliminate mining. In my State of \nAlaska, we would not have a new mine developed, nor could we.\n  You are depriving us and this country the right to produce minerals \nfrom the rich resources we have.\n  Make no mistake; the Solicitor wrote the opinion to end mining in the \nWest, to drive mining offshore, to drive the jobs offshore, and to \ndrive the dollars offshore.\n  The provision in this amendment would allow mining operations that \nhave been submitting plans prior to a recent Solicitor's opinion to \ncontinue under the law and the precedent that was relied on the \ndeveloped plan.\n\n[[Page S14793]]\n\n  The second issue is also a simple provision that would require the \nadministration to follow sound science for a change--not emotion.\n  The provision would limit the ability of the Secretary of the \nInterior to propose new hard rock mining regulations for those areas \nwhere the National Academy of Science found that there were \ndeficiencies. Why not give science a chance instead of emotion?\n\n  Finally, the National Academy of Science found that State and current \nFederal regulations on hard rock mining sufficiently protected the \nenvironment and needed only a few changes to bring it up to current \nstandards.\n  What is wrong with the objective of the National Academy of Science?\n  There are two simple provisions: One that provides fundamental \nfairness by allowing companies that have relied on 127 years of \ninterpretation to continue while the courts sort out whether this new \ninterpretation is legal; and one that requires the administration to \nfollow and comply with sound science.\n  We are calling for fundamental fairness and sound science. But the \nWhite House, in its single-minded determination to end the domestic \nmining industry, seems to have denied us both.\n  I certainly appreciate the support of the senior Senator from West \nVirginia. He has a sympathy and an understanding for the needs of the \nmining industry.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen these differences of opinion between the \nWest and the East. But we certainly now have a common interest.\n  There is going to be little for the domestic mining industry to \ncelebrate this Thanksgiving.\n  The White House, to serve its environmental constituency and the \naspirations of, I guess, the Vice President, has abandoned the call for \nsound science. They are appealing to emotion.\n  We need fairness. We need to meet the needs of the men and women who \nlabor in our mines.\n  This Nation will pay the price as coal mines in West Virginia, mining \nsites throughout the West, and in my State of Alaska close. Good, \nhonest jobs that built this Nation will be lost. Union and nonunion \nworkers will join the bread line that this administration will leave as \nits legacy for the mining industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank the President for his patience and perseverance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is that Senator Kohl \nwas seeking recognition. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kohl be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes after Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak with some mixed feelings \nbecause I have heard several of my colleagues, and I specifically want \nto talk about the remarks of Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller for \nwhom I have a tremendous amount of respect. I know when they speak \nabout miners, they speak from their hearts, and they speak from their \nsouls.\n  I haven't looked at the specific wording of the amendment. But I want \nto raise some questions, if this amendment comes to a vote. I will look \nat the amendment and then decide.\n  But I think I heard some of my colleagues trivialize this question. \nJust looking at it from another very important point of view, I can say \nthat I have spent a considerable amount of time in eastern Kentucky. \nThat is where my wife's family is from. I spent some time years ago \nwith an organization called ``Save Our Cumberland Mountains'' in east \nTennessee.\n  When my colleagues come to the floor and talk about this as saving \nsome exotic species, they are not talking about what I have seen with \nstrip mining. What I have seen with strip mining in east Tennessee and \neast Kentucky is a situation where, first of all, the coal mining \ncompanies came to the region and took an awful lot of the wealth, and \nthen they left an awful lot of the people poor.\n\n  But one of the things people had was their streams, rivers, and their \ncreeks. They had the outdoors, and the land that they loved.\n  I want to say to my colleagues that when you take the tops off these \nmountains with the strip mining as opposed to deep mining, and you let \nthe left-over rock and earth get dumped into the adjacent valleys and \nbury or pollute streams, it raises a big question.\n  Again, I say, in deference to my colleagues, that I know what they \nare saying. We will have a chance to analyze this and then decide how \nto vote.\n  But I do not believe this is a trivial question at all. I have seen \ncommunities ravaged by this strip mining. I have seen courageous people \nwho have lived in the mountains their whole lives speak up. So I want \nto speak up by raising this question on the floor of the Senate.\n  I also want to say to my colleague, Senator Byrd--and others--who, as \nI said, from his heart cares about the miners, that when I hear some of \nmy colleagues talk about the miners, I hope there will be equal concern \nfor the miners in east Kentucky when they don't have the unions. Right \nnow, they can't see 6 inches in front of them because of the coal dust \nlevel. I hope we will have the concern for the health and safety of the \nminers. When I hear speakers on the floor, I hope we will have the \nconcern on raising wages; I hope we will have concern for civilized \nworking conditions; and I hope we will have a concern for the right of \nminers and other people to be able to organize and bargain \ncollectively.\n  When I hear about the President's trip to Hazard, KY, where is the \nconcern for poverty? I hope we will also see the same kind of \ncommitment to health care, to education, to affordable child care, to \neconomic development, and all of the rest.\n  It is a little bit too much to hear some colleagues frame this debate \nin these terms given this broader context.\n  It is a difficult question. I said to Senator Byrd earlier I have not \nlooked at the specific amendment yet. I will do that. But I don't want \nany Senator to come to the floor and act as if there isn't some \nquestion--again, the Senator can clear this up for me--as to whether or \nnot, given section 404 of the Clean Water Act, we are or are not \ncreating a loophole. That is a terribly important question for me to \nresolve before a final vote on the issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator has mentioned my name. The word \n``waste'' has been used. The newspapers have repeatedly used the word \n``waste,'' saying this amendment that I am sponsoring is to let coal \ncompanies continue to dump their waste into the streams.\n  As to the use of the term ``waste,'' the Clean Water Act, section \n404, governs the disposal of ``dredged and fill'' materials into waters \nof the United States. Excess material from coal mines has always been \nregulated in this fashion as ``dredged and fill'' material under \nsection 404 of the Clean Water Act.\n  Judge Hayden in West Virginia, however, determined that excess \nmaterial from coal mines is ``waste'' and, as such, could not be \ndisposed of in valley fills.\n  For 20 years, the stream buffer zone regulation has not been \ninterpreted as preventing the disposal of excess material from coal \nmines into streams. Rather, Congress relied on the Clean Water Act to \ngovern this activity.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  I ask unanimous consent Mr. Shelby be added as a cosponsor to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Minnesota has \nexpired. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14793-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14793-S14794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GRATITUDE TO JEANETTE BOONE SMITH\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to share with all of my colleagues, \nparticularly with the citizens of Massachusetts, the deepest sense of \nappreciation I have for the longest serving member of my staff, someone \nI have been privileged to have work with me since I entered elective \noffice in 1982. Jeanette Boone Smith is leaving my staff after serving \nall of that time, since 1982, both in the Lieutenant Governor's Office \nof Massachusetts and in\n\n[[Page S14794]]\n\nthe Senate. Throughout those years, Jeanette has symbolized the values \nand the priorities I have tried to represent in the Senate. I am, \nindeed, extraordinarily fortunate to have had her friendship and her \ncounsel throughout my public life.\n  Jeanette embodies the fight for equality and for social justice that \ndefines the entire second half of this century. Her life is filled with \nstories of personal struggle, public struggle, and of triumph, of \nsacrifice, and of victory. She was born in Englewood, NJ, and she \nremained in that State throughout young adulthood. For Jeanette, public \nservice and political action came very early. She became president of \nEnglewood's Fourth Ward Democratic Club, where she worked for local and \nnational Democratic candidates. Her commitment to ensuring equality of \nopportunity and access to resources led her to fight tirelessly for the \nintegration of the Englewood schools and for public housing. The \nsuccess of the campaign in which she was involved opened up education \nand affordable housing to the whole community, and it serves as just \none example of the countless times Jeanette sacrificed her time and her \nenergy to help provide a better life to people who had traditionally \nbeen denied the full measure of the American dream.\n  Jeanette interviewed with me in January 1983 when I was putting my \nstaff together for the Lieutenant Governor's Office. From that time on, \nthrough those early years, she served as my executive assistant, \nperforming the endless and thankless tasks that all here understand are \nso vital to our ability to be able to manage our schedules and our \nState operations. As the years passed, she took on greater \nresponsibilities as the director of constituent services where her \nwarm, generous, open personality, and remarkable compassion for people \nin need allowed my office to advocate successfully to open and to \nsuccessfully complete the work on more than 100,000 individual cases \nthroughout Massachusetts.\n  As my colleagues well know, constituent services are critical in \nserving the people of our States and they are sometimes the most \nthankless and the most difficult tasks we confront. Jeanette assembled \nand managed a team that continues to help people in search of housing, \neducation opportunities, and nutritional assistance. She has also \noverseen many complex housing partnerships with the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development and State agencies, helping to bring \nquality, affordable housing to thousands of people throughout the \nState.\n  Jeanette is leaving to enjoy more time with her husband Perry, her \nson Tracey, and his sons, and the South End community she loves so \ndearly. Within the South End, she formed the Four Corners Neighborhood \nAssociation, which led to the construction of the Langham Court \nApartments. This complex is a wonderful example of Jeanette's abilities \nand her commitment to improving her community. It has been recognized \nwith awards for its architecture and innovative program of mixed-income \nhousing. She is also deeply involved in the Roxbury Presbyterian Church \nwhere she serves as an elder, a trustee, a member of the choir, and a \nmember of the renovation committee.\n  These words today--and I know my colleagues will share this sense for \nany long-term staff person who departs--cannot fully recognize \nJeanette's contributions to the people of Massachusetts or the full \nextent of my personal appreciation for her time with me. Although she \ndeparts my staff tomorrow, the principles she has represented in her \nwork will never leave; rather, they will do as Jeanette has done, which \nis to serve as a moral compass pointed toward a better world where a \nbright future is open and available to everyone in this country.\n  I am deeply grateful for her time with me, and I extend to her and \nPerry my very best wishes as they begin a wonderful new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14794-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14794-S14795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE NORTHEAST DAIRY COMPACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in the omnibus package that will be brought \nto the floor sometime this evening, there are two pieces of legislation \non dairy that I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing because I \nthink they are unfair and very much not in the spirit of the American \neconomic system.\n  One is the Northeast Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact is an \narrangement in which the New England States literally fix the price of \nmilk in those seven States and no one can tamper with that price. It is \nthe only price at which milk can be distributed from the farmer to the \nprocessor. In effect, it takes all the competition out of that product \nin that State, in all the New England States. We have never done that \nbefore in this country. It is contrary to everything that is \nrepresented by the economic system in the United States.\n  The reason why we have such a great country in part is because our \neconomic system provides that anybody with a good idea to develop a \nproduct or a service has an unfettered opportunity in all 50 States to \nmarket that product. That is what has made America great: competition. \nThat is why we have full employment, the best economy in the world, and \nan economy that can compete anywhere in the world and succeed. That is \nbecause in this country we say: In order to get your share of market, \nyou have to be able to provide the best product at the best price and \nmarket it in the best way. There are no restrictions in the 50 States \nto do that. That has been true since the United States of America was \noriginated.\n  The northeast dairy cartel is in contrast to that. There is nothing \nabout the cartel that is American in terms of how we do business. There \nis something else about that. They say, and I have heard this from some \nof the leaders in the northeast: Can't we just have our cartel? After \nall, it represents only a fraction of the milk market in the country. \nWhy can't we just have our cartel? But, obviously, if they can have \ntheir cartel, then everybody can have a cartel. What stops us from \nhaving a Southeast cartel or a Southwest cartel? What stops us from \nhaving a Southern cotton cartel? What stops us from having a Midwest \ncorn cartel or a Plains States wheat cartel? If a cartel makes sense in \nany form, then it makes sense not only in the New England States and \nnot only for milk; it makes sense anywhere, conceivably, and for any \nproduct.\n  Now I ask the question: Does the Senate want to go on record as \nfavoring this type of economic policy? I think we all know the answer \nis not yes. Nobody has defended this to me, even though it is coming \ntonight. Nobody has defended it to me. I talked with the leaders in the \nSenate. I asked them to explain why we should have this kind of \nlegislation in the omnibus bill. I tell you, not a leader, not a single \nSenator, has explained to me and defended in any way that makes sense \nthe idea of price-fixing cartels. Yet here it comes.\n  I am told it is coming because promises have been made and \narrangements have already occurred, and so on and so forth. On \nsomething as important as this, which is price-fixing cartels, it seems \nto me that saying ``promises have been made,'' and ``it has been passed \nin the House,'' or ``it is too late,'' or whatever, does not make any \nsense. May I also say I have been in dialog with the leaders in the \nSenate for months on this, so this is not a surprise. So here we are \nwith this piece of legislation.\n\n  Then we also have this milk pricing policy which, as you all know, \narbitrates that the farther you are from Wisconsin in this country, the \nmore you get for your milk if you are a dairy farmer. We all know, \nagain, this was set up 50 or 60 years ago when there was no \nrefrigeration to transport milk and they wanted to encourage the \ndevelopment of the dairy industry. So we provided incentives for dairy \nfarmers at points distant from Wisconsin to develop the dairy industry \nand to circumvent the need for refrigerated transportation. That is no \nlonger true.\n\n[[Page S14795]]\n\n  So what we are trying to do is not to eliminate that price \ndifferential because that would be too big a step to take at once. We \nare trying to reduce the price differential--not eliminate it, reduce \nit. USDA has come up with a program and 97 percent of the farmers in \nthis country have voted for the change in the present milk pricing \nprogram. I am not suggesting we need to eliminate the price \ndifferential at this time. But let's accept the reduction of the price \ndifferential in view of the fact that the present system is archaic and \nmakes no sense.\n  Again, coming over from the House is legislation that continues to \nmandate that the old Depression-era pricing system be continued. May I \nalso say the present system, both with respect to the Northeast Dairy \nCompact and the pricing system, was mandated to conclude on October 1, \nand we would put in a new system. But before October 1, there was a \nFederal judge in Vermont who challenged that kind of outcome. So right \nnow it is tied up in the courts and nothing is going to happen. The \npresent system will stay until at least the courts rule on the validity \nof a new system.\n  So I suggested, and many have suggested, there be no dairy language \nin the omnibus; just don't say anything and let's let this thing roll \nbecause it is tied up in the courts now anyhow, and we can discuss it \nnext year.\n  No, promises have been made. People have been won over in one way or \nanother. Other agendas are on the table. So today it comes in an \nomnibus bill, with the Northeast Dairy Compact renewed. Price fixing \ncartels, does any Senator want to vote for that? Price fixing cartels, \nnot just for the Northeast, because if you accept it in the Northeast \nyou accept it elsewhere; not just on milk, because a cartel is not \nuniquely suited to milk. It can be on any other commodity anywhere.\n  Does the Senate want to go on record as supporting price fixing \ncartels in this country? Do we want to tear up the American economy in \nthat way? That comes in the omnibus tonight. We are going to vote on \nthat.\n  We are also going to vote on going back to the old milk marketing \nprice system which, again, is totally outmoded. The USDA has come up \nwith a new system. I am very upset, obviously, and I am obviously going \nto fight that omnibus bill to its conclusion in any way I can, to \nfilibuster it and to require everything be done to demonstrate to us \nand to the American people that there is a giant bill coming down the \npike which has at least an element in it which is not acceptable, in my \njudgment, to how America is supposed to function.\n  We are also considering a continuing resolution that will be brought \nto the floor momentarily, I understand. Of course, one of the options \nwe have is to vote against a continuing resolution, which would, in \neffect, shut down the Government at midnight tonight. I could object to \nthe CR and the Government would shut down. That is something I had \nconsidered. But if we do that or if I do that, obviously, it is a huge \nstep, and there are many tens of thousands of people who would be out \nof a job, with enormous dislocations all across our country. It is a \nhuge step one does not take easily. It is not a step I want to take. It \nis not a step I am going to take because I do not think it represents \nresponsible action on my part. If some of the other people in this body \nwant to act in a way I consider to be irresponsible and challenge me to \nbe irresponsible--I am not an irresponsible person. Shutting down the \nGovernment is a huge, huge decision. One does not take it lightly. I am \nnot going to make that decision over this issue.\n  But I do want to point out to my colleagues that some strong-arm \ntactics are at work here. Allowing price fixing cartels is a bad thing \nfor this country. I very much hope we can and will find a way to undo \nthe damage of price fixing cartels in an outmoded milk marketing system \nin the very near future.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14795-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14795-S14796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are a number of issues we are working \non, but we have one unanimous consent request with regard to the loan \nguarantee for the satellite local situation we have worked out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no later than March 30, 2000, if no \nSenate committee has reported a bill limited to providing loan \nguarantees to establish local television service to rural areas by \nsatellite and other means, the Republican leader, or his designee, or \nthe Democratic leader, or his designee, be recognized to introduce a \nbill limited to sections 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 1554 providing such loan guarantees, and that \nthe Senate immediately begin consideration of the bill with relevant \nfirst-degree amendments in order and second-degree amendments that are \nrelevant to the first-degree amendment proposed to be amended. Further, \nthat if legislation is reported that is limited to such loan \nguarantees, it be considered on or before March 30 and be open to \nrelevant amendments as provided above. Further, that upon disposition \nof all amendments, the bill be read a third time and passed, with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the majority leader. This is \nthe result of ongoing discussions we have had for some time. I \nappreciate very much the involvement and the work done by the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana. This accomplishes much of what we \nhoped we could do. It is not everything. I am very hopeful we can get \nthis done before April 1, but the majority leader has made as strong a \ncommitment to me personally, and I am sure he is prepared to do it on \nthe record, that he will work with us to accomplish the objectives laid \nout in this unanimous consent agreement.\n  I appreciate, as well, the cooperation of the distinguished Banking \nCommittee chairman, and I believe as a result of the effort we have \nbeen able to demonstrate in getting to this point, we will achieve our \ngoal. We cannot leave rural America out. We will have an opportunity to \nprovide service to them. This will give us the vehicle to make that \nhappen. So I do not object.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Senator reserves the right to \nobject, I want to add my own personal comments rather than just the dry \nUC that I gave.\n  I, too, commend and thank the other Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, \nfor his efforts in this area and for his tenacity. In fact, this very \nday, he ruined my lunch talking to me about this issue. I know Senator \nBaucus believes very strongly in it.\n  It is not just a Montana issue. This is important in South Dakota and \nthis is important in Mississippi. This is important nationwide. If we \nare going to get this satellite local-to-local service in these smaller \nmarkets, we have to have this opportunity, but we want to make sure it \nis a loan guarantee that will work, that is actually going to do the \njob, that is not in some way going to improperly benefit any one \nindividual or group of individuals, for that matter, and that it has \nbeen carefully thought through.\n  Again, I am absolutely determined to get this done. I will not only \nlive up to this UC, which I have to, but I will do it with a great deal \nof vigor and activity.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for his willingness to focus on this \nand get it done by a date certain and make sure he and other committees \nhave added to it to make sure we do it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I earlier objected to bringing up the \ncontinuing resolution because I felt it made much more sense to include \nthe loan guarantee along with the other provisions in the omnibus bill \nthat will be taken up later providing for local-to-local satellite \nnetwork service.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi, as well as my colleague from \nMontana. I have been working with my colleague today to figure out some \nway to lock in even more having loan guarantees passed by this body and \nby the other body.\n  The other body has made a similar commitment in a colloquy about 2\n\n[[Page S14796]]\n\nhours ago to make sure this is passed so rural viewers of America have \nthe opportunity to have local satellite service.\n  I compliment my friend from Montana for working so hard on this. He \nhas worked very hard, as well as others. I am not going to hold up the \ncontinuing resolution to shut down the Government. In the whole scheme \nof things, we have our own priorities and know what the priorities \nshould be. But it is important to get this provision in here because it \ndoes make it even more certain we are going to get this loan guarantee \nprovision passed in the next year.\n  I thank the majority leader. He has been very gracious in working \nthis out, as well as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who \nI know wants to work this out as well, and my good friend from Montana. \nI also thank the Banking Committee chairman. He has been very helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request before \nthe Senate. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, this \nis a compromise to facilitate the passage of this omnibus bill. We have \nworked a long time on this. We are working up to a deadline where we \ncould see some blue screens after December 31. But one cannot ignore \nthe fact that even our satellite viewers should be able to receive \nlocal broadcasts or network stations in their local areas. The only way \nwe will ever provide any competition for the cables under the rules \nthey live by, under must carry, and still have a viable satellite \nservice that will compete with cables is through this method.\n  I appreciate the commitment of the Senator from Texas, the chairman \nof the Banking Committee. I thank my friend from Montana. He has worked \nhard on this. I thank the majority leader. Without their commitments, \nwe would be talking a different tune now. I also commend the leadership \nin the House of Representatives for making the same commitment that \nthis legislation be passed early next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unanimous consent request is before the \nSenate. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas yield to the \nSenator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I was going to speak on this subject of the \nsatellite bill, but I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nas one of the managers of the continuing resolution. I am entitled to \nthat recognition. I ask I be recognized immediately after the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has propounded \na unanimous consent request. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. This has obviously \nbeen a very difficult issue. We passed the satellite bill in the Senate \nunanimously. I think every Member of the Senate realizes the ability to \nreceive television signals in America is critically important. On \nSaturday, you want to watch Texas A On Sunday, you want to watch the \nDallas Cowboys. And one's life is diminished if you cannot do either \none of those things.\n  The problem we had was we passed a bill in the Senate to set up the \nlegal structure to get that job done. They passed a bill in the House \nto do the same. Neither bill had any loan guarantee language in it. The \nconferees realized there was a problem, but in their haste to get it \ndone, it is my opinion that we ended up with language that was as good \nas anybody could have written during that short period of time.\n  Under the agreement we have reached, we have an opportunity to have \nrepresentatives of the television stations, the satellite companies, \nand potential Internet suppliers come in. We have the ability to look \nat the technology.\n  We have the ability to look at loan guarantees we have given in the \npast. We have the ability to get the input of the Treasury. Hopefully, \nwe will have the ability to put together a bill that will maximize the \nchances that every American will have access to their local television \nstation.\n  I want my colleagues to know, as I have said many times as this \ndebate has evolved, I intend, by the 30th of March, to report a bill \nfrom the Banking Committee. It is my goal not only to write a bill that \nwill deal with this problem, but I hope we can develop a prototype for \nthe future, where we recognize that there are some social goals that \nare not necessarily met by market forces, and that the market by itself \nmight not provide this service which we have deemed to be important.\n  The question then is: What can you do to provide this service at the \nlowest possible cost and in the most efficient manner? It is my goal to \nput together a bill that will achieve that goal and perhaps be a \nprototype for similar problems in the future.\n  So I thank my colleagues. Probably as much effort has gone into this \none little issue as anything throughout this whole process. It is an \nimportant issue. It involved an important principle. I think we have \nreached a good conclusion. I am happy about it. I believe, when we \ncomplete it, that every Member of the Senate and every Member of \nCongress and, hopefully, everybody who has a satellite dish or wants \none will be happy about it as well.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the majority leader first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is yielding to \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

RES. 82, H.J. RES. 83, AND H.R. 3194\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for not objecting.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that has been very\n\n[[Page S14797]]\n\ncarefully worked out, and after it is agreed to, we have three \ncolloquies that Senator Daschle, Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, and I \nwould like to enter into.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to H.J. Res. 82, the \ncontinuing resolution, and following the reporting by the clerk, there \nbe two first-degree amendments in order, and no second-degree \namendments or motions to commit or recommit be in order. Those \namendments are the following:\n  The Byrd-McConnell amendment regarding mining;\n  The Helms-Edwards amendment regarding disaster funds.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the \namendments, the joint resolution be read a third time and passed and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I further ask consent that when the Senate receives H.J. Res. 83, the \njoint resolution be deemed agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask consent that when the Senate receives the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 3194, the reading of the conference report \ncommence immediately following the motion to proceed made by the \nmajority leader, to be followed by a vote on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, could I ask the \nmajority leader, following the motion to proceed by the majority \nleader, it says ``to be followed by a vote on a motion to proceed.'' Is \nthis going to be read?\n  Mr. LOTT. This is after the reading has been completed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is our understanding.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority \nleader a question, if I could. We had an understanding prior to \nremoving the quorum call that there is no time limitation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Correct, there is no time limitation in this agreement.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we do have a colloquy we will enter into. I \ndon't know how much debate time will be required since there was no \ntime limitation. It is safe to say there will be a period of time for \ndebate, so if Members want to take this time to get something to eat \nthey will probably have the time to do so. However, I do expect after \nsome reasonable period of time there will be a vote or votes, and, of \ncourse, we will proceed to the conference report that has been \ndelivered to the Senate at an appropriate time so it can be read, and \nfor a motion or votes on that.\n  One important thing I want to emphasize, the Senate can only do what \nthe Senate can do, and then our action has to go to the House. The \nHouse must act. With regard to these continuing resolutions, they have \na number of options. I personally am going to vote for the Byrd \namendment. I think the Senator is entitled to make his case. I hope the \nHouse will accept that. If they don't, it will be back in another venue \nin another way.\n  The same thing with regard to the Helms-Edwards disaster funds. An \noversight occurred, as I understand it, in the final hours last night \nwith regard to disaster funds for North Carolina. There were about \nthree tranches of money that had been requested for disaster \nassistance. Two of those were included, which come to a total of around \n$800 million. However, $81 million, an important tranche, was not \nincluded. Hopefully, the House will accept this and hopefully the House \nwill see fit to accept them both. I will talk to the Speaker and \nencourage him to do that.\n  I want to also emphasize, as has been the case in the past when my \nState has been involved, when South Dakota or North Dakota has been \ninvolved, when any place is involved in a disaster, they should get the \nassistance they need from a caring American people. That is the way we \nhave been doing it for all the years I have been in the Congress. That \nis the way it is now and the way it should be.\n\n  If for whatever reason in this waning hour of the session this money \nis not made available, I am committed publicly, along with Senator \nDaschle and the chairman of the committee, that this money will be \nprovided. It will be provided in the first available vehicle after the \nfirst of the year, and I presume that will be in a supplemental because \nthere will be a supplemental available, and with the commitment of the \nchairman and the commitment of the leaders and also the commitment of \nthe American people, those funds will be available. I want to make that \npart of the Record at this point.\n  I yield the floor for others to respond.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say I agree wholeheartedly with \nthe comments made by the majority leader. I don't know if there is a \nState right now that is hurting as badly as North Carolina. Senator \nEdwards has made that point over and over and over again to me, and I \nknow that Senator Helms has worked with Senator Edwards to try to \nprovide the most comprehensive response to the situation as we can.\n  We have come a long way and made a great deal of progress in the \nlegislation pending, the omnibus bill. As things happen when we work \nlate into the night with a lot of different people working, there is \nalways the possibility something will fall through the cracks. I truly \nbelieve that is what happened. I believe it was an honest mistake.\n  As the majority leader has indicated, whether it is fixed tonight, \nwhether it is fixed before the end of the session, or whether it is \nfixed immediately when we come back, I don't know how one can get a \nstronger commitment than the one given by the majority leader or the \none I am prepared to give and the one I know the chairman will be \nprepared to give to accommodate North Carolina.\n  I appreciate their willingness to work to do this. This should \nresolve this matter successfully once and for all, either tonight or at \nsome point in the not too distant future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I regret this error. It was an error. We have put together \nseveral bills in one bill and it has been a rather difficult week in \nmany ways. This error occurred because some of the Members of the House \nwho are involved and should have been involved were not notified of the \nfinal decision that was made with regard to a request that came from \nthe Senators of North Carolina.\n  Senator Helms called me several times on the matter. I talked on the \nfloor and on the phone with Senator Edwards before the final \narrangement was reached. Frankly, they sought more money than is even \nin the amendment that was left out of the bill. However, we said we \nwould have to take up the further money in the supplemental that comes \nbefore the Congress in the early part of the next year.\n  Last evening when this bill was being read out, I did receive a call \nconcerning the fact that some of the Members of the House were \ndisturbed by the changes that were proposed. It was determined then \nthat had not been properly conveyed to the Members, although some of \nthe staff, I believe, were notified and were part of it. It is just one \nof those things that a staff member's interaction did not take place, \nand I personally did not go over and tell the House Members--I probably \nshould have--but it was one of the final items on the discussions we \nhad, including those that involved the White House representatives who \nwere before our committee yesterday.\n  As a consequence, I want to assure the Senators from North Carolina, \nI do believe that once we have reached a decision such as that, and we \nfelt it had been cleared out, it is our responsibility now to make \ncertain this commitment is made good, and we will do that. This bill \nwill do it if the House will accept it and send it to the President. If \nthat does not happen, we will, without any question, take the matter up \nin the first supplemental that comes before the Congress next year. We \nwill have the supplemental bill for Kosovo coming. That was another \nrequest we received which was not fulfilled in this series of bills \nthat are before the Senate now.\n  I want to assure Senator Edwards and Senator Helms on this side--and\n\n[[Page S14798]]\n\nboth have been very diligent in seeking these moneys--that we will put \nthis money in the next bill if this is not accepted by the House. I \nhave every reason to believe it will be accepted by the House. I intend \nto get on the phone and talk to my friends and make sure they \nunderstand. If there was an error, it was one that was caused by the \nintensity of the work that was going on by the staffs of five different \nsubcommittees trying to put a bill together, along with all the other \nbills that were being considered, many of which were rejected and are \nnot in this bill that we all considered over this last week.\n  I do hope the Senators from North Carolina will accept that \nassurance. I can assure them this is an $81 million item and it is, in \nmy judgment, small compared to the amount of money that will be in the \nnext supplemental for the people who were affected by Hurricane Floyd \nanyway, so we will make up for this problem. We will make up the money, \nand we certainly will see to it that it is there.\n  I plead with the Members of the House to pass the bill tonight. In \nany event, we will take care of that error as quickly as we can.\n  Second, with regard to my good friend from West Virginia and his \namendment and that of Senator McConnell and the Western Senators, I \nthink there is a clear, growing understanding of the provisions of this \namendment. I have been saying, as Senator Byrd has been saying for some \ntime, this does not change existing law. It is an amendment to try to \npreserve the status quo until Congress has a chance to review the \nchanges that would take place if decisions of the Solicitor's Office \nand decisions of one Federal judge were followed, which would affect \nthe mining industry of the whole Nation. I hope the House will \ncertainly see fit to send that measure to the President, so we can see \nwhat the White House is going to do with that.\n\n  But for now, I hope the Senators involved will let us get on with the \nmajor bill, which is going to take some time. I again express my regret \nto the Senators involved that this incident has taken place, and we \nwill do our best to see it does not happen. But the distinguished \nminority leader reminded me, on an amendment that we had on a bill \nearlier this year, a similar thing happened when there were just too \nmany things going into one bill. Our provision was left out, but it got \nback in the next bill, I assure you.\n  Mr. President, I do hope the Senators involved will give us the \ncourtesy now of permitting the Appropriations Committee to present, at \nlast, the omnibus appropriations bill that will fulfill our commitment \nto pass 13 appropriations bills this year.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the Senator from North Carolina might \nwant to make a comment or ask a question at this point. I will be glad \nto yield the floor to him, or yield for him to do that while retaining \nthe floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the human suffering and devastation we \nincurred in North Carolina is absolutely unparalleled. Our people have \nnever suffered and struggled the way they are suffering right now. This \nstorm has completely devastated us. Our farmers are in the worst shape \nthey have ever been in.\n  I appreciate very much the majority leader's commitment, Senator \nStevens' commitment, and the minority leader's commitment. We have \ntalked throughout this process on a daily basis. We had an agreement, a \ncommitment to two things, basically. One was a loan forgiveness \nprogram, which has been talked about, and, second, some language that \nwould help the payment for structural damage on farms in North \nCarolina.\n  I appreciate very much the commitment we have received today. I do \nhave to say I am counting on my colleagues' commitments--the majority \nleader's commitment, Senator Stevens' commitment, Senator Daschle's \ncommitment--to do everything in their power to get this thing passed in \nthis Congress; that it will be included in the CR we are discussing \nright now and that, when it goes to the House side, the majority leader \nwill speak to the Speaker. We will do everything in our power, Senator \nHelms and myself, to make sure that happens. But it is critical to \nSenator Helms and me that we not need to rely on the commitment to do \nsomething after the first of the year, that we get this done tonight or \ntomorrow.\n  With that, I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will say on behalf of Senator Helms, he has been \nfollowing this very closely. I have spoken to him, and Senator Edwards \nhas been in constant conversation with him, as has Senator Stevens. He \nunderstands what we are doing here, and we have made a commitment to \nhim, which we certainly are going to honor, and to Senator Edwards, \nthat we will pursue this aggressively with the other Chamber. This \nmoney is going to be available, hopefully in this CR; if not, the first \navailable vehicle next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14798-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14798-S14799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the regular order is for the vote \nto begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous agreement, there is 5 \nminutes equally divided for debate at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, can we have order in the Chamber, \nplease?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Will the Senate please \ncome to order?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I had earlier planned to speak at least 2 weeks on \nthis amendment. We are getting a bargain. I am only going to speak 3 \nminutes, not 2 weeks. Let me just say this: I made my speech earlier \ntoday. I will not make it again now. I urge my friends to vote for this \namendment. When God drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, he \npronounced an edict: ``In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.''\n  The coal miners of West Virginia and Kentucky and other States of \nthis country earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. But not only \nthe coal miners have been affected by this court's jurisdiction, by its \nruling; the truckers, the railway workers, the men and women who \noperate the barges that go up and down the rivers, the suppliers--these \npeople, their families are affected by this judge's order.\n  This amendment does not seek to undercut, undermine, alter, modify, \namend, or repeal the Clean Water Act or the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act. I say that on my honor. The other cosponsors and I do \nnot seek to do that. We only seek to put the situation back to where it \nwas prior to the U.S. District judge's order, the status quo ante, \nwhich at that time made West Virginia the most strictly controlled \nState in the Union environmentally as far as mountaintop mining was \nconcerned, mountaintop mining--the strictest in the Union.\n  We want to go back to that, and the regulations that controlled then \nwere agreed upon and devised by the administration's own regulatory \nagencies--the Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA, the Interior Department \nthrough its Office of Surface Mining.\n  This amendment states, so there can be no doubt about it:\n\n       Nothing in this section modifies, supersedes, undermines, \n     displaces, or amends any requirement of, or regulation issued \n     under, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly \n     known as the ``Clean Water Act'') . . . or the Surface Mining \n     Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 . . . as applied by the \n     responsible Federal agencies--\n\n  Which are the agencies of this administration--\n\n     on October 19, 1999.\n\n  So there it is. The amendment has been misrepresented. There has been \nmuch misinformation about this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I close by thanking those who have cosponsored this \namendment with me. Their names are on the amendment.\n  How much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield myself another minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was 5 minutes equally divided, which \nis 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak another minute and \na half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment is proposed by Mr. Byrd, for himself, Mr. McConnell, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Reid, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Burns, and \nMr. Kyl--I thank all those Senators who supported this amendment and \nothers who will vote for it. Particularly I want to recognize the \nefforts of my chief cosponsor, the distinguished senior Senator from \nKentucky, whose early and strong support was given to this amendment, \nfor which I am extremely grateful. I thank both leaders for making this \nvote possible. I could speak longer, but I have said enough already.\n  I urge all Senators to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia. I appreciate his leadership not only on behalf of the coal \nminers of Kentucky but miners all across America.\n\n[[Page S14801]]\n\n  The President of the United States came to Hazard, KY, this summer. \nHe bit his lip; he felt our pain. He said he wanted to help us. We \nsaid: We need jobs. And when the opportunity came to support the Byrd \namendment which would at least keep the jobs we have now, the President \nwould not support him.\n  This administration is trying to destroy the mining industry in \nAmerica, make no mistake about it. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership, and we \nhope very much our colleagues will be able to support us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I hope other Senators will want to speak in \nopposition. I think there should be opposition to this amendment. I \nhave tremendous respect for my colleagues who have offered this \namendment. I will say a couple things especially in response to the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  I am a Senator who cares a great deal about workers and about mine \nworkers. I am a Senator who appreciates the sentiment behind this \namendment. But the question is, What happens when the strip mining \ntakes place, and what are the consequences for the people who live in \nthese communities?\n  I can speak certainly from what I have seen in eastern Kentucky, and \nit is pretty awful when that leftover rock and earth gets dumped into \nthe streams. Many of the people have the wealth taken away from them, \nbut they still have the land, they still have the streams, they still \nhave the water, and now we see that kind of devastation.\n  My concern is this amendment will create a loophole to the Clean \nWater Act. I know my colleague from West Virginia believes otherwise, \nbut it is a very real concern. I point out to colleagues that it is my \nunderstanding the Federal district judge put a stay on his own decision \nwhile it was being appealed to the court of appeals. So it is not \noperative right now.\n  I do not know why we are taking this action tonight. It is a big \nmistake from an environmental point of view, and I do not accept, I say \nto my colleague from Kentucky, the tradeoff that he presents as to \nworkers versus some protection for the environment and some concern \nabout the strip mining.\n  I did not want to be the person to speak in opposition, but I do \nbelieve there is another perspective. I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know what is in this amendment. I prepared \nthis amendment. I have been explaining it now for weeks. And, upon my \nhonor, there is nothing in it that undermines or undercuts the Clean \nWater Act or the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, both of \nwhich I supported, one of which I called up as majority leader in this \nSenate in 1977.\n  I know what I am talking about. I have lived under a coal miner's \nroof, ate from a coal miner's table, slept in a coal miner's bed. I \nhave known the joys and the sorrows of coal miners. I married a coal \nminer's daughter. I know what I am talking about. I haven't just made a \ntrip into West Virginia and come back to Washington to issue a news \nreport on the State and its people. I have lived there for many years.\n  I will be 82 years old the day after tomorrow. I know what those \nminers need. I am not misleading anybody. Let me say this to the \nSenator: That stay he refers to that the judge put on has no legal \nbasis. The judge stated that it has no legal basis. He put it on, and \nhe can lift it the day this Congress winds up its work.\n  I hope Senators will vote for this amendment. There were 125,000 coal \nminers when I went to the House of Representatives; 125,000 in West \nVirginia. Today there are 20,000 or less. My dad was a coal miner. My \nwife's sister's husband died with black lung. My wife's sister's \nhusband's father died under a slate fall. I know the joys and the \nsorrows of the mining people. I have helped to carry those miners, the \nheavy coffins, on the steep hillsides of West Virginia. I have not just \ngone into those hills poking around, and then coming back, and issuing \nnews reports about their poverty. I know what they need, because I am \none of them.\n  Those 20,000 coal miners earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. \nLet's give them a vote. If the Senator from Minnesota had people who \nwere faced with the loss of their jobs, this Senator would vote with \nthe Senator from Minnesota and not say a word about it. I resent \nanything such as has been said by the Senator about my State and its \npeople.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 1 \nminute to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my colleague. \nIt is an honest difference of interpretation of the amendment.\n  The only thing I want to respond to, I do not want to be personal, \nbut I would like to say to my colleague, I do not pretend to know West \nVirginia like you know West Virginia and Senator Rockefeller does; that \nis not the position I am taking, but as to the bopping in and bopping \nout, I will say that I want my colleague to know I have spent quite a \nbit of time in eastern Kentucky. That is where my wife's family is \nfrom. Her grandparents were all coal miners. I have spent time in east \nTennessee as well. I spent a lot of time with people. I have seen what \nthe strip mining has done to those communities. I am just expressing my \nhonest viewpoint. That is all I am trying to do, I say to the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I join many others in this body in \nexpressing my support for miners and for mining communities. In \nVirginia's Southwest region, mining creates the jobs that provide \nenough income to lift the next generation, that put the sons and \ndaughters of miners through college, and that gives the region options \nother than coal.\n  Virginia miners have expressed deep concerns that the broad \napplication of Judge Haden's ruling would result in the devastation of \nthe mining industry in the Southern Appalachian coal fields. The \nJudge's decision is not limited to the mountain top mining that was the \nsubject of the original suit. It would apply to the use of valley fills \nfrom other forms of mining, including underground mining. The practical \neffect of this ruling is a virtual moratorium on mining in mountainous \nregions. We need to protect the environment and we also need to protect \nthe livilihood of those hardworking families. I had hoped we could \nreach a compromise on this issue that would effectively allow us to do \nboth.\n  I have reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding between the federal \nand state agencies that could be used to mitigate the consequences of \nvalley fills if they were allowed to continue. It was signed by the \nEPA, Department of the Interior, Army Corps of Engineers, and the State \nof West Virginia. All the signatories are sworn to protect the nation's \nwater. I am convinced that if the MOU stood, the agencies involved \nwould work diligently to mitigate any negative consequences from mining \nin the West Virginia coal fields. Nevertheless, it is imperative that \nwe continue to be vigilant on the effects of mining on the environment, \nand work to minimize its effects.\n  I have also reviewed Judge Haden's ruling and see in that ruling the \nunderlying conflict between what the regulations intend to do, and the \nactual costs of applying those regulations. It demonstrates once again \nhow essential acting on regulatory reform is going to be in this \nCongress. It is imperative that we set in place a method of analyzing \nthe true cost of the regulations, before they are put into place. I am \ncertain the agencies involved want to do the right thing, by both \nminers and the environment. The rules as I read them make that \nvirtually impossible. I am hopeful that this conflict can be resolved \nas quickly as possible. In the meantime, I intend to support the miners \nof Southwest Virginia.\n  I must however, voice my strong opposition to the language on hard \nrock mining that has been added at the last minute to this amendment. \nMy vote on this amendment stems only from my concern for the immediate \neffect Judge\n\n[[Page S14802]]\n\nHaden's ruling would have on the economy of Southwest Virginia. I have \nopposed and will continue to oppose efforts to delay the review and \nrevision of the nation's hard rock mining standards. My vote in no way \nsupports the inclusion of hard rock provisions in this package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement be placed in the Record \nbefore the vote on Amendment No. 2780.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd \namendment.\n  We are scrambling around right here in the U.S. Senate to pass a \nstopgap spending bill to keep from shutting down a major portion of the \nFederal Government.\n  So, it is very fitting that we add an amendment to that stopgap \nspending bill that would help us keep a Federal judge from shutting \ndown the coal mining industry in West Virginia and possibly other \nStates like Kentucky as well.\n  This is a matter of survival for many of our coal mines. It is \nessential that we act now to prevent unnecessary damage to the \nindustry--to prevent unnecessary unemployment--and to prevent \nunnecessary economic devastation in areas which have already been \nbypassed by the economic boom times that have blessed much of the \nNation.\n  A Federal district court judge in West Virginia ruled on October 21 \nthat a well-balanced working agreement between the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers and the West Virginia Division of Environmental \nProtection violated the Clean Water Act.\n  That arbitrary ruling which basically overrules three Federal \nagencies' interpretation of the law is going to jeopardize the coal \nindustry immediately in West Virginia and potentially in other States \nlike my own State of Kentucky as well.\n  We need to pass the Byrd Amendment to stay this ruling until we have \nhad time to get the results of a pending environmental impact \nstatement.\n  It is a matter of simple fairness. The jobs and lives of many of our \nconstituents are at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted in support of the Byrd amendment to \nprovide for a 2-year moratorium during which mountain top mining \nactivities may continue under a memorandum of agreement with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. The EPA which is in charge of implementation \nof the Clean Water Act was a party to the agreement which would \ncontinue to force during the 2-year moratorium. An environmental impact \nstudy will go forward during the moratorium and regulations pursuant to \nthe environmental impact statement can be promulgated. My vote on this \namendment does not commit me to support the continuation of any such \nmoratorium beyond this 2-year period during which the courts and the \nregulatory agencies will more fully evaluate the impacts on both the \nenvironment and the affected coal miners and their communities. The \nfact that the court has stayed the effect of its own opinion is further \nevidence that this legislative moratorium is both warranted and will do \nno damage to the underlying act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \noffer an amendment at this time on behalf of Senators Helms and Edwards \nof North Carolina with regard to funds for their disaster. And I ask \nunanimous consent that that vote occur in a stacked sequence, after it \nis debated, after the vote on the amendment by Senator Byrd and Senator \nMcConnell, and that the first vote be just 10 minutes, and then the \nsecond vote would be 10 minutes also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2781\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send to the desk then the amendment on \nbehalf of Senators Helms and Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Helms and \n     Mr. Edwards, proposes an amendment numbered 2781.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n\n\n  commodity credit corporation producer-owned marketing associations \n                              forgiveness\n\n       Sec. 1. The Secretary of Agriculture shall reduce the \n     amount of any principal due on a loan made to marketing \n     association incorporated in the State of North Carolina for \n     the 1999 crop of an agricultural commodity by at least 75 \n     percent if the marketing association suffered losses of the \n     agricultural commodity in a county with respect to which--(1) \n     a natural disaster was declared by the Secretary for losses \n     due to Hurricane Dennis, Floyd, or Irene; or (2) a major \n     disaster or emergency was declared by the President for \n     losses due to Hurricane Dennis, Floyd, or Irene under the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n       If the Secretary assigns a grade quality for the 1999 crop \n     of an agricultural commodity marketed by an association \n     described in subsection (a) that is below the base quality of \n     the agricultural commodity, the Secretary shall compensate \n     the association for losses incurred by the association as a \n     result of the reduction in grade quality.\n       Up to $81,000,000 of the resources of the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation may be used for the cost of this provision: \n     Provided, That the entire amount is designated by the \n     Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) and Section 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n       Sec. 2. In administering $50,000,000 in emergency \n     supplemental funding for the Emergency Conservation Program, \n     the Secretary shall give priority to the repair of structures \n     essential to the operation of the farm.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am honored they would allow me to do this \non their behalf because I believe they were not treated properly in the \nwee hours of the morning with regard to an amount of money for disaster \nassistance for North Carolina. We are determined to assist them in \ngetting that. We hope this will be accepted by the House in this form. \nBut if not in this form, we will be back to carry out our commitment to \nthe people in North Carolina and as a symbol to people all across \nAmerica that, when it comes to disasters, there are no party lines and \nthere is no division between the Capitol; we will do what is necessary \nto help people when they are desperate and need help.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Aeronautics and space activities involved 14 \ncontributing departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and \nthe results of their ongoing research and development affect the Nation \nin many ways.\n  A wide variety of aeronautics and space developments took place \nduring FY 1998. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n(NASA) successfully completed five Space Shuttle flights. There were 29 \nsuccessful Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches in FY 1998. Of \nthose, 3 were NASA-managed missions, 2 were NASA-funded/Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA)-licensed missions, 8 were Department of \nDefense (DOD)-managed missions, and 16 were FAA-licensed commercial \nlaunches. Scientists also made some dramatic new discoveries in various \nspace-related fields such as space science, Earth science, and remote \nsensing, and life and microgravity science. In aeronautics, activities \nincluded work on high-speed research, advance subsonic technology, and \ntechnologies designed to improve the safety and efficiency of our \ncommercial airlines and air traffic control system.\n  Close international cooperation with Russia occurred on the Shuttle-\nMir docking missions and on the ISS program. The United States also \nentered into new forms of cooperation with its partners in Europe, \nSouth America, and Asia.\n  Thus, FY 1998 was a very successful one for U.S. aeronautics and \nspace programs. Efforts in these areas have contributed significantly \nto the Nation's scientific and technical knowledge, international \ncooperation, a healthier environment, and a more competitive economy.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to allow patients access to drugs and medical devices \nrecommended and provided by health care practitioners that are not \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    Access to Medical Treatment Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to \nMedical Treatment Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Harkin, \nReid, Inouye and Johnson in this effort to increase individuals' \nfreedom of choice in health care.\n  At the outset, I want to extend my thanks to my friend Berkley \nBedell, who formerly represented the 6th District of Iowa, for first \nbringing this issue to my attention and for his assistance in \ndeveloping this bill. Berkley Bedell has experienced first-hand the \nlife-saving potential of alternative treatments. His story underscores \nthe need for the legislation I am introducing today and the importance \nof a national debate on ways to promote consumer choice and expand \naccess to promising new medical treatments.\n  American consumers have already voted for expanded access to \nalternative treatments with their feet and their pocket-books. The \nJournal of the American Medical Association recently published a study \nby David Eisenberg and others that found that Americans spent nearly \n$27 billion on alternative therapies in 1997. Americans made more \nvisits to alternative practitioners--a total of 629 million--than to \nprimary care doctors. Expenditures for alternative medicine \nprofessional services increased 45.2 percent between 1990 and 1997 to \n$21.2 billion. Some type of alternative therapy is used by 46.3 percent \nof the American population.\n  Alternative therapies are also being incorporated into mainstream \nmedical programs and practice. The curriculum of at least 22 of the \nnation's 125 medical schools include courses on alternative medicine. \nThe National Institutes of Health now has a Center for Complementary \nand Alternative Medicine where work is underway to expand our knowledge \nof alternative therapies and their safe and effective use.\n  Despite the growing reliance on many types of alternative medicine, \nother alternative therapies remain unavailable because they do not fit \nthe categories already carved out by Congress for exemption from the \nrequirement to gain FDA approval. My bill would increase access to \ntreatments that would normally be regulated by the FDA, but have not \nyet undergone the expensive and lengthy process currently required to \ngain FDA approval.\n  Given the popularity of alternative medicine among the American \npublic and its growing acceptance among traditional medical \npractitioners, it would seem logical to remove some of the access \nbarriers that consumers face when seeking certain alternative \ntherapies. The time and expense currently required to gain FDA approval \nboth discourages the exploration of innovative, life-saving treatments \nby individual practitioners, scientists and smaller companies and \nlimits patient access to low-cost treatments.\n  Mr. President, the Access to Medical Treatment Act proposes one way \nto expand freedom of choice for medical consumers under carefully \ncontrolled situations. It asserts that individuals--especially those \nwho face life-threatening afflictions for which conventional treatments \nhave proven ineffective--should have the option of trying an \nalternative treatment, so long as they have been fully informed of the \nnature of the treatment, potential side effects, and given any other \ninformation necessary to meet carefully-crafted informed consent \nrequirements. This is a choice that is rightly made by the consumer, \nand not dictated by the\n\n[[Page S14807]]\n\nFederal government. All treatments sanctioned by this Act must be \nprescribed by an authorized health care practitioner who has personally \nexamined the patient. The practitioner must fully disclose all \navailable information about the safety and effectiveness of any medical \ntreatment, including questions that remain unanswered because the \nnecessary research has not been conducted. Patients must be informed of \nany possible side effects or interactions with other drugs.\n  The bill carefully restricts the ability of practitioners to \nadvertise or market unapproved drugs or devices or to profit \nfinancially from prescribing alternative medicine. This provision was \nincluded to ensure that practitioners keep the best interests of \npatients in mind and to retain incentives for seeking FDA approval. If \nan individual or a company wants to earn a profit from a product, they \nwould be wise to go through the standard FDA approval process.\n  The bill protects patients by requiring practitioners to report any \nadverse reaction that could potentially have been caused by an \nunapproved drug or medical device. If an adverse reaction is reported, \nmanufacture and distribution of the drug must cease pending a thorough \ninvestigation. If it is determined that the adverse reaction was caused \nby the drug or medical device, as a part of a total recall, the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, along with \nthe manufacturer, has the duty to inform all health care practitioners \nto whom the drug or device has been provided.\n  This legislation will help build a knowledge base regarding \nalternative treatments by requiring practitioners to report on \neffectiveness. This is critical because current information available \nabout the effectiveness of many promising treatments is inadequate. The \ninformation generated through this Act will begin to reverse this \nreality, particularly because information will be collected and \nanalyzed by the Center for Alternative Medicine at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  In essence, this legislation addresses the fundamental balance \nbetween two seemingly irreconcilable interests: the protection of \npatients from dangerous and ineffective treatments and the preservation \nof the consumers' freedom to choose alternative therapies. The \ncomplexity of this policy challenge should not discourage us from \nseeking to solve it. I am convinced that the public good will be served \nby a serious attempt to reconcile these contradictory interests, and I \nam hopeful the discussion generated by introduction of this legislation \nwill help point the way to its resolution.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents an honest attempt to focus \nserious attention on the value of alternative treatments and overcome \ncurrent obstacles to their safe development and utilization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PENALTY.\n\n       A health care practitioner or manufacturer found to have \n     knowingly violated this Act shall be denied coverage under \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Daschle today \nfor the introduction of the Access to Medical Treatment Act. This bill \nwill allow greater freedom of choice and increased access in the realm \nof medical treatments, while preventing abuses of unscrupulous \nentrepreneurs. The Access to Medical Treatment Act allows individual \npatients and their properly licensed health care provider to use \ncertain alternative and complementary therapies not approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).\n  Mr. President, we have made several important changes to the \nlegislation from last Congress.\n  We have improved the informed consent protections for patients by \nmodeling them after the NIH's human subject protection regulations. The \npatient must be fully informed, orally and in writing of: the nature, \ncontent and methods of the medical treatment; that the treatment is not \napproved by the FDA; the anticipated benefits AND risks of the \ntreatment; any reasonably foreseeable side effects that may result; the \nresults of past applications of the treatment by the health care \nprovider and others; the comparable benefits and risks of any available \nFDA-approved treatment conventionally used for the patient's condition; \nand any financial interest the provider has in the product.\n  Providers and manufacturers are required to report to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) any adverse effects, and must \nimmediately cease use and manufacture of the product, pending a CDC \ninvestigation. The CDC is required to conduct an investigation of any \nadverse effects, and if the product is shown to cause any danger to \npatients, the physician and manufacturers are required to immediately \ninform all providers who have been using the product of the danger.\n  Our legislation ensures the public's access to reliable information \nabout complementary and alternative therapies by requiring providers \nand manufacturers to report the results of the use of their product to \nthe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH, \nwhich is then required to compile and analyze the information for an \nannual report.\n  In addition, the provider and manufacturer may make no advertising \nclaims regarding the safety and effectiveness of the treatment of \ntherapy, and FDA has the authority to determine that the labeling of \nthe treatment is not false or misleading.\n  Mr. President, this legislation preserves the consumer's freedom to \nchoose alternative therapies while addressing the fundamental concern \nof protecting patients from dangerous treatments and those who would \nadvocate unsafe and ineffective therapies.\n  It wasn't long ago that William Roentgen was afraid to publish his \ndiscovery of X-rays as a diagnostic tool. He knew they would be \nconsidered an ``alternative medical practice'' and widely rejected by \nthe medical establishment. As everyone knows, X-rays are a common \ndiagnostic tool today. Well into this century, many scientists resisted \nbasic antiseptic techniques as quackery because they refused to accept \nthe germ theory of disease. I think we can all be thankful the medical \nprofession came around on that one.\n  In addition, the Office of Technology Assessment reported in a 1978 \nstudy that only about 25 percent of the practices of mainstream \nmedicine were based on scientific evidence. And there is little \nevidence that has changed in the past two decades.\n  Today's consumers want alternatives. They want less invasive, less \nexpensive preventive options. Americans want to stay healthy. And they \nare speaking with their feet and their pocketbooks. Mr. President, \nAmericans spend $30 billion annually on unconventional therapies. \nAccording to a recent survey published in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association (JAMA), nearly one-half of Americans use some kind \nof complementary and alternative medicine. These practices, which range \nfrom acupuncture, to chiropractic care, to naturopathic, herbal and \nhomeopathic remedies, are not simply complementary and alternative, but \nintegral to how millions of Americans manage their health and treat \ntheir illnesses.\n  This legislation simply provides patients the freedom to use--with \nstrong consumer protections--the complementary and alternative \ntherapies and treatments that have the potential to relieve pain and \ncure disease. I thank Senator Daschle for his leadership on this issue, \nand urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1956. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance the \nassurance of efficiency, quality, and patient satisfaction in the \nfurnishing of health care to veterans by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n             The Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance Act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nHealth Care Quality Assurance Act of 1999.\n  This legislation contains a number of proposals designed to ensure \nthat access to high quality medical services for our veterans is not \ncompromised as the Department of Veterans Affairs--the VA--strives to \nincrease efficiency in its nationwide network of veterans hospitals.\n  Mr. President, the VA administers the largest health care network in \nthe U.S., including 172 hospitals, 73 home care programs, over 800 \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics, and numerous other specialized care \nfacilities.\n  Moreover, there are approximately 25 million veterans in the U.S., \nincluding approximately 19.3 million wartime veterans, and the number \nof veterans seeking medical care in VA hospitals is increasing. The \nFY99 VA medical care caseload was projected to increase by 160,000 \nveterans over the FY98 level, and is projected to increase by an \nadditional 54,000 in FY00, reaching a total of 3.6 million veterans, an \nincrease from 2.7 million in FY97. In FY00, outpatient visits at VA \nmedical facilities are projected to increase by 2.5 million to 38.3 \nmillion. The average age of veterans is increasing as well, and this is \nexpected to result in additional demands for health care services, \nincluding more frequent and long-term health needs.\n  The VA is attempting to meet this unprecedented demand for health \ncare services without substantial increases in funding, largely through \nefforts to increase efficiency. Not surprisingly, these seemingly \ncompeting objectives are generating serious concerns about the \npossibility that quality of care and/or patient satisfaction are being \nsacrificed.\n  Mr. President, many VA regional networks and medical center directors \nreport that timely access to high quality health care is being \njeopardized,\n\n[[Page S14810]]\n\nand that is why I am introducing the Veterans Health Care Quality \nAssurance Act, legislation which seeks to ensure that no veteran's \nhospital is targeted unfairly for cuts, and that efforts to \n``streamline'' and increase efficiency are not followed by the \nunintended consequence of undermining quality of care or patient \nsatisfaction.\n  I believe that all veterans hospitals should be held to the same \nequitable VA-wide standards, and that quality and satisfaction must be \nguaranteed. Toward that end, the Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance \nAct calls for audits of every VA hospital every three years. This will \nensure that each facility is subject to an outside, independent review \nof its operations on a regular basis, and each audit will include \nfindings on how to improve services to our veterans.\n  The legislation will also establish an Office of Quality Assurance \nwithin the VA to ensure that steps taken to increase efficiency in VA \nmedical programs do not undermine quality or patient satisfaction. This \noffice will collect and disseminate information on efforts that have \nproven to successfully increase efficiency and resource utilization \nwithout undermining quality or patient satisfaction. The director of \nthis new Office of Quality Assurance should be an advocate for veterans \nand would be placed in the appropriate position in the VA command \nstructure to ensure that he or she is consulted by the VA Secretary and \nUnder Secretary for Veterans Health on matters that impact quality or \nsatisfaction.\n  The bill would require an initial report to Congress within six \nmonths of enactment, which would include a survey of each VA regional \nnetwork and a report on each network's efforts to increase efficiency, \nas well as an assessment of the extent to which each network and VA \nhospital is or is not implementing the same uniform, VA-wide policies \nto increase efficiency.\n  Under the bill's reporting requirement, the VA would also be required \nto publish--annually--an overview of VA-wide efficiency goals and \nquality/satisfaction standards that each veterans facility should be \nheld to. Further, the VA would be required to report to Congress on \neach hospital's standing in relation to efficiency, quality, and \nsatisfaction criteria, and how each facility compares to the VA-wide \naverage.\n\n  In an effort to encourage innovation in efforts to increase \nefficiency within the agency, the bill would encourage the \ndissemination and sharing of information throughout the VA in order to \nfacilitate implementation of uniform, equitable efficiency standards.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill includes provisions calling for \nsharing of information on efforts to maximize resources and increase \nefficiency without compromising quality of care and patient \nsatisfaction; exchange and mentoring initiatives among and between \nnetworks in order to facilitate sharing of such information; incentives \nfor networks to increase efficiency and meet uniform quality/patient \nsatisfaction targets; and formal oversight by the VA to ensure that all \nnetworks are meeting uniform efficiency criteria and that efforts to \nincrease efficiency are equitable between networks and medical \nfacilities.\n  Last week America celebrated Veterans Day 1999--81 years after the \nArmistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the \ncarnage of World War I. World War I was supposed to be ``the war to end \nall wars'' . . . the war that made the world safe for democracy. Sadly, \nthat was not to be, and America has been repeatedly reminded that the \ndefense of democracy is an on-going duty.\n  Mr. President, keeping our promise to our veterans is also an ongoing \nduty. The debt of gratitude we owe to our veterans can never be fully \nrepaid. What we can and must do for our veterans is repay the financial \ndebt we owe to them. Central to that solemn duty is ensuring that the \nbenefits we promised our veterans when they enlisted are there for them \nwhen they need them.\n  I consider it a great honor to represent veterans, these brave \nAmericans. So many of them continue to make contributions in our \ncommunities upon their transition from military to civilian life--\nthrough youth activities and scholarship programs, homeless assistance \ninitiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in need, and \nnational leadership on issues of importance to veterans and all \nAmericans. The least we can do is make good on our promise, such as the \npromise of access to high quality health care.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their \ncountry, and this legislation is but a small tribute to the men and \nwomen and their families who have served this country with courage, \nhonor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their \ncountry needed them, and this is a component of my on-going effort to \nensure that we, as elected officials, answer their call when they need \nus.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 1958. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to authorize \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to make grants for startup costs of school \nbreakfast programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE PARTICIPATION IN THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will go \nfar in helping children start their school day ready to learn.\n  The relationship between a healthy breakfast and both behavior and \nacademic achievement has been documented by a number of studies. \nFortunately, participation of schools in the School Breakfast program \nhas increased steadily since the program was made permanent in 1975. \nAccording to the School Breakfast Scorecard, a report recently released \nby the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a record number of \nschools--70,000--provided breakfast to school children last year. And \nnearly half of our states have 80 percent or more of their schools \nserving both lunch and breakfast under the National School Lunch and \nSchool Breakfast programs.\n  That's good news. The bad news is that the gulf between states with \nthe highest rates of school participation in breakfast and those with \nthe lowest is wide. 20 percent of our states have fewer than 55 percent \nof their schools participating in both breakfast and lunch; that's a \nfull 20 points below the national average. In my home state of \nWisconsin, only 30 percent of the schools that serve lunch also serve \nbreakfast.\n  By another measure--participation of low-income children in both \nschool lunch and breakfast--the results from the Scorecard are equally \nconcerning. Nationally, only 42 percent of the kids receiving a free or \nreduced price lunch are also receiving breakfast; some states have \nfewer than 25 percent of kids receiving a free or reduced price lunch \nalso receiving school breakfast.\n  The bill I am introducing today would help states provide an \nadditional financial incentive for schools to participate in the school \nbreakfast program. While there are a number of reasons that schools do \nnot offer their children a school breakfast, certainly the barrier most \ndifficult to overcome is the cost of the meals throughout the year. In \nshort, the cost of the school breakfast program may simply be too high \nfor some schools and school districts.\n  My bill authorizes, subject to appropriations, grants from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) to allow states to provide schools \nwith an additional five cent per meal reimbursement during the first \nyear in which they provide the school breakfast program. This \nadditional reimbursement may be used to supplement both the existing \nfederal per meal reimbursement and any additional per meal \nreimbursement provided by the state. To ensure that the grants are as \neffective as possible they are targeted to those states with poor \nschool breakfast participation rates and that also have a program in \nplace to promote school breakfast participation. State educational \nagencies will have the discretion to determine, based on participation \nrates, which schools or school districts will receive the supplemental \nassistance.\n  Providing a nutritious breakfast is the first step in ensuring that \nkids are ready to learn when they sit down at their desks each morning. \nThe legislation I am introducing will go far in helping states and \nschools reach that goal and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n\n[[Page S14811]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation and letters of support for my bill from Wisconsin State \nSuperintendent John Benson and Wisconsin School Food Service \nAssociation President Renee Slotten-Beauchamp be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1958\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Herb Kohl,\n     US Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl:\n       This letter is in support of your proposed amendment for \n     Startup Grants for School Breakfast Programs. I believe this \n     legislation will provide an essential incentive for schools \n     to implement a School Breakfast Program (SBP). Understanding \n     that breakfast is an important component for academic \n     achievement as well as the health of our nation's children, I \n     am very concerned with Wisconsin's low participation in the \n     SBP.\n       The federal startup grants for SBP will enhance the many \n     public and private efforts within our state to increase the \n     number of schools offering breakfast. Our state legislature \n     has supported my budget initiative for a ten cents per \n     breakfast reimbursement, effective in fiscal year 2001. \n     Statewide public and nonpublic collaborative initiatives to \n     promote the importance of breakfast include the Good \n     Breakfast for Good Learning Breakfast Awareness Campaign, now \n     in its third year. Public and private hunger prevention \n     coalitions are actively promoting school breakfast. \n     Professional organizations, such the Wisconsin School Food \n     Service Association and the Wisconsin Dietetic Association \n     have taken a lead in school breakfast promotion efforts.\n       However, the bottom line is that schools cannot absorb \n     financial loss in the Child Nutrition Programs. Fear that the \n     SBP will have a negative impact on the school district's \n     general fund has been detrimental to the promotional efforts \n     identified above. The startup grants for SBP will help \n     alleviate those fears and allow the children in this state to \n     have access to a nourishing breakfast at the start of the \n     school day.\n       I would like to commend your efforts to help the children \n     in this state and the nation reach their full potential \n     through promotion of School Breakfast Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John T. Benson,\n     State Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Wisconsin School\n\n\n                                     Food Service Association,\n\n                                                November 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl:\n       This letter is in support of your proposed amendment for \n     Startup Grants for School Breakfast Programs.\n       The Wisconsin School Food Service Association with its 1700 \n     members, along with other allied associations have been \n     working to increase the number of schools in Wisconsin \n     offering breakfast. We understand the connection between good \n     nutrition at breakfast and academic achievement. We see \n     first-hand how difficult it is for a hungry child to \n     concentrate on learning.\n       The federal startup grants for School Breakfast Programs \n     will help our efforts to expand school breakfast \n     participation. A real concern for many school districts is \n     the cost of implementing and maintaining the program. During \n     the 1997-98 school year Wisconsin schools lost an average of \n     $0.23 per breakfast served. Our association believes school \n     food and nutrition programs deserve adequate funding and \n     reasonable regulations to help maintain financial integrity \n     and nutritional quality of meals. As a commitment to the \n     children of Wisconsin we made state funding for school \n     Breakfast Programs a high legislative priority this year. Our \n     state legislature recently supported a ten-cent per breakfast \n     reimbursement, which will be in effect for the fiscal year \n     2001. Federal Startup Grants would help districts implement \n     school Breakfast Programs.\n       The Wisconsin School Food Service Association feels the \n     children of Wisconsin and the nation deserve every \n     educational opportunity to reach their full potential. School \n     breakfast is one of those opportunities.\n       Our association commends you for your efforts to expand \n     School Breakfast.\n           Sincerely,\n                                Renee Slotten-Beauchamp R.D., D.C.\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1959. A bill to provide for the fiscal responsibility of the \nFederal Government; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the fiscal responsibility act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today as we are debating how to protect \nSocial Security and Medicare while making necessary investments in our \nnation's future, I am introducing legislation designed to provide some \noptions for reducing spending. In an effort to promote greater fiscal \nresponsibility within the federal government, ``The Fiscal \nResponsibility Act'' would eliminate special interest tax loopholes, \nreduce corporate welfare, eliminate unnecessary government programs, \nreduce wasteful spending, enhance government efficiency and require \ngreater accountability.\n  The reforms contained in this bill would result in savings of up to \n$20 billion this year and up to $140 billion over the next five years. \nThese savings could be used to pay down the federal debt, shore up \nSocial Security and Medicare, provide middle-class tax relief, and/or \npay for needed investment in education, health care and other \npriorities.\n  While I recognize that everyone won't agree on each of the provisions \nof this measure, I believe it is important for us to put forward \noptions to be considered. I hope that we can work together on a \nbipartisan basis to produce a set of reforms such as these to lay a \npath of fiscal responsibility as we move into the next century.\n  The following is a summary of the bill's major provisions:\n  Elimination of Unnecessary Government Programs.\n\n[[Page S14812]]\n\n  A number of outdated or unnecessary programs would be eliminated, \nincluding Radio Marti, TV Marti and certain nuclear energy research \ninitiatives. These changes would save over $150 million this year.\n  Reduction of Wasteful Spending and Government Efficiency \nImprovements.\n  $13 billion a year is lost to Medicare waste and abuse. This would be \nsubstantially reduced through a series of comprehensive reforms. In \naddition, taxpayer support for the cost of certain nuclear energy \nlobbying activities would be eliminated.\n  A number of common sense steps would be implemented to improve the \nefficiency of government activities.\n  Spending by government agencies on travel, printing, supplies and \nother items would be frozen at 1998 levels. This change would save $2.8 \nbillion this year and about $12 billion over 5 years.\n\n  Pentagon spending would be tied to the rate of inflation. This would \nforce the Pentagon to reduce duplication and other inefficiencies \nidentified by government auditors and outside experts. This change \nwould save taxpayers $9.2 billion this year and approximately $69 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  Enhancing the government's ability to collect student loan defaults \nwould save taxpayers $892 million this year and $1 billion over five \nyears.\n  Eliminating Special Interest Tax Loopholes and Give-Aways.\n  Tobacco use causes 400,000 deaths a year and costs taxpayers billions \nin preventable health care costs. And, yet, taxpayers are forced to \ncough up about $2 billion a year to subsidize the advertising and \nmarketing of this deadly product. The tax deductibility of tobacco \npromotion would be ended and these funds would be saved.\n  A loophole that allows estates valued above $10 million to elude \ntaxation would be closed.\n  The federal government allows mining companies to extract minerals \nfrom federally-owned lands at an actual cost of pennies on the dollar. \nThis special interest giveaway would be ended, saving taxpayers $750 \nmillion over the next five years.\n  American citizens temporarily working in foreign countries can earn \nup to $70,000 without paying any U.S. taxes. This unfair provision \nwould be eliminated, bringing in an estimated $15.7 billion over the \nnext 5 years.\n  A foreign tax credit that allows big oil and gas companies to escape \npaying their fair share for royalties would be limited. This common \nsense change would generate $3.1 billion over 5 years to reduce the \ndebt our kids and grandkids will inherit.\n  Increased Accountability.\n  Tobacco companies hook 3,000 children a day on their deadly products. \nOne in three of these kids will be sentenced to an early death. Tobacco \ncompanies should be held accountable. Accordingly, a goal of reducing \nteen smoking by at least 15 percent each year would be set. If tobacco \ncompanies fail to meet this goal, they would have to pay a penalty. \nSuch a system would generate approximately $6 billion this year and $20 \nbillion over the next 5 years. It would also significantly reduce the \nnumber of young children who become addicted to tobacco.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review the provisions in this \nbill and look forward to moving forward next year on a fiscally \nresponsible budget plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1960. A bill to provide for the appointment of 1 additional \nFederal district judge for the eastern district of Wisconsin, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the federal judgeship for northeastern wisconsin act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nJudgeship for Northeastern Wisconsin Act of 1999. This bill would \ncreate one additional judgeship in the eastern district of Wisconsin \nand seat it in Green Bay, at the center of a region in desperate need \nof a district court. Let me explain how an additional judgeship could \nalleviate the stress that the current system places on business, law \nenforcement agents, witnesses, victims and individual litigants in \nnortheastern Wisconsin.\n  First, while the four full-time district court judges for the eastern \ndistrict of Wisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee, for most \nlitigants and witnesses in northeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee is well \nover 100 miles away. In fact, as the courts are currently arranged, the \nnorthern portion of the eastern district is more remote from a Federal \ncourt than any other major population center, commercial or industrial, \nin the United States. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur \nsubstantial costs in traveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--\ncosts in terms of time, money, resources, and effort. Indeed, driving \nfrom Green Bay to Milwaukee takes nearly two hours each way. Add \ninclement weather or a departure point north of Green Bay--such as \nOconto or Marinette--and often the driving time alone actually exceeds \nthe amount of time witnesses spend testifying.\n  Second, Mr. President, the few Wisconsin Federal judges serve a \ndisproportionately large population. Last year, I commissioned a study \nby the General Accounting Office which revealed that Wisconsin Federal \njudges have to serve the highest population among all federal judges. \nEach sitting Federal judge in Wisconsin serves an average population of \n859,966, while the remaining federal judges across the country--more \nthan 650--serve less than half that number, with an average of 417,000 \nper judge. For example, while Louisiana has fewer residents than \nWisconsin, it has 22 Federal judges, nearly four times as many as our \nstate.\n  Third, Mr. President, Federal crimes remain unacceptably high in \nnortheastern Wisconsin. These crimes range from bank robbery and \nkidnaping to Medicare and Medicaid fraud. However, without the \nappropriate judicial resources, a crackdown on Federal crimes in the \nupper part of the state will be made enormously more difficult. \nAdditionally, under current law, the Federal Government is required to \nprosecute all felonies committed by Indians that occur on the Menominee \nReservation. The reservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors \nand courts--more than 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic. \nAnd because the Justice Department compensates attorneys, investigators \nand sometimes witnesses for travel expenses, the existing system costs \nall of us. Without an additional judge in Green Bay, the administration \nof justice, as well as the public's pocketbook, will suffer enormously.\n  Fourth, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in \nnortheastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court \nto litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with \nout-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these \nlegitimate cases are never even filed --precisely because the northern \npart of the State lacks a Federal court. Mr. President, this hurts \nbusinesses not only in Wisconsin, but across the Nation.\n  Fifth, the creation of an additional judgeship in the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin is justified based on caseload. The Judicial \nConference, the administrative and statistical arm of the Federal \njudiciary, makes biannual recommendations to Congress regarding the \nnecessity of additional judgeships using a system of weighted filings--\nthat is, the total number of cases modified by the average level of \ncase complexity. In the Judicial Conference's most recent \nrecommendations, new positions were justified where a district's \nworkload exceeded 435 weighted filings per judge. Such high caseloads \nare common in the eastern district of Wisconsin, peaking in 1996 with \nan overwhelming 453 weighted filings. On this basis, an additional \njudgeship for the eastern district of Wisconsin is warranted.\n\n  Mr. President, our legislation is simple, effective and \nstraightforward. It creates an additional judgeship for the eastern \ndistrict, requires that one judge hold court in Green Bay, and gives \nthe chief judge of the eastern district flexibility to designate which \njudge holds court there. And this legislation would increase the number \nof Federal district judges in Wisconsin for the first time since 1978. \nDuring that period, nearly 150 new Federal district judgeships have \nbeen created nationwide, but not a single one in Wisconsin.\n  And don't take my word for it, Mr. President, ask the people who \nwould be most affected: since 1994, each and every sheriff and district \nattorney in northeastern Wisconsin has urged me to create a Federal \ndistrict court in\n\n[[Page S14813]]\n\nGreen Bay. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from these law \nenforcement officials be included in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. \nAttorney for the eastern district of Wisconsin, Tom Schneider, also be \nincluded. This letter expressed the support of the entire Federal law \nenforcement community in Wisconsin--including the FBI, the DEA and the \nBATF--for the legislation we are introducing. They needed this \nadditional judicial resource in 1994, and certainly, Mr. President, \nthat need has only increased over the last five years.\n  Perhaps most important, the people of Green Bay also agree on the \nneed for an additional Federal judge, as the endorsement of our \nproposal by the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce demonstrates.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, having a Federal judge in Green Bay \nwill reduce costs and inconvenience while increasing judicial \nefficiency. But most important, it will help ensure that justice is \nmore available and more affordable to the people of northeastern \nWisconsin. For these sensible reasons, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation, either separately or as part of an omnibus judgeship \nbill that I hope Congress will consider next session. The Judicial \nConference has recommended the creation of over 60 new judgeships, yet \nnot one has been created since 1990. Should such a bill be considered, \nI will be right there to ensure that Northeastern Wisconsin is \nincluded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1960\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Judgeship for \n     Northeastern Wisconsin Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN \n                   DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, 1 additional district \n     judge for the eastern district of Wisconsin.\n       (b) Tables.--In order that the table contained in section \n     133(a) of title 28, United States Code, reflects the change \n     in the total number of permanent district judgeships \n     authorized under subsection (a), such table is amended by \n     amending the item relating to Wisconsin to read as follows:\n\n``Wisconsin:\n    ``Eastern....................................................5 ....\n\n    ``Western..................................................2''.....\n\n       (c) Holding of Court.--The chief judge of the eastern \n     district of Wisconsin shall designate 1 judge who shall hold \n     court for such district in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act, including such sums as may \n     be necessary to provide appropriate space and facilities for \n     the judicial position created by this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 8, 1994.\n     U.S Senator Herb Kohl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: We are writing to urge your support for \n     the creation of a Federal District Court in Green Bay. The \n     Eastern District of Wisconsin includes the 28 eastern-most \n     counties from Forest and Florence Counties in the north to \n     Kenosha and Walworth Counties in the south.\n       Green Bay is central to the northern part of the district \n     which includes approximately one third of the district's \n     population. Currently, all Federal District Judges hold court \n     in Milwaukee.\n       A federal court in Green Bay would make federal proceedings \n     much more accessible to the people of northern Wisconsin and \n     would alleviate many problems for citizens and law \n     enforcement. Travel time of 3 or 4 hours each way makes it \n     difficult and expensive for witnesses and officers to go to \n     court in Milwaukee. Citizen witnesses are often reluctant to \n     travel back and forth to Milwaukee. It often takes a whole \n     day to travel to come to court and testify for a few minutes. \n     Any lengthy testimony requires an inconvenient and costly \n     overnight stay in Milwaukee. Sending officers is costly and \n     takes substantial amounts of travel time, thereby reducing \n     the number of officers available on the street. Many cases \n     are simply never referred to federal court because of this \n     cost and inconvenience.\n       In some cases there is no alternative. For example, the \n     Federal government has the obligation to prosecute all felony \n     offenses committed by Indians on the Menominee Reservation. \n     Yet the Reservation's distance from the Federal Courts and \n     prosecutors in Milwaukee poses serious problems. Imagine the \n     District Attorney of Milwaukee being located in Keshena or \n     Green Bay or Marinette and trying to coordinate witness \n     interviews, case preparation, and testimony.\n       As local law enforcement officials, we try to work closely \n     with other local, state and federal agencies, and we believe \n     establishing a Federal District Court in Green Bay will \n     measurably enhance these efforts. Most important, a Federal \n     Court in Green Bay will make these courts substantially more \n     accessible to the citizens who live here.\n       We urge you to introduce and support legislation to create \n     and fund an additional Federal District Court in Green Bay.\n       Gary Robert Bruno, Shawano and Menominee County District \n     Attorney.\n       Jay Conley, Oconto County District Attorney.\n       John DesJardins, Outagamie County District Attorney.\n       Douglas Drexler, Florence County District Attorney.\n       Guy Dutcher, Waushara County District Attorney.\n       E.

Schneider, United States Attorney, Eastern \n         District of Wisconsin.\n       Thank you for your letter of August 8, 1994, urging the \n     creation of a Federal District Court in Green Bay. You point \n     out a number of facts in your letter:\n       (1) Although 1/3 of the population of the Eastern District \n     of Wisconsin is in the northern part of the district, all of \n     the Federal District Courts are located in Milwaukee.\n       (2) A federal court in Green Bay would be more accessible \n     to the people of northern Wisconsin. It would substantially \n     reduce witness travel time and expenses, and it would make \n     federal court more accessible and less costly for local law \n     enforcement agencies.\n       (3) The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over \n     most felonies committed on the Menominee Reservation, located \n     approximately 3 hours from Milwaukee. The distance to \n     Milwaukee is a particular problem for victims, witnesses, and \n     officers from the Reservation.\n       I have discussed this proposal with the chiefs of the \n     federal law enforcement agencies in the Eastern District of \n     Wisconsin, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms, Secret Service, U.S. Marshal, U.S. \n     Customs Service, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal \n     Investigation Division. All express support for such a court \n     and give additional reasons why it is needed.\n       Over the past several years, the FBI, DEA, and IRS have \n     initiated a substantial number of investigations in the \n     northern half of the district. In preparation for indictments \n     and trials, and when needed to testify before the Grand Jury \n     or in court, officers regularly travel to Milwaukee. Each \n     trip requires 4 to 6 hours of round trip travel per day, plus \n     the actual time in court. In other words, the\n\n[[Page S14814]]\n\n     agencies' already scarce resources are severely taxed. \n     Several federal agencies report that many cases which are \n     appropriate for prosecution are simply not charged federally \n     because local law enforcement agencies do not have the \n     resources to bring these cases and officers back and forth to \n     Milwaukee.\n       Nevertheless, there have been a substantial number of \n     successful federal investigations and prosecutions from the \n     Fox Valley area and other parts of the Northern District of \n     Wisconsin including major drug organizations, bank frauds, \n     tax cases, and weapons cases.\n       It is interesting to note that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in \n     the Eastern District of Wisconsin holds hearings in Green \n     Bay, Manitowoc, and Oshkosh, all in the northern half of the \n     district. For the past four years approximately 29 percent of \n     all bankruptcy filings in the district were in these three \n     locations.\n       In addition, we continue to prosecute most felonies \n     committed on the Menominee Reservation. Yet, the \n     Reservation's distance from the federal courts in Milwaukee \n     poses serious problems. A federal court in Green Bay is \n     critically important if the federal government is to live up \n     to its moral and legal obligation to enforce the law on the \n     Reservation.\n       In summary, I appreciate and understand your concerns and I \n     join you in urging the creation of a Federal District Court \n     in Green Bay.\n\n                                          Thomas P. Schneider,\n\n                                           United States Attorney.\n                                    Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1961. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to expand the \nnumber of acres authorized for inclusion in the conservation reserve; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         the conservation reserve program acreage expansion act\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation which would increase the acreage cap currently in place for \nthe Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) under the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA).\n  CRP continues to be a popular alternative for landowners who wish to \ntake a portion of their land out of production for conservation \npurposes. While the program serves a multitude of beneficial purposes, \nthere are items of the program that we must continue to work on in \nCongress. As a start, I am introducing companion legislation to \nCongressman Collin Peterson's (D-MN) bill in the House to increase the \nacreage allotted in CRP up to 45 million acres.\n  CRP has undergone significant changes as a result of the 1996 Farm \nBill. Wildlife benefits provided by certain grass species and \nconservation practices are now heavily emphasized in the Environmental \nBenefits Index (EBI) which sets forth eligibility into the program. \nWhile many of these changes have been welcomed because of the favorable \neffect they have on conservation and the environment, I have some \nconcerns with certain requirements farmers face in relation to the EBI \nrequirements.\n  First, producers with existing CRP contracts that have tracts of land \naccepted for re-enrollment into CRP have indicated that in certain \ncases, they were required to plow under at least half of the existing \ngrass stand on those tracts in order to plant new grass seeds to meet \nthe EBI criteria. Those participants are concerned this may lead to \nsoil erosion instead of soil conservation on tracts that are already \nhighly erodible because plowing up half of grass stand exposes that \nland to the unpredictable forces of weather. Moreover, it often \nrequires more than one growing season for new grass species to take \nroot and establish adequate cover in order to protect habitat. That \nsaid, both producers and conservationists have expressed concern to me \nthat this requirement may place habitat protection in a precarious \nposition in some instances. Finally, the costs of seed varieties called \nfor in the EBI, especially for native grass species, have skyrocketed \nto a point here it is oftentimes cost-prohibitive for producers to meet \nthe requirements of establishing a new grass stand. These and other \nmatters I plan to address with the input of all interested parties as \nwe proceed with the legislation.\n  However, on the whole CRP remains a very popular program in my home \nstate of South Dakota and across the country. During the twelve signups \nheld between 1986 and 1992, 36.4 million acres were enrolled in CRP. \nUSDA estimates that the average erosion rate on enrolled acres was \nreduced from 21 to less than 2 tons per acre per year. Retiring these \nlands also expanded wildlife habitat, enhanced water quality, and \nrestored soil. The annual value of these benefits has been estimated \nfrom less than $1 billion to more than $1.5 billion; some estimates of \nthese benefits approach or exceed annual costs, especially in areas of \nheavy participation. While major changes cannot occur to CRP until we \nundertake a renewed effort to change the Farm Bill, I am hopeful that \nCongress reconsider the current Farm Bill in 2000.\n  In addition to supporting CRP, I have co-sponsored S. 1426, the \nConservation Security Act of 1999. This bill creates a voluntary \nincentive program to encourage conservation activities by landowners. \nThis bill includes a variety of solid conservation practices that \nlandowners may choose from in order to qualify for certain incentives. \nSome of the conservation practices include conservation tillage, runoff \ncontrol, buffer strips, wetland restoration, and wildlife management.\n  I believe the Conservation Security Act is a strong piece of \nlegislation that would benefit agriculture producers, wildlife, and the \nenvironment. I will continue to support and work with Senator Harkin in \nseeing this legislation move forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 1962.

A bill to authorize a study of alternatives to the current \nmanagement of certain Federal lands in Arizona; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  alternatiave land management study for the barry goldwater military \n                             training range\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will require a comprehensive study of alternative land \nmanagement options for areas comprising the Barry Goldwater military \ntraining range and Organ Pipe National Monument in Arizona.\n  Earlier this year, the Congress finalized the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2000 which included language to renew \na land-withdrawal for the Barry Goldwater training range for an \nadditional twenty-five years to the year 2024. The final proposal \ntransferred land management of the natural and cultural resources \nwithin the range to the Air Force and the Navy, a decision that was \nfully supported by both the Interior Department and the President's \nCouncil on Environmental Quality.\n  In practical effect, the Air Force and Marine Corps have been \nperforming the management functions at the Goldwater range for many \nyears, and doing a very good job of it, according to most observers. In \nfact, the Department of Defense already dedicates significant resources \nto land and natural resource management of the Range. The decision to \nformally transfer management recognizes the superior fiscal and \nmanpower resources available to the military Services, who also have \nthe most compelling interest in maintaining future training access to \nthe range, which can only be accomplished by effectively addressing \nenvironmental concerns regarding its use.\n  During consideration of the legislative environmental impact \nstatements and subsequent renewal proposals, no one disagreed that \nessential military training should continue on the range. However, \nseveral environmental groups registered concerns about the \nAdministration's proposal for DOD management of the Range and expressed \ntheir fears that the military Services would be inappropriate and \nineffective natural resources managers. I took personal interest in \nthese expressed concerns and advocated for the strongest possible \nlanguage in the final withdrawal bill to redress any potential problems \nshould the land management of these areas ever be jeopardized under \nprimary military authority.\n  However, in response to continuing apprehension about proper land \nmanagement in the newly passed withdrawal package, I worked with the \nconcerned individuals to develop language directing the Department of \nthe Interior to study and make recommendations for alternative land \nmanagement scenarios for the range. Such a comprehensive study would \nprovide information to guide the Administration and the Congress in \ntaking appropriate future action to ensure that the cultural and \nnatural resources on the range will continue to be preserved and \nprotected in future years.\n  Although I was unable to convince my colleagues that studying various \nland management options should be added to the Defense authorization \npackage, I am continuing to explore appropriate land management options \nfor the long-term. I do so because it is important that we assure that \nthe best possible protection will be provided to the unique natural and \ncultural resources of these areas, consistent with the primary purpose \nof the range.\n  While the Barry Goldwater Range will continue to serve its vital \npurpose, we have an obligation to ensure proper stewardship of our \nnatural resources. This study will provide us with the critical \ninformation necessary to fulfill that obligation. Once an alternative \nmanagement study is completed, I will ensure that any recommendations \nfor improved management of the Goldwater Range are considered and acted \non, as necessary, by the Congress.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to work with me to pass this \nlegislation to ensure that the Goldwater Range is managed by the agency \nmost qualified to protect the public's interest and preserve the \nprecious land and natural resources of these pristine areas for future \ngenerations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1964. A bill to designate the United States Post Office located at \n14071 Peyton Drive in Chino Hills, California, as the Joseph Ileto Post \nOffice; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              DESIGNATION OF THE JOSEPH ILETO POST OFFICE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Boxer in introducing a bill to designate the United States Post \nOffice located at 14071 Peyton Drive in Chino Hills, California, as the \n``Joseph Ileto Post Office.'' This post office would be designated in \nmemory and in celebration of the life of Joseph Santos Ileto, the \nFilipino American postal worker who was brutally gunned down during his \npostal route in August by Buford Furrow, Jr., a white supremacist. Only \nhours earlier, this same assailant opened fire on the North Valley \nJewish Community Center, wounding three young children, one teenager, \nand one elderly woman.\n  Joseph Ileto touched many lives. He was a kind-hearted, intelligent \nman who gave so much to those he loved and even to those he did not \nknow. He was known for his unselfishness and his willingness to give a \nhelping hand to anyone in need. In fact, the day Joseph Ileto was \nkilled, he was filling in for another mail carrier, as he had done so \nmany times before. His life and death exemplify the ultimate sacrifice \nof public service, which we too often take for granted. As a U.S. \nPostal Service employee, he served our nation with honor and dignity \nand died doing his job.\n  My heart goes out to the Ileto family, who is grieving over the death \nof their son, brother, and friend. Despite the sadness of their loss, \nthey can be proud that the life and spirit of Joseph Ileto lives on. \nHis death only confirms the urgency in which we as a community must \ntake a strong stand against hate crimes and racism. The number of hate \ncrimes in the U.S. has increased during the last five years, and the \ntime is now to have dialogue and pass meaningful legislation to address \nthis issue. As a first step, it is my hope that we can expedite passage \nthis bill, to remember and honor the life of Joseph Ileto.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior, the Bureau \nof Reclamation, to conduct a feasibility study on\n\n[[Page S14816]]\n\nthe Jicarilla Apache Reservation in the State of New Mexico, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    legislation authorizing the bureau of reclamation to conduct a \nfeasibility study regarding water supply to the jicarilla apache indian \n                       reservation in new mexico\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nBingaman in introducing legislation authorizing the Bureau of \nReclamation to conduct a feasibility study regarding water supply on \nthe Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation in New Mexico. There are major \ndeficiencies with regard to safe water supplies for residents of the \nJicarilla Apache Reservation, since the federally owned municipal water \nsystem is severely dilapidated.\n  The United States has a trust responsibility to ensure that adequate \nand safe water supplies are available to meet the economic, \nenvironmental, water supply, and public health needs of the Jicarilla \nApache Indian Reservation . Today, the House of Representatives passed \nidentical legislation to help resolve this problem.\n  The Jicarilla Apache Tribe is a federally recognized Indian nation in \nnorthern New Mexico, with over 3,000 citizens. In the 1920s, the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs (BIA) constructed a water delivery system to serve \nfederal facilities on the Reservation. In the 1960s, the system was \nextended to serve tribal facilities and members, but for the last 20 \nyears this federal owned and operated water system has been \ndeteriorating due to inadequate federal funding for regular maintenance \nand improvements.\n  No capital improvements have been made to the system for at least ten \nyears. Currently, the system is not in compliance with Federal safe \ndrinking water standards or pollutant discharge standards.\n  In October of 1988, the inlet system collapsed and caused a \ndevastating five-day water outage on the Reservation. That catastrophe \nrequired emergency assistance from the National Guard. A home burned to \nthe ground without necessary water to fight the fire. After that \nexperience, the Tribe expended its own funds to make some repairs, and \nbegan a large-scale evaluation of the system. The Tribe has discovered \nserious problems with the system.\n  Line breaks are common and frequent, and existing supply facilities \nare near or at maximum capacity. The Jicarilla Apaches have had to \nration water for the last seven summers.\n  According to a recent EPA report, the water system on the Jicarilla \nReservation is the third worst system operating in a six-state region. \nIn addition to being out of compliance with federal drinking water \nstandards, the sewage plant has been operating without a federal \ndischarge permit, exposing the BIA to fines up to $25,000 per day.\n  Sewage lagoons are operating at 200% capacity, and wastewater \nspillage threatens not only the Jicarilla Apaches, but down-stream \ncommunities in New Mexico and beyond. The Jicarilla Apache Tribal \nCouncil has enacted a resolution declaring a state of emergency due to \nthe continued operation of these unsafe water systems.\n  The Tribe has been forced to expend their own funds due to the \nserious health threats posed by the unsafe system. In addition to the \nsevere health threats that these systems pose, their inadequate and \nunsafe condition has virtually suspended social and economic \ndevelopment on the Reservation.\n  The water deficiencies have forced the Tribe to place a moratorium on \nnew projects, including housing, school, senior center, post office, \nand health care facility construction. These projects cannot be \ncompleted, even though many are already funded, because the existing \ninfrastructure cannot support any further development. While the \nfederal government is entirely responsible to maintain and operate the \nfederal water systems which serve the Reservation, the BIA lacks the \nresources improve the system.\n  The water system on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation is one of only \ntwo or three such systems still being maintained by the BIA. The BIA \ndoes not even own equipment necessary for routine sewer cleaning. While \nthe BIA has continued federal responsibility for these systems, BIA no \nlonger budgets for water delivery systems.\n  In fact, Kevin Gover of the BIA referred the Tribe to the Bureau of \nReclamation for assistance. The Bureau of Reclamation has the needed \nexpertise to help, having experience in providing water to Native \nAmericans through irrigation projects, as well as providing water \nsupplies to other rural communities.\n  The Tribe wants to eventually own and operate the water system, and \nwishes to enter into a relationship with the Bureau of Reclamation for \ncompletion of rehabilitation of this project. This legislation will \nallow the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study to \ndetermine the best method for developing a safe and adequate municipal, \nrural, and industrial water supply for the residents of the Jicarilla \nApache Indian Reservation in the State of New Mexico.\n  We want to help the Jicarilla Apaches end their water crisis, and \nsecure congressional authorization for the necessary studies the Bureau \nof Reclamation has the expertise to conduct. I ask unanimous consent \nthat our proposed legislation and the Jicarilla Apache Counsel \nResolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1965\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are major deficiencies with regard to adequate \n     and sufficient water supplies available to resident of the \n     Jicarilla Apache Reservation in the State of New Mexico.\n       (2) the existing municipal water system that serves the \n     Jicarilla Apache Reservation is under the ownership and \n     control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and is outdated, \n     dilapidated, and cannot adequately and safely serve the \n     existing and future growth needs of the Jicarilla Apache \n     Tribe;\n       (3) the federally owned municipal water system on the \n     Jicarilla Apache Reservation has been unable to meet the \n     minimum Federal water requirements necessary for discharging \n     wastewater into a public watercourse and has been operating \n     without a Federal discharge permit;\n       (4) the federally owned municipal water system that serves \n     the Jicarilla Apache Reservation has been cited by the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency for violations of \n     Federal safe drinking standards and poses a threat to public \n     health and safety both on and off the Jicarilla Apache \n     Reservation;\n       (5) the lack of reliable supplies of potable water impedes \n     economic development and has detrimental effects on the \n     quality of life and economic self-sufficiency of the \n     Jicarilla Apache Tribe;\n       (6) due to the severe health threats and impediments to \n     economic development, the Jicarilla Apache Tribe has \n     authorized and expended $4,500,000 of tribal funds for the \n     repair and replacement of the municipal water system on the \n     Jicarilla Apache Reservation; and\n       (7) the United States has a trust responsibility to ensure \n     that adequate and safe water supplies are available to meet \n     the economic, environmental, water supply, and public health \n     needs of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--Pursuant to reclamation laws, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation \n     and in consultation and cooperation with the Jicarilla Apache \n     Tribe, shall conduct a feasibility study to determine the \n     most feasible method of developing a safe and adequate \n     municipal, rural, and industrial water supply for the \n     residents of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation in the \n     State of New Mexico.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after funds are \n     appropriated to carry out this Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall transmit to Congress a report containing the \n     results of the feasibility study required by subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $200,000 to carry \n     out this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         The Jicarilla Apache Tribe--Resolution No. 99-R-314-06\n\n       Whereas, the Jicarilla Apache Tribe is a federally \n     recognized Indian tribe organized under Section 17 of the \n     Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 476 (1988); \n     and\n       Whereas, the inherent powers of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe \n     are vested in the Jicarilla Apache Tribal Council pursuant to \n     Article XI, Section 1 of the Revised Constitution of the \n     Jicarilla Apache Tribe; and\n       Whereas, the Jicarilla Apache Tribal Council is authorized \n     by Article XI, Section I(d) of the Revised Constitution of \n     the Jicarilla Apache Tribe to enact ordinances to promote the \n     peace, safety, property, health and general welfare of the \n     people of the Reservation and is authorized by Article X of \n     the Revised Constitution to enact ordinances and resolutions \n     on matters of permanent interest to\n\n[[Page S14817]]\n\n     the members of the tribe and on matters relating to \n     particular individuals, officials or circumstances; and\n       Whereas, the Jicarilla Apache Tribal Council has the power \n     to authorize tribal officials to act on its behalf for \n     regulatory and other purposes; and\n       Whereas, the lack of adequate and safe drinking water \n     facilities on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation leads to \n     serious health problems among tribal members and other \n     residents of the Reservation, such as early loss of life and \n     morbidity and diseases; and\n       Whereas, the current water treatment plant, water delivery \n     infrastructure and sewage systems that serve the Jicarilla \n     Apache Reservation are owned and operated by the United \n     States, through the Jicarilla Agency Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     (``BIA''); and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has a trust responsibility \n     to provide safe drinking water to the Jicarilla Apache people \n     and the United States has failed to carry out this \n     responsibility by not providing the BIA adequate resources to \n     properly maintain and operate the water systems;\n       Whereas, in October 1998, due to the lack of adequate \n     Federal resources to properly maintain and operate the water \n     systems, the inlet system, which diverts water from the \n     Navajo River, collapsed causing a catastrophic five-day water \n     outage on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, which \n     necessitated emergency relief by the National Guard; and\n       Whereas, the Jicarilla Apache Tribe worked around the clock \n     to restore water and expended tribal funds to do so, and as a \n     result of the water outage, the Jicarilla Apache Tribe began \n     investigating and evaluating the operation of the water \n     systems and discovered numerous additional problems; and\n       Whereas, the water treatment plant, which treats water \n     diverted from the Navajo River prior to being released for \n     public consumption in Dulce, New Mexico, has been the subject \n     of various notices of environmental non-compliance by the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'');\n       Whereas, the sewage facilities that serve the Jicarilla \n     Apache Reservation are not in compliance with Federal law and \n     are operating without a federal discharge permit, which \n     exposes the BIA to fines up to $25,000 a day, and to meet the \n     national requirements, a new waste water plant must be \n     constructed; and\n       Whereas, although the Federal Government is responsible for \n     maintaining and operating its own water systems that serve \n     the Reservation, the Tribe has been forced to take action out \n     of its own funds due to the serious health threats the these \n     deficient and unsafe systems have on the people within and \n     near the Reservation; and\n       Whereas, based on the analysis and recommendation of the \n     Tribe's engineers and consultants, the Tribal Council has \n     authorized the construction of a new inlet system, waste \n     water treatment plant, and sewage facilities and the upgrade \n     and rehabilitation of the water delivery infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act, in \n     1996 and found, among other things, that:\n       (1) safe drinking water is essential to the protection of \n     public health;\n       (2) because the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) now exceed the financial and \n     technical capacity of some public water systems, especially \n     many small public water systems, the Federal Government needs \n     to provide assistance to communities to help the communities \n     meet Federal drinking water requirements;\n       (3) more effective protection of public health requires \n     prevention of drinking water contamination through well-\n     trained system operators, water systems with adequate \n     managerial, technical and financial capacity and enhanced \n     protection of source waters of public water systems;\n       (4) compliance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act continues to be a concern at public water systems \n     experiencing technical and financial limitations and Federal, \n     State and local governments need more resources and more \n     effective authority to attain the objectives of the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act;\n       (5) Federal health services to maintain and improve the \n     health of the Indians are consistent with and required by the \n     Federal Government's trust relationship with the American \n     Indian people;\n       Whereas, the repair and replacement authorization by the \n     Tribal Council is consistent with the Congressional purposes \n     of ensuring safe drinking water to the public; and\n       Whereas, Indian tribes are recognized as domestic nations \n     under the protection of the United States Government and \n     possessed with the inherent powers of government; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to the Federal trust relationship between \n     the Federal government and Indian tribes arising from the \n     United States Constitution, United States Supreme Court \n     caselaw, numerous treaties, statutes, and regulations, the \n     Federal government had fiduciary duties to Indian tribes to \n     protect tribal self-government and to provide and ensure \n     adequate and safe drinking water; and\n       Whereas, in accordance with the Federal policy of Indian \n     Self-Determination, the Federal government has pledged to \n     assist Indian tribes in making reservations permanent homes \n     from Indian people; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Indian policy of Self-Determination \n     and the Federal trust responsibility to Indian tribes \n     requires that the Federal government conduct government-to-\n     government consultations with Indian tribes on matters \n     affecting tribal interests and to promote tribal economic \n     development, tribal governments, tribal self-sufficiency, \n     which includes proper and adequate and safe drinking water \n     facilities.\n       Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, by the Tribal Council of \n     the Jicarilla Apache Tribe that the Tribal Council hereby \n     declares that the Jicarilla Apache Reservation is in a state \n     of critical emergency due to the continued operation of the \n     unsafe water systems that serve the Jicarilla Apache \n     Reservation.\n       Be It Further Resolved, by the Tribal Council of the \n     Jicarilla Apache Tribe that the Tribal Council, hereby \n     authorizes the Vice-President and his staff to do all acts \n     immediate and necessary to address this emergency, including \n     but not limited to, executing contracts, consulting on a \n     government-to-government basis with Congressional members and \n     the Executive Branch, including the Federal agencies and the \n     White House and lobbying for congressional appropriations.\n       And Be It Further Resolved, by the Tribal Council of the \n     Jicarilla Apache Tribe that the Jicarilla Apache Tribe calls \n     upon the United States Congress and the United States \n     Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau \n     of Reclamation, the Department of Health and Human Services \n     and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, to \n     exercise their Federal Trust Responsibility and work with the \n     Jicarilla Apache Tribe on a government-to-government basis to \n     address this emergency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 1967. A bill to make technical corrections to the status of \ncertain land held in trust for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, \nto take certain land into trust for that Band, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                  MISSISSIPPI BAND OF CHOCTAW INDIANS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nmake technical corrections to the status of certain land held in trust \nfor the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and to take certain land \ninto trust for the Band.\n  Mr. President, the lands involved in this bill are lands currently \nowned by the tribe. Over the last 20 years, the tribe has attempted to \ntransfer the land to reservation land, through the regular processes of \nthe Department of Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land \ntransfer applications have the support of the State of Mississippi and \nthe local neighboring governments.\n  Countless times over the years, the tribe has been told by the \nDepartment that land transfer applications have been lost and that \naction would occur soon.\n  Housing, a school and a medical clinic are among the construction \nplans that are detained because of the inaction by the Department and \nBIA. Mr. President, this tribe is simply out of time. The school \nwaiting to be replaced has over two pages of safety violations from the \nBIA. The medical clinic will not pass its next inspection. Thousands of \nMississippi Choctaw citizens have substandard living conditions because \nof the lack of available housing.\n  Mr. President, the Choctaws are held up as the best example of self \ndetermination. Yet, the federal government seems determined to throw \nobstacles in the course of their success. The history of these land \nacquisition applications and the treatment of the tribe is intolerable.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed the bill and advises it \nhas no budgetary impact. I urge the Senate to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1969. A bill to provide for improved management of, and increases \naccountability for, outfitted activities by which the public gains \naccess to and occupancy and use of Federal land, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    the outfitter policy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today in \nconjunction with my colleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Thomas the \nOutfitter Policy Act of 1999.\n  This legislation is very similar to legislation I introduced in the \npast congress. As that legislation did, this bill would put into law \nmany of the management practices by which federal land management \nagencies have successfully managed the outfitter and guide industry on \nNational Forests, National Parks and other federal lands over many \ndecades.\n\n[[Page S14818]]\n\n  The bill recognizes that many Americans want and seek out the skills \nand experience of commercial outfitters and guides to help them enjoy a \nsafe and pleasant journey through our forests and deserts and over the \nrivers and lakes that are the spectacular destinations for many \nvisitors to our federal lands.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act would assure the public continued \nopportunities for reasonable and safe access to the special areas found \nthroughout our public lands. It establishes high standards that will be \nmet for the health and welfare of visitors who choose outfitted \nservices. It will help guarantee that quality professional services. It \nwill help guarantee that will be available for their recreational and \neducational experiences on federal land.\n  This legislation is needed because the management of outfitting and \nguiding services by this Administration had created problems that \nthreaten to destabilize many of these typically small, independent \noutfitter and guide businesses. In addressing these problems, this \nlegislation relies heavily on practices that have historically worked \nwell for outfitters, visitors, and other users groups, as well as for \nfederal land managers in the field. When the bill is enacted, it will \nassure that these past levels of service are continued and enhanced.\n  Previous hearings and discussions on prior versions of this \nlegislation helped to refine the bill I am introducing today. This \nprocess provided the intended opportunity for discussion. It allowed \nfor the examination of the historical practices that have offered \nconsistent, reliable outfitter services to the public. The legislation \nI am now introducing is a result of that process.\n  I look forward to considering this legislation in the coming session \nof the 106th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Outfitter Policy Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the experience, skills, trained staff, and investment \n     in equipment that are provided by authorized outfitters are \n     necessary to provide access to Federal land to members of the \n     public that need or desire commercial outfitted activities to \n     facilitate their use and enjoyment of recreational or \n     educational opportunities on Federal land;\n       (2) such activities constitute an important contribution \n     toward meeting the recreational and educational objectives of \n     resource management plans approved and administered by \n     agencies of the Department of Agriculture and the Department \n     of the Interior;\n       (3) an effective relationship between those agencies and \n     authorized outfitters requires implementation of agency \n     policies and programs that provide for--\n       (A) a reasonable opportunity for an authorized outfitter to \n     realize a profit;\n       (B) a fair and reasonable return to the United States \n     through appropriate fees;\n       (C) renewal of outfitter permits based on a performance \n     evaluation system that rewards outfitters that meet required \n     performance standards and discontinues outfitters that fail \n     to meet those standards; and\n       (D) transfer of an outfitter permit to the qualified \n     purchaser of the operation of an authorized outfitter, an \n     heir or assign, or another qualified person or entity; and\n       (4) the provision of opportunities for outfitted visitors \n     to Federal land to engage in fishing and hunting is best \n     served by continued recognition that the States retain \n     primary authority over the taking of fish and wildlife on \n     Federal land.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish terms and conditions of access to, and \n     occupancy and use of, Federal land by visitors who require or \n     desire the assistance of an authorized outfitter; and\n       (2) to establish a stable regulatory climate that \n     encourages a qualified person or entity to provide, and to \n     continue to invest in the ability to provide, outfitted \n     visitors with access to, and occupancy and use of, Federal \n     land.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, \nwith respect to the liability of the United States for claims of \nmilitary personnel for damages for certain injuries; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  feres doctrine reversal legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce a bill \nwhich will overturn what has come to be known as the ``Feres \ndoctrine.'' In the 1950 case of Feres v. U.S., the Supreme Court held \nthat the United States Government is not liable under the Federal Tort \nClaims Act for injuries to military personnel where the injuries are \nsustained ``incident to service.'' Under the Feres doctrine, therefore, \na soldier would not be able to seek compensation from the government \nfor injuries sustained due to government negligence unless the soldier \nhappened to be on leave or furlough at the time he or she sustained the \ninjuries.\n  Over the years, we have seen the Feres doctrine produce anomalous \nresults which reflect neither the will of\n\n[[Page S14822]]\n\nthe Congress nor basic common sense. For instance, under Feres, a \nsoldier who is the victim of medical malpractice at an army hospital \ncannot sue the government for compensation. Likewise, his family cannot \nsue for compensation if the soldier dies from the malpractice. But a \ncivilian who suffers from the same malpractice would be entitled to \nfile suit against the government. Likewise, if a soldier driving home \nfrom work on an army base is hit by a negligently driven army truck, he \nis barred from suing the government for compensation. If the soldier \ndies in the accident, his family will be barred from suing for \ncompensation. Meanwhile, a civilian hit by the same truck would have a \ncause of action against the United States. Unfortunately, the \nindividuals hurt by the Feres doctrine are the men and women of our \narmed forces--people whom we should protect and reward, not punish.\n  The recent decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in O'Neil \nv. United States illustrates the troubling results produced by the \nFeres doctrine. In O'Neil, the family of slain Naval officer Kerryn \nO'Neil was barred from pursuing a wrongful death claim against the \ngovernment under the Feres doctrine. O'Neil was murdered by her former \nfiance, George Smith, a Navy ensign. The two met at the U.S. Naval \nAcademy and were stationed at the same Naval base in California. After \nMs. O'Neil broke off their engagement, Mr. Smith began to stalk her. \nOne night while Ms. O'Neil was sitting in her on-base apartment \nwatching a movie with a friend, Smith came to her building and killed \nher, her friend, and then himself.\n  After the murders, Kerryn O'Neil's family learned that Mr. Smith had \nscored in the 99.99th percentile for aggressive/destructive behavior in \nNavy psychological tests. Under Naval procedures, these results should \nhave been forwarded to the Department of Psychiatry at the Naval \nHospital for a full psychological evaluation. Had their claim not been \nbarred, the O'Neils would have argued that the Navy was negligent in \nfailing to follow up on these extreme test results. I do not know \nwhether the O'Neil's deserved to be compensated under the Act--this \ndepends on the specific facts and the case law in this area. But it \ndoes seem clear to me that the O'Neils should not have been barred from \npursuing their claim because their daughter's fatal injuries were \nsustained ``incident to service.''\n  Of course, there are situations in which soldiers should not be \nallowed to sue the government in tort. For example, in a combat \nsituation, countless judgment calls are made which result in death or \ninjuries to soldiers. We cannot have lawyers and juries second guessing \nthe decisions made by field commanders and combatants in the heat of \nbattle. But such considerations do not necessitate that military \npersonnel should lose the right to sue the government in any context.\n  The bill I introduce today will reverse the court-created Feres \ndoctrine and return the law to the way it was originally intended by \nCongress. My bill is very short and simple. It amends the Federal Tort \nClaims Act to specifically provide that the Act applies to military \npersonnel on active duty the same as it applies to anyone else. My bill \nfurther specifies that military personnel will be limited by the \nexceptions to government liability already included in the Act, \nincluding the bar on liability for injuries sustained by military \npersonnel in combat and the bar on liability for claims which arise in \na foreign country. In short, my bill will ensure that members of our \narmed forces will be entitled to damages they deserve when injured \nthrough the negligence or wrongful actions of the Federal government or \nits agents, except for certain limited cases contemplated by Congress \nwhen it originally passed the Act.\n\n  Congress passed the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946 to give the \ngeneral consent of the government to be sued in tort, subject to \nseveral specific restrictions. Under the common law doctrine of \nsovereign immunity, the United States cannot be sued without such \nspecific consent. The Act provides that the government will be held \nliable ``in the same manner and to the same extent as a private \nindividual under the circumstances.'' Thus, the Act makes the United \nStates liable for the torts of its employees and agents to the extent \nthat private employers are liable under state law for the torts of \ntheir employees and agents.\n  The Act contains many exceptions to government liability, but it does \nnot contain an explicit exception for injuries sustained by military \npersonnel incident to service. In fact, one of the Act's exceptions \nprevents ``any claim arising out of the combatant activities of the \nmilitary or naval forces, or the Coast Guard during time of war.'' By \nincluding this exception, Congress clearly contemplated the special \ncase of military personnel and decided that certain limits must be \nplaced on government liability in this context. But by drawing this \nexception narrowly and limiting it to combat situations, Congress \nrejected any broad exception for injuries sustained ``incident to \nservice.'' The Supreme Court did far more than interpret our statute \nwhen it significantly broadened the limited combat exception provided \nby Congress. This bill leaves intact the government's exemption for \ninjuries sustained in combat.\n  The Feres doctrine has been the subject of harsh criticism by some of \nthe leading jurists in the nation. In the 1987 case of United States v. \nJohnson, a 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court held that the Feres \ndoctrine bars suits on behalf of military personnel injured incident to \nservice even in cases of torts committed by employees of civilian \nagencies. Justice Scalia wrote a scathing dissent in Johnson, in which \nhe was joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens. Scalia wrote \nthat Feres was ``wrongly decided and heartily deserves the widespread, \nalmost universal criticism it has received.''\n  Judge Edward Becker, the Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, has also spoken out strongly against the Feres doctrine. He \nhas noted that ``the scholarly criticism of the doctrine is legion'' \nand has urged the Supreme Court to grant cert. to reconsider Feres. \nJudge Becker has written to me that given the failure of the Court to \noverturn Feres thus far, I should introduce legislation doing so.\n  Even in the Feres opinion itself, the Supreme Court expressed an \nuncharacteristic doubt about its decision. The justices recognized that \nthey may be misinterpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act. They called \nupon Congress to correct their mistake if this were the case. The Court \nwrote:\n\n       There are few guiding materials for our task of statutory \n     construction. No committee reports or floor debates disclose \n     what effect the statute was designed to have on the problem \n     before us, or that it even was in mind. Under these \n     circumstances, no conclusion can be above challenge, but if \n     we misinterpret the Act, at least Congress possesses a ready \n     remedy.\n\n  Congress does possess a ready remedy, and I call upon my colleagues \nto exercise it. The bill I introduce today will eliminate the \njudicially created Feres doctrine and revive the original framework of \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act. There is no reason to deny compensation to \nthe men and women of our armed services who are injured or killed in \ndomestic accidents or violence outside the heat of combat. I hope that \nwhen we resume our business next year my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting and passing this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

CONGRESS \n    REGARDING A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT IN THE STATE OF \n                 CHIAPAS, MEXICO AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Jeffords, \nMr. Torricelli, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Feingold, \nMr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas the United States and Mexico have a long history of \n     close relations and share a wide range of interests;\n       Whereas a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Mexico is of \n     vital importance to the security of the United States.\n       Whereas the United States Government provides assistance \n     and licenses exports of military equipment to Mexican \n     security forces for counter-narcotics purposes;\n\n[[Page S14824]]\n\n       Whereas the Department of State's 1998 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices in Mexico stated that a ``culture of \n     impunity pervades the security forces'' and documented human \n     rights violations, including arbitrary detention, torture, \n     extrajudicial killings, and disappearances, by these forces;\n       Whereas confrontations in August 1999 between members of \n     the Mexican military and supporters of the Zapatista National \n     Liberation Army (EZLN) in Chiapas, Mexico are representative \n     of the political tension and violence that has plagued the \n     region for years;\n       Whereas the conflict has its roots in the poverty and \n     injustice suffered by the indigenous people of Chiapas, and \n     shared by the poor in the neighboring states of Oaxaca and \n     Guerrero;\n       Whereas the lack of progress in implementing a preliminary \n     peace agreement signed in 1996 and the intimidating level of \n     militarization by the Mexican army, paramilitary groups and \n     the EZLN has resulted in the forced displacement of thousands \n     of indigenous people and exacerbated the impoverished \n     conditions in Chiapas;\n       Whereas on September 14, 1999, the Commission for Peace and \n     Reconciliation in Chiapas of the Conference of Mexican \n     Catholic Bishops urged the Government of Mexico to consider \n     relocating military forces in Chiapas to only those positions \n     absolutely necessary to maintaining the integrity and \n     security of Mexico;\n       Whereas the Government of Mexico has devoted resources to \n     reduce poverty in Chiapas, but the breakdown in peace \n     negotiations and the lack of trust between the Mexican \n     Government and some indigenous communities have limited the \n     impact of that assistance;\n       Whereas on September 7, 1999, the Government of Mexico \n     pledged to renew dialogue with the EZLN, support the \n     formation of a new mediation tea, and investigate human \n     rights abuses in Chiapas;\n       Whereas the EZLN has not yet accepted the Government of \n     Mexico's overtures to resume negotiations; and\n       Whereas the summary expulsions of American citizens and \n     human rights monitors from Mexico are inconsistent with the \n     freedoms of movement, association and expression: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Secretary of State should--\n       (1) take effective measures to ensure that United States \n     assistance and exports of equipment to Mexican security \n     forces--\n       (A) are used primarily for counter-narcotics purposes; and\n       (B) are not provided to units of security forces that have \n     been implicated in human rights violations, unless the \n     Government of Mexico is taking effective measures to bring \n     the individuals responsible to justice;\n       (2) encourage the EZLN and the Government of Mexico to take \n     steps to create conditions for good faith negotiations that \n     address the social, economic and political causes of the \n     conflict in Chiapas, to achieve a peaceful and lasting \n     resolution of the conflict, and to vigorously pursue such \n     negotiations;\n       (3) commend the Government of Mexico for its renewed \n     commitment to negotiations and for establishing a date for \n     the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to \n     visit Mexico to discuss human rights concerns there;\n       (4) give a higher priority in discussions with the \n     Government of Mexico to criminal justice reforms that protect \n     human rights, emphasizing United States concerns about \n     arbitrary detention, torture, extra judicial killings, and \n     disappearances, and the failure to prosecute individuals \n     responsible for these crimes; and\n       (5) urge the Government of Mexico to implement the \n     recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human \n     Rights, particularly with regard to American citizens and \n     others who have been summarily expelled from Mexico in \n     violation of Mexican law and international law.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today submitting a concurrent \nresolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding measures to \nachieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the state of Chiapas, \nMexico.\n  This resolution is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, \nJeffords, Torricelli, Murray, Durbin, Wellstone, Feingold, Harkin, \nKerry, Mikulski, and Boxer.\n  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi is introducing an identical resolution \ntoday in the House of Representatives.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to convey our support for a \npeaceful settlement of the conflict in Chiapas that has been simmering \nsince the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Since then, and despite repeated \nattempts at negotiations, the situation remains tense and prospects for \nproductive dialogue remote. In August, armed confrontations between \nmembers of the Mexican military and Zapatista supporters in Chiapas was \na reminder of the political violence that has plagued the region for \nyears. I submitted a similar resolution just over a year ago and, \nunfortunately, the situation remains largely unchanged.\n  This resolution does not attempt to take sides or to dictate an \noutcome of that conflict. It is not meant to embarrass or interfere in \nMexico's internal affairs. The situation in Chiapas is a complex one \nthat has social, ethnic, economic and political dimensions. It is a \nmanifestation of years of Mexican history. It is for the Mexican people \nto resolve.\n  But despite its complexities, there is no doubt that the indigenous \npeople of Chiapas have been the victims of injustice for centuries. \nMost do not own any land and they live--as their parents and \ngrandparents did--in abject poverty. The 1994 Zapatista uprising, in \nwhich some 150 people died, was a reflection of that injustice and \ndespair, and the political tension and violence of recent years has \nonly exacerbated their plight.\n  To his credit, President Zedillo has devoted considerable financial \nresources to address the poverty and lack of basic services in Chiapas. \nOn September 7, 1999, he pledged to renew dialogue with the Zapatistas \nand investigate human rights abuses there. The scheduled November 23rd \nvisit to Mexico by Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights, is an important and welcome development. I am hopeful \nthat the Mexican Government will engage in an open dialogue with Ms. \nRobinson and that progress can be made on ways to further promote and \nprotect human rights in Mexico.\n  Despite these positive steps, however, Mexican officials indicate \nthat they expect little progress toward resolving the conflict before \nthe presidential elections in July 2000. This is very disappointing. \nWhile mistrust runs deep on both sides, a great deal can be \naccomplished in eight months if the parties to the conflict are willing \nto take the steps to create conditions for good faith negotiations to \nsucceed, and then sit down at the table together.\n  There is little evidence that the Mexican Government's strategy is \nworking. Since early 1998, the Zedillo administration has, on the one \nhand, lavishly funded social programs in those indigenous communities \nin Chiapas that are willing to accept them. On the other hand, Mexican \ntroops have tightened their grip on the impoverished communities of \nZapatista supporters. They patrol the roads in and out of Chiapas in \narmored vehicles, brandishing weapons and establishing military check-\npoints and bases when it is abundantly clear that neither the \ncommunities, nor the Zapatistas themselves, pose a credible threat to \nthe Mexican Government. In addition, paramilitary forces, responsible \nfor some of the worst atrocities, continue to operate in the region.\n  Human rights monitors, including Mexican citizens, have been \nharassed, and foreigners, including American citizens, have been \nsummarily expelled from Mexico for activities that amount to nothing \nmore than criticizing the policies of the Mexican Government.\n  The Zapatistas have also contributed to their isolation. They have \nnot accepted the Mexican Government's recent overtures to resume \ndialogue and seem resigned to wait in their jungle stronghold until \nthere is a new government before considering a return to talks. Again, \nJuly is a long way away, especially for the Zapatistas' supporters who \nstruggle every day just to find food and shelter for themselves and \ntheir families. They have suffered long enough.\n  Mr. President, this resolution calls on our Secretary of State to \nencourage the Mexican Government and the Zapatistas to support \nnegotiations that address the underlying causes of the conflict, to \nachieve a lasting peace. It seeks to convey our concern about the \npeople of Chiapas, and the urgent need for concrete progress to resolve \na conflict that has cost many innocent lives and threatens the economic \nand political development of our southern neighbor.\n  A stable, peaceful and prosperous Mexico is not only in the best \ninterest of all Mexicans, it is also in the economic and security \ninterests of the United States.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense-of-\nthe-Senate Resolution regarding the urgent need for the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture to resolve its civil rights discrimination cases. On \nbehalf of Senator Burns, the bill's cosponsor, and myself, I urge the \nSenate to recognize the urgency of this situation.\n  Mr. President, there exists a strong public policy against \ndiscrimination against minority groups, whether the discrimination is \ncommitted by private individuals or by the Government in the operation \nof its programs, and it is our firmly held belief that whenever \ndiscrimination occurs in the conduct of Government programs, the \nresponsible Government agencies should take quick and aggressive action \nto remedy such discrimination.\n  I am most concerned that over the past year, such action has not been \ntaken by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Civil Rights. \nIn fact, many Montana civil rights cases that my office and that of \nSenator's Burns have been working with are seriously backlogged in the \nsystem and have consequently remained unsatisfactorily addressed.\n  We have worked hard with the Montana Department of Agriculture's Farm \nAgency to resolve these cases. The Director of the FSA and the State \nFSA Committee has worked hard to resolve any outstanding problems \nconcerning its programs and have made certain that these kinds of \nproblems to not occur in Montana. I commend their outreach efforts in \nensuring the equitable delivery of the Agency's programs to all \neligible Montana recipients.\n  We need a better working relationship with the USDA's Office of Civil \nRights to bring the outstanding cases to resolution in a timely manner. \nRepeated phone calls and requests have yielded few answers. For that \nreason, I am offering this resolution which binds the agency to its \nmission of facilitating the fair and equitable treatment of USDA \ncustomers and employees while ensuring the delivery and enforcement of \ncivil rights programs and activities. Further we hope to commit the \nUSDA to treating its customers with dignity and respect as well as to \nproviding quality and timely products and services. Finally, the \nresolution resolves that not later than March 1, 2000, the Secretary \nshould resolve all the outstanding cases of alleged civil rights \ndiscrimination by the Department of Agriculture.\n  It is high time to bring this issue to resolution, and I appreciate \nthe Senate's consideration of this important matter.\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I am pleased to be joined by Mr. \nBaucus, in sponsoring a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which addresses \nthe backlog of Montana civil rights complaints at the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture (USDA).\n  Last year, a finding was made that the USDA had, for decades, been \nguilty of violating many of America's producer's civil rights. When \nthese producers tried to take advantage of the programs offered by the \nUSDA they were treated differently than their friends and neighbors. We \nenacted Legislation last fall, that was intended to right this wrong. \nEven with passage of this provision, it remains a difficult challenge \nto ensure that those who have been harmed by USDA will receive a prompt \nand balanced resolution of their complaints.\n  It appears that a number of those previously investigated complaints \nhave fallen into some sort of ``black hole''. Despite numerous phone \ncalls and concerted pressure, no progress has been made in resolving \nthese cases. We have been contacted by a number of Montanans who have \nshared horror stories about the treatment their cases have received \nfrom the USDA's Office of Civil Rights. These complaints are simply \nbeing ignored. The inadequacy of this process is adding insult to \ninjury, keeping these producers in limbo and allowing their complaints \nto rest, unresolved. These constituents cannot get on with their lives \nuntil the USDA takes action. For those who have justified complaints, \nthis delay is another slap in the face.\n  This resolution expreses the sense of the Senate that USDA's delays \nmust stop. These cases must be resolved soon. It is our intent that \nthey be resolved by March 1, 2000. These producers has suffered too \nmuch already. They cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  We look forward to working with members of other states affected by \nthis abuse of the civil rights program to resolve these complaints as \nquickly a possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14825-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14825-S14826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  FURTHER CONTINUING RESOLUTION, 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BYRD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2780\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bunning, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Murkowski, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Burns, Mr.\n\n[[Page S14826]]\n\nKyl, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Grams) proposed an \namendment to the joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nstand before the Senate today and pay tribute to a man who has greatly \ninfluenced the cultural maturity of my home state of Vermont. Graham \nStiles Newell will be honored as Citizen of the Year by the Vermont \nChamber of Commerce on December 4, 1999. Graham has made extraordinary \ncontributions to Vermont in many areas throughout his life. And he has \nmade his biggest contributions in one area in which I have spent a \ngreat deal of legislative energy--education.\n  Graham Newell probably learned to read before he learned to walk. I \nunderstand that he first secured a library card at the Saint Johnsbury \nAtheneum when he was in the first grade. Since then, he has been \npassing on his knowledge to anyone willing to learn, and that number is \nlarger than you can imagine. After graduating from the University of \nChicago in 1938, he launched an incredible career in education, one \nthat touched three generations of many Vermont families.\n  Graham has been a leader in Vermont education in both the \nprofessional and legislative arenas. In the last seven decades he has \nbeen a teacher at the Junior High, High School, and College level, and \nwill undoubtably keep teaching well into the next millennium. Graham \nbegan his teaching career at his alma mater, Saint\n\n[[Page S14827]]\n\nJohnsbury Academy, in 1938, and remained on the faculty for nine years. \nFrom 1945 to 1982 he taught history at Lyndon State College full-time. \nAfter ``retiring'' in 1982, he returned to the Academy to teach Latin, \nwhere you will still find him today. He also continued to teach one or \ntwo history classes a semester at Lyndon State College until 1996.\n  Most people consider Latin a dead language, but if you were to enter \nGraham's classroom today you would find it to be as alive and enjoyable \nas ever. A testament to Graham's teaching skills was demonstrated at \nthe Academy in 1997, when 47 of his 52 Latin students, over 90 percent, \nmade honors on the National Latin Exam, an extremely challenging test \ntaken by over 90,000 students across the United States.\n  Graham's contributions to education do not end in the classroom. \nWhile teaching, he also served in the Vermont Legislature for over 25 \nyears. He was a member and chair of the Vermont Senate Education \nCommittee during the 1960s, helping to create Vermont's education laws. \nIndeed, the self proclaimed Ambassador of the Northeast Kingdom has \npositively affected every single student in the state of Vermont over \nthe last 30 years. In fact, his influence has even reached students \noutside of Vermont, due to his tenure on the New England Board of \nHigher Education. But Graham always remained supremely faithful to the \nstudents in his classroom, once even teaching class over the phone from \nthe Vermont Statehouse.\n  One can look at Graham's education accomplishments alone and see a \nlifetime of work and success. However, his influence has touched many \nin other fields as well. As President of the Vermont Historical Society \nfrom 1965 to 1969, his many successes included securing a permanent \nhome for the organization in the historic Pavilion Office Building in \nMontpelier. He has also served on a number of commissions, including \nthe Commission on Interstate Cooperation, the Historic Sites \nCommission, the Commission to Study State Government (or ``Little \nHoover'' as we called it), the Vermont Civil War Centennial Commission, \nthe board of managers of the Council of State Governments, and the \nEducation Commission of the States. In addition, the thousands of \npeople who check into the Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital each \nyear should be thankful to Graham as he is largely responsible for its \nexistence. I could go on, but I'm afraid it would take the remainder of \nthis session of congress to do so.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to provide my colleagues with a \nshining example of a real Vermont renaissance man. I join countless \nVermonters in offering my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to \nGraham Stiles Newell for his many years of hard work and dedication to \nthe citizens of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14827-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BARB RABE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of \nBarb Rabe, who retired after 29 years of service in the Oshkosh School \nDistrict. She began her career in the Oshkosh School District in 1970 \nat the Perry Tipler Middle School as a Teachers Assistant, and then \ntransferred to Oakwood Elementary School where she served for the next \n27 years. During her years of service, Barb worked for six principals, \nadapting to each new principal's style, and was always actively \ninvolved as the staff grew from 12 to 42 and the student population \ngrew from 200 to 500. She worked hard at creating partnerships with \nstaff, students and families that would foster collaboration, \ncooperation and allegiance. Barb's strong work ethic, energy and \nenthusiasm will be missed.\n  While mastering the key elements of organization and flexibility, \ngiving of her time and talent in serving the faculty and students of \nOakwood School, and showing love and appreciation for students, she \nalso came up with new ideas to adapt to the changing work environment. \nShe developed the computerized milk and lunch money collection program \nat the school, which helped the school collect money more efficiently \nand thoroughly. She also purchased her own computer years before the \nschool purchased them and took her work home to complete it in an \norganized fashion. When Oakwood School became computerized, she played \nan instrumental role in the conversion process. The students and staff \nof Oakwood will miss her professional and positive demeanor, although \nher husband of 45 years, Gordon, and their three sons and their \nfamilies, will enjoy spending more time with her. Barb will be sorely \nmissed by the entire Oakwood Elementary School community, however I \nextend my best wishes for a healthy, enriched and rewarding \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14827-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL PRINTING FACILITY OF THE \n                        JOHN H.

Naples. ``Napes,'' as he is affectionately called by all \nwho know him, is retiring after 29 years of teaching at Ocean City High \nSchool in New Jersey. He has earned great respect from students and \npeers alike. Each year the students Mr. Naples' taught and the athletes \nhe coached attest to his dedication to excellence.\n  Although his first commitment was to education, his enthusiasm for \ncross-country and track leave an enduring legacy at Ocean City High \nSchool. Mr. Naples' cross-country record over the last 21 years is 209 \nvictories and 28 losses. His track record is 133 wins and only 8 \nlosses. During his tenure as a track coach, Mr. Naples led the Raiders \nto two state titles and coached 9 individual state champions.\n  His greatest moment as a coach came during the 1989 cross-country \nseason, when he inspired his girls' team to capture the first state \ntitle for an Ocean City High School team in 24 years!\n  Mr. President, it is often difficult to say goodbye to a teacher who \nhas touched the lives of so many people. This is a teacher whose former \nstudents are continually coming back to thank him for inspiring them, \neducating them and, most importantly, caring about them. My deepest \nrespects go to this inductee of the New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic \nAssociation Hall of Fame. He has left a lasting legacy of high academic \nstandards and excellence in sports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14827-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14827-S14828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH HONORS WEST VIRGINIA ADOPTION ANGELS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor three \nWest Virginia individuals who have recently been awarded ``Adoption \nAngel'' awards by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. Larry and \nJane Leech and Judge Gary Johnson are truly ``angels'' in adoption.\n  President Clinton recently proclaimed November ``National Adoption \nMonth''. It is a good time to re-commit ourselves to doing all we can \nto ensure that all children have the opportunity to grow up in safe, \nstable and permanent homes.\n  During Adoption Month in 1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, a \nbill I sponsored, was signed into law. This act, for the first time \never, made children's safety, health and opportunity for loving, stable \nfamilies the paramount factors to consider when planning for children \nin foster care. The act provided incentive bonuses for states \nsuccessful in increasing adoptions.\n  My state of West Virginia has made a lot of progress in moving kids \nout of foster care and into permanent homes. When the adoption bonuses \nfor 1999 were announced, I was proud that West\n\n[[Page S14828]]\n\nVirginia, because three of our state's children. Brian, Shawn and Sarah \nKeane, had the honor of introducing President Clinton the day the \nbonuses were announced. The 3 Keane children along with 208 more West \nVirginia foster children moved in with their adoptive families in 1998.\n  Our State is working hard to increase public awareness of adoption \nand children needing homes. A quarterly newsletter, ``Open Your Heart, \nOpen Your Home'' features stories of waiting children and successful \nadoptive families. In May, Dave Thomas came to West Virginia for the \nthird annual Foster and Adoptive Parent Recognition Day, to recognize \nadoptive parents who provide homes for children with special needs.\n  We have been able to make this progress largely as a result of the \nefforts of the individuals who were honored by the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, and other dedicated and hard-working West \nVirginians like them. Let me tell you a little about these ``angels''.\n  Larry and Jane Leech have been foster parents for many years, opening \ntheir home and their hearts to children in need of both. Working with \nthe West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, the Leeches \nadopted a sibling group of three young boys, twins age 4 and an older \nbrother, age 6, in 1998. Now, a year later, the Leeches are again in \nthe final stages of adopting another sibling group--this time, three \nolder girls. Mr. and Mrs. Leech also have three biological children. \nThey have a tremendous amount of love and a strong commitment to all \nnine of their children. Recently, the Leeches and their children \nvisited the West Virginia Governor's mansion where they were honored by \nFirst Lady Hovah Underwood, for their commitment to children in need.\n  Judge Gary Johnson believes that all children in the foster care \nsystem deserve permanent homes. As the 28th Judicial circuit judge, \nelected in 1992, Judge Johnson has worked closely with the West \nVirginia Department of Health and Human Resources. He meets with them \nquarterly to review problems or identify issues that prevent children \nin West Virginia from achieving permanence in their lives. Judge \nJohnson continually increases his own knowledge of the issues by \nattending conferences on child welfare.\n  The progress we have made since the passage of the 1997 Adoption Act \nis significant. Certainly the 211 West Virginia children who found \nfamilies last year, including the six children who now call Larry and \nJane Leech ``Mom'' and ``Dad'' know that. But over 400 West Virginia \nchildren are still waiting and hoping to be adopted--over 100,000 \nchildren in our nation are still waiting and hoping to be adopted. Too \nmany of these chilldren are growing up in the insecurity of foster \ncare. Too many of them are becoming teenagers without a permanent \nfamily.\n  And that is why we need ``National Adoption Month''. We need \nopportunities to honor the angels in adoption like the Leeches and \nJudge Johnson. And we need the opportunity to publicly re-new our \ncommitment to ensuring that all children have the opportunity for \npermanent adoptive homes.\n  I am pleased to join the other members of the Congressional Coalition \non Adoption in honoring more than 50 ``Angels of Adoption'' from around \nthe country. I am doubly pleased that 3 of these angels are from West \nVirginia. And I pledge to continue to work on legislation that will \nhelp all of West Virginia's, and America's foster children have the \nopportunity that the Leech children now have, the chance to grow up in \na permanent, loving family.\n  I urge my colleagues to dedicate themselves to this effort as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14828-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14828-S14829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JEWISH HISTORY IN GREECE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in recent years there has been \nrenewed interest in the early history of the Jewish community in \nGreece. The Hellenic and Jewish peoples have had a long and \nconstructive relationship, and that interaction has been one of the \nfoundations of Western civilization.\n  An important part of this historical movement is the renewed research \non historic Jewish sites in Greece. There is now an active and \nimpressive Jewish museum in Athens which has served as a focal point \nfor this activity. These efforts have spawned a number of individuals \nto do their own family and group research; and I am pleased to report \nthat one of my constituents, Dr. Judith Mazza, has written an excellent \naccount of her visit to Greece entitled, ``First-time Traveler's \nImpressions of Jewish Sites in Greece,'' which was published in the \nspring 1999 issue of Kol haKEHILA. Dr. Mazza is descended from a \nRomaniote Jewish family from Greece, and her article depicts succinctly \nthe rich and enduring Jewish cultural and religious legacy in Greece. I \nrecommend it to all those interested in the history of the Jewish \npeople and ask that the article be inserted at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    [From Kol haKEHILA, Spring 1999]\n\n     A First-Time Traveler's Impressions of Jewish Sites in Greece\n\n                         (By Dr. Judith Mazza)\n\n       I first saw mention of the Jewish Museum of Greece, located \n     in Athens, about twenty years ago. Curious about my family \n     history, I joined the Museum as an ``American Friend.'' Upon \n     joining, I received a letter from the founder (now Director \n     Emeritus) of the museum, Nicholas Stavroulakis, concerning my \n     family name (Mazza, Matsas, Matza, etc). I learned from that \n     letter that my family most probably was a Romaniote family \n     rather than a Sephardi family. I then understood why my \n     father's family never spoke Ladino (judaeo-espanol). My \n     father, born in the United States, spoke Greek at home, as \n     did his parents (who emigrated to the United States in the \n     early 1900s from Ionnina and Corfu).\n       My husband and I were curious to visit Jewish sites in \n     Greece. My interest had been stimulated by the book Jewish \n     Sites and Synagogues of Greece (Athens, 1992) by Stavroulakis \n     and Timothy DeVinney. Prior to reading this book, I knew \n     little about the communities that had existed in Greece prior \n     to World War II. I did not have the opportunity to travel to \n     Greece until November 1998. As soon as I knew I would be in \n     Athens, I attempted to contact the Jewish Museum of Greece. \n     Kol haKEHILA, was the first internet source to give me a way \n     to contact the museum by e-mail.\n       By e-mail, I asked the museum's curator, Zanet Battinou, to \n     help find us a knowledgeable guide for our day in Athens. She \n     recommended Dolly Asser. In addition to visiting ancient \n     sites in Athens that day, Ms. Asser also took us to the \n     Jewish Museum of Greece, and to the two modern synagogues in \n     Athens.\n\n\n                                 athens\n\n       We began our day at the Museum. It had recently relocated \n     and now occupies an entire building in the Plaka \n     neighborhood. The museum has a number of floors, each with a \n     different focus. As a first-time visitor, I found it \n     interesting to see historic artifacts, documents, clothing \n     and a wide variety of religious and domestic objects. There \n     is a research library on the top floor. School children \n     arrived as we were leaving, so apparently a visit to the \n     Jewish Museum of Greece has become a part of the public \n     school curriculum.\n       After we left the museum, we visited the two synagogues. \n     They are located on Melidoni Street, immediately across the \n     street from one another. The street is gated and guarded by \n     an armed policeman as a precaution against potential \n     terrorist incidents.\n       We first went to the Beth Shalom synagogue, which is the \n     only actively used synagogue for the 3,500 Jews in Athens \n     today. Ms. Asser introduced us to Rabbi Jacob Arar, who \n     studied in France and Israel, inasmuch as there are no \n     rabbinical schools in Greece. The outside of the building has \n     simple lines and is faced in white marble. The interior of \n     the synagogue is mostly wood paneled and has a warm and \n     comfortable feeling.\n       Directly across the street is the Ianniotiki synagogue, \n     which had been built by Romaniote Jews from Ionnina. It is \n     located on the second floor of the building. The lower floor \n     houses the Athens Jewish community offices. We obtained the \n     key to the synagogue from the office staff and walked through \n     a hallway into a courtyard. The courtyard was fully paved \n     except for a small area from which one large palm tree grew. \n     We walked up the narrow exterior stairs to a walkway, and \n     unlocked the door. This synagogue was smaller and seemed \n     older than the synagogue across the street. We later learned \n     that it is mostly used for special occasions. It is elegant \n     in its simplicity.\n\n\n                                 rhodes\n\n       We had the opportunity to see one other Jewish site in \n     Greece when we stopped in Rhodes a few days later. We had \n     seen a website for the Jewish Museum of Rhodes before our \n     travels began at www.RhodesJewishMuseum.org. We sought out \n     the island's synagogue and adjacent museum. Finding the \n     street in the old walled city of Rhodes was not too \n     difficult, as it was clearly labeled and the synagogue is \n     noted on tourist maps. As we walked toward the synagogue \n     and museum, we knew that we were in what had once been the \n     Jewish quarter of the city. We could see Hebrew \n     inscriptions above some of the doorways, signifying houses \n     built by prominent Jewish families. However, many of these \n     buildings appeared to be in a state of disrepair. \n     Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S14829]]\n\n     we had no information about the buildings and knew \n     virtually nothing about the Jewish community that once \n     existed here.\n       As we walked, we could see through iron gates, that some \n     buildings had interior courtyards with interesting floor \n     patterns formed by smooth black and white stones. In some \n     courtyards, the stone patterns were intact, while in others \n     the patterns were quite deteriorated.\n       We could not find the synagogue itself, but luckily, we \n     asked directions from an elderly woman. Lucia Modiano Sulam \n     turned out to be the keeper of the synagogue and was kind \n     enough to guide us to it. She was a Holocaust survivor, with \n     tattooed numbers on her forearm.\n       We were quite unprepared for what we found when we entered \n     Kahal Shalom synagogue. The synagogue, in very good \n     condition, was more elaborate than the synagogues we had seen \n     in Athens. Crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling. \n     Beautiful carpets lay on the floor. The mosaic floor inside \n     was made of the same black and white smooth stones that we \n     had seen elsewhere. Here, the stones were arranged in more \n     elaborate patterns. Chairs were placed on the two long sides \n     of the interior and the wooden bimah was in the middle of the \n     room.\n       Just outside the synagogue entrance is a courtyard which \n     has a stone mosaic floor. It is well preserved.\n       We also visited the Jewish Museum of Rhodes, located next \n     to the synagogue. This is a new museum in its first stage of \n     development. Aron Hasson, a Los Angeles attorney whose family \n     came from Rhodes, founded it. The museum currently consists \n     of one room with white rustic walls and a curved ceiling. \n     When we were there, the museum exhibition consisted of \n     photographs and other printed materials.\n\n\n                   Tourism to Jewish sites in Greece\n\n       We knew that the Jewish population in Greece had been \n     decimated by the Holocaust, and that only remmants of that \n     once-thriving community remains there. However, as a traveler \n     and tourist, I have been stuck by the difficulty in obtaining \n     information about Jewish sites and Jewish history of Greece. \n     I do not understand why one organization or resource does not \n     reference another. Organizations that have websites or access \n     to the Internet should have hypertext links to other Greek \n     Jewish organizations, including e-mail links to facilities \n     that may not yet have a website.\n       There should be a list of bibliographic references about \n     Greek Jewry and Jewish tourist sites in Greece. When we were \n     in the Jewish Museum of Greece shop in Athens, I was stunned \n     to find an English language book about the Jews of Ionnina \n     (Dalven, R., The Jews of Ioannina, Philadelphia, 1992). I \n     purchased the book immediately! Likewise, it was through word \n     of mouth from both Yitzhak Kerem (publisher of the electronic \n     newsletter Sefarad) and Elias Messinas (editor of Kol \n     haKEHILA) that I learned of the fascinating book written by \n     Dr. Michael Matsas entitled The Illusion of Safety; The story \n     of the Greek Jews During the Second World War (New York, \n     1997). In reading these books and in speaking with both \n     Messinas and Kerem whom I recently met in Jerusalem, I \n     understand that the Greek Jews, unlike Jews in some  other \n     parts of Europe, had ample opportunity to flee or hide \n     from the Nazis. In instance after instance the warnings of \n     the catastrophic consequences of not fleeing or hiding \n     were not disseminated, or the seriousness of the situation \n     was minimized. The communication among the communities was \n     poor.\n       When we visited Rhodes, we stood on its acropolis and \n     clearly saw the Turkish coast only 11 miles away. It was \n     difficult to come to terms with the complacency of the Jewish \n     population of Rhodes in 1944 that resulted in their \n     slaughter. They were among the last Greek Jews to be sent to \n     Auschwitz. By 1944, other communities in Greece had already \n     been eliminated. Safety lay only eleven miles away. The Jews \n     of the city of Rhodes did not even flee to the island's \n     countryside. Perhaps a reader can explain this puzzling \n     apparent fact.\n       The lesson today seems clear. To preserve the remnants of \n     the Greek Jewish heritage, various interested organizations \n     should cooperate with the another. They should use electronic \n     hypertext links to cross-reference one another whenever \n     possible. The Jewish Museum of Greece in Athens should have \n     information about Jewish sites throughout Greece, including \n     other museums, such as the one in Rhodes. Likewise, the \n     Jewish Museum of Rhodes should link to as many Jewish sites \n     throughout Greece as possible. Books, bibliographies and \n     brochures about Jewish sites throughout Greece should be made \n     available at each of the sites and at Tourist Offices. Never \n     again should the Jewish community of Greece be weakened by \n     poor communication among various components. Certainly, not \n     in this age of electronic communications and the Internet. \n     There are some dedicated people working in disparate \n     organizations to preserve and memorialize Greek Jewish sites \n     and culture. Now they need to recognize the gestalt effect \n     that would result from closer cooperation.\n       We came away from our experience wanting to learn more \n     about the various communities that only existed in the past, \n     and also those which continue to survive. We hope that others \n     will become interested in exploring and preserving Jewish \n     heritage in Greece. The best way to do this and to attract \n     Jewish tourists is to make information about Jewish sites \n     more readily available. We hope that the various \n     organizations and interested parties will work together to \n     that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14829-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY OF THE PROVIDENCE GAY MEN'S \n                                 CHORUS\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nProvidence Gay Men's Chorus, which celebrated its fourth anniversary on \nNovember 14, 1999. I would like to thank the Chorus for its four years \nof community involvement, during which time the members have shared not \nonly their melodious voices with the citizens of Rhode Island, but also \ntheir hopes and ambitions for a better world.\n  The Providence Gay Men's Chorus, which began in 1995 as a group of \neight, now has 50 members. In addition to their musical talent, one of \nthe attributes that is most unique about the Chorus, and most \nappreciated, is the group's mission to promote tolerance. As we know, \nthe real work of fostering support for people with diverse backgrounds \nand lifestyles usually happens slowly, and within the context of shared \nactivities and community. The Providence Gay Men's Chorus reaches out \nwith its concerts to expand the bounds of community. By helping to \ncreate an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, their work \nbenefits not only the citizens of Rhode Island, but ultimately the \nentire nation.\n  I am pleased to make it known that November 14, 1999 was not only the \nfourth anniversary of the Chorus, but also was declared Providence Gay \nMen's Chorus Day in the State of Rhode Island. Mr. President, I ask \nthat a gubernatorial proclamation from the Governor of my home state of \nRhode Island proclaiming November 14th as ``Providence Gay Men's Chorus \nDay'' be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  I join in the chorus of voices supporting the Providence Gay Men's \nChorus' dual mission of creating beautiful music and promoting mutual \nrespect and understanding. I know this talented musical group will \ncontinue its good work and I wish them many, many more birthdays.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n    State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations--Gubernatorial \n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the Providence Gay Men's Chorus was first \n     conceived in a karaoke bar in Providence in October 1995. The \n     first meeting of its original eight members from Rhode Island \n     and Massachusetts was held in November 1995, in a home in \n     Pawtucket. The name Providence Gay Men's Chorus (PGMC) was \n     decided on after some deliberation and the group was then \n     underway with a music director and an accompanist; and,\n       Whereas, the mission of the PGMC is to provide and foster \n     continuing growth of men's voices. Through the sharing of \n     song concerts, the PGMC hopes to foster mutual understanding, \n     tolerance and support of people with diverse backgrounds and \n     lifestyles; and,\n       Whereas, the membership started to blossom during the first \n     year and moved to St. James Episcopal Church in North \n     Providence. During this year, the first board was also formed \n     and the first concert was held in Warcham, Massachusetts with \n     12 members; and,\n       Whereas, the chorus kept growing and moved again. This time \n     to the Bell Street Chapel in Providence, where the now 35-\n     member chorus was performing two seasons per year with three \n     concerts per season. It was at the Bell Street Chapel that \n     the PGMC achieved their first sell out audience; and,\n       Whereas, as membership approached 40 members, the chorus \n     moved once again to the First Unitarian Church in Providence. \n     During this time, the PGMC joined the national choral \n     organization for gay and lesbians called GALA and received \n     its first corporate sponsorship; and,\n       Whereas, the chorus is now approaching its fourth birthday, \n     has a membership of 50 and is back at the Bell Street Chapel. \n     The members will be performing series of concerts in \n     November, singing at First Night 2000, and initiating a \n     scholarship program. Future plans for the chorus are to bring \n     a program to the Hasbro's Children's Hospital, perform to \n     mainstream audiences throughout the city and state, and \n     attend the national GALA conferences; and,\n       Whereas, on November 14, 1999 the chorus will hold a \n     concert at the Newport Congregational Church, under the \n     direction of Charles Pietrello and the accompaniment of Bruce \n     Ruby;\n       Now, therefore, I, Lincoln Almond, Governor of the State of \n     Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, do hereby proclaim \n     November 14, 1999, as Providence Gay Men's Chorus \n     Day.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14830-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14830]]\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM AND OLENE DOYLE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to stand before my \ncolleagues today and pay tribute to a couple who have so positively \ninfluenced the people of Washington County, Vermont over the course of \ntheir lives. William and Olene Doyle will be honored as the Washington \nCounty Citizens of the Year by the Green Mountain Council of Boy Scouts \non November 22nd, 1999.\n  My old friend Bill Doyle has navigated a well rounded career as a \nteacher, politician, and author. Since 1958, he has been teaching \nhistory and government at Johnson State College. In 1968, he was \nelected to serve as one of Washington County's three State Senators, a \nrole in which he has thrived for over three decades. As a skilled \nteacher and a master of parliamentary rules, Bill has been an \ninvaluable mentor and mediator in the Vermont State House. Bill has \nwritten two books, including The Vermont Political Tradition, which is \nregarded by many to be a ``must read'' on Vermont political history. He \nhas also taken his passion for government and politics and created the \nannual ``Doyle Poll,'' our yearly gauge of public opinion on the \nhottest and sometimes most controversial issues facing Vermonters. \nWhile admittedly unscientific, the poll's results are soundly \nreflective of Vermont sentiment.\n  As the son of an art teacher, I have always held a deep respect for \nthe arts and for those who are able to inspire creativity in our \nnation's young people. Olene Doyle has taught art in elementary, \nsecondary, and higher education institutions in the central Vermont \nregion. Her dedication to arts and education led her to volunteer \npositions on the local school board in Montpelier, as well as on the \nboard of the Wood Art Gallery, where, incidently, I now hold the annual \nCongressional Arts Competition.\n  Bill and Olene raised three wonderful children. However, they have \nnever stopped teaching as evidenced by their ongoing community service \nand involvement in their local church and non-profit organizations. \nGiven the countless hours they dedicate to community service, it is \nnoteworthy that the couple finds the time to pursue personal hobbies \nsuch as golf and gardening.

Mr. President, it is important that we remember \nhow vital our nuclear nonproliferation programs with Russia are to our \nnational security. That's why I was pleased, in recent weeks, to see \ntwo articles by Brett Wagner in the San Francisco chronicle and in the \nWall Street Journal, which I would like to submit for the Record.\n  Mr. Wagner is the president of the California Center for Strategic \nStudies, and his articles bring much needed attention to an essential \naspect of our nuclear nonproliferation policy--to ensure that Russian \nweapons-grade, highly-enriched uranium does not fall into the wrong \nhands. We need to live up to our agreement with Russia and strengthen \nour nuclear, chemical and biological nonproliferation program with that \nnation. Our future could well depend on it.\n  I believe that Mr. Wagner's articles will be of interest to all of us \nin Congress who care about these issues, and I ask that they be printed \nin the Record.\n  The articles follow.\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 22, 1999]\n\n          U.S. Must Move Quickly to Buy Russia's Excess Nukes\n\n                           (by Brett Wagner)\n\n       Without a doubt, what's been most frustrating about being a \n     national security specialist in the 1990s has been urging \n     that the United States buy the hundreds of tons of \n     undersecured excess weapon-grade uranium scattered across \n     Russia--only to repeatedly hear in response that this could \n     never happen in the real world because of Washington's never-\n     ending struggle to balance the federal budget.\n       My, how things change.\n       Today, Washington is awash in an unprecedented trillion-\n     dollar budget surplus--a surplus expected to surpass $100 \n     billion in the next fiscal year alone.\n       Politicians from both major parties are busy, of course, \n     debating what to do with all the extra money. Unfortunately, \n     neither party has even mentioned Russia's offer to sell its \n     enormous stockpiles of excess weapon-grade uranium to the \n     United States as quickly as possible in exchange for badly \n     needed hard currency.\n       Congressional and presidential priorities aside, it's hard \n     to imagine a better time to reconsider this issue.\n       By now, almost everyone who reads the newspaper or watches \n     the evening news knows that Russia has yet to develop any \n     reliable means of securing its enormous stockpiles of weapon-\n     grade uranium and plutonium. It doesn't even have an \n     accounting system capable of keeping track of them.\n       And as the media often remind us, these materials have \n     already begun leaking into the West--troubling news, to say \n     the least, considering that:\n       The blueprints and non-nuclear components necessary to \n     build crude but highly effective nuclear weapons are already \n     widely available;\n       It only takes 20 or 30 pounds of highly enriched uranium to \n     arm a device capable of leveling a city the size of downtown \n     Washington;\n       Rogue states and terrorist groups openly hostile to the \n     United States have already attempted several times to \n     purchase nuclear warheads or material from Russian nuclear \n     workers;\n       There is no reliable way of keeping a nuclear weapon or \n     contraband from being smuggled into U.S. territory if it ever \n     does fall into the wrong hands.\n       What most people don't seem to remember, however, is that \n     for several years now Russia has been trying to sell these \n     same undersecured stockpiles of highly enriched uranium to \n     the United States for use as nuclear fuel in commercial power \n     plants and, what's more, that an agreement designed to help \n     further this goal was signed by President Clinton and Russian \n     leader Doris Yeltsin in February 1993.\n       Unfortunately, that agreement is a full year behind \n     schedule, with shipments from 1993 through 1999 representing \n     only 80 tons of highly enriched uranium--30 tons short of the \n     minimum goal by the end of its seventh year in force. \n     Moreover, even if the agreement were moving ahead at full \n     speed, it would still cover only a fraction of Russia's \n     excess weapon-grade uranium (500 of 1,200 tons), and none of \n     its plutonium. A frustrated Russia can't understand why \n     America wants to move so slowly.\n       Meanwhile, terrorism is spiraling out of control in and \n     around Moscow, war is breaking out again in the Caucus and \n     the nuclear materials from thousands of dismantled Russian \n     warheads continue to pile up in poorly protected makeshift \n     warehouses scattered across several time zones, many of them \n     far from the central government's watchful eye.\n       All of which begs the question: How long can things go on \n     this way, before we run out of luck? Or, in other words, how \n     long can Russia's hundreds of tons of missile materials be \n     stored so haphazardly before small but significant amounts \n     begin winding up in the hands of terrorists or rogue states?\n       The time has come for Washington to finally put its money \n     where its mouth is and use part of the enormous budget \n     surplus to purchase as much of Russia's fissile materials--\n     both uranium and plutonium--as Moscow is willing to sell, and \n     as quickly as Moscow is wiling to sell them.\n       The case for taking such a bold step should be easy to make \n     with the American people.\n       First, the sticker price would be remarkably low--less than \n     $20 billion. And since the U.S. government would presumably \n     one day sell most or all of the uranium and plutonium for use \n     as nuclear fuel, the expense would not have to be counted as \n     an expense--an argument sure to resonate well with fiscal \n     conservatives eager to keep pace with Gramm-Rudman.\n       Second, one could compare the price tag with the hundreds \n     of billions of dollars America spent to defend itself and its \n     allies against nuclear weapons during the Cold War; the \n     trillion dollars of human life that would result if a small \n     nuclear device were ever successfully detonated in a place \n     such as downtown Washington; and the billions of dollars that \n     rogue states and terrorist groups have already offered \n     Russian nuclear workers for extremely small amounts of the \n     same nuclear material.\n       And there is the tremendous sense of relief in purchasing \n     the very stuff that for so long threatened America's very \n     survival, and which now threatens the whole world.\n       With the 2000 election cycle beginning to pick up steam, \n     and with the possibility of a viable third-party presidential \n     candidate growing by the day, one would think that the two \n     major parties would be scrambling to take the lead on this \n     most serious of national Security issues.\n\n[[Page S14831]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 1999]\n\n                             Nukes for Sale\n\n                           (By Brett Wagner)\n\n       Strangely absent from the debate over how to spend \n     Washington's projected $1 trillion surplus has been any \n     discussion of Russia's longstanding offer to sell its \n     stockpiles of excess weapon-grade uranium. The time has come \n     to take Russia up on this offer.\n       Russia has never developed a reliable system for protecting \n     the enormous stockpiles of weapon-grade uranium and plutonium \n     it inherited from the Soviet Union. These stockpiles are \n     often stored in makeshift warehouses, some protected only by \n     $5 combination locks and soldiers who occasionally desert \n     their posts in search of food. Small caches of these nuclear \n     materials have already begun leaking out of Russia. It would \n     only take 20 or 30 pounds of highly enriched uranium to arm a \n     device capable of leveling a city the size of lower \n     Manhattan.\n       In February 1993 Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin \n     signed an agreement for Russia to sell the U.S. highly \n     enriched uranium extracted from its dismantled nuclear \n     warheads in exchange for hard currency. Russia is currently \n     dismantling thousands of warheads. Unfortunately, this \n     unprecedented opportunity to advance U.S. and international \n     security has fallen behind schedule at nearly every turn, \n     primarily because Washington is constantly distracted by less \n     important issues. So far Russia has shipped only 50.5 tons of \n     highly enriched uranium--almost 30 tons short of the \n     agreement's stated goal by this point.\n       One major holdup has been the U.S. enrichment Corp., a \n     recently privatized company selected by the U.S. government \n     to implement the American side of the accord. It has resisted \n     accepting delivery of Russia's enriched uranium because, \n     among other reasons, it claims that the materials are not \n     pure enough for U.S. nuclear plants. But the corporation has \n     a fundamental conflict of interest. Since it also produces \n     enriched uranium, it wants to limit Russian competition in \n     the international market.\n       The question is: How long do we have before we run out of \n     luck? How long before some of Russia's uranium winds up in \n     the hands of terrorists like Osama bin Laden or regimes like \n     Saddam Hussein's?\n       Washington should switch the power of executive agent from \n     the U.S. Enrichment Corp. to the Department of Energy. Given \n     that most of the delays in implementing the agreement have \n     stemmed from America's insistence that the highly enriched \n     uranium be blended down into nuclear fuel in Russia, \n     Washington should reverse this policy and accept Moscow's \n     offer to ship its undiluted uranium directly to the U.S.\n       As soon as the agreement gets back on track, Washington \n     should ask Moscow to expand it to include all of Russia's \n     excess weapon-grade uranium, not to mention its excess \n     plutonium. It makes no sense to purchase one stockpile of \n     unsecured fissile material while leaving others in jeopardy.\n       The pricetag for such a deal would be remarkably low. The \n     cost of purchasing 500 tons of Russia's highly enriched \n     uranium, the quantity covered in the agreement, is \n     approximately $8 billion. Beyond what the agreement covers, \n     Moscow has some 700 tons of additional weapons-grade uranium \n     it has deemed ``excess.'' That would increase the price to \n     around $19 billion. And for an additional $1 billion or $2 \n     billion. Moscow would probably throw in its excess weapon-\n     grade plutonium, which it has also been trying to sell for \n     use as nuclear fuel.\n       With Russian parliamentary elections scheduled for later \n     this year and a presidential election next June--which may \n     well bring in a government less friendly to the West than Mr. \n     Yeltsin's--the time to act is now rather than later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14831-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am proud to add the American Automobile \nAssociation (AAA) and the California DMV to the long list of \norganizations that support S. 655, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle \nConsumer Protection Act that I introduced during this session to \nprotect consumers from title fraud.\n  Other supporters of my title branding legislation include the \nAmerican Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), state DMV \ndirectors around the country, the Michigan Secretary of State and other \nSecretaries of State, the International Union of Police Associations \nAFL-CIO, International Association of Auto Theft Investigators, \nNational Odometer and Title Fraud Enforcement Association, American \nAutomobile Manufacturers Association, Association of International \nAutomobile Manufacturers, National Automobile Dealers Association, \nNational Association of Minority Automobile Dealers, National \nIndependent Automobile Dealers Association, Honda North America, Nissan \nNorth America, Carfax, CarMax, American Service Industry Association, \nAmerican Automotive Leasing Association, American Car Rental \nAssociation, American Salvage Pool Association, Automotive Engine \nRebuilders Association, Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, \nAutomotive Parts Rebuilders Association, National Association of Fleet \nResale Dealers, National Auto Auction Association, and State Farm \nInsurance.\n  I also think it is worth recognizing 23 of our colleagues who have \nactively signaled their intention to protect motorists in their state \nand throughout the nation by formally supporting S. 655. Senators \nMcCain, Breaux, Stevens, Conrad, Burns, Hutchison, Frist, Abraham, \nMack, Warner, Bennett, Sessions, Murkowski, Shelby, Inhofe, Grams, \nThomas, Roberts, Hatch, Thompson, Enzi, Kyl, and Hutchinson are to be \ncommended for cosponsoring this important consumer protection measure.\n  The American Automobile Association represents over 40 million \ndrivers. It is a nonpartisan organization that champions the interests \nof the driving public in virtually every city, county, and state across \nthis great land. AAA supports S. 655 because it shares my belief that \nnational standards for titling salvage, rebuilt salvage, non-repairable \nand flood damaged vehicles will help prevent the fraudulent sale of \ndamaged vehicles and protect consumers from unknowingly purchasing \nthem. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print AAA's letter of \nsupport for S. 655 in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        AAA Washington Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: As a representative of 42 million \n     motorists, AAA appreciates your effort to establish more \n     uniformity in the titling and registration of salvage and \n     other damaged vehicles.\n       AAA shares your concern about the practice of unscrupulous \n     individuals buying damaged vehicles at low cost, rebuilding \n     them, and then retitling them in another state with less or \n     no protections. A ``washed'' title does not disclose previous \n     damage to a vehicle and therefore, subsequent purchasers have \n     no knowledge of the damage. Unwitting consumers are the \n     victims of such fraudulent practices.\n       In an effort to help AAA members avoid the pitfalls of \n     buying damaged or rebuilt vehicles, AAA provides tips on ways \n     to identify damaged or flood vehicles. AAA also recommends \n     that consumers have used cars checked for safety and \n     reliability by a reputable auto technician before they \n     purchase the vehicle.\n       Minimum standards for titling salvage, rebuilt salvage, \n     non-repairable and flood-damaged vehicles will help present \n     the fraudulent sale of damaged vehicles and protect consumers \n     from unknowingly purchasing them. However, because states \n     often have unique and various problems relating specifically \n     to salvage vehicles, AAA believes states should be provided \n     flexibility to enact stricter standards that address \n     individual state concerns as your bill allows.\n       S. 655 represents an important step toward addressing the \n     problem, while recognizing the legitimate role states have in \n     motor vehicle licensing and titling laws. AAA commends your \n     leadership in working with all parties to craft a workable \n     solution and is pleased to support your bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Susan G. Pikrallidas,\n\n                                           Interim Vice President,\n                                    Public & Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, my goal from the outset has been to protect \nused car buyers from title fraud. The solution I proposed was simple, \nstraightforward, and modeled after the recommendations of the Motor \nVehicle Titling, Registration, and Salvage Advisory Committee. S. 655 \nmerely establishes model uniform definitions and disclosure \nrequirements for four basic terms: salvage; rebuilt salvage; flood; and \nnonrepairable vehicles. Under the legislation reported out by the \nSenate Commerce Committee, states would be free to utilize additional \nterms and to provide additional disclosures beyond those provided for \nin this bill. States that choose to adopt the four uniform terms and \nrelated provisions would be eligible for incentive grants. No state\n\n[[Page S14832]]\n\nwould be penalized for non-participation or for retaining different \nstandards.\n\n  While there is substantial and broad support for this much needed \nlegislation, there continues to be resistance to moving forward with \nthis legislation in the Senate. Unfortunately, this resistance has the \neffect of allowing unsuspecting consumers to continue to purchase and \ndrive potentially life-threatening vehicles. Delaying this legislation \nwill cost used car buyers another $4 billion this year and place \nmillions of structurally unsafe vehicles back on America's roads and \nhighways. Roads that our family, friends, and neighbors share every \nday.\n  Even though S. 655 has wide-spread support and follows the \nrecommendations of the Congressionally-chartered Salvage Advisory \nCommittee, a few groups have attempted to undermine this measure at \nevery stage of the process. Unfortunately, these groups seemed to have \nconvinced some of my colleagues that it is better to delay the \nimplementation of clearly needed consumer protections and continue to \npress for the imposition of untried, untested and in many cases anti-\nconsumer requirements. Requirements that states have rejected time and \nagain. Provisions that focus on post-purchase redress rather than pre-\npurchase disclosure. Definitions and standards that would perpetuate \nconfusion rather than promote uniformity among the states, undermining \nthe very purpose of this legislation. These groups claim to have the \ninterests of consumers in mind, yet the best representative of car-\nbuying consumers, the American Automobile Association, has rejected \ntheir approach and supports passage of S. 655.\n  As I am sure my colleagues will agree, advancing titling definitions \nand standards that states have rejected, and will continue to reject, \nwill only exacerbate title fraud. Such an approach only benefits those \nwho prey on unsuspecting car buyers and would jeopardize the minimum \nstandards required to make the program work, unnecessarily harm many \nvehicle owners and buyers by needlessly reducing the value of their \nvehicles, create unreasonable or untested standards, foster unnecessary \nlitigation, impinge on states rights, and promote a scheme that states \nwill reject.\n  During the 104th and 105th Congresses, this was a bipartisan, better \nyet nonpartisan, initiative. My only interest has been to protect \nconsumers by encouraging the use of minimal uniform disclosure \nstandards for severely damaged vehicles--those involved in a serious \naccident, severely damaged by falling objects, or vehicles that have \nsustained significant and lingering water damage. Whether the used car \nbuyer is in Mississippi, California, Nevada, Minnesota, or in any other \nstate, he or she needs the pre-purchase disclosure information that S. \n655 would provide.\n  I have made every effort to reach consensus on this legislation. In \nthat vein, a number of changes were incorporated throughout the \nlegislative process to address the concerns of State attorneys general, \ncertain consumer groups, and many of my colleagues. The latest version \nof this legislation incorporates the full range of changes that DMV \nadministrators, including California's Administrator, believe are \npracticable. The substitute makes it very clear that there is no \npreemption of state law. The substitute also mirrors much of the State \nof California's current titling requirements, ensuring that minimal \nchange will be required by our largest state should it choose to apply \nfor the bill's grant monies.\n  Mr. President, even though I have made numerous compromises on this \nlegislation, the goal post continues to move further away. Instead of \ngaining acceptance, I was recently presented with yet another round of \nproposed modifications. AAMVA reviewed these proposed changes and \ndetermined they would eviscerate the purpose of this legislation. AAMVA \nopposes these additional changes because they could potentially harm \nthe very people this legislation aims to protect, create a mountain of \nunnecessary paperwork, and would create a substantial amount of \nbureaucracy with no added value.\n  It makes no sense to adopt provisions that the experts on titling \nmatters believe are harmful to used car consumers, the very people this \nbalanced legislation aims to protect. AAMVA, Secretaries of State, \nlocal and state law enforcement, state legislators, and the automotive \nand insurance industries have repeatedly pronounced their support for \nS. 655. AAA and the California DMV also agree that my substitute bill \nis the right legislative solution.\n  Mr. President, if we do not pass this legislation, the real loser is \nthe unfortunate used car buyer in these and other states who \nunknowingly purchases a wreck on wheels, perhaps a previously totaled \ngovernment crash test vehicle. Every day that Congress fails to act on \nthis prudent title branding legislation, thousands of individuals are \nharmed and millions of dollars are lost to the unscrupulous practice of \ntitle laundering. Let's pass this bill now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14832-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14832-S14836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                S. 1949\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

and\n       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and \n     irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;\n       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--\n       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities \n     to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in \n     operation; and\n       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new, \n     clean, and efficient generating technologies;\n       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants \n     fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce nearly \n     two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;\n       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the \n     average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired \n     power plants in\n\n[[Page S14833]]\n\n     the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent of the heat \n     generated by burning the fuel is wasted;\n       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent \n     above current levels, and technological advances are possible \n     that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even \n     more;\n       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of \n     mercury emissions in the United States, releasing an \n     estimated 52 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;\n       (8) in 1996, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United \n     States produced over 2,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide, \n     the primary greenhouse gas;\n       (9) on average--\n       (A) fossil fuel-fired power plants emit 1,999 pounds of \n     carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity \n     produced;\n       (B) coal-fired power plants emit 2,110 pounds of carbon \n     dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity produced; and\n       (C) coal-fired power plants emit 205 pounds of carbon \n     dioxide for every million British thermal units of fuel \n     consumed;\n       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the \n     United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to \n     establish requirements for stationary sources;\n       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23 \n     percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to \n     stringent new source performance standards under section 111 \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and\n       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as \n     ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less \n     stringent requirements;\n       (12) on the basis of scientific and medical evidence, \n     exposure to mercury and mercury compounds is of concern to \n     human health and the environment;\n       (13) pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of \n     childbearing age, and children are most at risk for mercury-\n     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;\n       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds \n     occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-\n     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--\n       (A) ingestion of breast milk;\n       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish, \n     that are contaminated with methyl mercury; and\n       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;\n       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to \n     Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific \n     knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury \n     emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and \n     mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;\n       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report \n     described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between \n     mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil \n     fuels and methyl mercury concentrations in freshwater fish;\n       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned \n     the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared \n     to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and\n       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased \n     from 899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent;\n       (17) pollution from powerplants can be reduced through \n     adoption of modern technologies and practices, including--\n       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more \n     efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized \n     bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle \n     system;\n       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from \n     fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;\n       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution \n     controls;\n       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable \n     resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;\n       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy \n     from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel \n     cells; and\n       (F) combined heat and power methods of extracting and using \n     heat that would otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of \n     heating or cooling office buildings, providing steam to \n     processing facilities, or otherwise increasing total \n     efficiency; and\n       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in \n     paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and \n     productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the \n     future.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while \n     safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired \n     generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are \n     technologically feasible through modernization and \n     application of pollution controls;\n       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon \n     dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the \n     environment from combustion of fossil fuels;\n       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by \n     increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil \n     fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through--\n       (A) use of commercially available combustion technology, \n     including clean coal technologies such as pressurized \n     fluidized bed combustion and an integrated gasification \n     combined cycle system;\n       (B) installation of pollution controls;\n       (C) expanded use of renewable and clean energy sources such \n     as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells; and\n       (D) promotion of application of combined heat and power \n     technologies;\n       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to \n     retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace \n     them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency \n     combustion technology; and\n       (B) to increase use of renewable and clean energy sources \n     such as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells;\n       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund to fund the \n     training, economic development, carbon sequestration, and \n     research, development, and demonstration programs established \n     under this Act;\n       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean \n     Air Act relating to sources in operation before the \n     promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7411);\n       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent \n     reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are \n     accomplished through the retirement of old units and \n     replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act \n     should be credited to the utility sector and the owner or \n     operator in any climate change implementation program;\n       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury \n     recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems, \n     and other methods of mercury pollution control;\n       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury \n     exposure and the threat to public health from mercury, \n     particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and \n     their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;\n       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health \n     and the environment posed by mercury;\n       (11) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely \n     affected by reduced consumption of coal; and\n       (12) to provide economic development incentives for \n     communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of \n     coal.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that Congress \nincluded $10 million in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill to \ncontinue the Russian Leadership Program in Fiscal Year 2000.\n  The Russian Leadership Program was created earlier this year in the \nFY 1999 supplemental appropriations bill in order to bring emerging \nRussian leaders to the United States to see first hand how democracy \nand the American free market economic system function. The program was \nsuccessful in bringing over 2,100 emerging leaders from 83 of the 89 \nstates and republics in the Russian Federation during July, August, and \nSeptember of this year. Dr. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and \none of the world's leading historians of Russian culture was asked to \nadminister this program. Our thanks go to Dr. Billington for doing an \nexcellent job implementing this program in a short period of time.\n  The program was modeled after the Marshall Plan which was implemented \nafter World War II. Between 1946-1956, the U.S. Government brought over \n10,000 Germans citizens to the United States to learn ways to rebuild \ntheir economy through technical assistance as well as cultural and \npolitical contacts. The Marshall Plan was one of the most successful \nforeign aid programs of the last century.\n  Similar to the Marshall Plan, participants in the Russian Leadership \nProgram visited more than 400 communities in 46 states and the District \nof Columbia observing democracy in action at all levels of government. \nThey met and discussed the American system of government with current \nand former U.S. Presidents, Members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, \nGovernors, state legislators, state supreme court justices, mayors, and \nmembers of city and town councils.\n  Some of the participants also campaigned door-to-door with political \ncandidates, visited police and fire stations, met with students in \nschools, visited hospitals, research facilities, businesses, soup \nkitchens, shelters and experienced firsthand the partnership among \ngovernment, and the private sector.\n  This program was unique because more than 800 American families \nhosted our Russian visitors, welcoming them into their homes and \ncommunities, and spending the time to answer questions about and show \nour guests the American way of life. Vadim Baikov, one of the six \nRussians who visited Alaska, the State I represent, wrote after the \nprogram that, ``In my opinion, the best cultural aspect is that we \nstayed with the families, because in this way one can actually gain \ninsight of the genuine American lifestyle. I think that is what counts \nthe most.''\n  Organizations such as Rotary International, the United Methodist \nChurch, Freedom Force, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints played a key role in organizing the participants in the program \nboth in Russia and the United States. In addition to volunteering their \ntime, these families and hosting communities generously supplemented \nthe government's $10 million appropriations by providing approximately \n$1.5 million worth of meals, cultural activities, additional \ntransportation and medical care.\n  Beyond the strong ties of friendship that developed between guests \nand hosts, it is clear that the Russian Leadership Program \nfundamentally changed how these Russian guests see America. They \nconstitute the largest single group ever to travel from Russia to the \nU.S. They return to Russia with clear ideas and strong commitment to \npositive change. A mayor from Tomsk spend time with the mayor of \nCleveland and said: ``If we were to meet more often, there would be \nmore peaceful relations.''\n  The Russian Leadership Program has had a tremendous impact in one \nyear. It is a good program and I am pleased that we were able to \nprovide the necessary funding to continue this program into the new \nmillenium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14836-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14836-S14837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMUNICATIONS OMNIBUS REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the revised \n``Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999'' \n(H.R. 1554). As a Member of the Judiciary Committee, I am particularly \npleased that this legislation includes as Title IV, the ``American \nInventors Protection Act of 1999.'' This important patent reform \nmeasure includes a series of initiatives intended to protect the rights \nof inventors, enhance patent protections and reduce patent litigation.\n  Perhaps most importantly, subtitle C of title IV contains the so-\ncalled ``First Inventor Defense.'' This defense provides a first \ninventor (or ``prior user'') with a defense in patent infringement \nlawsuits, whenever an inventor of a business method (i.e., a practice \nprocess or system) uses the invention but does not patent it. \nCurrently, patent law does not provide original inventors with any \nprotections when a subsequent user, who patents the method at a later \ndate, files a lawsuit for infringement against the real creator of the \ninvention.\n  The first inventor defense will provide the financial services \nindustry with important, needed protections in the face of the \nuncertainty presented by the Federal Circuit's decision in the State \nStreet case. State Street Bank and Trust Company v. Signature Financial \nGroup, Inc. 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir., 1998). In State Street, the Court \ndid away with the so-called ``business methods'' exception to statutory \npatentable subject matter. Consequently, this decision has raised \nquestions about what types of business methods may now be eligible for \npatent protection. In the financial services sector, this has prompted \nserious legal and practical concerns. It has created doubt regarding \nwhether or not particular business methods used by the industry--\nincluding processes, practices, and systems--might now suddenly become \nsubject to new claims under the patent law. In terms of everyday \nbusiness practice, these types of activities were considered to be \nprotected as trade secrets and were not viewed as patentable material.\n  The first inventor defense strikes a fair balance between patent and \ntrade secret law. Specifically, this provision creates a defense for \ninventors who (1) acting in good faith have reduced the subject matter \nto practice in the United States at least one year prior to the patent \nfiling date (``effective filing date'') of another (typically later) \ninventor; and (2) commercially used the subject matter in the United \nStates before the filing date of the patent. Commercial use does not \nrequire that the\n\n[[Page S14837]]\n\nparticular invention be made known to the public or be used in the \npublic marketplace--it includes wholly internal commercial uses as \nwell.\n  As used in this legislation, the term ``method'' is intended to be \nconstrued broadly. The term ``method'' is defined as meaning ``a method \nof doing or conducting business.'' Thus, ``method'' includes any \ninternal method of doing business, a method used in the course of doing \nor conducting business, or a method for conducting business in the \npublic marketplace. It includes a practice, process, activity, or \nsystem that is used in the design, formulation, testing, or manufacture \nof any product or service. The defense will be applicable against \nmethod claims, as well as the claims involving machines or articles the \nmanufacturer used to practice such methods (i.e., apparatus claims). \nNew technologies are being developed every day, which include \ntechnology that employs both methods of doing business and physical \napparatus designed to carry out a method of doing business. The first \ninventor defense is intended to protect both method claims and \napparatus claims.\n  When viewed specifically from the standpoint of the financial \nservices industry, the term ``method'' includes financial instruments, \nfinancial products, financial transactions, the ordering of financial \ninformation, and any system or process that transmits or transforms \ninformation with respect to investments or other types of financial \ntransactions. In this context, it is important to point out the \nbeneficial effects that such methods have brought to our society. These \ninclude the encouragement of home ownership, the broadened availability \nof capital for small businesses, and the development of a variety of \npension and investment opportunities for millions of Americans.\n  As the joint explanatory statement of the Conference Committee on \nH.R. 1554 notes, the provision ``focuses on methods for doing and \nconducting business, including methods used in connection with internal \ncommercial operations as well as those used in connection with the sale \nor transfer of useful end results--whether in the form of physical \nproducts, or in the form of services, or in the form of some other \nuseful results; for example, results produced to the manipulation of \ndata or other imports to produce a useful result.'' H. Rept. 106-  , p. \n31.\n  The language of the provision states that the defense is not \navailable if the person has actually abandoned commercial use of the \nsubject matter. As used in the legislation, abandonment refers to the \ncessation of use with no intent to resume. Intervals of non-use between \nsuch periodic or cyclical activities such as seasonable factors or \nreasonable intervals between contracts, however, should not be \nconsidered to be abandonment.\n  As noted earlier, in the wake of State Street, thousands of methods \nand processes that have been and are used internally are now subject to \nthe possibility of being claimed as patented inventions. Previously, \nthe businesses that developed and used such methods and processes \nthought that secrecy was the only protection available. As the \nconference report on H.R. 1554 states: ``(U)nder established law, any \nof these inventions which have been in commercial use--public or \nsecret--for more than one year cannot now be the subject of a valid \nU.S. patent.'' H. Rept. 106-  , p. 31.\n  Mr. President, patent law should encourage innovation, not create \nbarriers to the development of innovative financial products, credit \nvehicles, and e-commerce generally. The patent law was never intended \nto prevent people from doing what they are already doing. While I am \nvery pleased that the first inventors defense is included in H.R. 1554, \nit should be viewed as just the first step in defining the appropriate \nlimits and boundaries of the State Street decision. This legal defense \nwill provide important protections for companies against unfair and \nunjustified patent infringement actions. But, at the same time, I \nbelieve that it is time for Congress to take a closer look at the \npotentially broad and, perhaps, adverse consequences of the State \nStreet decision. I hope that beginning early next year the Judiciary \nCommittee will hold hearings on the State Street issue, so Senators can \ncarefully evaluate its economic and competitive consequences.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. My colleague is correct. The State Street decision \nmay have unintended consequences for the financial services community. \nBy explicitly holding that business methods are patentable, financial \nservice companies are finding that the techniques and ideas, that were \nin wide use, are being patented by others.\n  The Prior Inventor Defense of H.R. 1554 is an important step towards \nprotecting the financial services industry. By protecting early \ndevelopers and users of a business method, the defense allows U.S. \ncompanies to commit resources to the commercialization of their \ninventions with confidence that a subsequent patent holder will prevail \nin a patent infringement suit. Without this defense, financial services \ncompanies face unfair patent-infringement suits over the use of \ntechniques and ideas (methods) they developed and have used for years.\n  While I support the Prior Inventor Defense, as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I hope we will revisit this issue next year. More \nmust be done to address the boundaries of the State Street decision \nwith the realities of the constantly changing and developing financial \nservices industry.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Schumer and my colleagues on \nthe committee on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14837-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/18/senate-section/article/S14837-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14837-S14838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. For the information of all Senators, when the Senate \nconvenes, it will begin consideration of a number of legislative items \nthat have been cleared for action and need to be considered in the \nHouse prior to adjournment. Following the consideration of these bills, \nthe Senate will resume debate on the final appropriations bill. \nFurther, as a reminder, cloture was filed today on the appropriations \nconference report, and there is still hope that the Wisconsin \ndelegation will allow the cloture vote to occur at a reasonable hour \nduring tomorrow's session. However, if no agreement is made, the \ncloture vote will occur at 1:01 a.m. on Saturday morning, and \nabbreviated postcloture debate is anticipated. Therefore, Senators can \nexpect a vote to occur a few hours after the cloture vote.\n  In addition, the Senate may consider the Work Incentives conference \nreport prior to the pending adjournment.\n\n[[Page S14838]]\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M. TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If there is no further business to come before the \nSenate, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in adjournment \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is there a unanimous consent request pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is, to adjourn.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nwith regard to the cloture vote which the Senator from Alaska \ndescribed, that the vote take place at 10 a.m. on Saturday; and that \nshould cloture be invoked, no more than 21 hours of debate remain.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I simply want to \nindicate, as one member from the Wisconsin delegation, there is an \neffort to be reasonable with respect to the hour of the vote and to \nlimit our rights with respect to the 30 hours respectively. Our goal is \ncertainly not to cause people to vote at a very extreme hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate stands in \nadjournment until 10 a.m., Friday, November 19, 1999.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 10:44 p.m., adjourned until Friday, \nNovember 19, 1999, at 10 a.m.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}]
