Mr. President, this week is the last week the Senate will \nbe in session before we take a break for the Easter holiday. During the \nperiod of that break, on April 20, we will remember an anniversary. It \nis a sad remembrance. It is the 1-year anniversary of the shooting at \nColumbine High School in Colorado.\n  Most of us can remember the scenes from television played and \nreplayed so often. The scenes of children, not unlike our own children, \nracing out of the school away from other kids who were shooting away \nwith weapons. You can remember, I am sure--I will always remember--a \nyoung man who dragged himself, having already been shot, out of a \nwindow, trying to fall to the ground and get away from danger. We saw \nthat terrible scene on television.\n  We watched as the funerals unfolded one after another; 12 innocent \nstudents were killed and 23 were injured.\n  We finally came to realize as a nation that the tragedy which struck \nin Colorado could touch any one of us anywhere and at any school. \nColumbine was not the most predictable place for this to occur. \nColumbine was a place where you would have thought that would never \noccur. But sadly, this is the reality of America where too many guns \nare used in crimes of violence.\n  If you look through the chronology of school shootings since 1997, \nBethel in the State of Alaska; Pearl, MI; West Paducah, KY; Jonesboro, \nAK; Edinboro, PA; Fayetteville, TN; Springfield, OR; Littleton, CO; \nConyers, GA; Deming, NM; Fort Gibson, OK; Mount Morris Township, MI--\nyou will remember that episode in Michigan. It wasn't that long ago. On \nFebruary 29, a 6-year-old boy went to his first-grade classroom, pulled \nout a 32-caliber Davis Industries\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nsemiautomatic pistol, pointed it at his classmates, and then turned the \ngun on Kayla Rolland, 6 years old, and fatally shot her in the neck.\n  This sad reality is on the minds of American families. The obvious \nquestion of the Senate and the Congress is: Is there anything you can \ndo? What can you do? What will you do?\n  The first anniversary of Columbine will come and go next week, and \nsadly Congress will have done nothing--absolutely nothing.\n  We passed a bill last year on the floor of the Senate which at least \nmoved us closer to the possibility of keeping guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and children.\n  There was an idea behind this law that was not an unreasonable or \nradical idea, which was the suggestion that if a person bought a gun at \na gun show, that person would be subject to the same background checks \nas a person who bought one from a licensed gun dealer. We don't want to \nsell guns to criminals. We don't want to sell them to people with a \nhistory of violent mental illness. We certainly don't want to sell guns \nto children. Why wouldn't we check at a gun show to make certain that \nwe are keeping guns away from those people? That is what the law said. \nThat was what was passed here in the Senate.\n  The background check has become automated and computerized. Within 2 \nhours after the name is submitted, some 95 percent of all of the names \nsubmitted--they run them through--95 percent of the people who buy a \ngun at a gun show would be delayed 2 hours from buying a gun. For the 5 \npercent where questions are raised and they can't give them an \nimmediate answer, that 5 percent is 20 times more likely to be in a \nprohibited category; that is, they are 20 times more likely to be \ncriminals, people with a history of violent mental illness, or those \nwho should otherwise be disqualified.\n  The law we proposed was not a radical idea. It said: Can you wait 2 \nhours at a gun show so we can do a background check and make sure that \npeople who should not buy guns, don't buy them? It is an inconvenience. \nBut you know, we put up with inconvenience every day for the security \nof ourselves and our families.\n  When I flew through O'Hare Airport yesterday to come to Washington, I \nwent through a metal detector. They stopped me: Take the change out of \nyour pockets and go back through. That is an inconvenience. That is a \ndelay. I am prepared to accept that. If it means there will be fewer \nterrorist attacks and fewer threats on people traveling, I accept it.\n\n  That is what this law says; it is an inconvenience. At a gun show, \nwait for the background check to be completed before you are allowed to \nget your gun. That is what we proposed.\n  Second, we said if you are going to own a gun, you have a legal \nresponsibility to store it safely. You exercise your constitutional \nright under the second amendment to buy a gun, but then when you take \nit home, for goodness' sake, put it in a place so children can't get \ntheir hands on it.\n  We called for trigger locks, and that is becoming a popular, common \nsuggestion--it is not an unreasonable suggestion, certainly--so \nchildren don't get their hands on guns. Every day in America, we lose \njust as many kids to guns as we lost on April 20, 1999, at that one \nhigh school in Colorado--12 kids a day die because of guns. Some are \nsuicides, some are drive-by gangbanger shootings, and others are just \naccidents where curious kids play with guns and shoot themselves or \ntheir playmates.\n  Our bill said let's require trigger locks on guns, let's make sure \nthey are stored safely and the kids, such as this fellow in Michigan, \ndo not end up with a .32-caliber Davis industries semiautomatic pistol \nin the first grade where he killed Kayla Rowland. That was the second \npart of this bill.\n  The third part said you don't need these high-capacity Ammo clips \nwith hundreds of bullets in them if you are going out to shoot a deer. \nIf you need a semiautomatic weapon to shoot a deer, maybe you ought to \nstick to fishing. We are saying we don't need to make these clips in \nthe United States nor do we need to import them. These are people \nkillers. These are not guns used in sporting or hunting enterprises. \nThat was the third part of the bill.\n  We almost lost the gun shows provision I have just described on the \nSenate floor. The gun shows amendment passed by one vote, the vote of \nVice President Gore, who under the Constitution can break a tie. He \nshowed up that day and cast the deciding vote. We passed the gun shows \namendment by one vote after Columbine, after this national tragedy. We \npassed it by one vote. We sent it across the Rotunda to the House of \nRepresentatives. Now it is their responsibility. We gave them 2 or 3 \nweeks to prepare to debate the bill. But we obviously gave the gun \nlobby at least the same period of time to prepare their campaign \nagainst it. And they were successful. They watered down the gun shows \namendment. They took the viable parts out of it. They passed a shadow \nof what we passed in the Senate.\n  At that point, it goes to the conference committee and the House and \nSenate sit together and try to work out a compromise. Here we sit, \nalmost a year after Columbine, and we have done absolutely nothing. \nFamilies across America who expect this Congress to do the most basic \nthings for gun safety have a right to be angry that this Congress is so \ninsensitive and unwilling to address this critical issue of gun safety, \nof safety in the classrooms, keeping guns out of the hands of \ncriminals, violently mental ill people, and children.\n  The other side says, of course, it isn't about new laws. We hear the \ngun lobby say we have plenty of laws, it is about enforcing the laws on \nthe books. How many times have we heard Charlton Heston and those folks \ncome up with that argument? I don't disagree with them. I think \nenforcement is critical and existing laws should be enforced.\n  So last week while we were debating the budget resolution, I brought \na proposal on the floor of the Senate. Many Members, frankly, subscribe \nto the NRA position that we need more enforcement. I said let's put \nmore agents and inspectors in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms so they can find the gun dealers who are breaking the law and \nselling their guns to criminals; let's put 1,000 more prosecutors \nacross America to enforce those laws, prosecute those laws, and put \npeople in jail who violate those laws.\n\n  Unfortunately, I couldn't succeed and I didn't prevail. A Senator \ncame to the floor and offered an alternative which took out all the \nmoney for the ATF agents and inspectors. He didn't want to put more \nenforcement in the gun laws of America. And he prevailed. The argument \nthat this is about enforcement doesn't square with the vote that took \nplace last week.\n  There are 102,000 gun dealers across America, about 80,000 who \nactively sell weapons that are used in sport and hunting. When we did a \nsurvey, out of those 80,000 federally licensed gun dealers, we found if \nwe narrowed it down to those gun dealers who sell guns that end up \nbeing used in crime, traceable guns used in crime, only 1,000 of the \n80,000 gun dealers are the culprits, the ones selling guns to people \nthat are ultimately used in crime. Over half the guns used in crime in \nAmerica come from 1,000 of the gun dealers out of 80,000.\n  It makes sense to me to go after these 1,000, and it makes sense to \nme to give resources to the ATF and the Department of the Treasury to \ngo after these gun dealers, close them down if we have to, but enforce \nthe law. Don't let people--whether they are in Illinois, my home State, \nor any other State--sell guns that are going to be used in a crime.\n  When I put the amendment on the floor, the other side couldn't accept \nthat. They didn't want to put more enforcement in the gun laws. So they \ncame up with a much weaker alternative.\n  Here we are at the traditional and historic standoff. This Congress \nfailed to act for 1 year after Columbine. The images are still fresh in \nour mind of those kids running for their lives out of their own high \nschool; those caskets, one after the other, at funerals; grieving \nparents, grieving communities, and a grieving nation; and this \nCongress, unable and unwilling to respond or act. It is shameful. It is \ndisgraceful. And it continues. The school violence, the gun violence \nthat struck Columbine, continues. Look beyond the schools. We see it in \nthe streets and the neighborhoods, and more children will die today\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\nin America, 12 more, the same number killed at Columbine--12 more--\nbecause we will not take the initiative for gun safety.\n  Has this Congress reached such a point that we are under the thumb of \nthe National Rifle Association and the gun lobby? That we would let \nthose well dressed lobbyists down on K Street rule our agenda to the \npoint where American families are being ignored? I hope not.\n  I hope when we remember in just a few days the anniversary of \nColumbine, families across America will take just a few minutes, get on \nthe phone, and call their Congressman and their Senator and ask them \none simple question: I just heard about Columbine; what have you done \nwith your vote to make my kids safer in school since this tragedy? If \ncitizens will call and ask that question, perhaps we will see a change \nof sentiment here on Capitol Hill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank once again the Senator from \nIllinois for his eloquence on the issue of sensible gun laws and add my \nvoice to his plea that the Senate do what it is supposed to do, which \nis to bring out the juvenile justice bill with five sensible gun \ncontrol measures, sensible measures that will reduce gun violence.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, who is on the floor \nas well, for his very important sense-of-the-Senate Amendment to the \nbudget resolution, which actually says it is the opinion of the Senate \nthat we ought to be voting on those gun measures. It passed by a slim \nmajority, but so far we have not seen any results.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2485-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2485-S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GAS TAX REPEAL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I take to the floor today is \nnot only to underscore what Senator Durbin has said but to say that \nwhile I think we should be doing this juvenile justice bill and passing \nthe gun measures that lie within it, what we are doing today makes no \nsense at all, in my view, which is to cancel, if you will, the 4.3-cent \nFederal tax on a gallon of gasoline which, in the case of my State, if \ncarried out over 2 years, would lose my State $1.7 billion in highway \nfunds and transit moneys.\n  The people in my State are very smart. We are suffering from the \nhighest gas prices in the United States, but we also understand the \nanswer is not to use this as an excuse to slash highway funds, to begin \ndrilling off the coast of California or to open up the Alaska Wildlife \nRefuge to drilling. People in my State understand we need an energy \npolicy, not some kind of gimmickry that the other side is using to lash \nout at Vice President Gore and say he, in fact, wants higher gas taxes, \nwhich is just a made-up story.\n  What we need in this country is an energy policy. What does that \nmean? First, it means having a Department of Energy that comes forward \nwith an energy policy for safe ways to produce energy in this Nation \nand ways to save energy.\n  What does the Republican Congress want to do? I think we can look \nover history if we want to find out. First, when they took over in \n1994--they got sworn in in 1995--one of the first things they tried to \ndo was eliminate the Department of Energy. That makes a lot of sense. \nWe need an energy policy, so what is the first thing they do? Try to \neliminate the Department of Energy? I have to say, Bill Richardson did \na masterful job of going around the world convincing the producers of \noil to do a better job, to increase their supply. But, if the \nRepublicans had their way, there would be no Cabinet position because \nthere would be no Department of Energy. So that is the first thing they \ndid in order to have an ``energy policy.''\n\n  What else did they try to do? Every year, year in and year out since \nthey took over, they have not provided adequate funding for alternative \nand renewable energy, which would lessen our dependence on foreign oil. \nThis is shortsighted and it only means our dependence on foreign oil \nwill increase. We need more investment in energy-efficient \ntechnologies, not less.\n  If you think I am just stating something that perhaps I cannot back \nup, let me give you the facts. On solar and renewable energy research \nand development, between the years 1996 and 2000, the Republicans have \ncut President Clinton's requests by 23.6 percent. On energy and \nconservation R, they have cut the President's requests 20.3 percent. \nEnergy conservation grants, which are so important to encourage energy \nconservation--by the way, that is the best kind of energy policy, \nconservation; everybody wins. It costs the consumer less, and it \ndestroys our environment less--they cut those grants by 25.4 percent. \nSo the bottom line is they first wanted to do away with the Department \nof Energy. That was their program. Then they took the funding for \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy and cut it by 22.2 percent.\n  How about this one? Our Secretary of Energy goes around the world and \ngets an increased oil supply of about 1.7 million barrels a day, which \nis excellent work--he did a good job. We could save 1 million barrels \nof oil a day if we increased the fuel economy of SUVs and light trucks \nto 27 miles per gallon. Now they are at about 20. We could save 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day from that simple step. What happens around \nhere? The Republicans, in 1995, put a rider on appropriation bills \nprohibiting the administration from raising fuel economy standards for \nSUVs and light trucks just to get it to 27 miles per gallon, which it \nis at now for cars.\n  This sounds like ``and a partridge in a pear tree.'' We have \ncontinual moves here: Eliminating the Department of Energy, providing \nin adequate funding for alternative and renewable energy, and riders \nprohibiting raising fuel economy for SUVs and light trucks.\n  Here is another one. We know when energy prices go up, it is very \nimportant that the President have the ability to tap the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. It is there when there is an emergency. It is very \nimportant that he have that power. The Republican Congress has failed \nto reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and without new \nreauthorization, no funds can be appropriated for the purchase of new \noil for the reserve. So the reserve is not going to increase. That is \nvery important.\n  This is four policies, all of which undermine an energy policy for \nthis country to lead to U.S. independence from foreign oil: Eliminating \nthe Department of Energy, providing inadequate funding for alternative \nand renewable energy, stopping us from increasing fuel efficiency for \nSUVs and light trucks, and failing to reauthorize the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  What do they come up with today? Repealing the gas tax. That is not \nan energy policy; it is a disaster--$1.7 billion lost over 2 years to \nmy State. It would hurt my State. The country as a whole would lose \n$18.8 billion from the measure that is going to come before us. I hope \nwe will not get cloture so we do not take it up. The Senate, frankly, \nhas expressed itself on the budget resolution against this shortsighted \namendment.\n\n  This is not, however, the only thing my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are pushing. I mentioned in my opening statement drilling in \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge. There is a big debate over that: Should we \nallow drilling in a wildlife refuge? I say we give this the commonsense \ntest. When President Eisenhower set up this refuge, do you think he \nthought about oil drilling in a refuge for the most magnificent \nwildlife you could find? I do not think so. Just think about it. What \nkind of refuge is it, if you have oil drilling there, with the risk of \nspills and all the traffic that comes with it?\n  Some are again calling for drilling off the coast of California. I \nhave to explain to my friends who think that is an energy policy that \nthat would undermine California's economy because our tourism industry \nis dependent on a beautiful, magnificent coast. Our recreation industry \nis dependent on a beautiful, unspoiled coast. We should not use this \nspike in gas prices as an excuse to destroy the highway fund, to \ndestroy the coast, to destroy a wildlife refuge. I think the American \npeople can see through this. It does not an energy policy make, to \nrepeal a tax which is earmarked for highways. It makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  Here is another fact: Right now in America there are 68,000 barrels a \nday\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\nbeing drilled and exported out of our country. While colleagues are \ntalking about drilling in a refuge and drilling off the coast, we are \nexporting 68,000 barrels a day.\n  There are 1 million barrels a day wasted because they will not vote \nto increase the fuel efficiency standards for SUVs and light trucks. \nThey vote down energy efficiency budget recommendations by this \nPresident. They do not give him the tools for increasing the quantity \nof gas or oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They turn a blind eye \nto the oil companies that are merging at a rapid rate. I was an \neconomics major in college many years ago. I am the first one to admit \nthat it was a long time ago. One thing I learned and which has not \nchanged was that competition is important for the consumer. When we \nhave less competition, the consumer suffers. We have seen merger after \nmerger. Yet we do not hear anyone on that side of the aisle saying \nmaybe it is time we put a moratorium on these mergers. On the other \nhand, they support these mergers, as far as I can tell. We need to \nimpose a moratorium on these mergers.\n  Mergers are at a near frenzy. Shell and Texaco entered a joint \nventure, which is essentially a merger, in 1997. British Petroleum and \nAmoco merged shortly thereafter. Last year, Exxon and Mobile merged. \nBP/Amoco is currently attempting to acquire California-based ARCO. If \none overlays gas prices with these mergers, it is straight up. It is \ncommon sense: Less competition, higher prices.\n  There are secret oil company documents that we know have been filed \nas part of the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit to block the merger. \nThose secret documents ought to be made public. One can see, if one \nreads the filing, that the FTC has made explosive charges of oil price \nmanipulation by BP. We know that a lot of BP's oil is being exported \nfrom this country. If we are going to allow this merger to take place, \nwe should at least insist that oil stay here rather than stand up in \nthis Chamber and say we are going to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax \nwhich is going to destroy the highway trust fund. The people in my \nState are against this proposal.\n\n  Between 1973 and 1995, we banned the export of the Alaska North Slope \ncrude. The GAO has said that lifting this export ban increased the \nprice of crude by more than $1 a barrel.\n  We can create an energy policy that will result in the lowering of \ngas prices and, by the way, help the environment and clean up our air. \nWhat do we do around here? We do not do the long-range planning. We are \nnot listening to the people who have studied this issue for years. We \nare turning a blind eye to these mergers which make prices skyrocket. \nWe are not doing anything about stopping the exportation of Alaskan \noil. We are not increasing the fuel economy standards.\n  We are taking the short view and trying to make political points by \nsaying: If we take away that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax, it is going to \nsolve our gas price problem. That is not the answer. The American \npeople are smart. They see this for what it is: A political ploy; it \ndoes not do anything; it robs our States of needed money for highways \nwhile they keep cutting back the funds the President requests for \nenergy efficiency.\n  I stand here as someone who has been involved in energy efficiency \nissues since I was a county supervisor in the seventies. That is when \nwe had those long lines because gas prices were high and people were \nscared. By the way, that is when the American car companies lost their \nmarket share because it was the foreign carmakers that were making the \nfuel-efficient cars. Why don't we learn from history? Why don't we do \nthe right thing instead of this short-term idea that makes no sense at \nall, that will only hurt our environment, will hurt our people, will \nhurt our ability to build the highways we need in the future, and \nabsolutely does nothing about lessening our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I am very pleased I had this opportunity to speak because I think \nthis issue is clearly one of the most important we can consider.\n  My last point is, half of our trade deficit is due to imported oil. \nWhat is reducing the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon going to do to lessen \nour dependence on foreign oil? Zero. Nothing. Nada. Let's do something \nthat is going to help our balance of trade, that is going to help our \nenvironment, that is going to help our economy, and that is going to \nhelp our people.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, by a bipartisan vote of 53-47, \nthe Senate adopted the Reed amendment to the budget resolution calling \non the conference committee on the juvenile justice bill to submit a \nreport by April 20 of this year, which is the 1-year anniversary of the \ntragedy at Columbine High School, and include in that report \ncommonsense gun control provisions which this Senate passed last May.\n  These provisions include an amendment that child safety locks be sold \nwith all handguns; an amendment to close the gun show loopholes so a \ncomplete background check can be done on all purchasers at gun shows; a \nban on the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips; and a ban on \njuvenile possession of semi-automatic assault weapons.\n  We adopted the Reed amendment, sponsored by many and supported by 53 \nSenators, because we wanted to send a message to the leadership of the \nHouse and Senate that America has waited too long for us to respond to \nthe tragedy at Columbine High School, too long to respond to the \npervasive floodtide of gun violence that every day kills 12 American \nchildren.\n  We have been down this road before. In 1993 and 1994, after a long \nlegislative battle, we were able to pass the Brady law and the assault \nweapons ban over the objections of the gun lobby and their allies in \nCongress. Since 1993, we have seen a 20 percent reduction in crime in \nthe United States. Gun crimes in particular fell 37 percent between \n1993 and 1998.\n  No one can claim the Brady law or the assault weapons ban alone was \nthe cause of this decline. There are other factors. We also know that \npreventing 500,000 felons, fugitives, and other prohibited purchasers \nfrom easily obtaining firearms has made a significant contribution to \nthat reduction in gun violence.\n  The American people were with us when we passed those commonsense gun \ninitiatives in 1993 and 1994, and they are with us today. Eighty-nine \npercent of Americans favor requiring a background check on all sales at \ngun shows. A similar percentage, 89 percent, favors requiring child \nsafety locks be sold with all handguns.\n\n  Unfortunately, the gun lobby and its allies in Congress are trying to \nhide behind a claim there is inaction in enforcement, arguing that we \nneed tougher enforcement, not new gun laws.\n  We agree, we need good, strong enforcement of our gun laws. We need \nadditional resources devoted to this task. That is why we support the \nPresident's request for substantial new resources for gun law \nenforcement, including 1,000 new prosecutors, 500 new ATF agents and \ninspectors, an expansion of the Project Exile program to toughen \nsentences for gun crimes, and new ballistics testing procedures. We \nneed all these things.\n  But the gun lobby presents us with a false choice between tougher \nenforcement or more legislation. The American people know we need both. \nYou cannot enforce a loophole. We need legislation to close these \nloopholes so our\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nauthorities can truly and effectively and efficiently enforce the law.\n  The gun show loophole is just one example. When one-quarter or more \nof dealers at gun shows are unlicensed and therefore are not subject to \nthe Brady background checks--they do not have to check the background \nof the purchaser--it does not take a genius to figure out, if a \nprohibited person seeks to purchase a weapon, where they will go. They \nwill go right to those unlicensed dealers at the gun shows.\n  Under current law, someone who is a felon, someone who is prohibited \nfrom purchasing a firearm under the Brady law, and other laws, could go \nto an unlicensed dealer at a gun show and purchase as many weapons as \nhe or she wanted without any type of background check, and they would \nnot be effectively screened for the acquisition of a firearm.\n  Senator Lautenberg has many times on this floor pointed to Robyn \nAnderson--the woman who went to a Colorado gun show with Dylan Klebold \nand Eric Harris to help them buy 3 of the guns they used to kill 13 \npeople at Columbine High School--who has said that the process was much \ntoo easy. In fact, it is reported that Harris and Klebold repeatedly \nasked dealers at the gun show if they were licensed or unlicensed, \neventually finding a private seller, an unlicensed seller, in order to \navoid paperwork and background checks.\n  What could be clearer? What could be more compelling for the need to \nclose this loophole than the demonstration that these two young men \nwere clever enough--and, frankly, the law is so wide open, you do not \nhave to be that clever--to find a way to purchase weapons when they \nwere supposed to be prevented from doing it? And they did.\n  Robyn Anderson later testified before the Colorado legislature, \nsaying:\n\n       It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I \n     wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a \n     background check.\n\n  We need to move promptly and swiftly to pass the Lautenberg amendment \nwhich was included in the juvenile justice bill to close this loophole \nand give our authorities the leverage they need to truly enforce the \nlaws. The time has come for action. We have waited for an entire year. \nThat wait is unforgivable. The memories of those students and what \nhappened there linger. We should have done something much sooner than \nthis. But we have a chance.\n  What is even worse is that Congress is about to go into a recess at \nthe end of this week. So when all of those grieving families in \nColorado and across the country come together on April 20 to ask, \n``What have we done,'' not only will we say ``nothing,'' but we will be \nfar from the center of Washington where we should have done something. \nWe can pass this legislation.\n\n  What kind of message does that send, not only to the people of \nColumbine but the families of thousands and thousands of people who die \neach year? Over half of them are not killed in some type of \nconfrontation; over half of them are killed by accidents and suicides.\n  We have to do something. We can do something. If we had safety locks \non weapons, that could help, or we could think about, as some States \ndo, having a waiting period. We used to have a waiting period with the \nBrady bill, but, again, to get that legislation through the Congress, \nwe had to--as soon as the instant check system was put into place--\nabandon the waiting period.\n  There is more we can do.\n  Finally, I thank those Republican and Democratic Senators who joined \nlast week to pass the Reed amendment, to send a strong signal to the \nleadership that we have to do something--words are insufficient--to \nexpress truly what we should express with respect to the tragedy at \nColumbine.\n  We need action. We need legislation. We need laws that will give our \nenforcement authorities the tools to do the job and do it well. \nAlthough the time is dwindling away, I hope we can move quickly so that \non April 20 we will not only commemorate a tragedy but celebrate the \npassage of legislation that will help prevent, I hope, future \ntragedies.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have started our debate, and later \nthis afternoon we will have a vote on the disposition of the waiver of \nthe gas tax.\n  Upon arriving on the floor, I had the opportunity to hear the remarks \nof the Senator from California relative to an issue we have discussed \non previous occasions; that is, the export of petroleum, energy \nproducts. I think the generalization was that she was concerned with \nthe export from the State of Alaska of some 60,000 barrels a day of oil \nproduct.\n  As I have explained on this floor before, the export of our oil \nproduct, which is surplus to the west coast, has been carried on by one \ncompany that had that access, British Petroleum. British Petroleum has \nsince acquired the non-Alaska segment of ARCO, which includes a number \nof refineries. BP did not have refineries on the west coast. I have \nintroduced a letter in the Record from BP indicating they will curtail \nexports of Alaskan oil at the end of this month. I also have a letter \nfrom Phillips, which has acquired ARCO Alaska, and it is not their \nintent to export Alaskan oil.\n  I hope that addresses and resolves the issue and satisfies the \nconcerns of those who continually bring this up in spite of my \nexplanation.\n  But I will also submit for the Record the list of exports of \npetroleum products by States of exit for the current month. I note that \nAlaska is listed on this list at 3.9 million barrels a day; that \nCalifornia, the State of which my friend was speaking, shows exports of \n6.2 million barrels a day of energy products; that Texas, for example, \nhas 14 million barrels a day of petroleum, energy products; that \nLouisiana has 4.4 million.\n  We are currently exporting about 37 million barrels of energy \nproducts. This is a combination of jet fuel, motor gas, crude oil, and \nso forth. But it simply points out a reality that I think the Record \nshould note.\n  Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate is going to have a chance to \nvote on whether we can quickly give the American motorists some relief \nfrom spiraling gasoline costs. I urge my colleagues to objectively \nevaluate the responsibility they have in representing the American \npeople on this issue and whether the American people clearly want \nrelief.\n  The 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax, that was adopted in 1993 after Vice \nPresident Al Gore cast the deciding tie-breaking vote, raised the gas \ntax by 30 percent. It is interesting to go back and look at the issue. \nI know some of my colleagues will come to the floor because they think \nit is a mistake to establish a precedent wherein general revenues are \nused to finance highway construction. Ordinarily I would agree with \nthem, but not in this case.\n\n  As the record will show, in 1993, when this was passed, the revenue \nwent to fund the general fund. That is the budget. That is the \nexpenditures of the administration as they see fit. There was a \nsubstantial revenue stream that went into the general fund of about $21 \nbillion. That is what was collected in that timeframe between 1993 and \n1997, when the Republican majority changed the formula and directed \nthat the 4.3 cent a gallon be put into the highway trust fund. That is \na little background to keep in mind, as we address the appropriateness \nof supporting or rejecting the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act, which is \nbefore us.\n  The point I make again is that the administration had the benefit of \n$21 billion of expenditures from the revenue generated from 1993 until \n1997, when the Republican majority changed the funding mechanism and \nput it in the highway trust fund. I also remind my colleagues that the \nVice President broke the tie back in 1993 when the 4.3-cent-a-gallon \ntax was initiated. I think the Vice President has to bear the \nresponsibility of defending his position on the Gore tax, as it has \nbeen fondly referred to by those of us on the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  I find it curious to reflect that not a single penny of that tax was \ndedicated to highway or bridge construction. All the money was \nearmarked for the administration's spending.\n  I think we have an obligation to hear from the American public. What \ndo\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nthey think? This is a Gallup poll, March 30 through April 2. It asked \nthe question: Would you favor or oppose a temporary reduction in the \nFederal gas tax by 4.3 cents per gallon as a way of dealing with the \nincreased price of oil? Notice, it does not ask about the highway trust \nfund. It does not ask whether we will reimburse the highway trust fund. \nIt is quite specific: Would you favor or oppose a temporary reduction \nin the Federal gas tax of 4.3 cents per gallon as a way of dealing with \nthe increased price of oil?\n  In response to this poll, 74 percent of the respondents favor a \ntemporary reduction; those in opposition, 23 percent. I think this is a \nfair sample of the attitude of the American public with regard to this \nissue. Seventy-four percent favor the temporary reduction. I encourage \nmy colleagues, as well as the staffs, observing the debate today, to \nrecognize this. I remind all Members of the Gallup poll, March 30 to \nApril 2, 74 percent of the respondents favor a temporary reduction. I \nthink that is significant and represents, certainly, the attitude of a \nsignificant portion of the American public.\n  I think it is appropriate that we make it clear it is the intention, \nthe commitment of those of us who happen to favor providing the \nAmerican public with relief that we ensure there is no sacrifice made \nin the highway trust fund program. In addition, our legislative \nguarantees that if the failed Clinton-Gore energy policy results in the \nprice of gasoline rising above $2 a gallon--that is for regular--all \nfuel taxes will be lifted until the end of the year.\n  Let me make sure everybody understands. We are proposing to waive the \n4.3 immediately, suspending it for the balance of this year, with the \nproviso that the highway trust fund will be totally funded. I \nemphasize, there is no free lunch. It has to come from the budget \nsurplus. I would like to see it come from savings on wasteful \nGovernment spending. But it will provide immediate relief, and it will \nnot jeopardize the highway trust fund.\n  In addition, the legislation guarantees that if the failed Clinton-\nGore energy policy results in the price of gasoline rising above $2 a \ngallon for the average price of fuel--that is regular self serve--all \nfuel taxes will be lifted until the end of the year.\n\n  Isn't this the kind of a safety net the American consumer needs, like \nthe mom who goes down to fill up the Suburban at $1.80 a gallon? That \nshoots a pretty good hole in a $100 bill for that 40-gallon gas tank. \nWhat about the guy who gets up at 4 o'clock in the morning to drive \ninto Washington, DC, to work as a carpenter. He drives 50 or 60 miles \nin the morning, the same in the evening. Is he looking for some relief? \nYou bet he is.\n  This is real relief. It appropriately puts the responsibility back \nwhere it belongs--on the administration--to ensure us that their \nprojections stand the test of time.\n  If you look at their projections, they are pretty weak. The \nstatements by the Secretary of Energy were pretty weak as far as \npredicting the price. I note that on the CBS ``Early Show'' of March \n29, the Secretary indicated, when asked by Jane Clayson about the \nprice:\n\n       . . . gasoline prices will gradually and steadily decline, \n     possibly, according to the Energy Information Administration, \n     my department, as much as 11 cents by the end of September. . \n     . .\n\n  What are we going to do on Memorial Day? What are we going to do on \nthe Fourth of July? They are hedging. This administration knows it is \nin trouble on this issue because it does not have an energy policy and \nis simply saying, ``Well, it is going to go down a little bit, maybe by \nthe end of September.''\n  Further questioning by the interviewer Jane Clayson:\n\n       So the bottom line, how much can we expect to see a drop at \n     the pump?\n\n  Secretary Richardson replied:\n\n       Well, bottom line--I'm just quoting our investigators and \n     other official people--they are saying 11 cents by the end of \n     the summer, possibly over 15, 16, 17 by the end of this year.\n\n  That is their answer, not very encouraging.\n  Let's get a little more current. If my colleagues have any doubt that \nprices are not going to come down very much, all they have to do is \nread today's New York Times. The headline story is: ``Oil Prices Fall \nNearly Enough For OPEC''--to do what--``to cut production.''\n  Imagine that: We are seeing a decline, and they are talking about \ncutting production.\n  I quote:\n\n       Less than two weeks after OPEC agreed to increase \n     production to bring down the cost of oil, prices have fallen \n     abruptly and are near the level at which the cartel had \n     agreed it would then cut back its output. Ali Rodriguez, \n     President of the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries, \n     said today that it the price of the organization's benchmark \n     basket of crude oil remained below $22 a barrel, the 1.5 \n     million a day agreed to last month would be cut back by one \n     third.\n\n  There is the leverage. They are calling the shots. We are not calling \nthe shots.\n  I find it extraordinary that as this administration looks at the \nenergy crisis, we would simply look to the Mideast for relief by \nincreasing imports.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 11, 2000]\n\n        Oil Price Falls Nearly Enough For OPEC to Cut Production\n\n       CARACAS, Venezuela, April 10 (Bloomberg News)--Less than \n     two weeks after OPEC agreed to increase production to bring \n     down the cost of oil, prices have fallen abruptly and are \n     near the level at which the cartel had agreed it would then \n     cut back its output.\n       Ali Rodriguez, president of the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries, said today that if the price of the \n     organization's benchmark basket of crude oil remained below \n     $22 a barrel, the 1.5 million barrel-a-day increase that the \n     organization agreed to last month would be cut back by one \n     third. OPEC was expected to announce that the basket price \n     dipped below $22 today, falling from a five-month low of \n     $22.14 on Friday.\n       The price ``may fall a little further,'' Mr. Rodriguez said \n     in a television interview. ``But OPEC has already established \n     a corrective mechanism, and if prices fall below $22 a barrel \n     for 20 consecutive days we'll immediately cut back \n     production.''\n       Mr. Rodriguez, who is also the energy minister of \n     Venezuela, said the traditional slump in demand for oil \n     during the spring also could make the cutback likely. The \n     German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported today \n     that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, would endorse the \n     cuts if prices slipped further.\n       Oil prices have plunged about 30 percent since last month, \n     when they reached nine-year highs. After a meeting March 29 \n     in Vienna of the 11-member organization, 9 OPEC members \n     agreed to raise oil output quotas by about 1.5 million \n     barrels a day and keep prices within a range of $22 to $28.\n       Crude oil plunged 4.8 percent to a three-month low of \n     $23.85 on the New York Mercantile Exchange today. OPEC's \n     basket has been trading $2 to $3 cheaper than New York oil.\n       Mr. Rodriguez said he had the authority as OPEC president \n     to order small adjustments before the group's next meeting in \n     June.\n       ``If the price falls I can communicate to each country how \n     much it must cut back,'' he said.\n       Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, refused to join the \n     agreement to increase production, saying the move would lead \n     to a price rout. Iraq, another member that does not \n     participate in the cuts, also said new production would hurt \n     prices.\n       Mr. Rodriguez said he still expected demand for oil to \n     surge this year, perhaps prompting OPEC to approve further \n     increases in output in June or later.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if OPEC decides to cut back its \nincreased production by one-third, then where are we? We are right back \nwhere we were before OPEC made the decision to raise production.\n  Think about that--full circle.\n  I spoke before the ocean industries this morning and expressed my \nconcern. The Secretary of Energy, the Honorable Bill Richardson, spoke \nbefore me. I don't think he was able to convey much of a feeling of \nassurance that, indeed, we had this issue of an energy crisis under \ncontrol.\n  If OPEC makes the decision to raise production, I think we have to go \nback and examine the deal the Secretary made with OPEC. That is rather \ninteresting. I think we need to because OPEC never really increased \ntheir production by 1.5 or 1.7 million barrels. If you factor in the \nreality that OPEC was cheating, what really happened on or before March \n27 was OPEC's actual increase of production was a bare 500,000 barrels \na day. That is what we really got.\n  The rationale for that is the recognition, if you read the agreement, \nthat they acknowledge they were posting in the cartel a production of \n23 million barrels a day. They were cheating and\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nput out 24.2 million barrels a day. When the administration announced \nthat it was going to get an additional 1.7 million barrels a day, they \ndidn't take into account the reality that they were already cheating by \n1.2 million barrels a day. If you subtract 1.2 from 1.7, you get \n500,000 barrels a day. That is actually what we got.\n  In that case, we are right back where we started before OPEC met.\n  Do not be misled, my colleagues. All of that doesn't go to the United \nStates. There are other customers of OPEC. We traditionally get 16 \npercent of our crude oil from OPEC. By the time you look at the \nallotments of the other countries, it is estimated that out of 500,000 \nbarrels, the U.S. gets somewhere in the area of 75,000 to 88,000 \nbarrels.\n  Furthermore, if you look at what we consume in the general \nmetropolitan area of Washington, DC, and its extensions, it is about \n121,000 barrels a day.\n  We haven't gotten anything. We are almost assured that we will see \nhigher gasoline prices this summer.\n  For that reason alone, I believe we should give relief now to the \nAmerican motorists by rolling back the Gore gas tax.\n  Yesterday, I indicated that 74 percent of the American people think \nthat the 4.3 cents per gallon should be temporarily lifted.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Gallup Poll \nof March 30 to April 3 which indicated that 74 percent favor a \ntemporary reduction of the Federal gas tax of 4.3 cents per gallon as a \nway of dealing with the increased price of oil, and 23 percent oppose \nthat.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Would you favor or oppose a temporary reduction in the \n     federal gas tax by 4.3 cents per gallon as a way of dealing \n     with the increased price of oil?\n\n                                                                Percent\nFavor................................................................74\nOppose...............................................................23\n\nSource: Gallup, Mar. 30-Apr. 2.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is not just the American motorists \nwho want to see gas taxes come down. There are business organizations, \nespecially small businesses, that have been hit hard by the fuel price \njump. Their businesses are being devastated.\n  I have a letter of support from the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses which represents more than 600,000 small \nbusinesses in America. In their letter, they cite the fuel price hike \nand what it has meant to an average small business.\n  I quote:\n\n       For a small company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel \n     fuel in a month, the increase it prices in the past year will \n     cost that company an additional $40,000 per month. If fuel \n     prices remain high, these costs could eventually be passed on \n     to consumers in the form of higher prices for many goods and \n     services. A 4.3 cent reduction in the cost of fuel would save \n     the company more than $2,000 per month.\n\n  The Independent Truckers Association also sent a letter of its \nsupport to our legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record along with the \nletter from the National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         NFIB,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I want to \n     express our support for Senate Bill 2285 which would \n     temporarily repeal the 4.3 cent excise tax on fuel, provide \n     additional tax relief should the cost of fuel continue to \n     rise, and protect funding levels in the Highway Trust Fund. \n     NFIB urges members to support its adoption.\n       Gas prices have been soaring. According to the U.S. \n     Department of Energy, gas prices, which have increased by as \n     much as 50 percent in the past year, are likely to continue \n     to rise into the summer, if not beyond.\n       These high fuel prices are hitting many Americans, \n     especially small businesses, extremely hard. For a small \n     company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel in a \n     month, the increase in prices in the past year will cost that \n     company an additional $40,000 per month. If fuel prices \n     remain high these costs could eventually be passed on to \n     consumers in the form of higher prices for many goods and \n     services. A 4.3 cent reduction in the cost of fuel would save \n     the company more than $2,000 per month.\n       Your bill goes along way towards providing America's small \n     business owners valuable relief from rising fuel costs. We \n     applaud your proactive efforts to reduce this tax burden on \n     small business while at the same time providing a hold \n     harmless provision for the Highway Trust Fund. This will \n     guarantee that full funding will continue to flow to states \n     and local communities for planned infrastructure projects.\n       Mr. Leader, thank you for your continued support of small \n     businesses. We look forward to working with you to enact S. \n     2285 into law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                               Sr. Vice President,\n     Federal Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Independent Truckers Association,\n\n                                 Half Moon Bay, CA, April 4, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Independent Truckers Association--\n     the oldest association of the nation's long-haul independent \n     truckers and small fleet owners--endorses wholeheartedly the \n     swift passage of S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act \n     of 2000.\n       This measure would temporarily repeal the 4.3 cents excise \n     tax on fuels and protect funding levels in the highway Trust \n     Fund. We see this as an important first step to help ensure \n     that prices for consumer goods shipped to market will remain \n     stable.\n       It's important to recognize that truckers--not just the \n     independents and small fleets, but the whole industry--work \n     on a very small profit margin. So, the recent increase of oil \n     prices by OPEC, along with the failed energy policy of the \n     Clinton-Gore Administration, strikes deep into the heart and \n     wallet of America's truckers. Enacting S. 2285 today will \n     help those injured by excessive oil and fuel prices, and help \n     keep the economy rolling along.\n       Senator Lott, thank you for your support of America's \n     independent truckers. We look forward to working with you to \n     enact S. 2285 into law.\n           Very Sincerely,\n                                                   Mike Parkhurst,\n     National Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I quote from this letter. It says:\n\n       It is important to recognize that truckers, not just the \n     independents and small fleets, but the whole industry, work \n     on a very small profit margin. So the recent increase in oil \n     prices by OPEC, along with the failed energy policies of the \n     Clinton/Gore administration, strikes deep in the heart and \n     wallet of American truckers. Enacting Senate bill 2285, the \n     Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act, today will help those injured \n     by excessive oil and fuel prices and will help keep the \n     economy rolling along.\n\n  I also have a letter of support from the National Food Processors \nAssociation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         NFPA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the National Food \n     Processors Association (NFPA), the nation's largest food \n     trade association, I am writing to urge that Congress take \n     action to address rapidly rising fuel prices. From the food \n     industry's perspective, the effects of higher energy prices \n     are about to move from the gas pump to the grocery store, \n     threatening to put a serious crimp in the incomes of \n     America's working families.\n       You no doubt have heard from the transportation sector \n     about the serious effect of the 50-plus percent fuel price \n     increase since the first of the year. America's agribusiness \n     industry relies heavily on trucks and the rails to transport \n     food from the farm to processor and on to kitchen tables all \n     across the United States. Additionally, the nation's food \n     processors--an industry employing more than 1.5 million \n     workers in some 20,000 facilities across the country--consume \n     no small measure of energy to make available the tasty and \n     nutritious foods that consumers enjoy. Given the intense \n     competition and very small profit margins, under which most \n     food manufacturers operate, they are in no position to absorb \n     these dramatic increases in energy prices.\n       I believe the absence of an effective national energy \n     policy is largely responsible for this budding crisis. \n     However, there are tools available now to help address this \n     problem, at least for the short term. First, portions of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve could be released, helping reduce \n     prices by increasing, temporarily, the supply of fuel. \n     Second, I encourage Congress to enact at least a temporary \n     suspension of the most recent 4.3-cent gasoline tax increase, \n     which was adopted in 1993 for the purpose of deficit \n     reduction. NFPA also has urged President Clinton to support \n     such actions.\n       Leadership by Congress is needed to address this serious \n     issue. I hope that the U.S. Senate will work with the \n     President to take action promptly to ease the strain of \n     rapidly increasing fuel costs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John R. Cady.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, many Americans accepted the gas tax\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nincrease because they believed that the money would go to rebuilding \nand expanding the Nation's highway infrastructure. Today, that is \nexactly how the money is used. But, again, since the 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon tax was adopted in 1993, not a single penny of that went into, \nas I said, building a highway or repairing a bridge. When the tax was \nadopted, it was not earmarked for the highway trust fund. It was \ninstead collected from the motorists, transferred to the Treasury \nDepartment, and then spent for whatever programs the Clinton \nadministration wanted. But those programs did not include added highway \nconstruction.\n  That changed when Republicans took control of Congress and enacted \nthe 1997 highway bill. Only then did these fuel tax revenues become \nearmarked for highways, bridges, and mass transit.\n  I know some are concerned legitimately that if we spend these taxes \nfor the remainder of this year, the highway trust fund, which finances \nroads, bridges, and mass transit, could be in danger. That is a \nlegitimate concern. I am sure it is going to be a concern in the debate \nthat is forthcoming. But I would like to try at least to put those \nfears to rest.\n  Our legislation is quite specific. If you do not believe that we can \npass a bill that ensures something, then the argument is moot. But this \nlegislation ensures that the highway trust fund will not lose a single \npenny during tax holiday. We require that all moneys that would have \nanything to do with the fund had the taxes not been suspended be \nreplaced by other Federal revenues.\n  That isn't a free lunch. That is going to be difficult to do. But if \nthis legislation passes, that is what is going to happen. We are going \nto have to find the money. I hope it will come from on-budget surplus. \nI would rather see it coming from reducing wasteful Federal programs.\n  Remember. The consumer can't pass it on. He or she can't pass on this \nincreased price to anybody. They are stuck with it. The truckers that \ncame to Washington can't pass it on. If you look at your airline \nticket, it is passed on. Nobody can figure out the cost of an airline \nticket. If you fly on a Monday or a Tuesday night, it is all different. \nThe fishermen, the farmers--we don't really look at the impact on our \neconomy. The farmer, for example, is dependent on fertilizer. Where \ndoes fertilizer come from? It comes from urea. Urea is made out of \ngas--all petroleum products. We have a multiplier here.\n  We have the difficulty of recognizing that we have become beholden to \nthe Mideast for the sources.\n  I can assure the American motorists that highway construction \nprojects this year and next year will be unaffected by the tax holiday \nthat we are proposing in this legislation. When the trust fund is fully \nrestored, all the projects scheduled for beyond 2002 will be completed. \nThat is in the legislation.\n  The question before the Senate today is simple. Do Senators want to \ngive the American motorists a break at the gas pump when gas prices are \nhigh?\n  Again, I refer to the Gallop Poll. Seventy-four percent of Americans \nsay yes; 25 percent of Americans say no.\n  I think we should adopt this temporary tax holiday and invoke cloture \non the bill.\n  The rationale is we are giving the American people a choice. We are \nthe elected representatives. Aren't we? What is the priority? Is there \na priority to have a choice and a reduction knowing that the highway \ntrust fund is not going to be jeopardized because we are going to have \nto make it whole?\n  I would like to show you a couple more things before I conclude.\n  This is a picture of the hard, stark reality of where we are today \nand where we are going. Make no mistake about it. It is a very bleak \npicture. But it is very real because it shows the world oil balance for \nthe year 2000. It shows where we are currently as we enter the second \nquarter of the year.\n\n  We have global demand at 76.8 million barrels a day and global supply \nat 74. We have the sources of our crude oil, where it comes from in the \nworld, the non-OPEC, Iraqi production, OPEC 10 nations. The point is, \nin this country today, at the end of the first quarter, we are using \nreserves. The world is using up its reserves. In other words, the \ndemand is greater than supply, so the world is drawing down about 2 \nmillion barrels of its reserve.\n  The projection in the second quarter is interesting. It shows a \nsurplus of 200,000 barrels. The third quarter again draws down reserves \nof 1.3 million barrels a day. The fourth quarter is worse--2.7 million \nbarrels a day.\n  That is the harsh reality. If things are going to get better, we will \nhave to import more from OPEC or other nations such as Iraq.\n  I conclude with a reminder many people have forgotten relative to the \nadministration's attitude of how we will get relief in this country as \nwe look at various areas of domestic production. One of the most \ntelling is to recognize that currently a significant portion of our \nactivity is coming from the Gulf of Mexico. At the present time, OCS \nactivity is primarily coming off Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and \nAlabama, producing 30 percent of our natural gas and 22 percent our \ncrude oil. That is the OCS. That is in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I cannot help but note an article on October 23, 1999, from the \nMetropolitan edition of the Capitol City Press State Times, Morning \nAdvocate, Baton Rouge, LA. Vice President Gore says he will be more \nantidrilling than any other President. It is significant because it \nrepresents the attitude, I think, of this administration and certainly \nthe Vice President as he seeks the Presidency.\n\n       I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to \n     protect our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil \n     drilling.\n       I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the \n     coast of California and Florida and then I will go much \n     further, I will do everything in my power to make sure there \n     is no new drilling off these sensitive areas even in areas \n     already leased by previous administrations.\n\n  That is the Vice President saying, if elected President, he in effect \nwould cancel leases leased by previous administrations.\n  It is ironic our Secretary of Energy takes credit for deep-water \nroyalty relief. I worked with Senator Bennett Johnston on that \nlegislation. We got it passed. He takes some credit for it although it \ndidn't pass on his watch. Now the Vice President of the United States \nwants to undo it. I find that ironic.\n  The last point of irony is we are looking to receive our oil from \nIraq. I have a chart showing our increased dependence and what the oil \nfields look like. It is germane to this debate. Our fastest growing \nsource of imports is Iraq. Many people forget we had a war over there \nin 1991. We lost 147 American lives in that conflict. We had over \n500,000 troops over there. We were over there to make sure Saddam \nHussein did not take over the oil fields of Kuwait. That is the harsh \nfact. Iraq and Saddam Hussein had visions of going into Kuwait, taking \nover the oil fields, and moving on to Saudi Arabia. That was a war over \noil. We fought that battle.\n  This chart demonstrates where we are today. I am outraged. Last year, \nwe imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq; we are currently importing \n700,000 barrels a day. That is where we are.\n  In addition to the loss of lives and the fact we had nearly 400 \nwounded and 23 taken prisoner, what has it cost the American taxpayer? \nThe American taxpayer has been hit for over $10 billion in costs in \nkeeping Saddam Hussein fenced in. Imagine that, $10 billion.\n  How many remember what happened when Saddam Hussein was defeated? \nThat is what happened. Take a good look. It shows the burning oil \nfields of Kuwait he left behind. The fires are raging, and there are \nAmericans trying to cap the wells and get this environmental disaster \nunder control. That is the kind of person we are dealing with. We are \nlooking to them to bail this country out from the standpoint of \nincreasing our imports? This is the policy of this administration?\n  One other thing on which I cannot help but comment. I think it is so \nironic, this war is still going on. It is not reported in the \nWashington press. I don't know if the folks back home know it. An \narticle from March 29, Wednesday, the International News Service, says:\n\n       U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense System.\n       U.S. warplanes bombed Iraq air-defense system Wednesday in \n     response to Iraqi artillery fired during their patrol.\n\n  There is a little more detail in the French newspaper, Agence France \nPresse, press reports from April 9:\n\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\n\n       U.S. war planes bombed northern Iraq Sunday after coming \n     under Iraqi fire during routine patrols over the northern no-\n     fly zone, the U.S. military said. The aircraft dropped \n     ``ordnance on elements of the Iraqi integrated air defense \n     system'' after Iraqi air forces fired anti-artillery \n     northwest of Musul and west of Bashiqah, the U.S. European \n     command base in Stuttgart, Germany, said.\n       Baghdad said on Thursday that 14 Iraqis were killed and 19 \n     wounded when U.S. and British planes bombed the south of the \n     country, in what was described as the deadliest raid since \n     the beginning of the year.\n       A total of 176 people have been killed in Iraq in US-\n     British bombings since December 1998.\n\n  Still not much notice. That is a French translation.\n  Here is a Russian translation on the Interfax Russian News, April 10:\n\n       Moscow Worried Over U.S., Britain Bombing Southern Iraq.\n       The foreign ministry has voiced concern over U.S. bombings \n     of southern Iraq.\n\n  Baghdad made public its data about the victims of the latest raid, 14 \npeople killed and 19 wounded.\n  How in the world can we justify being at war with Saddam Hussein, \nincreasing our dependence to 700,000 barrels a day, lifting our export \nban to give him the technology, which we did 2 weeks ago, to increase \nhis production for his refining capacity even more, and be at war with \nhim?\n  I don't understand this. I think it is outrageous. We have lost 147 \nlives in the Persian Gulf war. We are really taking his oil, putting it \ninto our airplanes, and going over and bombing. Think about that.\n  Is that the kind of policy we have on energy? Do the American people \nknow what has happened? Do they care? It is unbelievable to me, as we \naddress this issue before us. You might say it is a gas tax. It is the \nwhole issue of lack of an energy policy. We do not have an energy \npolicy for coal. The same clean coal technology supported by this \nadministration--we have seen that. We do not have a nuclear policy. The \nadministration will not address the contractual commitment it made in \n1998 to take nuclear waste, although the ratepayers paid the \nadministration $15 billion. That is going to be a legal case of $40 \nbillion to $50 billion when the lawyers are through suing each other. \nThey want to take down the hydrodams. The replacement for that, \nobviously, is going to put more trucks on the highway in Oregon and \nWashington if they remove the dams, because so much of the traffic in \ngrains and other produce are moved by barge.\n  Some say gas is the answer, just plug it in. The National Petroleum \nCouncil says we are using 21 trillion cubic feet of gas now, and in \nnext 10 years we will be up to 31 trillion. The infrastructure is not \nthere. It is going to take $1.5 trillion to put in that infrastructure. \nSo don't think gas is going to be cheap. And this administration \nremoved 65 percent of the public lands in the overthrust belt, which \nobviously means there is less area for exploration.\n  So the crunch is coming. I think this administration hopes they will \nget out of town before this becomes a big political issue in the \ncampaign. But I think it is going to be a big political issue in the \ncampaign.\n  I see many of my colleagues wishing to speak. I again encourage \neverybody to recognize the attitude of the American people as expressed \nby this Gallup Poll, which says 74 percent favor elimination of the \ntax--opposed 23. I had printed the letters of the Independent Truckers \nAssociation supporting this, and the NFPA as well, the National Food \nProcessors Association, and the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness. We are not talking about jeopardizing the highway trust fund; \nwe are talking about making it whole. We are talking about giving the \nAmerican people a choice, whether this is a priority for them as \nrepresented through their elected representatives--which we are--\nwhether they want relief. It gives us a safety net for the public out \nthere; most of all, a safety net to keep this administration's feet to \nthe fire to ensure that gasoline prices for regular do not go over $2 a \ngallon, because if they do, then the entire 18.4 cents federal gas tax \ngoes off, it is suspended for the remainder of this year.\n  I think it is a fair trade. I think it is a reasonable compromise. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the effort and not be misled by the \nargument that this is going to jeopardize the highway trust fund. It \ncannot. We have to live by the commitment, if we pass this legislation, \nto find the money someplace else--out of the surplus, out of reducing \nwasteful spending, or whatever. That is actually in the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my \ncolleague, the Senator from Texas, completes her remarks, if I can have \n10 minutes for purposes of introduction of legislation?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I shall not \nobject--our distinguished colleague from West Virginia is controlling \nthe time on the gas tax. I would like to have 8 minutes in opposition \nto the gas tax. I know our distinguished colleague from Ohio has been \nhere for some time. He should be accorded precedence over this Senator \nat least.\n  I wonder if we could have some order so Senators can be convenienced. \nThen certainly we can put in this matter. I seek, from our \ndistinguished colleague, how would he suggest we go about this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is reserved \ntime. Senator Murkowski has approximately 37 minutes remaining and the \nDemocratic side has approximately 35 minutes remaining. To utilize the \ntime under the previously existing unanimous consent agreement, we \nwould----\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may interject, it is not necessarily the Democratic \nside because there is strong bipartisan support, am I not correct, I \nask Senator Byrd?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the control of the Democratic \nside----\n  Mr. WARNER. It is under the control of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can yield to anyone he so chooses. \nIs there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object to that consent for a moment, \nMr. Voinovich has been waiting here for quite some time. I believe he \nshould be recognized next. Then, ordinarily, when we have controlled \ntime like this, we might go to this side. If that is the case, I will \nyield for 8 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with the suggestion by my good friend from \nWest Virginia. I am conducting a hearing on electric deregulation. I am \ngoing to turn the remaining time on this side over to my good friend \nfrom Texas to yield to those in support of the gas tax holiday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could we have the Senator from Maine, who \nhas been waiting, and the Senator from Texas, enter the colloquy on \ntiming? Again, they have been here for some time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, I assume the proponents and opponents \ncontrol the time. We have other speakers who are coming to speak in \nsupport of the holiday. The Senator from Texas supports the holiday. I \ndo not know the disposition of the other Republican Members.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I had \nrequested time to introduce a bill. I do not, however, want to \ninterrupt the debate on the gas tax. I suggest I go after the Senator \nfrom Florida, who I understand is also going to be introducing a bill, \nso as not to interrupt the debate on the gas tax issue.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assume that will mean the 37 minutes, approximately, \nfor each side, would be used. Then the other morning business would \ncome up. Is that the wish of the other side?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, why don't we go in accordance with the times \nthe Senators came to the floor and sat down and expected to be \nrecognized? When I first came, Mr. Voinovich had been waiting and the \nSenator from Alaska was speaking. I was the next on the floor. I will \nbe happy to yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be happy if the Senator wishes to \nproceed and I can follow. Whatever the Senator from West Virginia \nwishes.\n  Mr. BYRD. What does the Senator from Texas have to say?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Senator from West Virginia, what he is \nproposing now is for Senator Voinovich to go next, and that is under \nthe Senator's time; is that correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Following that, I would be recognized on Senator \nMurkowski's time. Following that, then\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nthe Senator would have the ability to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia, on your time again. And following that, then----\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to speak on the gas issue in sequence after \nthe Senator from West Virginia, if I may. We want to stay on the issue, \nI suggest, because we have a vote. Then we wish to accommodate other \nSenators.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, we have other speakers who want to speak on \nour side on the gas tax issue, so we can follow back and forth.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I can get an understanding, then it will be \nSenator Voinovich under Senator Byrd's time, then myself under Senator \nMurkowski's time, then back to Senator Byrd--and Senator Warner for \nhowever they are going to allocate their time under Senator Byrd's time \nallotment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. BYRD. I always like to yield to the ladies. I was brought up the \nold-fashioned way. But the lady's proposal is going to automatically \nsay she is going to be next after Mr. Voinovich. Is that the way she \nwants it done?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It was my understanding we would go back and forth, \naccording to the time allotments. Senator Voinovich is on the time of \nthe Senator from West Virginia. I thought the sequence would be back to \nSenator Murkowski's side after that.\n  If that is not correct, I will be happy to yield whatever time \nSenator Byrd wants on his side, and then I will control Senator \nMurkowski's time after Senator Voinovich, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nWarner. Is that what the Senator from West Virginia is suggesting? It \nis fine, as long as I know at what point our side will be able to \nreclaim our time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Any way is fine. The Senator from Alaska had a lot of time. \nHe spoke a long time. I sat here a long time. I was glad to listen to \nit. Mr. Voinovich was here before I came. He should have his time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator from West Virginia wants to take all \nthree from his side in answer to Senator Murkowski, I will be happy to \ndo that. Then I will take my time after Senator Voinovich, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Warner. Is that to what the Senator from West \nVirginia was referring?\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request we have before \nus came from the Senator from Florida, and he was not mentioned in any \nof this.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may modify the request, I am in the category with \nthe Senator from Maine. We have topics we wish to discuss other than \nthe gasoline tax. We appreciate that debate should be completed. We \njust want to have an order that, after the gasoline tax debate, we may \nintroduce our legislation. We want to be included in the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Will somebody restate the unanimous consent request, please, so we \nhave an understanding by everybody? Will the Senator from Texas restate \nthe unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will make an attempt. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Byrd be recognized on his time to \nallocate, as he sees fit, time to Senator Voinovich, himself, and \nSenator Warner, after which I will be recognized to take control of \nSenator Murkowski's 37 minutes, after which the Senator from Florida \nwill be recognized for his introduction of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I apologize. I did not know the \nSenator from Maine--I made a huge mistake. I amend my unanimous consent \nrequest to suggest that Senator Collins follow the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2492-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2492-S2496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Although I disagree with my \ncolleague from Alaska in regard to this matter, I do agree this debate \nhas given us an opportunity to identify the real problem of why we have \nhigh gas prices in this country, and that is, we lack an energy policy. \nOur reliance on foreign oil could increase to 65 percent or more by the \nyear 2020.\n  As a matter of fact, a couple of weeks ago in the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, we had a representative from the Energy \nDepartment appear before the committee and I asked him: Just how \nreliant should we be on foreign oil? What is the number? He was unable \nto give a number.\n  I mentioned that, as a former Governor, if I had a problem, I would \nidentify what the goal was to solve that problem and put in place \nstrategies to achieve that goal. The fact is, we are here today because \nwe have no energy policy in this country. That is the main issue.\n  The other issue is whether or not reducing the gas tax by 4.3 cents a \ngallon is going to make any real difference. I argue it may not bring \ndown the price of gas at the pump. In some States, if the gas tax is \nreduced, their State laws provide that the state gas tax is increased \nto make up for the loss of the Federal gas tax. I point out that in \nterms of the traveling public, the motoring public, getting rid of the \n4.3 cent gas tax is only going to save about $43 a year.\n  This is one of the factors which I think adds to the cynicism of the \nAmerican public in regard to some of the things we do in the Senate. We \nargue this is going to make a difference, and then the people realize \nall we are talking about over a year's period, if they drive 15,000 \nmiles a year, at 15 miles-per-gallon is about $43.\n  I have been involved in this matter as a Governor and as the former \nchairman of the National Governors' Association. The Governors were \nopposed to the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax in 1993 because it was used \nfor deficit reduction and we thought it should be used for building \nhighways.\n  In 1998, when TEA-21 was negotiated, everyone agreed to put that 4.3 \ncents a gallon into the highway trust fund so we can use it for new \nconstruction of highways and to maintain and repair highways. It also \nguaranteed to many of the donor States--that is, a State that sends \nmore money to Washington than they get back, like Ohio--that they will \nget at least 90.5 cents per dollar back every year. It gave us a \npredictable, reliable source of revenue to get the job done. We thought \nwe had resolved this issue once and for all.\n  Today we have the issue before us of reducing the gas tax by 4.3 \ncents a gallon. Someone said: Do not worry about it because we will \nmake up the lost funding from the surplus. I argue, if I have listened \ncarefully to my colleagues on the floor, there are lots of other good \nthings that they want to do with our surplus. If one looks at it from \nan equity point of view, the tradition in this country is, the people \nwho use the highways pay for them. We are saying reduce their tax and \nmake it up by hitting everybody else in the country and taking it out \nof the general fund, which can be used for other things that would \nbenefit the rest of America.\n  I cannot buy the argument: Do not worry about it, we will make it up \nfrom the surplus.\n  I also point out the National Governors' Association, the National \nLeague of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National \nAssociation of Counties, all the major State and local organizations \nare opposed to repealing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax.\n\n  I do not care what the polls say, the one organization I listen to in \nOhio which represents the motoring public is the American Automobile \nAssociation. This is the premier organization representing the people \nwho drive in this country.\n  One would think they would be for reducing the gas tax, wouldn't \nthey? The fact is, they are opposed to it because they know that repair \nand maintenance of our highways and new construction are important to \nthe motoring public, particularly to their safety. They also realize \nthat this country, in so many areas, has turned into a gigantic parking \nlot, with gridlock, bottlenecks, and hours wasted in America on\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\nthe highways because our infrastructure is in such bad shape. Gasoline \nis being wasted sitting in these traffic jams, polluting the air, let \nalone the stress and strain on the drivers and their loss of time.\n  Today, the only good thing I can say about the fact we are debating \nthis 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax reduction is the fact that it is \nbringing to the American people's attention that we do not have an \nenergy policy.\n  As I have said over and over on this floor, gas prices are going to \ncome down. They are going to come down because the administration is \ngoing to make sure they come down before the November election.\n  The real question is: Are we just going to treat it as we have in the \npast? Do my colleagues remember 1973 when we had the crisis and the \nprices went up? Are we just going to treat this like we treat a barking \ndog and say: Give it a bone, it'll stop barking and we will go back to \ndoing things the way we've always done in this country? I hope not.\n\n  What we should resolve--Republicans and Democrats, Congress and the \nadministration--is to put together a real energy policy for the United \nStates of America before the end of this year so we can bring down our \nreliance on foreign oil, which is a threat not only to our nation's \neconomy, but it is a threat to our national security.\n  So I urge my colleagues, please, today, on the cloture vote, please \nvote against cloture so that we can get on with other business. And \npart of that ``other business'' should be, let's put together a \nbipartisan energy policy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to my distinguished \nfriend, the senior Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first thank our distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio. When I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, \nhe was a Governor. He brought together those Governors. He laid the \nfoundation with the National Governors' Association; indeed, a \ncoalition of highway administrators all over the country. He deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for the work he did as we, in this body, worked on \nthe legislation. We could not have done it without the help of those \norganizations. I am so glad the Senator paid proper respect to their \nservices.\n  I thank our distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I have \nnow been privileged to serve with him here in my 22nd year in the \nSenate. No matter whether he has been the majority leader or minority \nleader, as a leader in his party, he has always been there taking the \nlead, making the tough decisions, and pointing the way.\n\n  There is an old French saying about a politician one time saying: \nTell me, which way is the crowd going so I can jump in front and lead? \nThe senior Senator knows that quote better than I. That is not our \nsenior Senator from West Virginia. He knows which way to lead and then, \nindeed, the Senate, most often, and the crowd, know which way to go.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I say to my colleague, there are two separate issues \ntoday. Let us divide them.\n  First is the energy policy of this administration. Our distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska has addressed that issue. Yes, it is flawed. In \nthe words of the Secretary of Energy, they were caught napping. As a \nconsequence, we are suffering at the gas pump. We are suffering in our \neconomy. We are suffering in many ways for these increased prices.\n  I have compassion and understanding for those people. I support what \nSenator Murkowski will bring forth as separate legislation to try to \nonce again restore America's preeminence in its ability to develop \nenergy sources and get the rigs out from under the brier patch of laws \nand regulations where they once drilled oil and gas in this country but \nare now rusting in stacks.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a State which is known for its \nenergy production. He knows full well of that situation.\n  I do not like to be in opposition to the distinguished leaders of my \nparty, the Republican Party, but I am strongly in opposition to this \nquestion of repealing this gas tax.\n  I will not go back into the history, but we addressed this in the \ncourse of TEA-21. We took the funds, the general revenue, and put them \ninto the highway trust fund. That was a commitment to the American \npublic of those dollars so desperately needed to repair and modernize \nour transportation system.\n  I think what underlines this debate is the word ``anger.'' Yes, there \nis anger at the pump. That is understandable. But there is also anger \nbehind the wheel when Americans, driving their vehicles today--whether \nit is for work or for pleasure, or for whatever purpose--see this \ncancer of the transportation system slowly eating away at their \nlifestyle, devouring the time they need at the job, devouring the time \nthey need with their families, devouring the time they need for what \nlittle pleasure life provides today in terms of the burdens and \ncommitments on the American family.\n  So we have a choice: Anger at the pump; anger with the highways. I \nbelieve it is most important that the institution of the Senate show a \ncontinuity of commitment to the modernization of our highways, our \nrails, and other transportation modes to reduce the threat to our \nlifestyle. That is what it is all about.\n  If we were to repeal this gas tax--I project that the Senate will \nnot, but if we were to repeal it, what Senator could get up and say, \nwith certainty, that that tax reduction will be passed down to the \nconsumer at the gas pump? I will carefully listen to the speeches. What \nSenator could make that irrefutable commitment to the American public?\n  The free enterprise system is fraught with uncertainty. I would be \nwilling to--I am not a betting man--wager, though, that that money \nwould not go into the pockets of the American consumers. That will \nbring about anger at the gas pump far greater than any that was \nwitnessed thus far.\n\n  There is the question of the modernization of this highway \ntransportation system and other modes of transportation. Hundreds of \nthousands of people are involved, from the Governor of a State, to \ntheir highway transportation authorities, to the legislatures of the \nvarious States. These people have made commitments, passed laws, \nadopted budgets on the reliability of the Congress to stand behind what \nthey put into that legislation.\n  I repeat that. Stability in this program is essential because these \nmodernization programs cannot be done overnight. They cannot either \npour concrete or have the designers do their work overnight. There has \nto be a careful, methodical sequence of the steps. Literally hundreds \nof thousands of people are involved all over America. They sit and \nlisten, astonished that we are about to take away one of the \nunderpinnings of that program.\n  Those legislatures, in their next session--most of them have \ncompleted their sessions for this year--would say: Wait a minute. \nBefore we commit so many State funds in reliance on what the Federal \nGovernment might do, let's wait and see. Is the Congress going to do \nsomething else to diminish the flow of funds?\n  We cannot have instability in the highway modernization program. That \nis fundamental, absolutely fundamental.\n  I conclude my remarks and hope the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia will address the clause in the bill referred to on page 3, \nwhich says:\n\n       Maintenance of trust fund deposits.--In determining the \n     amounts to be appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund under \n     section 9503 . . . an amount equal to the reduction in \n     revenues to the Treasury by reason of this subsection shall \n     be treated as taxes received . . .\n\n  I just say to my good friend from West Virginia, who has examined \nthis legislation for so many years in this body, I think this is the \nfirst of its type. The distinguished Senator, the senior Democrat on \nthe Appropriations Committee, understands the appropriations process. I \nfind that this provision, No. 1, is unique. I don't know of many \nprecedents that I have seen, if any at all. And second, the subject, \nagain, of the uncertainty of taking it with one hand from the highway \ntrust fund, by virtue of the elimination of the tax, then giving it \nback with the other hand in terms of some commitment, to me,\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nbrings about uncertainty. I question how many Senators can rely on \nthat.\n  I hope my distinguished colleague might look at that provision based \non his many years of experience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see my time is up. I see my colleague on his feet. I \nwonder if he might address that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have not prepared remarks in that connection, but I will \ntake a look at that and insert the matter in the Record, if I am able \nto make a contribution.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague because he has spent \nthese many years in the appropriations process; he has studied all the \nbudget resolutions going back these many years.\n  I question what the precedent is, and the degree of uncertainty as to \nthis body being able to deliver, and, I might say, the House of \nRepresentatives. It would take both bodies; would I not be correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator and very much respect and appreciate \nthe leadership he has given. I will work with him on this to the final \nvote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my distinguished friend. I thank him for the \nexcellent contribution he has made in this debate. I thank him for his \nsupport and cooperation with respect to the amendment we prepared a few \ndays ago, which was voted on favorably by the Senate. I thank him for \nhis leadership on the committee and in the Senate on this subject over \nthe years. We have stood together shoulder to shoulder on previous \noccasions on this very subject matter, and I am glad to have him \nstanding shoulder to shoulder today.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time was taken in the colloquy \nearlier about who should go first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if we could restore that time, half to the other \nside and half to this side on the question. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator now has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I also thank Mr. Voinovich for the fine \nstatement he made. I thank him for his courage in taking the position \nhe has today. It isn't easy for him, but I thank him for his solid \nsupport of the position I take today. I think he is right, as I think I \nam right.\n  Mr. President, just 5 days ago, during consideration of this year's \nBudget Resolution, the Senate, by a vote of 65 yeas to 35 nays, \nexpressed the Senate's opposition to either a temporary or permanent \nrepeal of Federal gasoline taxes. In addition to myself, the original \nco-sponsors of the amendment were Senators Warner, Baucus, Voinovich, \nLautenberg and Bond. Additional co-sponsors added during the debate \nwere Senators Lincoln, Domenici, Bingaman and Robb. Later today, the \nSenate will be asked to vote again on essentially the same question, \nwhen the cloture vote is taken on S. 2285. That bill would implement a \ntemporary repeal of a portion of the Federal tax on gasoline. To make \nup for the lost revenues to the Highway Trust Fund that this gas tax \nrepeal would cause, the proponents of this bill advocate the use of \nrevenues from the General Fund of the Treasury. The proponents do not \nidentify a particular source of those revenues. One has to assume that \nthe replenishment of the Highway Trust Fund will either come from the \nnon-Social Security surplus, or from cuts in spending in other areas of \nthe budget, such as education, or if it turns out that there is no non-\nSocial Security surplus, then this bill could cause us to have to \nreturn to deficit spending. That would be true, particularly if the \nRepublican tax cut package is enacted, and if the projections of the \nCongressional Budget Office turn out to be faulty. I, for one, cannot \nsupport any proposition such as this, which takes the ``trust'' out of \nthe Highway Trust Fund and could mandate unidentified cuts in other \nFederal programs. We must not backfill the potholes this bill will \nleave in funding for adequate maintenance of roads and bridges with \nmoney from education, veterans programs or other vital needs.\n  The proponents of S. 2285 have attempted to downplay the \naforementioned vote that was taken on the Budget Resolution against any \nrepeal of Federal gasoline taxes. That amendment to the Budget \nResolution, which as I have said, was adopted by a vote of 65 yeas to \n35 nays, contained the following language, ``Any effort to reduce the \nfederal gasoline tax or de-link the relationship between highway user \nfees and highway spending, poses a great danger to the integrity of the \nHighway Trust Fund, and the ability of the states to invest adequately \nin our transportation infrastructure.''\n  Yet, Mr. President, S. 2285 would in fact de-link the relationship \nbetween highway user fees and highway spending. In that respect, S. \n2285 poses a great danger to the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund, \nand thereby, threatens to undermine the ability of the States to invest \nadequately in our nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  In I Corinthians 14:8, we are told, ``If the trumpet gives an \nuncertain sound, who will prepare to the battle?'' When it comes to our \nFederal investment in our Nation's highways, S. 2285 would give a most \nuncertain sound. This bill would cut revenues to the Highway Trust Fund \nby repealing a portion of Federal gasoline taxes. Yet, just two years \nago, in landmark legislation, the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century, TEA-21, our State and local governments were told that we \nhad put the ``trust'' back into the Highway Trust Fund, and that we had \nestablished an automatic mechanism to distribute all gasoline taxes to \nthe states for their highway needs. In so doing, we committed ourselves \nto retaining the ``trust'' in the Highway Trust Fund forevermore. Now \nwe come along and have a different sound coming from those who trumpet \nS. 2285. They want to cut Federal gasoline taxes and place in jeopardy \nthe funding stream that we promised to the States in TEA-21. In return \nfor these lost revenues, they would have us adopt a new promise, a \npromise that we will make up those lost gas tax revenues from the \nGeneral Fund surpluses or from cutting funding for other vital national \ninvestments. The very reason that funding ``guarantees'' were included \nin TEA-21 was to eliminate the uncertainty surrounding our national \nhighway program. We said that all highway user fees--the Federal \ngasoline taxes which the American people pay every time they go to the \ngas pump--would automatically go to the States so that our Governors, \nhighway commissioners, and State and local officials would have a \npredictable funding stream to meet their critical highway funding \nneeds.\n\n  The goal of TEA-21 was to reverse decades of disinvestment in our \nnational highway infrastructure. The use of our national highway system \ncontinues to grow dramatically. In the 15 years, from 1983 to 1998, \naccording to the Federal Highway Administration, the number of vehicle \nmiles traveled on our Nation's highways, has grown from 1.65 trillion \nmiles per year to over 2.62 trillion miles per year. However, our \nNation's investment in highways has not come close to keeping pace with \nthis increased traffic. The percent of vehicle miles traveled has been \ndropping almost every year since we initiated the interstate highway \nsystem during the Eisenhower Administration. They dropped steadily \nuntil 1997--the most recent year for which data is available.\n  What has this disinvestment done to the condition of our nation's \nroads? It has led to a national network of roadways with inadequate \npavement conditions. Less then half the miles of roadway in rural \nAmerica are considered to be in good or very good condition. Of the \nroad miles in rural America, 56.5 percent are in fair to poor \ncondition. Conditions are even worse in urban America, where 64.6 \npercent of road miles are considered to be in some level of disrepair, \nand only 35.4 percent of urban roadways are considered to be in good or \nvery good condition. The situation is no better when we turn our \nattention to the nation's highway bridges. According to the most recent \ndata from the Federal Highway Administration, 28.8 percent of our \nnation's bridges are either functionally obsolete\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nor structurally deficient. In urban America, 32.5 percent of the \nbridges are either functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. We \nare talking about a basic issue of safety here. It is an issue that \ncannot be ignored in the name of short-term, feel-good tax cut \nproposals.\n  Total highway spending by all levels of Government currently equals \n$41.8 billion annually. However, if we wanted to spend a sufficient sum \nto simply maintain the current inadequate condition of our national \nhighways and bridges, we would need to spend $9 billion more per year, \nor $50.8 billion. In order to maintain the current average trip time \nbetween destinations, we would have to spend $26.1 billion more per \nyear, or a total of $67.9 billion annually on our Nation's highways. \nPut another way, Mr. President, as a Nation, we would have to increase \nhighway spending by more than 62 percent each year, simply to prevent \ntraffic congestion from getting any worse. Yet, S. 2285 would place \neven the present levels of highway spending in jeopardy.\n  Highway congestion is worsening each and every year in cities, as \nwell as rural communities across America. In the last 15 years, use by \nmotorists of our highways on a per lane basis increased by more than 46 \npercent. This increased use has led to record levels of congestion. \nThat congestion and the time that motorists spend in traffic jams is a \ncontinual and ever-growing drag on our national economy. Whether it's \ncommuters stuck in traffic jams going to or from their jobs, or trucks \nthat are delayed in delivering their products to their destinations, \nthe costs to the nation are tremendous, and growing. In 1982, it was \nestimated that congestion cost our economy $21.6 billion. Between 1982 \nand 1997, that figure increased over 234 percent to $72.2 billion per \nyear. That is $72 billion in wasted fuel, wasted time, and lost \nprosperity, not to mention the untold pollution that is caused by daily \ntraffic congestion, particularly in our Nation's largest cities.\n  It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that I urge my colleagues to \nagain reject this effort to temporarily repeal Federal gasoline taxes. \nGasoline prices are too high, even though we have recently seen a \ndecline in prices at the pump. However, there is no assurance \nwhatsoever, that reduced Federal gasoline taxes, if enacted, would \nresult in reduced gasoline prices at the gas pump. I find that \nproposition highly doubtful. In any case, I believe that the enactment \nof S. 2285 would cause grave danger both to the integrity to the \nHighway Trust Fund and to our ability to meet these huge and ever-\ngrowing highway needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep the commitments we made in TEA-21 and \nvote against cloture on S. 2285.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has eight minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield that to Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Lott bill to repeal \nthe gasoline tax that funds our nation's highway program.\n  I do so for two reasons. First, the bill would undermine the landmark \n1998 highway bill, which is so important to economic development in \nMontana and throughout the country. Second, the bill will not reduce \nthe price of gas at the pump.\n  It is, in short, a bad idea. I urge that it be rejected by a strong, \nbipartisan, vote.\n  By way of background, the gas tax was established for one simple \nreason: to finance the construction of the national highway system.\n  In 1993, there was a departure. The tax was increased, by 4.3 cents a \ngallon. And, for the first time, the tax was used not for the highway \nprogram, but instead for deficit reduction.\n  I supported the increase, reluctantly, as part of an overall \ncompromise that was a key step toward balancing the budget.\n  Even so, many of us were determined to restore the principle that the \ngas tax should only be used to fund our highway and related \ntransportation programs. We worked, as we said, to ``put the trust back \nin the trust fund.''\n  It was a long, difficult fight. We faced tough opposition, from the \nadministration, the budget committees, and elsewhere. But, in the end, \nwe prevailed. During the Senate's consideration of the 1998 highway \nbill, we provided that the entire gas tax, including the 4.3 cents, \nwould go into the trust fund and be used exclusively for highway \nconstruction and other transportation needs. When an amendment was \noffered to repeal the 4.3 cent tax, it was defeated.\n  Don't get me wrong. Nobody likes taxes. But the tax goes directly to \nimprove the roads. As these things go, the gas tax has worked well.\n  The Lott amendment would turn back the clock. It would repeal the 4.3 \ncent tax.\n  Let me explain what this would mean for our nation's highway program.\n  It puts $20 billion worth of the highway trust fund in jeopardy.\n  I'll get right to the point. Most of my colleagues were here for the \nhighway bill debate. You know how difficult it was. You know how hard \nwe fought to make sure that each of our states would get enough funding \nto support our transportation needs.\n  For my state of Montana, it would mean losing $184 million.\n  That, in turn, will mean delays and cancellations. Roads won't be \nrepaired. Interchanges won't be built. Safety improvements will be left \non the drawing board.\n  In Montana, The DOT estimates that upwards of 60 projects would be \ndelayed or canceled. Projects that would increase mobility and save \nlives.\n  That's not all. If this bill passes, Mr. President, we will be \nbreaking faith. We will be breaking faith with governors. With state \ntransportation agencies. With contractors. And with thousands of hard-\nworking folks who show up every day, in good weather and bad, to build \nour roads and improve our communities. Who depend on their jobs to \nsupport themselves and their families.\n  Senator Lott and others argue that the bill won't affect the highway \nprogram, because any reductions in highway funding would, in effect, be \ncovered by transfers from other programs.\n  In other words, the bill would shift the burden somewhere else. But \nwe all know that there aren't any easy alternatives. There are no easy \ncuts. So we should not assume that these ``alternative'' cuts will \noccur. We have to assume that the cuts will come right out of the \nhighway program. And that, again, would be devastating.\n\n  To what end? the proponents of the Lott bill say that, if we cut the \ntax, it will reduce the price of gas at the pump.\n  Certainly, there is reason to be concerned about the price of gas at \nthe pump. I represent Montana. The Big Sky State. We drive long \ndistances. We're sensitive to the price of gas at the pump, which has \nrisen from $1.18 gallon a year ago to $1.59 a gallon now. We need to \nget the price down, as soon as we can.\n  But there is no reason to believe that a reduction in the federal gas \ntax will result in lower prices at the pump. After all, this is a \nmarket ruled by a cartel. Until we break the stranglehold of that \ncartel, we'll be limited. We can cut the gas tax. But we can't \nguarantee that the price at the pump will be reduced by the same \namount. Instead, the difference may well offset by price increases, by \neither the OPEC producers or by the refiners, marketers, and other \nmiddlemen.\n  Pulling this all together, the Lott amendment will undermine our \nhighway programs without enhancing our energy independence.\n  There's one final point.\n  For the past few years, Congress has been criticized for putting \npartisan politics ahead of the public interest. In short, of not \ngetting much done.\n  There have been some notable exceptions. Balancing the budget. \nReforming the welfare system.\n  And, yes, reaching a bipartisan compromise on the 1998 highway bill, \nTEA-21. The bill did not just reauthorize the highway program. It \nrenewed and revitalized the highway program. We passed it \noverwhelmingly, by a vote of 88-5. It was a great accomplishment.\n  We can confirm that accomplishment today, by rejecting the Lott bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate on \nthe repeal of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. I think perhaps there \nis a misunderstanding of what this resolution does. I will reiterate \nit.\n  The bill which Senator Lott has introduced, along with Senator \nMurkowski and myself, gives a Federal fuels tax holiday that would \nsuspend through the end of this year the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax \nthat was put on about 3 or 4 years ago. If the average gasoline price \nin our country reaches $2 a gallon, it would suspend for the rest of \nthis year the entire 18.4-cent-per-gallon Federal excise tax on \ngasoline. The bill specifically holds harmless all of the trust funds. \nSocial Security, and the highway trust funds would not be affected. So \nwe would make up any lost revenue from other sources, not the highway \ntrust fund.\n\n  I do not think the highway contractors should be alarmed. The highway \ncontracts are going to go out just as they have been. We are now 2 \nyears ahead in contracting. There will be no suspension of the \ncontracting under the highway trust fund. I think our highways are a \nfirst priority, and I do not think the highway contractors should be \nconcerned in any way that that is going to lessen to any degree.\n  It is very clear what this does. It says to the traveling public, it \nsays to the family trying to take a vacation, it says to the truckers \nwho are depending on a gasoline price that is stable, so they know what \nthat price is going to be, approximately, when they make their \ncontracts to haul goods back and forth in our country, we are going to \nhave a suspension of up to 18 cents a gallon until prices come down to \na level that is reasonable and that could have been anticipated when a \ncontract was made. Airline passengers are paying $75 one way on most \ntrips across this country because of this gasoline price increase.\n  We need to respond to something so basic to so many people, and that \nis the transportation costs--for people to take a family vacation, to \ndrive to and from work, or for their very livelihoods, if they are \ntruckers. We are going to respond to this crisis.\n  I have heard people from foreign countries say: I do not know what \nyou Americans are complaining about; we pay $4 a gallon in Europe--in \nBrussels, in London. That is not the price on which our economy is \nbased. We travel greater distances. We have an economy that is based on \ngasoline prices in the $1- to $1.40-a-gallon category. That is an \nimportant part of the cost of doing business in our country.\n  Furthermore, we do have the ability to control our own destiny. We do \nhave the ability to drill and explore in our country. Many private \nbusinesses, small businesses, want very much to do that. They want to \nbe able to drill a well as small as one producing only 15 barrels a \nday.\n  To put that in perspective, a 15-barrel-a-day well is a very small \nwell. The average well in Alaska produces 650 barrels a day. In the \nGulf of Mexico, it could be 10,000 barrels a day. We are talking 15 \nbarrels a day. Our small businesses can continue to do business and \nmake a modest profit on a 15-barrel-a-day well, but they have to know \nthe price is going to be somewhat stable. When oil prices went down to \n$9, $10 a barrel, 2 years ago, these little guys could not make it. \nThese little producers are small businesses, and they could not break \neven on $9 or $10 a barrel.\n  What I would like to propose is that we pass the bill before us today \nto give instant relief to the consumers and business people in our \ncountry, but that we look at the longer term issue as well, and that \nis, what can we do to encourage our small businesses to be able to stay \nin business, drilling wells that produce 15 barrels a day or less? If \nthey will stay in business, they will produce the same amount we import \nfrom OPEC today. That is the important issue. We will not be at the \nwhim of OPEC, to have huge price spikes, if we will encourage our own \npeople to explore and drill even the small wells.\n  There is another advantage of that, and that is it keeps the jobs in \nAmerica. Today we are going to foreign countries and producing because \nit is cheaper to do it over there in OPEC countries or in Mexico or \nVenezuela. It is cheap to do it there. That does not create American \njobs; it creates jobs in foreign countries.\n  If we pass the bill before us today and say we are going to give \nrelief immediately to the people who are driving to work, the people \nwho depend on a stable price as they drive their trucks carrying goods \nback and forth across the country, I am saying let's look at the long \nterm, too. Let's look at the stable price that is necessary for them to \nenter into contracts that will keep them in business. Let's do it by \nencouraging our small producers to take the risk to go out and drill \neither a dry hole or one that would produce up to 15 barrels a day, by \ngiving them a tax credit if the price goes below $17 a barrel, so they \ncan stay in business, much as we do for farmers when the prices they \ncan get on the open market do not allow them to break even.\n  We want the farmers to stay in business so they will be able to \ncontinue to provide food for our country and for export. Why not do \nthat for a small producer? If that well produces 16 or more barrels a \nday, no tax credits, because the margin, then, is much higher and they \nwill be able to break even in the low-price times.\n  I am saying let's give immediate relief and let's look at the long \nterm, let's do something that will be a win-win for our country, \nsomething that will provide more price stability so we will not have \nthe price spikes we are seeing now. We do that by stopping our 56-\npercent dependence on foreign imports for the fuel we require every day \nin this country. Let's do it by creating more American jobs for small \nbusinesses, and let's keep those jobs in America so we will be more \nself-sufficient and more in control of our own destiny.\n  I hope my colleagues will pass the bill that is before us today, give \nthe instant relief, and say we are going to protect the highway fund \nabsolutely, so the contracts can continue to be let and our highways \nwill continue to be built and improved and maintained.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do I understand, the Senator yields herself 5 minutes? Is \nthere not 10 minutes under joint control on the subject of gas taxes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. There are 10 minutes equally divided. She \nhas yielded herself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Off the control of which Senator's time? My understanding \nis Senator Byrd controls the time for Senators in opposition, of which \nI am aligned. Senator Murkowski controls the proponents' time.\n  Am I not correct on that, Mr. President?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. As an opponent on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is taking her 5 \nminutes in opposition.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would then remove all opposition time; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Senator, could I have the benefit of a minute \nof that time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I spoke briefly last week about this proposal to \nreduce the gas tax. I spoke on the need for reforms in our Nation's \nenergy policy.\n  However, because this bill did not go through committee, and because \nit has had little technical scrutiny, there are just two points that I \nbelieve should be considered before we move ahead with this idea.\n  First, I appreciate the concern that has recently been shown for the \nhighway trust fund. There is a nice clause in this bill that would take \nmoney out of general revenues to pay for the reduction into the highway \ntrust fund.\n  Last week I called this hocus pocus. It is creative, to say the \nleast. But let's get honest here. This tax cut has to come from \nsomewhere, and this method of accounting is not without consequence.\n  Regardless of the good intentions being professed by my colleagues, \nthe transfer of this burden to general revenues would result in a tax \nincrease to the people of my State and perhaps other States.\n  In Arkansas, any reduction, either whole or in part, of the existing \nexcise tax on motor fuels will result in a penny-for-penny increase in \ntax at the State level. This is the law in my State, and I know that \nthere are similar provisions in Tennessee, Oklahoma, Nevada, and \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of section 27-70-\n104 of the Arkansas Code be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Sec. 27-70-104. Federal excise tax on motor fuels\n\n       (a) Should the Congress of the United States extend an \n     option to the State of Arkansas to collect all or part of the \n     existing tax on motor fuels imposed by the Internal Revenue \n     Code, Chapter 31, Retailers Excise Tax, Sec. Sec. 4041 and \n     4081, it is declared that the option is executed.\n       (b) Further, if the federal excise tax is reduced in any \n     amount, the amount of the reduction will continue to be \n     collected as state highway user revenues.\n       (c) Any increase in the federal excise tax, accompanied by \n     state option, shall be disbursed as set forth in subsection \n     (d) of this section.\n       (d) Any revenues derived under subsection (a) of this \n     section will be classified as special revenues and shall be \n     deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the State \n     Apportionment Fund for distribution under the Arkansas \n     Highway Revenue Distribution Law, there to be used for the \n     construction of state highways, county roads, and municipal \n     streets.\n\n       History: Acts 1975, No. 610, Sec. Sec. 1, 2; 1981, No. 719, \n     Sec. 1; A.S.A. 1947, Sec. Sec. 76-337, 76-338.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I agree that this bill might give a minor tax reduction \nfor the oil producers of 45 States, but the tax burden would remain \nlevel in as many as five States. Without a reduction in spending, this \namounts to a tax increase in my home State and two of my neighboring \nStates, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. In short, if this bill were to pass, \ntaxes, in effect, would go up in Arkansas.\n  My second point is that this bill would not get relief to the people \nwho need it. I said last week that this tax is collected on the \nwholesale level and all that this bill offers is a suggestion that the \nwholesalers pass this on to the consumers. I am not sure that this \npoint is getting out to my colleagues, so I have a quote here from the \nSupreme Court of the United States concerning this tax.\n  According to the U.S. Supreme Court in Gurley vs. Rhoden:\n\n     the Federal excise tax on gasoline is imposed solely upon \n     statutory producers, and not on consuming buyers.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n     the Federal excise tax on gasoline is imposed solely upon \n     statutory producers, and not on consuming buyers.\n\n  Therefore, I assert that even the Supreme Court agrees that this tax \nreduction will not go to consumers. This tax cut will go exclusively to \noil producers who will have no legal requirement to pass the cut on. \nThat won't help truckers in my State. It won't help farmers in my \nState. It won't help small business people in my State. It won't help \naverage consumers.\n  We cannot forget that despite the fact that the administration has \nsuccessfully compelled OPEC to pump more oil, and that oil prices are \ncoming down, the high cost of the oil price spike will still be on the \nbottom line at the end of the year.\n  We have to do something real and substantial for our truckers, our \nfarmers, and our fuel dependent small businessmen and women.\n  A 4.3-cent gas tax cut will do essentially nothing for anyone.\n  I again suggest that a suspension of the heavy vehicle use tax would \nbe a way to get real relief to real truck drivers. This would not drain \nthe highway trust fund to the degree that this gas tax cut would and it \nwould directly help the people who have been hurt the most by the spike \nin fuel prices.\n  I have also advocated a short-term no-interest loan program for \ndiesel dependent small business, and lastly I have called for a \nformalized end-of-the-year tax credit, that would take into account the \ntotality of this oil spike in an environment of dropping prices.\n  We all want to help those in need and we should consider giving tax \ncredits, but we should also protect the Treasury from windfalls that \ncould arise in this economic environment.\n  This bill is a bad idea, it would in effect raise the tax burden on \nmy constituents, and it would not help the people who are really \nhurting from the high prices at the gas pump.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially those from Oklahoma and Nevada, \nCalifornia and Tennessee, to look at how this bill will affect the tax \nburden in your States. Ask how this bill will affect the bonds that \nyour State has issued. And most importantly, consider how little this \nbill will do to help the consumers of our Nation. We can do better, and \nI hope we can continue the debate on this bill so we will have that \nopportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  In this legislation, there is full recovery to the highway trust \nfund, if indeed\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\nthis suspension takes place. There is a balance in it, too. That \nbalance puts the onus on the administration to encourage that the price \nremain low because if it doesn't and the price goes to $2 a gallon, \nclearly what will happen is we will eliminate this tax, which is 18.4 \ncents.\n  The question has been asked, How do we ensure that it is passed on to \nthe consumer? That is a legitimate question. We provide in the \nlegislation a requirement that the GAO audit and make an issue of \nanyone who breaks the trust that this differential has to be passed on \nto the consumer. We have the support of the National Food Processors \nAssociation, a letter to that effect, and support from the National \nFoundation of Independent Businesses and the Independent Truckers \nAssociation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     National Food\n\n\n                                       Processors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, United States Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the National Food \n     Processors Association (NFPA), the nation's largest food \n     trade association, I am writing to urge that Congress take \n     action to address rapidly rising fuel prices. From the food \n     industry's perspective, the effects of higher energy prices \n     are about to move from the gas pump to the grocery store, \n     threatening to put a serious crimp in the incomes of \n     America's working families.\n       You no doubt have heard from the transportation sector \n     about the serious effect of the 50-plus percent fuel price \n     increase since the first of the year. America's agribusiness \n     industry relies heavily on trucks and the rails to transport \n     food from the farm to processor and on to kitchen tables all \n     across the United States. Additionally, the nation's food \n     processors--an industry employing more than 1.5 million \n     workers in some 20,000 facilities across the country--consume \n     no small measure of energy to make available the tasty and \n     nutritious foods that consumers enjoy. Given the intense \n     competition and very small profit margins, under which most \n     food manufacturers operate, they are in no position to absorb \n     these dramatic increases in energy prices.\n       I believe the absence of an effective national energy \n     policy is largely responsible for this budding crisis. \n     However, there are tools available now to help address this \n     problem, at least for the short term. First, portions of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve could be released, helping reduce \n     prices by increasing, temporarily, the supply of fuel. \n     Second, I encourage Congress to enact at least a temporary \n     suspension of the most recent 4.3-cent gasoline tax increase, \n     which was adopted in 1993 for the purpose of deficit \n     reduction. NFPA also has urged President Clinton to support \n     such actions.\n       Leadership by Congress is needed to address this serious \n     issue. I hope that the U.S. Senate will work with the \n     President to take action promptly to ease the strain of \n     rapidly increasing fuel costs.\n           Sincerely,\n     John R. Cady.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I want to \n     express our support for Senate Bill 2285 which would \n     temporarily repeal the 4.3 cent excise tax on fuel, provide \n     additional tax relief should the cost of fuel continue to \n     rise, and protect funding levels in the Highway Trust Fund. \n     NFIB urges members to support its adoption.\n       Gas prices have been soaring. According to the U.S. \n     Department of Energy, gas prices, which have increased by as \n     much as 50 percent in the past year, are likely to continue \n     to rise into the summer, if not beyond.\n       These high fuel prices are hitting many Americans, \n     especially small businesses, extremely hard. For a small \n     company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel in a \n     month, the increase in prices in the past year will cost that \n     company an additional $40,000 per month. If fuel prices \n     remain high, these costs could eventually be passed on to \n     consumers in the form of higher prices for many goods and \n     services. A 4.3 cent reduction in the cost of fuel would save \n     the company more than $2,000 per month.\n       Your bill goes a long way towards providing America's small \n     business owners valuable relief from rising fuel costs. We \n     applaud your proactive efforts to reduce this tax burden on \n     small business while at the same time providing a hold \n     harmless provision for the Highway Trust Fund. This will \n     guarantee that full funding will continue to flow to states \n     and local communities for planned infrastructure projects.\n       Mr. Leader, thank you for your continued support of small \n     businesses. We look forward to working with you to enact S. \n     2285 into law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                               Sr. Vice President,\n     Federal Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Independent Truckers Association,\n\n                                 Half Moon Bay, CA, April 4, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Independent Truckers Association--\n     the oldest association of the nation's long-haul independent \n     truckers and small fleet owners--endorses wholeheartedly the \n     swift passage of S. 2285, the Federal Fuel Tax Holiday Act of \n     2000.\n       This measure would temporarily repeal the 4.3 cents excise \n     tax on fuels and protect funding levels in the Highway Trust \n     Fund. We see this as an important first step to help ensure \n     that prices for consumer goods shipped to market will remain \n     stable.\n       It's important to recognize that truckers--not just the \n     independents and small fleets, but the whole industry--work \n     on a very small profit margin. So, the recent increase of oil \n     prices by OPEC, along with the failed energy policy of the \n     Clinton-Gore Administration, strikes deep into the heart and \n     wallet of America's truckers. Enacting S. 2285 today will \n     help those injured by excessive oil and fuel prices, and help \n     keep the economy rolling along.\n       Senator Lott, thank you for your support of American's \n     independent truckers. We look forward to working with you to \n     enact S. 2285 into law.\n           Very Sincerely,\n                                                   Mike Parkhurst,\n                                                National Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Some say this isn't much of a cut. Tell that to the \nworking man or woman who gets up at 4:30 and drives 75 miles one way to \nwork in this city in his pickup because the Government won't let him \nwork at home in the coal mines, or building roads, forests, because \nthey don't support resource development. It might not mean much to the \nfolks who can afford it, but it means a lot to the folks at home.\n  As a consequence, ask the public what they think. It is in a Gallup \nPoll: 74 percent favor a temporary reduction of the 4.3-cent gas tax.\n  This is a balanced piece of legislation. It is balanced because it \nwould take off the Gore tax. This tax was put on as a consequence of \nVice President Al Gore breaking the tie in this body back in 1993. That \ndidn't go into the highway trust fund. That went into the Clinton \ngeneral fund, and the Clinton administration spent that money as they \nsaw fit. It was the Republican majority in 1998 that turned it around \nand put it into the highway trust fund. The Clinton administration has \nenjoyed $21 billion, a windfall they expended out of the general fund \nfor their programs.\n  As Senators look behind the scenes on this one, be careful because \nreality dictates that this is good for the consumer. The consumers of \nthis Nation want it. Seventy-four percent favor the temporary reduction \nof the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax.\n  If there is anyone who has been misled by this administration and \ntheir opinion of what is going to happen, they should have read the New \nYork Times today. The president of OPEC said today that if the price of \nthe organization's benchmark basket of crude oil remained below $22 a \nbarrel, the 1.5-million-barrel-a-day increase the organization agreed \nto last month would be cut back by one-third.\n  OPEC is saying: If the price goes down below $22 a barrel, we will \ncut our production. We are nowhere near home on this by any means. We \nhave been sold a bill of goods. Give the taxpayer a break.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the 20-plus years I have been \nprivileged to serve in the Senate, this is a day I will long remember. \nIt is the first time I ever voted against a tax decrease in over two \ndecades.\n  I see no certainty to this program. The Senator says 74 percent favor \na temporary reduction. Why isn't it 100 percent? I know very few people \nwho want to increase taxes. And with all due respect to my friend, the \nGAO monitoring 100,000 gas stations across America to see whether or \nnot it came down 4.3 cents? That I just cannot accept.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If that is a question, I would be happy to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. On your time, you are welcome to do it.\n  Mr. President, in all seriousness, the Senate really was a leader in \npassing\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nthe landmark legislation to modernize America's transportation system. \nThis gas tax was included in that highway fund by 80-plus Senators. It \nis a foundation block for this program. Let us not bring uncertainty to \nthe modernization of America's transportation system by beginning to \npull a block here and a block there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to \nproceed to invoke cloture on S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act \nof 2000, a bill introduced by Senator Lott, which I have been pleased \nto cosponsor.\n  This legislation will repeal, until the end of this year, the 4.3 \ncent-per-gallon increase to the federal excise tax on gasoline, diesel, \nkerosene, and aviation fuel added by the Clinton Administration in \n1993.\n  At the same time, both the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and \nAirways Trust Fund are held completely harmless. It is a bogus argument \nthat the Trust Funds will be impacted by giving consumers a tax break \nat the gas pump. The progress of important highway and airport projects \nwill not be affected because the impact would be zero. This legislation \nallows for reimbursement of the Trust Funds that are financed by the \ngasoline and aviation fuel taxes. For both of these funds, any lost \nrevenues to be replaced from the budget surplus.\n  Also, our legislation is set up so that should the national average \nfor regular unleaded gasoline prices breach the $2 mark, it would also \nrepeal, until the end of the year, the 18.3 cent-per-gallon federal \ngasoline tax; the 24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on highway diesel \nfuel and kerosene; the 4.3 cents per-gallon railroad diesel fuel; the \n24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on inland waterway fuel; the 19.3 cent-\nper-gallon for noncommercial aviation gasoline; the 21.8 cent-per-\ngallon for noncommercial jet fuel; and 4.3 cents-per-gallon for \ncommercial aviation fuel.\n  This will provide the nation with a vital ``circuit breaker'' in the \nmidst of the very real possibility of high fuel costs as America takes \nto the road this summer--and the legislation ensures that any savings \nwill truly be passed on to consumers and not pocketed before customers \ncan benefit from any savings at the pump.\n  Some of my colleagues say that repealing the 4.3 cent per gallon gas \ntax will not amount to enough savings for the consumers to even care \nabout. Well, I guess people in Maine think differently, especially \nafter a winter of paying the highest prices in decades for both home \nheating oil and for fuel at the pump.\n  This past week, the Maine legislature, both the Senate by a vote of \n26-9, and the House, by a vote of 94-54, endorsed a bill that allows \nfor rebates to truckers for the state diesel fuel taxes they paid \nbetween February 1 and March 15 when diesel fuel prices skyrocketed to \nover $2.00 per gallon. While the funding decision now rests with the \nappropriators, the Maine legislature has spoken clearly that they know \nit makes a difference, especially where the trucking industry is \nconcerned.\n  I am aware of a trucking company in Maine that has lost at least \n$200,000 in the last three months because of the failed energy policy \nof this Administration that caused diesel prices to spike. How can an \nowner buy equipment, hire people, keep his trucks rolling, and function \nwithin a set budget for the year with losses such as these? Tell him \nthat temporary repeal of the federal 4.3 cent tax on diesel fuel won't \nmake a difference. Well, let's run the numbers.\n  This company has a fleet of about 50 trucks that take 200 gallons of \ndiesel every time you fill them up, and since these large rigs get no \nmore than five miles to the gallon, they get filled up quite regularly. \nSo, if we temporarily repeal even just the 4.3 cent federal gas tax, \nevery time the fleet of trucks gets filled up, the company will be able \nto save at least $430, adding up to thousands of dollars a month. No \nwonder hundreds of truckers drove their rigs to Washington, D.C. to \nprotest on two different occasions in the past month. Tell them that a \ntemporary repeal of 4.3 cents per gallon diesel fuel tax won't make a \ndifference.\n  Look to your own states--California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, \nNew York, Wisconsin--all around the country state legislatures are \nconsidering their own responses to the rise in all fuel prices.\n  In California, there is a proposal for a four-month suspension of the \n15 cent per gallon state tax. In Connecticut, the Legislature's Finance \nCommittee unanimously approved a seven cent per gallon state gasoline \ntax over a three-year period. In New York, both parties have called for \nsome sort of state gas tax relief. In Illinois, the State Senate has \napproved an elimination of the five percent sales tax on gasoline and \ndiesel fuel. Lawmakers in Wisconsin have proposed both repealing or \ntemporarily suspending the state gas tax.\n  In Florida, the Republican House Speaker has proposed a 10 cents per \ngallon tax cut, saying, ``If the federal government is not going to \nhelp the people of Florida, then we need to''.\n  What this legislation before you today does is take a concrete step \ntoward more reasonable fuel prices for everyone, helping to serve as a \nbuffer for consumers and businesses who are already reeling from the \nhigh cost of gasoline and other fuels. Of course, I hope the provisions \nfor temporary repeal of the full tax will not be necessary. But if they \nare, they will provide immediate relief to taxpayers and ensure that, \nif prices are skyrocketing, any savings in fuel costs will be passed on \nto the purchasers of the gasoline products.\n  The retail price we pay for refined petroleum products for gasoline, \ndiesel fuel, and home heating oil, for instance, substantially depends \nupon the cost of crude oil to refiners. We have seen a barrel of crude \noil climb to over $34.00 recently from a price of $10.50 in February of \n1999. That is a 145 percent increase.\n  While OPEC agreed last month to only very modest increases in crude \noil production, White House officials say that the cost of gasoline at \nthe pump will now decline in the coming months, even though their own \nEconomic Advisor Gene Sperling was quoted in the Washington Post on \nMarch 29, as warning that ``there is still significant and inherent \nuncertainty in the oil market, particularly with such low inventories, \nand we will continue to monitor the situation very closely''.\n\n  While the Administration has ``monitored'' the situation, crude oil \nprices have gone up and up, and our inventories have gone down and \ndown. As a matter of fact, the Administration admits that it was \n``caught napping'' after OPEC decided to decrease production in March \nof 1999--and while they napped through a long winter's sleep, prices \nfor crude climbed as temperatures and inventories plummeted.\n  The effect on gasoline, diesel and home heating oil was predictable, \nand in fact was predicted. Last October--a half a year ago--the \nDepartment of Energy, in its 1999-2000 Winter Fuels Outlook, projected \na 44 percent increase in home heating oil bills. In a severe winter, \nthe agency estimated, an additional 28 percent increase in costs could \nbe felt for residential customers.\n  In other words, the Department of Energy itself predicted an increase \nof over 70 percent, but did nothing. In actuality, home heating oil \ncosts jumped from a fairly consistent national of 86 cents per gallon \nin the winter of 1998-99 to as high as $2.08 per gallon in Maine early \nlast month--an increase of well over 100 percent. In that same time \nframe, conventional gasoline prices rose 70 percent or higher.\n  So now the Administration tells us that gasoline prices will most \nlikely go down by this summer because of the small production increases \nagreed to by OPEC. Even with an increase in OPEC quotas, there will \nstill be a shortfall in meeting worldwide demand for crude oil. \nApproximately 76.3 million barrels per day are needed to meet demand, \nbut the anticipated new OPEC production is estimated to be only 75.3 \nmillion barrels per day. So you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little \nhesitant accepting estimates from an Administration that seems to make \npredictions while their gauge is on empty.\n  The Administration's projections of an average of $1.46 per gallon \nfor gasoline this summer--which is still 25 percent higher than last \nsummer I might add--does not presume production disruptions at the \nrefinery. I would like to point out that one of the reasons prices went \nup and supply ran dangerously low a few months ago was the unexpected \nshutdown of four different refineries that serve the Northeast.\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n  Just last week, DOE's Energy Information Administration stated that, \n``. . . motor gasoline markets are projected to exhibit an \nextraordinarily tight supply/demand balance.'' Against this backdrop, \nwe cannot depend upon the Administration's predictions turning into \nfact, when they have so far been so incorrect.\n  Now is the time for Congress to act, even if the Administration \nrefuses to. I want to at least make sure that American businesspeople \nand consumers have in their pockets what they would have otherwise paid \nin fuel taxes if the Administration is underestimating prices once \nagain and gasoline hits $2.00 a gallon.\n  Beyond the pump, consumers are getting hit with extra costs directly \nattributable to high fuel costs. If you've paid to send an overnight \npackage lately, you probably noted that you were charged a surcharge--a \nfuel fee--because their cost of diesel fuel has increased by about 60 \npercent over the past year. And with a 150 percent increase in jet \nfuel, that airline ticket you buy today will probably include something \nyou've never seen before--a fuel charge of $20.00. How long will it be \nbefore costs of other products will also be passed on the consumer?\n  Consider the impacts to the nations' farmers. In some locations, the \nplanting season has begun. The New York Times reported two weeks ago \nthat a farmer paying 40 cents a gallon more this year to fuel his \ndiesel tractors and combines, will be adding as much as $240 a day to \nhis harvesting costs. In my home State of Maine, we are at the peak \nseason for moving last year's potato crop out of storage and to the \nlarge Eastern markets. But the industry still can't get truckers to \ncome into the State to move the potatoes because they are discouraged \nby the particularly higher price of diesel in Maine.\n  The only help the potato industry has had recently in getting their \nproduct to market was certainly not due to the energy policy of this \nAdministration, but to local truckers who turned to hauling potatoes \nbecause wet weather kept them away from taking timber out of the Maine \nwoods.\n  Soon, we will enter the summer months, when tourism is particularly \nimportant to the economy of New England and to Maine in particular. \nWith the high price of gasoline, we need relief now, and that's what \nthis bill provides. As a matter of fact, we could have used the relief \nin Northern Maine a few months ago--that's a big tourist season for \nthem as snowmobilers from all over the East head to Maine to use the \nhundreds of miles of trails throughout the northern part of the State.\n  The choices are clear--do nothing for the taxpayers who are being \ngouged by failed energy policies, or do something by supporting \nlegislation that gives some relief at the gas pump right now. We should \ntemporarily repeal the 4.3 cent per gallon gas tax and support a bill \nthat also acts as a circuit breaker, giving citizens a break at the gas \npump if gas goes over $2.00 a gallon while protecting the Trust Funds \nthat build our highways and airports. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill by voting for cloture.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am as upset by the gasoline price \nspikes as anyone else. Price spikes have been worse in California than \nin any other State. Today, as I speak, though prices have recently \nstarted to come down a bit, they still average more than $2 per gallon \nin some parts of California.\n  Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose S. 2285, despite \nunderstanding the sentiment behind it. The problem with S. 2285 is that \nthere is no way to guarantee that a reduction in the federal gasoline \ntax will be passed on to consumers. Why is this? Because price is a \nfunction of supply and demand, not taxes. And right now, world oil \nmarkets are extremely tight, so prices are high.\n  The way to relieve the pressure on the market is to boost supply and \nreduce demand.\n  With regard to supply, fourteen nations sell oil to the U.S. under a \ncartel known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, \nOPEC. Like any monopoly, OPEC controls the price of oil by limiting \nsupply. Decreased production in non-OPEC countries like Venezuela, \nMexico, and Norway has also contributed to the squeeze.\n  Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law, there are only a few things the \nU.S. can do to encourage the cartel to increase supply. The preferred \nalternative is diplomacy. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has had some \nsuccess on this front. OPEC ministers announced last month that the \ncartel would immediately increase supply by 1.7 million barrels a day. \nMexico has also agreed to increase production by a small amount.\n  It takes several weeks for production increases to be felt at the \npump, in lower prices. And California has unique problems affecting its \nsupply. No other State requires the kind of reformulated gasoline that \nCalifornia does. So the gasoline has to be refined in California. And \nCalifornia refiners have had problems--including two fires--operating \ntheir plants at full capacity. They are at full capacity now.\n  Notwithstanding these problems, the announcement of OPEC production \nincreases has driven spot gasoline prices down. They have dropped more \nthan 40 cents, for instance, in the greater Los Angeles area.\n  The spot price is the price of gasoline on the open market without \ntaxes and other markups figured in. Spot prices are usually good \nharbingers of the price movement we will eventually see at the pump \nabout a month or two later.\n  But the increase in OPEC production is, at best, a short-term \nsolution. By the middle of summer when demand for gasoline will peak, \nwe may be back in the same predicament.\n  As I said a moment ago, S. 2285 doesn't solve the problem of high \ngasoline prices. Under California law, if the federal gasoline tax \ndrops by 9 cents per gallon or more, then the State tax automatically \nrises to off-set the federal decrease. The law is designed to protect \nthe Highway Trust Fund. I have spoken with members of the California \nlegislature about this. They do not seem inclined to change the law.\n  Even if the law were changed, the price still wouldn't drop. At least \nthat's what the chief executive officers of the three major California \nrefiners told me. Collectively, they produce 70 percent of California's \ngasoline. None could guarantee that prices would drop at the pump. They \ncited the fundamental problem with supply, and also pointed out that \nthey have no control over other entities in the supply chain.\n  What are our options?\n  The fact is, we have limited control over supply. Too much of the \nworld's oil is produced elsewhere. The one thing we can control is \ndemand.\n  The best way to reduce demand is to require that sports utility \nvehicles (SUVs) and light duty trucks get the same fuel efficiency that \npassenger vehicles do. If SUVs and light duty trucks had the same fuel \nefficiency standards as passenger cars, the U.S. would use one million \nfewer barrels of oil each day.\n  This is roughly equal to the U.S. shortfall before OPEC increased \nproduction.\n  The Department of Transportation is responsible for setting fuel \nefficiency requirements under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \nprogram. Abut two-thirds of all petroleum used goes to transportation, \nso boosting fuel efficiency is an important way to wean ourselves off \nOPEC oil and reduce the price motorists pay for gasoline. Consider, \ntoo, the significant environmental and health benefits of higher fuel \nefficiency.\n  But CAFE standards have not increased since the mid- 1980s. And the \nsituation is made worse by a loophole in the CAFE regulations. SUVs and \nlight duty trucks--which are as much passenger vehicles as station \nwagons and sedans--are only required to average 20.7 miles per gallon \nper fleet versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles.\n  Since half of all new vehicles sold in this country are fuel-thirsty \nSUVs and light duty trucks, this stranglehold on energy efficiency has \nproduced an American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. \nWe are going backwards!\n  According to the non-partisan American Council for an Energy \nEfficient Economy, the U.S. saves 3 million barrels of oil a day \nbecause of CAFE standards. Close the SUV loophole, as I said a moment \nago, and save another million barrels each day.\n  Overall, SUV and light duty truck owners spend an extra $25 billion a \nyear\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nat the pump because of the ``SUV loophole.'' Making SUVs and light duty \ntrucks get better gas mileage would save their owners some $640 at the \npump each year when the price of gasoline averages $2 per gallon.\n  The ``bottom line'' is that eliminating some or all of the federal \ngasoline tax won't lower prices at the pump. The best way to do that is \nto reduce our demand. The best way to reduce demand is to increase the \ngas mileage requirements for SUVs and light duty trucks.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I've come to \nthe Senate floor on a number of occasions in recent weeks to express my \nconcern with rising fuel costs and the lack of an energy policy by this \nAdministration. I don't have to remind my colleagues how the rising \ncost of oil threatens almost every aspect of our economy and \ncommunities. Senior citizens on fixed incomes cannot absorb extreme \nfluctuations in their energy costs. Business travelers and airlines \ncannot afford dramatic increases in airline fuel costs. Families \nstruggling to feed and educate their children cannot withstand higher \nheating bills, increasing gasoline costs, or the domino effect this \ncrisis has on the costs of goods and services. To be sure, this problem \nis impacting virtually every facet of American life and may only get \nworse as we approach the high energy demand of the summer months.\n  I look at the situation we're now facing with high oil prices and \nlimited supply and have a hard time understanding why it's such a \nsurprise to so many people. I've heard Secretary Richardson refer to \nthe fact that the Energy Department may have been caught ``napping on \nthe job.'' Since coming to Congress in 1993, I've been saying the \nEnergy Department is asleep at the wheel. We have an Energy Department \nthat spends less than 15% of its budget, and even less of its time, on \nthe core energy issues within the Department. I dare say that energy \nconsumers are the last thing they think about over on Independence \nAvenue--certainly not the first.\n  With all due respect to Secretary Richardson, I don't think he was \nnecessarily caught napping on the job, but flat out neglecting the \nenergy needs of this country. Under the tenure of the last three \nSecretaries of Energy, this Administration has done nothing but weaken \nour energy security, increase our reliance on foreign oil, shut down \ndomestic oil and gas production, and ensure the closure or removal of \nmany of our primary means of electricity generation--coal, nuclear, and \nhydropower. I think it's time that policy-makers in Washington come to \nthe realization that we are now a nation with no energy policy and no \nability to respond to even the most limited energy supply disruptions.\n  Consider the recent effort of the Administration to address the oil \nprice crisis. We've all witnessed this Administration's ``tin-can \ndiplomacy'' over the past few weeks. Instead of planning for the energy \nneeds of our country, this Administration waits for a crisis and then \nresponds by sending its appointees to grovel, plead, or otherwise beg \nother nations into helping us out. The United States, thanks to this \nAdministration, is a nation running around the world looking for a \nhandout from friend and foe alike.\n  It's embarrassing that the economy of our nation hinged on the \ndecision of a few oil ministers sitting in a room in Vienna just a \ncouple of weeks ago. Do we realize that Iran was blocking an OPEC \nincrease of 1.7 million barrels of oil a day? The strength of our \neconomy now may rest on the ability of OPEC oil ministers to convince \ncountries like Iran to help us out in the future. That is quite a \nstatement on the viability of the Clinton Administration energy policy.\n  But still, this Administration maintains its steadfast opposition to \ndoing anything here in the United States to dramatically decrease our \nreliance on foreign oil and increase our domestic exploration and \nproduction. ANWR is off-limits. They don't want to discuss off-shore \ndrilling. They claim they're open to looking at some activity on public \nlands, but at the same time they're on a blitz to lock up every last \nacre of land they can find into some type of new, restrictive \ndesignation before President Clinton and Secretary Babbitt leave \noffice.\n  Well, the farmers of Minnesota can't wait for President Clinton or \nSecretaries Babbitt or Richardson to leave office before our country \nplaces a renewed emphasis on a sound, long-term energy policy. Truckers \nacross America cannot wait for President Clinton to leave office to get \nsome relief at the fuel pump. And energy consumers far and wide cannot \nstand by while this Administration begs countries like Iran and Libya \nto ``feel our pain.''\n  Regrettably, I fear the oil supply and price crisis we're now \nexperiencing is only an early warning of the pain the Clinton \nAdministration's neglect of energy policy is going to level on American \nenergy consumers. It won't be that far into the future before this \nAdministration's appetite for closing down nuclear and coal-fired power \nplants and destroying hyrdopower facilities will bring similar price \nincreases for electricity consumers.\n  Many of us have suggested that we need to look closely at both short- \nand long-term approaches to easing the pain of the current oil crisis \non American energy consumers and reducing our nation's reliance on \nforeign oil. I've spoken at length about how we need to focus our \nefforts on developing a long-term energy policy that puts American jobs \nand productivity first, instead of last. Doing so, however, will take \ntime and produce few immediate results to help consumers in the coming \nmonths.\n  In the short-term, I believe Congress must consider temporarily \nsuspending some or all of the federal fuel taxes, which, along with \nstate excise taxes, account for an average of 40 cents per gallon of \ngasoline. That is why I've joined Majority Leader Trent Lott, Senator \nLarry Craig and a number of my colleagues in offering S. 2285--The \nFederal Fuels Tax Holiday Act of 2000. Our legislation would \ntemporarily suspend the 4.3 cent tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and \naviation fuel while protecting both the Highway Trust Fund and the \nSocial Security surplus. The bill will suspend the 4.3 cent tax \nstarting on April 16 through January 1, 2001. For farmers, truckers, \nairlines, and other large energy consumers, this action will have an \neven greater positive impact on the large amounts of fuel they consume.\n  This legislation reflects the leadership of a number of our \ncolleagues. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado has \nchampioned legislation to suspend the diesel fuel tax. Once a trucker \nhimself, Senator Campbell has led the way in assisting truckers and \ntheir families who are suffering as a result of the rising price of \ndiesel fuel. And Senator Murkowski, as Chairman of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, has been a leader in calling attention to the growing energy \nneeds of our nation and the Administration's energy policy failures.\n  I want to add that I'm very aware that many of my colleagues have \nargued that 4.3 cents a gallon has a negligible impact on consumers. To \nthem, I say look at the amount of fuel a farmer or trucker consumes \nduring an average week. Look at the diesel fuel required to operate a \nfamily farm or deliver products across this country. Or look at the \ntight profit margins that can make the difference between going to work \nand being without a job. I'm convinced this action is going to help \nfarmers, businesses, truckers, and families in Minnesota and that's why \nI strongly support it.\n\n  I firmly believe that federal gas taxes should go to the Highway \nTrust Fund for road, highway and bridge improvements. That's why we're \nrestoring revenues being provided to energy consumers by the 4.3 cent \ngas tax suspension. The Highway Trust Fund will be reinstated with non-\nSocial Security budget surplus funds from the current fiscal year as \nwell as fiscal year 2001. In addition, no highway projects or airport \nprojects will be delayed or jeopardized, because funds going into the \ntrust fund are fully restored by the surplus. There will be no impact \non these projects.\n  If gas prices reach a national average of $2 a gallon for regular \nunleaded gasoline, federal excise gas taxes would be suspended, again \nwithout impacting the Highway Trust Fund in any way. This would \nsuspend, until the end of the year, the 18.4 cents per gallon federal \ngasoline tax, the 24.4 cents per gallon tax on highway diesel fuel and \nkerosene, the 19.4 cents per gallon for noncommercial aviation \ngasoline, the 21.9\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\ncents per gallon for noncommercial jet fuel, and the 4.4 cents per \ngallon for commercial aviation fuel.\n  Let me make this very clear: we are not going to raid the Highway \nTrust Fund with this legislation. In fact, we've ensured that the non-\nSocial Security budget surplus will absorb all of the costs of the gas \ntax reduction. I also want to assure my colleagues and my constituents \nthat this legislation walls off the Social Security surplus. We will \nnot spend any of the Social Security surplus to pay for the gas tax \nreduction.\n  Our legislation is quite simply a tax cut for the American consumer \nat a time when it's needed most. We're going to use surplus funds--\nfunds that have been taken from the American consumer above and beyond \nthe needs of government--and give them back to consumers every day at \nthe gasoline pumps. This legislation takes concrete steps toward more \nreasonable fuel prices, helping to serve as a buffer for consumers who \nare already feeling the impact of the high cost of gasoline and other \nfuels.\n  In closing, I want to say that I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the coming days, weeks and months in forging a number of \nboth short-term and long-term responses to the needs of farmers, \ntruckers, the elderly, and all energy consumers. I've been a strong \nsupporter of renewable energy technologies and increased funding for \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LiHEAP. I strongly \nsupport the efforts of my colleagues to increase domestic oil and gas \nexploration and production. I remain committed to finding a resolution \nto our nation's nuclear waste storage crisis--a crisis that threatens \nto shut down nuclear plants and further weaken our nation's domestic \nenergy security. And I'll continue to be one of the Senate's strongest \ncritics of the Department of Energy's unconscionable neglect of the \nlong-term energy needs of our nation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 2285, \nthe Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act of 2000. Our country is in dire need \nof a comprehensive energy policy, including a strategy to reduce fuel \nprices. Immediately suspending the 4.3 cent per gallon Clinton/Gore gas \ntax is one thing we can do in the short-term to provide some relief \nfrom the high fuel prices we have been experiencing.\n  S. 2285 would further suspend all but 0.1 percent of federal excise \ntaxes on fuels if the national average price of a gallon of regular \nunleaded gasoline rises to $2. While I fully support this concept, we \nshould consider doing more. I have cosponsored legislation in the past \nthat would permanently repeal all but two cents per gallon of the \nfederal gas tax, allowing states to make up the difference if they \nchoose to fund their own highway-construction needs.\n  Mr. President, we Arizonans have been sending more gas tax revenues \nto Washington than we receive back in federal highway funds. For \nArizona, and other so-called donor states, repeal of the federal tax \nwould either mean significant tax relief or, if the state does increase \nits own tax, more dollars actually spent on highway improvements in-\nstate. It is time to divest the federal government of this authority, \nand give it back to the states where it rightfully belongs.\n  To ensure our energy security in the long-term, we also need a \nstrategy for reducing our dependence on imported oil. Today we are \nextremely dependent on other countries for our oil--56 percent comes \nfrom foreign sources. While our imports are rising, domestic production \nis decreasing. In just the last decade, U.S. production has declined 17 \npercent. At the same time, our consumption has increased 14 percent. \nUnfortunately, we are moving in the direction of greater dependence on \nforeign oil, not less.\n  To reverse this trend we need to stop the decline in domestic \nproduction, which can only be done by increasing access to lands with \nhigh potential for oil and gas resources. Of course this can, and must, \nbe done in an environmentally sensitive manner. While extraction should \nbe part of a larger energy strategy, including the development of \nalternative fuels, and conservation efforts, it is a critical \ncomponent. Increasing domestic production will help reverse our rising \nreliance on imported oil, and will boost supply, thereby lowering \nprices.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote for cloture this \nafternoon on the Federal fuels tax holiday bill to help address the \nsoaring cost of fuel and our rising dependency on foreign oil. We have \nhad numerous hearings and many statements have been given on the floor \nto address this grave situation we are in. Unfortunately, it seems like \nwe are going to have to endure this problem for a while longer.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have had many conversations with truckers, \nshippers, and concerned citizens about how this problem affects them. \nSpecifically, my conversations boiled down how this crisis affects our \nAmerican truck drivers. Over 95 percent of all commercial manufacturing \ngoods and agricultural products are shipped by truck at some point. 9.6 \nmillion people have jobs directly or indirectly related to trucking. In \naddition, trucking contributes over 5 percent of America's gross \ndomestic product which is the equivalent of $372 billion to the \neconomy.\n  Along with these astonishing facts about trucking, here are some more \nfacts about this fuel crisis:\n  fuel taxes account for about 28 percent of what you pay for a gallon \nof gas at the pump;\n  the government imposes 43 different direct and indirect taxes on the \nproduction and distribution of gas, bringing the total burden to 54 \npercent of the price of a gallon of gas;\n  U.S. oil production is down 17 percent from 1992, consumption is up \n14 percent;\n  DOE estimates the United States will use 65 percent foreign oil by \n2020;\n  the United States spends $300 million per day, and $100 billion per \nyear on foreign oil;\n  and oil makes up one-third of our trade deficit.\n  I know what our truckers are going through. I put myself through \ncollege driving a truck and I just recently got my Colorado commercial \ndriver's license so that I could get back into driving. Since I own a \nsmall rig, I know firsthand how the fuel crisis impacts those who \ndepend on it. My fuel bills have doubled in the last year alone.\n  Hundreds of truckers from all over have come to Washington to ask for \nhelp on three different occasions in the last few weeks. One thing I \nhave learned is that when many private citizens give their time to come \nto Washington, the issue is not profit margins, or stock prices, it is \nbecause they are fighting for their families' very livelihood.\n  I met a man named Wesley White from Oregon, who said he was on his \nlast run. He could not afford to continue fueling his truck. He has \nspent his pension to buy the truck, but when he gets home, he's parking \nit for good. Without the income derived from delivering goods he will \nnot be able to make truck payments and will lose the truck. Another \ntrucker I met was living with his wife and two small children in the \ntruck sleeper because the increase in diesel costs did not leave them \nenough money to pay their house rent.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has ignored the plight of these \nhard working Americans. This administration got us into this mess by \ntheir total lack of an energy policy. They stand in the way of domestic \noil production by locking up public lands and refuse to release federal \nfuel stockpiles already in place.\n  Now, faced with skyrocketing diesel prices, they still do nothing of \nsubstance, instead they wanted to wait for OPEC to meet in Vienna which \nhappened on March 27 and 28 of this year, hoping that the outcome would \nbe favorable for the U.S., which is debatable. But can we trust this \noutcome when the U.S. has sanction on 8 out of the 11 OPEC nations?\n\n  Recently, the Energy Secretary went to the Middle East with hat in \nhand, to beg for fuel. He claims that this increase in oil production \nwill lower fuel costs by approximately 11 cents by the end of the \nsummer. Well, what do we do until then? The crisis is happening now. \nAlso administration officials come before Congress to propose studying \nalternative energy sources, which is fine, but I have news for them: \nTrucks today run on diesel, not wind or solar power. Everything we buy \nto eat and wear comes on a truck. If the trucks stop rolling, this \nNation stops rolling.\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\n  The benefits from this recent increase in oil production will not be \nseen for months. We need solutions now before any more Americans lose \ntheir jobs because of high fuel prices.\n  I am pleased the pending legislation includes a provision which is \nsimilar to a bill I introduced more than a month ago on March 2, S. \n2161 the American Transportation Recovery and Highway Trust Fund \nProtection Act of 2000. My bill would temporarily suspend the federal \nexcise tax on diesel fuel for one year or until the price of crude oil \nis reduced to the December 31, 1999 level. It would replace the lost \nrevenues with monies from the budget surplus in the general fund, while \nprotecting the Highway Trust Fund. S. 2161 is endorsed by the American \nTrucking Association, the Independent Truckers Association, and the \nColorado Motor Carriers Association to name just a few.\n  The provision in the pending legislation states that in the event the \nnational average price of unleaded regular gasoline rises to $2 per \ngallon or more, it would further suspend all federal excise taxes on \nfuels, while retaining only the 0.1 percent portion devoted to Leaking \nUnderground Storage Tanks Trust Fund. I believe this action would be an \nimportant step forward to help relieve the escalating burden on \nAmerica's truckers and farmers.\n  But, these bills are only short-term solutions, and only one step \nwhich could be taken. Our real problem is our dependence on foreign \noil. In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, the U.S. bought 35 \npercent of its oil from foreign sources. Today, we buy 56 percent, by \nsome reports 62 percent. All the negotiations the administration is \ndoing to get OPEC to open the spigots is not more than a band aid \napproach to a problem that will continually revisit us as long as we \nare dependent on foreign oil. It is unfortunate that we, a global \nsuperpower, are reduced to begging, and now we have to take what we can \nget from OPEC. More forceful actions need to be taken to expose the \nseverity of this problem and address it now, not in the months to come. \nWe cannot stand by and do nothing of consequence while good people lose \ntheir means of support.\n  The Federal fuels tax holiday bill is an important step forward to \nprovide relief to hard working Americans from the burden of rising fuel \nprices, and I urge my colleagues to support cloture so we can pass this \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to take this \nopportunity to explain why I missed the vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday bill, and more \nimportantly, to explain why I would have voted against cloture on this \nbill.\n  I had to be absent for this vote because I was traveling to Taiwan, \nwhere I became the first Member of the U.S. Congress to visit its newly \nelected leadership. I made the trip to discuss and reinforce Taiwan's \nclose economic ties with my state of West Virginia, and to relay our \ncountry's interest in Taiwan and its continued stable relations with \nChina.\n  Had I been in Washington, DC, for this vote, I would have most \nassuredly voted against it. I would have opposed cloture for a number \nof reasons, including my philosophical opposition to the frequent use \nof the cloture procedure by the majority to foreclose Democratic \ninitiatives. However, I was happy to see that this cloture motion \nfailed because of more substantive concerns. Quite simply, this bill \nrepresents bad tax policy, bad energy policy, and bad transportation \npolicy, all dressed up in an election year wrapper.\n  Proponents of the gas tax ``holiday'' would have us believe that this \nbill--which would have cut more than $200 million in federal highway \nmoney for West Virginia--was offered to do something about the recent \nprice increases for gasoline and other fuels. Petroleum products are \ntaxed at the refinery, not at the pump, and consumers would not have \nseen any of the savings passed through to them. Consumers in some \nstates would even have seen their state gasoline tax go up in response \nto the federal tax going down. The effect of this bill would have been \nthe creation of a windfall for oil companies and middlemen, with West \nVirginians still paying much more than the national average for a \ngallon of gas.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss some of the problems \nwith this legislation. The proposed 4.3 cent reduction would translate \nto more than $4 billion in lost revenue that would otherwise go to the \nHighway Trust Fund. The complete elimination of fuel taxes that would \nhave been triggered by the price of gas going above $2.00 would explode \nthat shortfall to more than $20 billion--all to be made up from a \nsurplus that some would argue does not exist. These funding reductions \nwould have put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work, \njeopardized projects to upgrade our aging transportation \ninfrastructure, and put millions of highway users at risk.\n  In addition to the severe cutback in the highway funding mechanism, \nwhich we were so happy to put in place two years ago with the passage \nof TEA-21, the impact of the fuel tax repeal would have left the \nAirport and Airway Trust Fund under-funded to the tune of about $700 \nmillion a year. The effect on airline passenger safety, and on airport \nconstruction and maintenance projects, would be devastating.\n  Repeal of the gasoline excise tax would have eliminated the tax \nincentives we in Congress have instituted to expand the use of \nalternative fuels. Without the general excise tax from which to \npartially exempt alternative or blended fuels, there would be no \nrealistic means of bringing our nation into compliance with fuel \ndiversity standards we have previously worked to put in place. As this \ntemporary worldwide shortage of gasoline demonstrates so painfully at \nthe pumps, the United States needs an energy policy that weakens the \ngrip of foreign suppliers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to comment on an earlier cloture \nvote on this issue. On March 30 I voted for the cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed to this bill. I voted this way not because I \nsupported the gas tax repeal, but precisely because I thought the \nSenate should proceed to consideration of the bill, so that its many \nfaults could be debated, and the bill could be voted down.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the inquiry from the senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, I would like to pass on my views on \nthe intent and impact of Section 1(f)(4) of S. 2285. This provision, as \nSenator Warner pointed out, is indeed unprecedented in the history of \nthe law governing the Highway Trust Fund. As I read this provision, it \nis an attempt to make up for the losses in deposits that would occur to \nboth the Highway and Airport and Airway Trust Funds as a result of a \nreduced fuel tax in this bill with transfers from the general fund of \nthe Treasury. As has been pointed out by other Senators during debate \non this bill, the legislation does not state with specificity how this \ndiversion of general funds is to occur. It is not clear whether these \ngeneral funds would be derived from the non-Social Security surplus or \nbe required to be diverted from other areas of federal spending.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the excellent staff \nwork of Ann Loomis of Senator Warner's staff, Ellen Stein of Senator \nVoinovich's staff, Tracy Henke of Senator Bond's staff, Mitch Warren of \nSenator Lautenberg's staff, Tom Sliter and Dawn Levy of Senator Baucus' \nstaff, as well as Peter Rogoff, of my Appropriations Committee staff, \non this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from a \nnumber of interest groups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Byrd: The Associated General Contractors of \n     America (AGC) greatly appreciates your vote in favor of the \n     Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond Sense of the \n     Senate Amendment to the Budget Resolution. Your vote in \n     support of not tampering with the federal gas tax and the \n     Highway Trust Fund demonstrates your commitment to improving \n     our nation's highways, bridges and transit systems.\n       The amendment, which was overwhelmingly approved by the \n     Senate 66 to 34, declares the Senate's support for \n     maintaining the current level of federal motor fuels taxes. \n     The Senate has consistently rejected efforts to repeal \n     portions of the federal gas tax. In 1998, 72 sitting Senators \n     voted against\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\n     repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. The next day, the entire \n     Senate voted to spend the 4.3 cents for badly needed highway \n     and transit improvements.\n       It is imperative that the Senate continues to oppose any \n     efforts to reduce the federal gasoline taxes on either a \n     temporary or permanent basis. These user fees save lives, \n     reduce congestion and create thousands of American jobs. Any \n     reduction or suspension of the federal gasoline tax threatens \n     to erode the spending levels guaranteed in the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). Moreover, the \n     reduction in gasoline taxes provides no guarantee that \n     consumers will experience any reduction in the price at the \n     pump.\n       Again, thank you for your support of the Byrd-Warner-\n     Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond Sense of the Senate \n     Amendment to the Budget Resolution. Please continue to help \n     defeat any efforts to reduce the federal gasoline taxes and \n     preserve the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jeffrey D. Shoaf,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Congressional Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roberts: On behalf of the 5,000 members of the \n     American Road and Transportation Builders Association \n     (ARTBA), thank you for your April 6 vote in support of the \n     Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinvoich-Lautenberg-Bond Amendment to the \n     proposed FY2001 budget resolution.\n       We greatly appreciate you going on record in opposition to \n     efforts to repeal or suspend the federal motor fuels tax in \n     response to rising gas prices. We have notified our members \n     in your state that you voted to support retaining the current \n     federal motor fuels tax and sent a strong signal against \n     proposals that would place funding for state highway and mass \n     transit improvement programs at risk.\n       Unfortunately, this issue may come before the Senate again \n     the week of April 10. We understand S. 2285, or some \n     variation thereof, may be brought to the Senate floor in the \n     near future as a stand-alone bill or as an amendment to other \n     legislation. S. 2285 would temporarily repeal 4.3 cents of \n     the federal motor fuels tax from April 15, 2000, through \n     January 1, 2001. The bill would repeal the entire 18.4 cents \n     federal gas tax if the national average price for a gallon of \n     gasoline rises above $2.00. The bill proposes to use the \n     ``on-budget surplus'' to ``reimburse'' the more than $20 \n     billion that could be lost to the Highway Trust Fund under \n     this scheme.\n       We hope you will vigorously oppose S. 2285 or like \n     proposals.\n       This bill introduces uncertainty and risk into state \n     highway and mass transit funding. Federal investment in these \n     areas is already guaranteed under TEA-21. There is no need to \n     risk this guarantee for a promise that things will be taken \n     care of using the ``on-budget surplus.''\n       The fact is, S. 2285 could utilize the entire FY 2000 ``on-\n     budget surplus.'' According to the Senate Budget Committee's \n     Informed Budgeteer, the Congressional Budget Office has re-\n     estimated the FY 2000 ``on-budget surplus'' to be $15 \n     billion. Repealing the entire federal gas tax from April 15 \n     to September 30--a possibility under S. 2285--would cost the \n     Highway Trust Fund approximately $15 billion.\n       This would leave no room for other Republican or Clinton \n     Administration budget priorities . . . or for using the \n     ``surplus'' to pay down the national debt . . . or to protect \n     Social Security and Medicare. The House has already adopted a \n     supplemental appropriation bill for FY 2000 that would tie-up \n     $16.7 billion of the ``on-budget surplus''! The proposed \n     supplemental is but one of many measures that would utilize \n     the ``on-budget surplus.''\n       Again, we thank you for your vote April 6. We need you to \n     be with us again in opposition to S. 2285.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        AAA Washington Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: AAA is pleased to lend its support to \n     your amendment to the Senate budget resolution, S. Con. Res. \n     101, expressing the ``Sense of the Senate'' that the federal \n     gasoline tax should not be reduced or repealed.\n       AAA has serious concerns about efforts to suspend or repeal \n     any portion of the federal excise tax on gasoline. While \n     attractive at first glance, this course of action will do \n     little to address the root cause of our gasoline price \n     problem today, which is a shortage of supply caused by \n     curtailed production of crude oil by OPEC member nations.\n       The benefit to motorists from reducing the gas tax is, at \n     best minimal--repealing 4.3 cents would amount to about $1/\n     week for the average consumer. However, as your amendment \n     points out, the resulting loss of revenue to the Highway \n     Trust Fund would be disastrous to the important work of \n     fixing the nation's highways and bridges and improving \n     safety.\n       It is highway and traffic safety that is of most concern to \n     AAA. Lower receipts to the Highway Trust Fund compromise the \n     safety of the traveling public. We take these roads back and \n     forth to work and on vacations, our children take these roads \n     to school, and our public safety officials use these arteries \n     to respond to emergencies.\n       Asking Americans to choose between a gas tax reduction and \n     safety is posing the wrong question. The right question is: \n     How should Congress and the Administration manage an energy \n     strategy that reduces dependence upon a foreign cartel? That \n     way motorists would have the safe highways they've paid for \n     through their gas taxes and an oil supply they can rely on. \n     Short-term fixes, while politically popular, are not in the \n     best interests of highway safety and the overall economic \n     well being of the nation.\n       Congress made a very important decision by creating the \n     Highway Trust Fund and establishing the direct link between \n     user fees paid by motorists and trust fund monies dedicated \n     to improving the nation's surface transportation. Because of \n     TEA-21, the trust fund is now dedicated to providing \n     Americans the safe and efficient transportation system on \n     which they have paid and on which they rely.\n       Again, AAA appreciates your continued leadership on \n     transportation issues and is pleased to support your \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Susan G. Pikrallidas,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Public & Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Construction Industry\n\n\n                                    Manufacturers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: The Construction Industry \n     Manufacturers Association (CIMA) thanks you for your support \n     of the amendment to S. Con. Res. 101 to oppose a reduction of \n     federal fuel taxes. CIMA is the full service, innovative \n     business resource for over 500 construction equipment \n     manufacturers and services providers.\n       CIMA's membership was alerted to this amendment and \n     actively lobbied for a favorable vote. The bipartisan support \n     for the amendment demonstrates that an overwhelming majority \n     of the Senate supports the user fee concept to build and \n     maintain our nation's roads, highways and bridges.\n       A reliable transportation infrastructure is essential to \n     maintain the strength of the U.S. economy and for the \n     American public to enjoy safe and efficient modes of travel.\n       CIMA thanks you for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dennis J. Slater,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Laborers' International Union\n\n\n                                             of North America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 800,000 members of \n     the Laborers' International Union of America, I am writing to \n     urge you to oppose any effort to temporarily repeal the \n     entire 18.4 cents per gallon gas tax to offset the recent \n     increases in the price of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel. \n     While a repeal of the gas tax would most certainly result in \n     less spending on transportation infrastructure, safety \n     programs and job losses, there is simply no guarantee that it \n     would result in lower prices at the pump.\n       The current plan likely to be considered on the Senate \n     floor proposes to suspend the 4.3 cents gas tax immediately. \n     However, even if the 4.3-cents tax is suspended, few \n     consumers will likely see savings at the pump for at least \n     two reasons. First, the tax is not actually imposed at the \n     gas pump; rather it is collected shortly after it leaves the \n     refinery. The fuel can pass through several middlemen before \n     it reaches the consumer. None of these middlemen would have \n     to pass along the savings. Those supplying the fuel could \n     simply keep the reduced tax. Past experience has shown that \n     as the wholesale cost of fuel goes up, prices at the pump \n     increase. Decreases in fuel taxes, however, have not \n     necessarily been passed on to motorists and motor carriers.\n       Several years ago, Connecticut reduced their state fuel tax \n     but it did not translate into a price cut for consumers. As \n     the Hartford Courant noted in 1997, after prices failed to \n     come down.\n       ``Gas taxes and prices are not connected in an ironclad \n     way. The tax can be cut, but the benefits to consumers will \n     be swallowed up in higher prices at the pump. In the future, \n     the governor and legislature should build tax policy on a \n     firmer foundation.''\n       Secondly, some states, such as California, have laws that \n     automatically increase the state fuel tax with any reduction \n     in the federal fuel tax. In those states, the consumer would \n     realize no tax savings at all.\n       The new Senate plan calls for funding the gas tax repeal \n     out of the budget surplus, a proposal that would supplant \n     other legislative priorities. In 1997, Congress transferred \n     the revenue from the taxes imposed on highway users to the \n     Highway Trust Fund to help pay for highway and transit \n     infrastructure, and for highway safety programs. The 4.3-cent \n     tax on gasoline and diesel brings in $7.2\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\n     billion to the Highway Trust Fund annually--$5.8 billion for \n     highways and $1.4 billion for transit. When Congress passed \n     the TEA-21 bill, it established a direct link between these \n     funds and the funding returned to the states and cities for \n     highways and transit. Under TEA-21, all highway programs--\n     highway construction, highway safety, transportation \n     enhancements and high-priority projects--are decreased \n     proportionally if tax revenues fall. Using the budget surplus \n     for transportation puts highway construction, highway safety \n     and transit programs at risk when Congress reauthorizes them \n     in 2003, because the funding levels in TEA-21 will not be \n     sustainable without a tax increase or continued transfers \n     from the General Fund.\n       In essence, repealing the gas tax could reduce spending for \n     highway construction, transit and other transportation \n     infrastructure programs and draw down the budget surplus \n     without ever putting one cent, and at the very most pennies a \n     week, into the pocket of the average consumer. To put it \n     simply, it's a bad idea.\n       For all the above reasons and more, we ask you to oppose \n     any effort to repeal or suspend any portion of the gas tax if \n     the full Senate considers it.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            Terence M. O'Sullivan,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Portland\n\n\n                                              Cement Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2000.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the American Portland \n     Cement Alliance (APCA), a trade association representing \n     virtually all domestic portland cement manufacturers, thank \n     you for voting in favor of the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-\n     Lautenberg-Bond sense of the Senate amendment to the budget \n     resolution.\n       As you know, an attempt to repeal or temporarily suspend \n     the federal fuels user fees (gasoline tax) may occur next \n     week, possibly during consideration of the Marriage Penalty \n     Tax legislation. Because the amendment would likely reimburse \n     the transportation trust funds with General Fund revenues, \n     its enactment could easily consume this year's entire \n     projected budgetary surplus (not required to protect the \n     Social Security Trust Fund). In short, if you have other \n     priorities, such as paying down the national debt, estate and \n     marriage penalty tax reductions, Medicare, or education, the \n     money will be gone.\n       APCA is deeply concerned that any reduction in the user fee \n     would undermine TEA-21 and the funding commitment that \n     legislation made to the states for highway and mass transit \n     programs. Any reduction in these user fees would jeopardize \n     the funding guarantee under TEA-21 and, more importantly, \n     introduce uncertainty for state highway and transit \n     improvement programs, and the construction and material \n     supply industries, such as the cement manufacturers. \n     Therefore, I respectfully ask that you vote against any \n     measures to repeal the federal fuels user fees.\n       Again, thank you for your support on the Byrd-Warner-\n     Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond sense of the Senate \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard C. Creighton,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        AAA Washington Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: AAA thanks you for your vote in support \n     of the amendment offered by Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) to the \n     fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. The 66-34 vote in favor \n     of the Byrd amendment is a clear signal that the majority of \n     the U.S. Senate does not support efforts to suspend or repeal \n     any portion of the federal excise tax on gasoline.\n       AAA continues to have serious concerns about efforts to \n     reduce the federal gas tax. Motorists will see very little \n     benefit from the repeal and they could, in fact, face \n     significant safety problems. The loss of revenue to the \n     Highway Trust Fund would be disastrous to the important work \n     that needs to be done to improve the nation's highways, \n     bridges, and safety programs. A gas tax repeal is a short-\n     term fix to a long-term problem and is not in the best \n     interests of highway safety.\n       AAA encourages you to stand firm in opposition to further \n     consideration of any effort to repeal or suspend the federal \n     gas tax.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Susan G. Pikrallidas,\n                                  Public and Government Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I respond by telling my friend, Senator Warner, that \nthe gas station is the most competitive business in this country. I \nyield the remaining time to my friend, Senator Smith of New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, under S. 2285, lost \nrevenues to the highway trust fund would be made up dollar for dollar \nfrom the on-budget surplus. Let's not forget that we are in this \nposition because the President of the United States does not have an \nenergy policy. We cannot continue to risk both the well-being of the \nAmerican people and our national security. This policy of relying on \noverseas energy has left us vulnerable to the whims of foreign \ncountries.\n  Passage of S. 2285 will bring relief to working families and protect \nour highway trust fund. I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a few minutes of my leader \ntime, if I may, because I understand we have no time on our side \neither.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent to me by two Cabinet \nofficials, Larry Summers and Bill Richardson, be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate; Washington, DC. 20910\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The Administration believes that \n     Congress should pass critical tax credits and incentives that \n     would promote energy efficiency and the use of renewably \n     energy resources to enhance our energy security, instead of a \n     temporary suspension of fuel taxes that will offer consumers \n     little tangible benefit while risking highway and mass \n     transit funds and squeezing other key priorities like \n     education and law enforcement.\n       We urge the Congress to adopt measures that would address \n     fundamental energy needs. The President has proposed a \n     comprehensive tax package, including new tax credits for \n     domestic oil producers and essential incentives to promote \n     energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. \n     Congress should pass the President's tax package and fund \n     fully his fiscal year 2001 budget and 2000 Supplemental to \n     promote energy security through the use of domestic energy \n     technologies. Enactment of these proposals would reduce the \n     effect of high energy prices, decrease our dependence on \n     imported oil, and improve the environment.\n       Much of the benefit of the proposal would accrue to OPEC \n     and other producers rather than American consumers, in \n     contrast to the Administration's approach, which seeks to \n     enhance energy security by increasing domestic energy \n     supplies and energy efficiency. Reducing fuel taxes would \n     increase the demand for imported oil. The quantity of oil in \n     the world market in effectively fixed in the short term. The \n     combination of increased demand and a fixed supply would \n     increase the price of oil, with much of that increase \n     accruing to OPEC instead of American consumers.\n       The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century, PL. \n     105-178, signed by the President on June 9, 1998, guarantees \n     that funds deposited in the highway account will be \n     automatically spent on federal highway and construction \n     needs. The transportation fuels taxes are in the nature of \n     user fees to recoup those costs. We believe that this \n     legislation is inconsistent with this national policy that \n     users of the nation's transportation system should pay for \n     the costs of building and maintaining our transportation \n     infrastructure. There is no justification for shifting \n     transportation infrastructure costs, as S. 2285 would do, \n     from the users of this transportation system to taxpayers \n     generally.\n       We are concerned that S. 2385 only partially protects the \n     Social Security Trust Fund. It provides that the revenue loss \n     from rate reductions in excess of 4.3 cents per gallon may \n     not exceed the on-budget surplus. The 4.3-cents-per-gallon \n     rate reduction, however, would apply even if it remits in an \n     on-budget deficit. In any case in which the rate reduction \n     results in a deficit, the ultimate effect is that a portion \n     of the Social Security Trust Fund equal to the deficit is \n     diverted to maintain highway spending programs at their \n     current level. In addition, S. 2285 would affect receipts and \n     is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n       Finally, we are concerned that this proposal cannot be \n     administered. S. 2285 provides that the aggregate revenue \n     effect of rate reduction in excess of 4.3 cents per gallon \n     not exceed the on-budget surplus during the period the taxes \n     are reduced. We are concerned about our ability to administer \n     this limitation if the rate reductions in excess of 4.3 cents \n     per gallon are triggered. Because the rate reduction period \n     does not coincide with normal budgetary accounting periods, \n     the budget surplus for the period may never be known.\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\n       For the forgoing reasons, we strongly oppose S. 2285. We \n     look forward to working with you on meaningful legislation \n     that will promote domestic energy solutions and reduce our \n     long-term dependency on foreign oil.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence H. Summers.\n     Bill Richardson.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Basically, the letter says what a number of our \ncolleagues have been saying throughout this debate, that this could \nhave devastating consequences on general revenues as well as on the \nSocial Security trust fund per se.\n  It says, briefly reading a couple of paragraphs:\n\n       In any case in which the rate reduction results in a \n     deficit, the ultimate effect is that a portion of the Social \n     Security Trust Fund equal to that deficit is diverted to \n     maintain highway spending programs at the current level. In \n     addition, S. 2285 would affect receipts and is subject to the \n     pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n       We are concerned that this proposal cannot be administered. \n     S. 2285 provides that the aggregate revenue effect of rate \n     reductions in excess of 4.3 cents per gallon not exceed the \n     on-budget surplus during the period the taxes are reduced. We \n     are concerned about our ability to administer this limitation \n     if the rate reductions in excess of 4.3 cents per gallon are \n     triggered. Because the rate reduction period does not \n     coincide with normal budgetary accounting periods, the budget \n     surplus for the period may never be known.\n\n  We ought to have a very good and thorough discussion about the \nimplications of this bill prior to the time we are called upon to vote \non it. By voting for cloture now, we cut off debate that never was. We \ncut off a debate that ought to provide a thorough examination of the \nimplications on the Social Security trust fund, of the budget overall, \nof highway construction this year, of the implications for \ninfrastructure in the outyears, of the solvency of the trust fund in \nperiods beyond this fiscal year. All of those issues have not been \ndebated.\n  For that reason, I hope my colleagues will join me in opposition to \nthe cloture vote to be cast today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nproceed to Calendar No. 437, H.R. 6, the marriage penalty tax repeal \nbill, and that the motion to proceed be agreed to, that the bill be \nsubject to debate only, equally divided, and at 4 p.m. the majority \nleader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to reduce the marriage penalty by providing for adjustments \n     to the standard deduction, 15-percent rate bracket, and \n     earned income credit and to repeal the reduction of the \n     refundable tax credits.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will briefly explain what we have in mind, \nand then I believe Senator Inhofe has some comments he wants to make on \nanother issue before we go to the actual debate on the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  Senator Daschle and I have been talking. As a result of the caucus \nluncheon, the Democrats have some amendments they want to have made in \norder. If they are relevant or if they are close to being relevant in a \nway we can have debate and votes on them, we would like to work out an \nagreement to do that. I have asked him to provide me a list of those \namendments so we can make sure we understand what they are and have a \nchance to assess their relevancy.\n  It is preferable we do that rather than filing cloture and having a \ncloture vote. I believe the American people think it is time to quit \ntalking about the marriage tax penalty and do something about it. I \nknow Senator Moynihan has a different approach as to how to deal with \nit. It is credible. We have looked at that and debated it in the \nFinance Committee. Certainly, that substitute or other substitutes \nshould be offered.\n  Rather than just mark time and not accomplishing anything, this will \nput us into general debate on the marriage tax penalty until 4 p.m. \nThen in an hour, we will have a chance to get an agreement on how to \nproceed. I want us to debate this issue, fully understand the \nramifications of what the Finance Committee reported out, have debate \non the amendments and vote on those amendments and complete this \nlegislation. The American people believe it is time we do this.\n  I cannot help remembering what we did on the Social Security earnings \ntest. We made in order a couple of amendments. We had a good debate, \nand we had a vote or two and passed it unanimously. I believe most \nMembers of the Senate, if not all, realize there are inequities with \nthe marriage tax penalty and we should do something about it. I want to \nfacilitate getting to that point.\n\n  The House has acted overwhelmingly. We are going to see if we can \nwork out an accommodation and obtain a UC agreement as to how to \nproceed.\n  If I need to, I will take leader time to make this brief comment on \nthe bill on which we just voted. The Senate has spoken, although I note \nthere were 43 Senators who thought there should be some sort of fuels \ntax holiday so that working Americans could have some relief.\n  I emphasize, this issue is not over. I fear gasoline prices are going \nto go up. The fact is, we are still dependent, and\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\ngoing to be even more dependent, on foreign oil, mostly OPEC oil, for \n55 percent or more of our needs. We need to do something. We do not \nhave an adequate energy policy, if there is one at all. This issue will \nnot go away.\n  My comment to those who voted against it on both sides is: if not \nthis, what? And if not now, when are we going to do something about our \nenergy dependence on foreign oil? There is a danger here, and we need \nto find a way to address it.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, did the leader ask consent as to what is \nhappening between now and 4 o'clock?\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, we are going ahead with general \ndebate on the marriage tax penalty until 4 o'clock with the time \nequally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader agree the time should be equally divided?\n  Mr. LOTT. It was in the request. The time will be equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry; I missed that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand a lot of people are preparing \ntheir remarks to address this very significant subject of the marriage \ntax penalty. I know the Senator from Texas has addressed this subject \nmany times, as I have, and I intend to do that.\n  Regrettably, I want to report to the Senate and to the American \npeople something different, which is more evidence of the hypocrisy, \ncorruption, and coverup which pervades this administration. Something \nhappened last week. At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, we finally got some answers about the ``investigation'' \nconcerning the March 1998 incident in which information from Linda \nTripp's confidential Government security file was deliberately leaked \nto the media.\n  Linda Tripp was and still is a Government employee who works out of \nthe Pentagon. I understand nobody wants to hear about this. They would \nrather hear warm and fuzzy things. People say they have already heard \nit before, which they have not, but they think they have. They say \nthere are only 9 months left in this President's term. Everybody says: \nShut up; let it go; leave it alone; there is nothing you can do about \nit. They say: Just move on to something else.\n  For those concerned about the politics of it, that is probably wise \ncounsel, but some of us are less concerned about the politics than we \nare about the truth.\n  I wish I did not have to say anything about this subject, but \nsomebody has to do it. We are talking about another crime committed in \nthis administration. Politicians do not want to make people feel \nuncomfortable. As Henry Ward Beecher said:\n\n       I don't like those cold, precise, perfect people who, in \n     order not to say wrong, say nothing; and in order not to do \n     wrong, do nothing.\n\n  A lot of say nothing and do nothing takes place in this Senate. That \nis why I asked Donald Mancuso, the Pentagon's acting inspector general, \na series of questions at the hearing last week. His answers revealed \nfor the first time a number of things we previously did not know.\n  He told us: No. 1, the Pentagon Office of Inspector General completed \nits investigation of this matter in July of 1998. Spokespeople in the \nadministration have been implying for the last 20 months that the \nPentagon itself was still investigating. This is not true. It is just \nanother Clinton lie.\n  What we have is evidence of a lie, a coverup, and a transparent \neffort to drag it out as long as possible, hoping to run out the clock \nas the administration's time in office winds down.\n  No. 2, we learned that the report--this is the report on the leak in \n1998--was given to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, and \nquoting Mancuso:\n\n       We felt we had found sufficient information to warrant \n     consultation with the Department of Justice.\n\n  This means it was a criminal referral. The Pentagon IG obviously \nbelieved there was sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed.\n  No. 3, the inspector general concluded that Pentagon Director of \nPublic Affairs Ken Bacon was involved in illegal activity. Quoting \nagain Inspector General Mancuso:\n\n       The facts show that information was released by Mr. Bacon \n     and it related to Linda Tripp.\n\n  No. 4, the Justice Department, after a 20-month coverup, quietly told \nthe Pentagon in the last 2 weeks it would not prosecute anyone in the \ncase.\n  We would not even have known about it if it had not been for the fact \nthis came out during a hearing. This came out in a hearing that was \nlive on C-SPAN. It was a public hearing, a public forum, so no one is \ngoing to be held legally accountable for what happened.\n  Remember, this is the President, who, in November 1992, said he would \nimmediately fire anyone who was caught disclosing information from \nconfidential Government personnel files.\n  All these things were not publicly known previously. I repeat, these \nfour new findings we learned for the very first time only last week: \nFirst, we discovered that the Pentagon Office of Inspector General \ncompleted its investigation of the matter in July of 1998.\n  Second, we learned that the report was given to the Justice \nDepartment for criminal prosecution.\n  Third, we learned that the inspector general concluded that Pentagon \nDirector of Public Affairs Ken Bacon was involved in the illegal \nactivity.\n  Mancuso said:\n\n       The facts show that information was released by Mr. Bacon \n     and it related to Linda Tripp.\n\n  Under the circumstances, releasing this information was clearly a \ncriminal act, whether the Justice Department wants to believe this or \nnot.\n  Fourth, we learned that the Justice Department has been covering up \nthe crime for 20 months and only now tells us that no one will be \nprosecuted and no one will be held accountable.\n  This would never have come to light if it had not been for this \nhearing.\n  This is the same Justice Department that has botched up the \ninvestigation of the theft of information on the W-88 warhead, that has \nrefused to appoint an independent counsel to investigate campaign \nfundraising illegalities, and that continues to cover up vital \ninformation in defiantly refusing to release the LaBella and Freeh \nmemos suggesting that crimes may have been committed in the Chinagate \nscandal.\n  All this was ``breaking news'' last week. Did we read about it in the \nNew York Times, in the Washington Post, or in the Los Angeles Times, or \nany of those publications? Did we hear about it on ABC, CBS, NBC, or \nCNN? No, we did not. With the noted exception of the Washington Times, \nthe mainstream media largely ignored this important story.\n  Have we come to the point, 7 years and 3 months into this President's \nterm, that the media, that is supposed to be the watchdogs of \ndemocracy, has given up caring about lawbreaking and abuses by the \nincumbent administration? Is that what this is all about? Are they so \ntired and bored by it all that they cannot report the obvious facts to \nthe American people?\n  I appeal to the media right now to cover this story, and to cover it \nwell. Just tell the truth. Expose the facts. Expose the hypocrisy. Do \nnot, by your silence, allow yourselves to become pawns and participants \nin another Clinton coverup.\n  This is still America. The truth still matters. Let's look at some \nhistory. Let's recall a time when the media played a much different \nrole than they are playing now. Watergate was 25 years ago, a time \nbefore the ``death of outrage,'' when the media boasted of its role \nexplaining the immense significance of lawbreaking and coverups in high \nplaces.\n  Charles Colson, a guy I happen to know, I say to Senator Byrd--I \nattend a Bible study with him; an outstanding individual; at that time \nhe was not so outstanding--was special counsel to President Nixon. He \nwent to jail for doing essentially what Ken Bacon did. He released \ninformation to the media about a Pentagon employee that came from a \nconfidential Government file in an attempt to discredit that person.\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\n This was a crime then; and it is a crime now.\n  What exactly did Colson do? This is what he said he did, in his own \nwords. This is going back to 1991:\n\n       I got hold of derogatory FBI reports about Ellsberg and \n     leaked them to the press.\n\n  He said further, in 1976:\n\n       I happily gave an inquiring reporter damaging information . \n     . . compiled from secret FBI dossiers.\n\n  So what happened to Colson?\n  In the midst of the media firestorm surrounding Watergate, Colson \npleaded guilty to the charge that he obstructed justice by \ndisseminating to the media derogatory information from a confidential \nFBI file about Daniel Ellsberg.\n  Colson was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell to a \nprison term of 1 to 3 years and fined $5,000. At the sentencing, Judge \nGesell deplored Colson's ``deliberate misconduct'' and he lectured him \nto understand that ``Morality is a higher force than expediency.''\n  In his book, ``Born Again,'' Colson talked about the significance of \nwhat he had done. He recalled that Judge Gesell said, in his pretrial \nhearing:\n\n       The whole purpose of this case, beyond its immediate \n     objective, is to direct some attention to the desirability of \n     having a government of law, not a government of men. That is \n     what this is [all] about.\n\n  Colson continued, in his own words:\n\n       It is something I remembered from Civics I in school.\n\n  He said:\n\n       These were the cardinal principles of American government, \n     the real bull-work against man-made tyranny. When a man's \n     constitutional rights are in jeopardy, the violation, even \n     cloaked in the time-honored protective shroud of national \n     security, is simply intolerable.\n\n  Colson served 7 months in jail before the court reduced his sentence \nto time served.\n  Now, what did Ken Bacon do?\n  Let's go to the Washington Post of May 22, 1998:\n\n       The Pentagon's chief spokesman (Ken Bacon) apologized today \n     for authorizing the release to a reporter of information \n     contained in Linda R. Tripp's 1987 security clearance form, \n     saying, ``In retrospect, I'm sorry the incident occurred.''\n       Bacon's remarks came after he acknowledged in a deposition \n     last Friday that he provided the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer \n     with the Tripp information.\n\n  So, in other words, he admitted it. There is no question about \nwhether or not he committed this crime. There is no doubt about it, no \ndispute about it.\n  Bacon said:\n\n       I'm sorry that I did not check with our lawyers or check \n     with Linda Tripp's lawyers about this.\n\n  Sorry? Sorry didn't cut it for Chuck Colson. Colson committed his \ncrime in July of 1971. He admitted his guilt and pleaded guilty on June \n3, 1974, and was sentenced to jail June 21, 1974.\n  Bacon committed his crime in March 1998. He admitted what he had done \nin June of 1998. The Pentagon inspector general referred the matter for \ncriminal prosecution in July of 1998. So now, 2 years later, in April \nof 2000, the Clinton Justice Department says it is going to take a \npass, hoping nobody will see or care at this late date.\n  Colson went to jail and served time in prison. If there was justice, \nan equal application of the law, Bacon would also go to jail and serve \ntime in prison.\n  Is this the first time the Clinton administration has been involved \nin lawbreaking and corruption? Hardly. It has almost become a way of \nlife: Travelgate, Filegate, Buddhist Temple fundraisers, illegal \nforeign campaign contributions, the compromise of high-technology \nnuclear secrets to China, not to mention perjury and obstruction of \njustice--the list goes on and on.\n  Why is any of this important? It is all about a concept that is basic \nto America, a concept as basic as going to church on Sunday. That \nconcept is: Equal application of the law.\n  Only the media can ultimately protect this fundamental principle by \ninforming the people about what is happening. If the people do not \nknow, of course, they will not care. The role of the media is critical \nin protecting our liberties. So again, I appeal to the media to cover \nthis story, not to cover up this story.\n  Does anyone care? I believe the American people care. But they must \nbe informed first.\n  Let me conclude by recalling the words of Chuck Colson. In writing \nabout his own case, he said:\n\n       I pleaded guilty after being told by Watergate prosecutor \n     Leon Jaworski that my conviction would deter such a thing \n     from [ever] happening again.\n\n  So I am here today to tell the American people, it just happened \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2508-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2508-S2517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF ACT OF 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the centerpiece of our \nefforts to reduce the tax overpayment by America's families. The \nMarriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 delivers savings to virtually \nevery married couple in America. And it does so within the context of \nfiscal discipline and preserving the Social Security surplus.\n  The importance of this measure cannot be overstated. According to the \nmost recent CBO estimates, in 1999, 43 percent of married couples--\nabout 22 million couples--faced the marriage tax penalty. The average \npenalty was $1,480 per couple. This was levied on individuals who are \nalready overburdened with expenses--the costs associated with buying \nhomes, paying for education, raising children, and building financial \nsecurity for retirement.\n  It isn't fair, Mr. President. It isn't fair that when two individuals \nmarry their combined tax liability becomes greater than if they had \nremained single and continued to pay taxes at their single rate. But \nunfortunately, this has been the case--to one degree or another--for \nmore than 30 years.\n  Now it's time for a change.\n  It's time to restore equity--to bring balance and fairness into the \ntax equation for these married couples. This, of course, is not as \nsimple as it might appear. Our tax system has tried to balance three \ndisparate goals--progressivity, equal treatment of married couples, and \nmarriage neutrality. And it is impossible to achieve all three \nprinciples at the same time.\n  The principle of progressivity holds that taxpayers with higher \nincomes should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The \nprinciple of equal treatment of married couples holds that households \nwith the same amount of income should pay the same level of tax. And \nthe principle of marriage neutrality holds that a couple's income tax \nbill should not depend on their marital status. The tax code should \nneither provide an incentive nor a disincentive for two people to get \nmarried.\n  Our policy response differs depending on how we balance these \ndifferent principles. For instance, if we want to ensure that when two \nsingles get married their total tax bill will not rise--but we do not \nmind if two married couples with the same overall income level are \ntreated differently, then we arrive at one result. However, if we want \nto make sure that two singles who marry do not face increased taxes--\nand we want to make sure that two married couples with the same income \nlevel are treated evenly--then we arrive at a different result.\n  Last year, the Senate position in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 \nembraced the first policy result. We focused on the difference between \nwhat two spouses would pay in taxes if they were single versus what \nthey would pay in taxes if they were married. In order to fully address \nthat problem, we developed a system whereby a married couple would have \nan option. The couple could continue to file a joint return using the \nexisting schedule of married filing jointly. Or the couple could choose \nto file a joint return using the separate schedules for single \ntaxpayers. It was straightforward, and it was universal--we did not try \nto impose arbitrary income limits to cut off the relief.\n  As I said last year, this approach had a lot of good things about it. \nMost importantly, I liked the way that it basically eliminated the \nmarriage penalty for all taxpayers who suffered from it. It delivered \nrelief to those in the lowest brackets as well as to those in the \nhighest brackets. It also delivered relief to those who itemized their \ndeductions as well as those who took the standard deduction.\n  Nevertheless, I did not propose, or support, the separate filing plan \nthis year. As the Chairman of the Finance\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nCommittee, I am responsible for developing tax policy in a rational \nmanner. I am also responsible for working with members of my Committee \nand of the full Senate.\n  After listening to my colleagues' views on marriage tax relief, I \ncame to the conclusion that the best approach at this time is to build \non the foundation that Congress has already approved. Last year, in the \nconference report of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999, the Congress \nadopted three components of marriage penalty relief. These include an \nexpansion of the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly; \na widening of the tax brackets; and an increase in the income phase-\nouts for the earned income credit. A different part of the bill also \naddressed the minimum tax issue. This year, the House passed a marriage \npenalty tax bill that included the first three components.\n  And the Finance Committee bill, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act \nof 2000, has built on this foundation. Under current law, for the year \n2000, the standard deduction for a single taxpayer is $4,400. The \nstandard deduction for a married couple filing a joint return is \n$7,350. That means that for couples who use a standard deduction--and \nthose are generally low and middle income couples--they are losing \n$1,450 in extra deductions each year. At a 28% tax rate, that lost \ndeduction translates into an extra tax liability of $406 each and every \nyear.\n  The Finance Committee bill increases the standard deduction for \nmarried couples so that it is twice the size of the standard deduction \nfor singles. And we do that immediately, for the 2001 tax year. When \nfully effective, this provision provides tax relief to approximately 25 \nmillion couples filing joint returns, including more than 6 million \nreturns filed by senior citizens.\n  Increasing the standard deduction also has the added benefit of \nsimplifying the tax code. Approximately 3 million couples who currently \nitemize their deductions will realize the simplification benefits of \nusing the standard deduction.\n  Second, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 addresses the \ncause of the greatest dollar amount of the marriage tax penalty--the \nstructure of the rate brackets. Under current law, the 15% rate bracket \nfor single filers ends at taxable income of $26,250. The 15% rate \nbracket for married couples filing jointly ends with taxable income of \n$43,850, which you can see is less than the sum of two times the single \nrate bracket. In practical terms, that means that when two individuals \nwho each earn $30,000 get married and file a joint tax return, $8,650 \nof their income is taxed at the 28% rate rather than at the 15% rate \nthat the income would have been subject to if they had remained single. \nThe extra tax liability for that couple each year comes out to $1,125.\n  The Finance Committee bill remedies that fundamental unfairness. The \nbill adjusts the end point of the 15% rate bracket for married couples \nso that it is twice the sum of the end point of the bracket for single \nfilers. Recognizing that the rate structure hurts married couples in \nthe higher brackets, the bill also adjusts the end points of the 28% \nrate bracket as well.\n  When fully effective, and we make that happen a year earlier than the \nHouse, this provision will provide tax relief to approximately 21 \nmillion couples filing joint returns, including more than 4 million \nreturns filed by senior citizens.\n  Third, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 addresses the \nbiggest source of the marriage tax penalty for low income, working \nfamilies--the earned income credit. This complicated credit is \ndetermined by using a schedule for the number of qualifying children, \nand then multiplying the credit rate by the taxpayer's earned income up \nto a certain amount. The credit is phased out above certain income \nlevels. What that means is that two people who are each receiving the \nearned income credit as singles may lose all or some of their credit \nwhen they get married.\n  In order to address that problem, the Finance Committee bill \nincreases the beginning and ending points of the income levels of the \nphase-out of the credit for married couples filing a joint return. For \na couple with two or more qualifying children, this could mean as much \nas $526 in extra credit. This provision would also expand the number of \nmarried couples who would be eligible for the credit. It will help over \none million families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the majority has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Parliamentary inquiry: I didn't think there was any time \nlimit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement, \nthe time between 3 and 4 o'clock was equally divided between the \nmajority and the minority, or their designees. The Senator from Montana \nhas 29 minutes.\n  Does the Senator from Montana have a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I offer a unanimous consent request, if I \nmay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may present the request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Chair restated the agreement, as I \nunderstood it, correctly. But I don't think the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Roth from Delaware, was on the floor when that \nunanimous consent was propounded and agreed to. He was unaware of the \ntime constraint. I think it is only fair, frankly, that the Senator \nfrom Delaware be able to present his views. I am willing to yield as \nmuch time as I have to the Senator. How much does the Senator need?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would say 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Ten minutes. Fine, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I would not want to give away 10 minutes of time from this side \nbecause there are others who want to speak and are counting on the \nminutes. I have no problem doing a unanimous consent request giving the \nSenator an additional 10 minutes. But I would like to retain 30 minutes \nof time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no unanimous consent request. The \ntime was under the control of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nextended to 10 minutes after 4 p.m. and that this side have 29 \nminutes--whatever it is--and the remainder of time be allotted to the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I have a parliamentary question. It was my understanding \nthat Senator Inhofe was speaking as if in morning business. Does that \ntime count?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe that is the source of the \nmisunderstanding. Senator Inhofe did speak as if in morning business. \nHowever, the unanimous consent request was that the time between 3 and \n4 be allocated equally. Therefore, I believe the unanimous consent \nrequest just propounded by the Senator from Montana would probably very \nclosely correct that misunderstanding. I believe all of us were \noperating under that understanding.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the time allocation \nbetween now and 10 minutes after 4 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocation at this time is 10 minutes \nto the majority and 29 minutes remaining for the minority.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, finally, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act \nof 2000 tries to make sure that families can continue to receive the \nfamily tax credits that Congress has enacted over the past several \nyears. Each year, an increasing number of American families are finding \nthat their family tax credits--such as the child credit and the Hope \nScholarship education credit--are being cut back or eliminated because \nof the alternative minimum tax. Last year, Congress made a small down-\npayment on this problem, temporarily carving out these family tax \ncredits from the minimum tax calculations. This year, we are building \non that bipartisan approach, by permanently extending the preservation \nof the family tax credits.\n  Because of this provision, millions of taxpayers will no longer face \nthe burden of calculating the alternative minimum tax.\n  In making the changes that I have just described--whether it is the \nchange in the rate brackets or the change in the earned income credit--\nwe have tried to meet an important objective. That goal, which I talked \nabout\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nearlier, is to treat all married couples with the same amount of income \nequally. It is a principle that is ignored by using a combined return \nwith separate schedules or by using a second earner deduction. With the \nSenate Finance Committee bill, we do not create a new, so-called \n``homemaker penalty.'' Our bill ensures that simply because a family \nhas only one wage earner, it is not treated any differently than a \nfamily where both spouses work. Many people have argued that tax policy \nshould not discourage one parent from staying at home and raising the \nfamily. It is a laudable goal and one that I support.\n  How much does this marriage tax penalty relief help? It helps a lot. \nOver forty million families will get marriage tax relief under this \nlegislation. In my state of Delaware, over 100,000 families will \nbenefit. Every family earning over $10,000 per year will see their tax \nbill fall at least one percent--except those at high income levels. The \nkey to this legislation is that it helps the middle class. Sixty \npercent of this bill's tax relief goes to those families making \n$100,000 or less.\n  Who are these people? They're two married civil engineers, or a \npharmacist who is married to a school teacher. They're the policeman \nand his wife who runs a small gift shop in Dover. They are the \nfirefighter who is married to a social worker, or a librarian who is \nmarried to an accountant. These are the families who will benefit.\n  And they will benefit even more, as you examine the impact this tax \nrelief will have over time. Consider the effect if these tax savings \nwere put away for their children's education and retirement. If a \ncouple with two children making just $30,000 took their tax savings \nfrom this bill and put it into an education savings account like the \none recently passed by the Senate, they would have $40,000 for those \nchildren's college education. Based on the stock market's historical \nrate of return, that's $40,000 if they did not set aside another penny! \nIf the family was that of two elementary school teachers with two \nchildren and earning average salaries of $70,000 combined, they would \nhave $65,000 after 18 years.\n  If those two married school teachers then started to put their tax \nsavings from this bill into a Roth IRA after 18 years, this same couple \nwould have $224,100 when they retired 27 years later.\n  By transforming these tax savings into personal savings, we see that \nthese real tax savings translate into real opportunities for these \nfamilies.\n  And consider the effect on the economy. According to an analysis by \nthe Heritage Foundation, when fully phased-in this marriage tax penalty \nrelief legislation will result in 820,000 additional jobs. It will \nincrease the personal savings rate by three-tenths of a percent, which \nin turn will lower interest rates. It also increase investment by $20 \nbillion and gross domestic product by $54 billion. So not only do \nmarried families gain, not only do their children gain, but the entire \ncountry gains. They gain more jobs, better jobs, and higher wages \nbecause of this marriage tax relief legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, the marriage tax relief legislation I bring to the \nfloor today amounts to just five percent of the total budget surplus \nover the next five years. It amounts to just 17.6 percent of the non-\nSocial Security surplus over the next five years. It amounts to just 42 \npercent of the new spending provided for in this year's budget over the \nnext five years. Finally, it amounts to less than half of the tax cut \nthat has been allotted to the Finance Committee for tax cuts over the \nnext five years in this year's budget. By any comparison or estimation, \nthis marriage tax penalty relief is fiscally responsible.\n  This bill does all these things for America's working families while \npreserving every cent of Social Security's surplus. These tax cuts do \nnot have to pit America's families against America's seniors. Nor does \nit extend a tax cut in a fiscally irresponsible manner. These tax cuts \nfit in this year's budget, along with the other Republican priorities \nthat we have already passed for education, health care, and small \nbusinesses. Our priorities add up to what's good for America, and our \nnumbers add up to what's fiscally responsible.\n  It is time we divorce the marriage penalty from the tax code once and \nfor all. I urge all my colleagues to support the Marriage Tax Penalty \nRelief Act of 2000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The so-called marriage penalty is not a penalty. It is the result of \nthe code. Nobody in Congress decided we were going to penalize married \ncouples by making changes in the Tax Code so that married couples would \npay more than two singles would pay with their respective incomes.\n  It is not a penalty in the sense of anyone ever thought of harming \nanybody. Rather, this is a consequence of the complexity of the Tax \nCode. It is a consequence of the mathematical impossibility of trying \nto do all things for all people. Most Americans want a progressive tax \nrate so married couples who have the same income, regardless of who \nearns the income, and how much, are taxed the same; in addition to \nthat, have marriage neutrality so married couples do not have to pay \nmore than singles.\n  It is impossible to do all three. Therefore, the Congress has to make \nchoices and judgments according to what it thinks makes the most sense.\n  A little history would be instructive. When the income tax was first \nenacted, individuals were treated as a taxable unit, regardless of \nwhether they were married or not. If a person had $50,000 in income, he \nor she paid taxes on that $50,000. If he or she married and that person \nhad zero income, that individual who earned the income would still be \ntreated as the taxable entity and his spouse would not, regardless how \nmuch the spouse earned. That was the rule for quite a few years.\n  The problem arose in community property States when the couples could \nsplit the income because whatever the major wage earner earned was \ncommunity property and therefore could be split. Courts upheld that.\n\n  A little later, Congress thought if that was the case in community \nproperty States, it should be the case all around the country.\n  Congress, in 1948, decided couples could split their incomes; that \nis, if the man earned $70,000 and his wife earned zero, they combined, \nand they each paid on $35,000. That was the law in 1948. That helped \nmarried couples. The trouble was, it hurt singles. In 1969, the \ndisparity was so great, in some cases a single taxpayer could be paying \n42 percent more in income taxes than a couple would pay with the same \nincome.\n  Congress thought that was not right. They came up with different \nrates--one set of rates for singles and another set of rates for \nmarried couples--and set the proportion of about 60 percent so that \nindividuals would not have to pay up to twice as much as what they \notherwise would pay. That has been the law ever since, although we have \nmade some changes. In 1981, there was a deduction for the lower earner \nof a couple, to try to address the marriage penalty; that was changed, \nand another inequity came with the tax bill passed in 1993.\n  We are trying to figure out today a solution to be fair to most \npeople. There has been a big demographic shift in our country since \n1969. There are a lot more couples who both earn income, many more now \nthan was the case in 1969.\n  It is important to note that although there is a marriage penalty, \nthere is also a marriage bonus. More married couples receive a bonus \nwhen they get married than receive a penalty. It is pretty close. About \n51 percent of Americans, because they are married, receive a bonus. Say \nthe husband earns quite a bit more than his spouse, or vice versa; when \nthey get married, they get a bonus. The penalty occurs when both \nincomes are about the same. Again, more Americans receive a bonus \ntoday--not a penalty--as a consequence of getting married.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, $29 billion was \nincurred by married couples as a penalty and $33 billion was received \nby married couples as a bonus. That problem has emerged because of the \nshifting demographic characteristics of our country, with both man and \nwife now having earned income at equal levels. The more equal the \nearnings of the spouses, the more likely a marriage penalty will occur.\n  The proportion of working-age married couples with two earners grew \nfrom 48 percent in 1969 to 72 percent in\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\n1995. Also, we have seen a rise in the quality of income of married \ncouples. In 1969, only 17 percent of the households of married couples \nhad both spouses contributing at least one-third to the income of the \nhousehold, but by 1995 that number increased to 34 percent. In the same \nperiod, the percentage of households where one or neither spouse has \nearnings decreased from 52 percent to 28 percent.\n  Without these shifts, more married couples would receive marriage \nbonuses with few marriage penalties. The unintended problem which has \nemerged is that half of married couples incur this so-called penalty. \nThe question is, what do we do? The Finance Committee bill reported out \nby the majority of the committee is a good-faith effort to try to \naddress the problem.\n  It is only fair to point out, there are significant, in my judgment, \nflaws with the bill that came out of committee. As a consequence, the \nDemocrats will have an alternative which we think addresses a lot of \nthe flaws.\n  What are the flaws? First, one of the big flaws is it is very \ncomplex. It adds additional complexity to the code. We all know the \ncode is complex enough as it is. This adds even more complexity. The \nstandard deduction for married couples is double; the brackets are the \n15-percent bracket, the 28-percent bracket, double for marrieds. That \nis a change in the code. The earned-income tax credit ``phased ins'' \nand ``phased outs'' are changed from current law. AMT personal credits \nare exempted in certain areas but not in others. It adds considerable \nnew complexity to the code. I am not saying it is fatal to the proposal \nreported out by the Finance Committee, but it is a fact it adds \nadditional complexities compared with current law.\n  Second, I think it is important to point out there are real problems \nwith the amount and size of the proposal. It is fiscally irresponsible. \nIt is going to cost a lot of money at a time when I think most \nAmericans want to pay down the national debt.\n\n  When I talk to people around my State of Montana, and I talk to \nSenators from around the country, they tell me when they talk to their \npeople at home they pose the choice: Do you want to use the surplus \nthat we have, wonderfully, now, in the United States of America to pay \ndown the debt or do you want to use the surplus to lower taxes? I will \nnot say dramatically, but I will say overwhelmingly it is my \nexperience, and I think it is the experience of most Members of the \nHouse and Senate when they ask that question, the answer is: Pay down \nthe debt. Americans today would rather pay down the debt.\n  Why? Because they are innately smart; they have a sense of things. We \nall trust the good faith and good common sense of the American people. \nThere is a conservative element that says: Here we are in times of \ngreat national prosperity. We have big budget surpluses. It probably \nmakes sense to start paying down that $7 trillion national debt. We may \nnot have this opportunity again. We would like to think we will, and we \nhope we will, but we do not know we will. So first I think people want \nto pay down the debt.\n  The proposal now on the floor is quite large. In fact, the costs for \nmore than half the benefits of this bill go to married taxpayers who \nare already in a bonus situation.\n  I will state that a different way. More than half of the costs of \nthis bill do not address the marriage penalty problem at all because \nthe lower tax is given to married couples who are already at a bonus \nsituation. They get the bonus because they are married. This bill says: \nYou already have a bonus. We are not going to give you more.\n  The point, I thought, was to address the penalty situation; to try to \ncorrect the problem where people, when they get married, pay more taxes \nas a couple than they would pay individually. That is the problem we \nare trying to address. The Finance Committee bill addresses a part of \nthat, but more than half of the cost of that Finance Committee bill \ndoes not. It does something else. Even the other portion, which \npurports to address the marriage penalty, does not totally. There are \nlots of areas in the code where the marriage penalty would still exist. \nWhere are they? In about 62 parts of the code.\n  There are 65 provisions in our income Tax Code which today create the \nso-called inequities causing bonuses for families--65. The majority \nbill, Finance Committee bill, addresses only three. There are 62 other \nprovisions in the code which cause a marriage penalty which are not \naddressed by the Finance Committee bill.\n  What are they? They are things such as the child tax credit, Social \nSecurity benefits, savings bonds for education, IRA deductions, student \nloan interest deductions, and 56 others. The adoption expense credit, \nfor example--there are couples who want to adopt kids. They get married \nand because of where they might be in the brackets, the progressive \nrates, they may find themselves paying a penalty because they are \nmarried as a consequence of the adoption expenses credit--or perhaps \nsome of the others. So it is a fiscally irresponsible bill. More than \nhalf does not address the problem. Rather, it is given to people who \nalready have a bonus--not a penalty but a bonus. The remaining part is \nskewed. A good part of it does go to address the problem, but in 62 \ncases inequities, disparities, and penalties still exist.\n\n  In addition, about 5 million additional taxpayers will become subject \nto the alternative income tax as a consequence of the majority bill. I \ndo not think we want that. We have all heard the problems created by \nthe alternative minimum tax, the AMT. It is getting to be more and more \nof a problem as Americans earn a little more income and therefore they \nare more likely to be subject to that, the alternative minimum tax, \nwhich hits a lot of taxpayers pretty hard. As a consequence of the \nmajority committee bill, about a million American taxpayers will now \nbecome subject to the alternative minimum tax.\n  So what is a better approach? Speaking generally, we think a better \napproach is to do something very simple. It has the elegance of \nsimplicity--people can understand it--and it is more fair. What is it? \nEssentially, we say to a married couple: You have your choice. File \njointly or file separately. It is your choice. You just do whatever you \nwant to do. Presumably, you will pick the choice that results in a \nlower income tax for you.\n  What could be simpler? It is simple to the people of America to \nexplain it to them so they can understand it. It does not add \nadditional complexities that are in the majority bill, but rather it is \nsomething very simple. You say to a couple: We don't care what your \ntotal income is, we don't care how it is distributed, whether the wife \nmakes 80 percent and the husband 20 percent--it makes no difference. \nYou can have your choice. You file jointly or file separately. \nObviously, you file the return that results in the lower income tax.\n  I might add, this already is the case in many States around the \ncountry. There are about 10 States today which have just that, to \nattempt to address the marriage penalty in just that way. That is \noptional filing. It is optional to file jointly or you have the option \nto file separately in the States of Arkansas, Delaware, District of \nColumbia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, my State of Montana, \nTennessee, and Virginia. You see, the mix of States is varied. There \nare high-income States and some low-income States--that is per capita \nincome. It is geographically dispersed. But 10 States decided, for the \nsake of simplicity, or whatever the reason, that was what they wanted \nto do, and we have heard no complaints. It is an approach that works.\n  The second benefit of the Democratic alternative is this: It \naddresses all of the marriage penalties--not some of them, all of them. \nHow? By addressing all of the 65 provisions in the Tax Code today which \nresult in marriage bonus/penalty inequity. All of them. You say: How do \nyou do that without additional complexity? It is very simple--because \nof the effect of optional filing. You just file optionally, \nindividually, calculate your AMT, calculate your child adoption \nexpense, whatever it is, or jointly. And you just choose. That way we \naddress all of them.\n  I might say, the Democratic alternative is also fiscally responsible. \nWhy do I say that? Because we are focused only on the penalty part. As \nI mentioned earlier, the majority bill, the Finance Committee bill, \ngives more than half the benefits to people who already have a bonus, \nwho do not need\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nthe help. They already have a bonus. In effect, more than half this \nbill is a general tax cut bill. That is fine. But then we should call \nit what it is, a general tax cut bill more than it is a marriage tax \npenalty reduction bill. It is a general tax cut. If that is the case, \nthen we should have a debate on the code and what is the best way to \nlower taxes, to deal with taxes for all Americans. It is truth in \nlabeling. It is what we purport to be doing, and that is focusing only \non the marriage tax penalty.\n  I might also say the minority bill, the Democratic alternative, does \nnot exacerbate the singles penalty, whereas the majority bill does. \nDon't forget, we have widows, widowers, single people who need tax \nhelp, too. The majority bill in particular--but in all fairness, the \nminority bill, too--does not address singles, widows, and widowers. It \nbasically deals with married people. Think for a moment; if you are \nmarried with no kids and you are receiving the so-called marriage \nbonus, you get a tax cut in the majority bill. On the other hand, if \nyou are a single mom and you have three kids, you get no tax cut. Let \nme state that again. If you are married and have no kids, you are \nalready receiving the so-called marriage bonus, you get a tax cut under \nthe majority bill. On the other hand, under the majority bill, if you \nare a single mom and you have three kids, there is no tax cut. I do not \nthink that is fair. I do not think that is fair at all.\n  That is representative of the inequity of the bill coming out of the \nFinance Committee. It is not a marriage tax penalty bill; it is a tax \ncut. If they want a tax cut, then we should have that debate on what \nthe distribution should be, what we should do with the brackets, what \nincentives do we want to create? What disincentives do we want to \naddress?\n  The Tax Code is pretty big. There are lots of provisions of the Tax \nCode that affect people on the corporate side and the income side. If \nwe want to cut taxes, let's see how we want to focus that, how to \nmanage it, and how to tailor it. Let's call this what it really is.\n  We have other priorities we have to address. The majority bill costs \nabout $248 billion over 10 years. The minority bill is $151 billion \nover 10 years. The projected on-budget surplus for the next 10 years is \nclose to $900 billion. It is $893 billion.\n  I will list some of the tax legislation that is pending: This one is \n$248 billion; the Patients' Bill of Rights will cost about $70 billion; \nthe minimum wage bill in the House is about $122 billion; educational \nsavings is about $22 billion; debt service costs about $100 billion. \nThat means the total of the pending tax legislation is about $566 \nbillion, and what remains is for debt reduction--not very much--and for \nSocial Security and Medicare reform, which is probably not going to be \nenacted this year.\n  What about prescription drug benefits? Where does that fit in? What \nabout debt reduction and prescription drugs? There is not very much \nleft.\n  When we address the marriage tax penalty, I submit we focus on the \nproblem, and the problem is the marriage tax penalty. The problem is \nnot the marriage bonus; it is the marriage tax penalty. If we focus on \nthe problem, we will solve the problem in a more fiscally responsible \nway. That is clear.\n  Second, let's make sure the benefits go to those who are facing the \nproblem.\n  I know as this debate unfolds, some of these points will become more \nclear, but I urge Senators to think before they leap because this is a \nfairly complex problem.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I believe neither side has any \nspeakers. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator yields back the \nremainder of his time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the underlying \nbill. Shortly, I think the majority leader will be in to make a motion \non the bill.\n  First, I wish to compliment Senator Roth, in his leadership, and the \nFinance Committee, for reporting out a good bill. It is my hope we will \nbe able to pass this bill in the next couple of days to provide relief \nfrom the so-called marriage tax penalty. Married couples need relief. \nWe need to pass it.\n  I have heard the President say he is for it, although he has not come \nto the forefront. I think Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, has come up with a good proposal. I am going to talk a \nlittle about that. But I also compliment my colleague, Senator \nHutchison, who has been fighting for this for the last several years.\n  I believe this year we have a chance to make this law. I hope we will \nhave bipartisan cooperation to make it happen. I compliment the House \nfor their leadership in moving forward to make it happen.\n  The President recently invited many of us down to the White House for \nthe signing of the bill to eliminate the so-called Social Security \nearnings penalty tax. If you were a working senior between the ages of \n65 and 70, and you had an income above $17,000, for every $3 that you \nearned, you would lose $1 of Social Security. We eliminated that \npenalty. The President signed it. I am sure he was taking credit for \nit. I did not make the signing ceremony. He invited me. That was nice.\n  But we acted together. We eliminated an unfair provision in the Tax \nCode that for years many of us thought was unfair. We eliminated that. \nThat is now the law of the land.\n  Now we are looking at another provision, the so-called marriage tax \npenalty. It needs to be eliminated. It needs to be eliminated now, this \nyear, not 20 years from now, and not in some token way that is only \nverbal, as the President has proposed.\n  I believe my colleague, Senator Roth, and many of us on the Finance \nCommittee, have taken the right step to eliminate this unfair tax.\n  What we have done is, we have said we should double the 15-percent \ntax bracket for couples. It should be twice as much for couples as it \nis for an individual.\n  Many people say: What do you mean by that? Individuals who have a \ntaxable income of up to $26,000, they pay 15 percent. Above that \ntaxable income, they pay 28 percent. What we are saying is, if it is 15 \npercent for $26,000 earned by an individual, it should be twice that \namount for a couple. So a couple could have income of up to $52,500, \nand that would be taxed at 15 percent.\n  What is current law? Current law is, for a couple, the first $43,850 \nis taxed at 15 percent, and above that amount it is taxed at 28 \npercent. So there is $8,650 which is actually taxed at 28 percent. What \nis the difference? That is a difference of $1,125.\n  If you have a couple making $52,500, the bill we have before us would \noffer them relief of $1,125. That is just on the rate change.\n  We also double the standard deduction. Basically, the standard \ndeduction is $7,350. That would increase to $8,800. That is a savings \nof $218 for a couple in the 15-percent tax bracket.\n  So again, we are offering tax relief by simplifying the code, saying \nlet's double the 15-percent bracket for couples, as compared to \nindividuals. And let's double the 28-percent bracket so we provide that \nrelief through the code.\n  I think it is important. I think it is fair. I think it provides \nrelief for married couples, and it also does not penalize someone if \nthey happen to be a stay-at-home spouse. We do not discriminate against \nthem either. Maybe it is a farmer who has a spouse who does not receive \nearned income in the form of a check but yet they still work. They work \non the farm. They work on the ranch. They work raising kids. We provide \nthem a modest amount of tax relief as well.\n  I think the bill we have before us is a good bill. It is one that \nprovides tax relief for middle-income Americans. It is one that \neliminates the marriage penalty for all practical purposes so we don't \nfind discrimination in the code.\n\n  I will give a different example. You have a married couple with two \ndiffering incomes, where one income is $40,000, maybe one is taxed or \nhas income of $20,000. Let's say the $20,000 is earned by an occasional \nworker who might work one year but might not work the next year. The \npractical impact is that $20,000 is added to the $40,000 income, and \nthey are taxed at a higher bracket, the 28 percent, instead of 15 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\n  For that additional work they do under the present code, they are \npenalized by paying at their spouse's highest tax bracket. That is \ncurrent law. We want to change that. The bill we have before us does \nchange that.\n  I compliment Senator Roth. I urge my colleagues not to play games. \nLet's make this law. Let's have a signing ceremony at the White House \nin another couple of weeks. Let's have Democrats and Republicans and \neven the White House take credit for it. It is a positive change. It is \na good change. It is a needed change. It is a change that should become \nlaw this year. It is an accomplishment on which all of us can \ncongratulate ourselves and say we got something done: We eliminated the \nSocial Security earnings penalty, and we eliminated the unfair marriage \npenalty.\n  Married couples should not be penalized to the tune of $1,400 a year \nfor the fact they are married. That is a fact; that is what is \nhappening under the present law. We should eliminate that. We do that \nwith the bill that is before us today. I urge my colleagues to support \nit when we come to that time. I hope we will pass it by tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to try to be brief because I want \nSenator Hutchison and others to be able to speak.\n  I have been having some discussions with Senator Daschle trying to \nwork out an agreement as to how to proceed on amendments. We are going \nto continue to do that. We had asked for a list, a description of the \namendments they might have in mind. We don't have that yet. I assume it \nis just a physical problem for right now. We will continue to discuss \nthat and see if there is a way we can come to an agreement that will \nallow us to vitiate cloture, but we need to go on with the debate.\n  We have Senators here ready to speak. We have the chairman of the \ncommittee here who would like to get on record on this issue. So we \ncould go ahead and have cloture filed so, if necessary, we would have a \nvote on cloture on Thursday, but we could go ahead then with debate \nonly. While we are doing that, we can continue to have discussions \nabout how we can work out an agreement.\n  Let me emphasize again, I think we can work out an agreement that \nwould allow for a substitute to be offered, or substitutes for that \nmatter, that are relevant to the marriage tax penalty. I understand \nthese amendments may relate to Medicaid. They may relate to \nprescription drugs. It may be a complete prescription drug proposal. I \ndon't know how that would be relevant or how we would have time to \nevaluate that. I fear we are headed off down a trail that is not in \nline with what I had offered or hoped for. I repeat, substitutes \nor relevant marriage penalty elimination amendments, we can work that \nout. I don't want to say what we won't do at this point. I will say we \nare going to go forward. We will continue to try to work to get a fair \nagreement.\n\n  In the end, this is the point: For 10 years we have talked about the \nunfairness of the marriage penalty tax. Ever since the Senator from \nTexas has been in the Senate--now for 6 years--she has been relentless \non the subject. So we are going to have a vote on the marriage penalty \ntax, and we are going to see who is for eliminating it and who is not.\n  I hope we can do it without getting tangled up in procedural \nquestions. If necessary, we will have a vote on cloture and we will \nknow where we are. I hope we will have the votes on cloture to cut off \nthe filibuster and then move on to the final vote. For now, I want us \nto make sure we get time this afternoon to have a good debate on this \nissue, and so I will go ahead and go through this process.\n  I am still hopeful we can reach agreement on the number of \namendments. It could be as many as three or four, it could be six, all \ndealing with the marriage tax penalty or closely relevant issues. We \nwill keep working on that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3090\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a committee amendment)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I now send to the desk an amendment on behalf of the \nFinance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion to the desk to \nthe pending bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the marriage tax \n     penalty bill:\n         Trent Lott, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Judd Gregg, Tim \n           Hutchinson, Rick Santorum, Connie Mack, Michael B. \n           Enzi, Craig Thomas, Robert F. Bennett, Chuck Grassley, \n           Jim Bunning, Gordon Smith of Oregon, Ben Nighthorse \n           Campbell, Wayne Allard, Jeff Sessions, and Bill Roth.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this cloture vote, if necessary, if it is \nnot vitiated, would occur then on Thursday of this week at a time that \nwould be announced after consultation with the leaders on both sides. \nIt is, again, my hope that we can work out an agreement that would \nprovide for full debate and discussion of amendments and swift passage \nof the bill itself. But while these negotiations are going on, I will \nstay in touch with the minority leader, and we will make sure all \nMembers are notified as to how the proceedings are going.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived and the bill be pending for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the leader has not made a request yet that \nwe be here for debate only on this bill, has he?\n  Mr. LOTT. I just did.\n  Mr. REID. Objection is made. I respectfully say to the leader, we \nbelieve, very clearly and without any equivocation, it is time we \nstarted acting like the Senate, started debating bills. We will in good \nfaith for the majority leader try to come up with a list of amendments \nwe believe should be offered. We will try to do that. In the meantime, \nwe want to start off on amendments to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, ordinarily when we file cloture, at the end \nof that proceeding we ask for the mandatory quorum under rule XXII to \nbe waived and the bill be pending for debate only so that we make use \nof the time to begin debating the substance of the bill or the \nalternatives. That has been objected to.\n  As an alternative, so we can make use of the time we have this \nafternoon--surely we can spend another hour and a half or so allowing \nSenators to discuss their positions on the marriage penalty or any \nother issue--I proposed that we go into a period for the transaction of \nmorning business.\n  I am told there may be objection to that, which kind of surprises \nme--that we will not even allow morning business to go forward so \nSenators can speak.\n  You talk about the Senate. The way the Senate works is Senators get \nto speak when they need to and want to on any subject certainly in \nmorning business.\n  But it was suggested, since that apparently was going to be objected \nto, that maybe we were ready to go forward with debate on the bill and \ndebate on the Moynihan substitute, or one of the Democratic \nsubstitutes, and that maybe you are ready to go with that.\n  In an effort to be fair and get the debate to go forward, and to \naddress one of the issues that certainly is a legitimate one--Senator \nMoynihan, and probably Senator Baucus, offered this in the Finance \nCommittee, and we talked about it, had votes on it--so we can go ahead \nand engage the discussion about what is the best way to deal with the \nmarriage penalty tax, this is a different way of doing it, and I think \nit merits being addressed by the Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be open for one amendment, the \nso-called Democratic alternative by Senator Moynihan, Senator Baucus, \nor their designee, with no other amendments or motions to commit or \nrecommit being in order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend, for whom I have the greatest respect, the majority leader, that \nthis isn't really senatorial activity. This is make-believe senatorial \nactivity. We are not really being Senators. My friend, the majority \nleader, is treating us as if we are in the House and he is the Rules \nCommittee--the one-man Rules Committee. He is now being so generous to \nus that he is saying we can offer one amendment, and he designates what \nthe amendment is. We, the minority, believe that we have rights that \nhave been developed in this body for over 200 years, and we are tired \nof playing make-believe Senators.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since objection is heard, I want to make \nsure people understand this didn't in any way foreclose any other \nagreement that might be involved with making other amendments in order \nand having amendments considered. I presume there will be other \namendments that are relevant on the marriage tax penalty provision--I \nassume on the Democratic side and perhaps on this side, also. This \ndoesn't foreclose any agreement. All I am trying to do is to facilitate \nthe debate and discussion on this very important piece of legislation.\n  There was an indication from the Democratic side that you were \ninterested in going forward with your\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\namendment or amendments, and the one that was clearly identifiable is \nthe one that had been offered in the Finance Committee as an \nalternative on how to proceed. I certainly don't feel as if that is \nforeclosing any Senators the opportunity to be heard and to offer \namendments. But objection has been heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to yield, but let me finish this.\n  I offered to have a period for the transaction of morning business \nwith Senators to talk about any subject they chose. It could be the gas \ntax bill. It could be the budget resolution. It could be stock options. \nIt could be anything. That has been objected to, which I find highly \nunusual.\n  Then I offered, to try to accommodate what I thought may be a way to \nget the debate started and some progress to be made, to go with the \nDemocratic alternative.\n  Again, in terms of one-man action here, all I am trying to do is to \nget debate on this very important issue, the marriage penalty tax.\n  Does the Senate want to have a debate and vote on that or not? We \nhave been talking about it for years. Now we are up to the point where \nwe would like to go forward. We haven't been able to get a list of \namendments or enter into an agreement. But I am still hopeful we will \nbe able to get a list of amendments and agree to proceed. But I was \ntrying to go ahead and protect our rights to file cloture, if it is \nneeded, on Thursday. That is being objected to.\n  Does Senator Dorgan wish me to yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Obviously, Senator Daschle would like to propound a \nquestion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield to Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say that I talked briefly to the \nmajority leader about an hour or so ago. He made the request at that \ntime for a list of our amendments. I must say I want to accommodate the \nmajority leader. But here we are on a bill of some consequence, a bill \nthat has not yet had any time for debate on the Senate floor. It was \nthe subject of good consideration and discussion in the committee. But \nnow, on the very first day, we are on this bill on the Senate floor and \ncloture has been filed. We don't object to proceeding to the bill. That \nwas done by unanimous consent. But now the majority leader has chosen \nalready to file cloture on the bill. I remind my colleagues that filing \ncloture is to end the debate. Once again, for the second time in the \nsame day, we are ending debate before it even begins.\n  We don't want to hold up a good debate and a good discussion with \nsome other ideas with regard to how to proceed on the marriage tax \npenalty. We can do that. But a good debate entails offering \nalternatives, other ideas, and other suggestions.\n  All we are simply saying is, why don't we have the opportunity to \noffer some amendment? Let's lay down the amendments. Let's get on with \nit. But what the majority seems to be saying is we will not have the \ndebate at all. We will move on to morning business, if we can't have a \nlist of amendments defined and specified prior to the time the debate \neven begins.\n  I am sure the majority leader can empathize with our frustration at \nbeing given yet another situation where we do not have the opportunity \nto have that debate, and we are closing the debate before it even \nstarts.\n\n  I will work with the majority leader. We will see if we can't come up \nwith a list. We want to pass marriage penalty reduction, but we think \nwe can do it in ways that aren't as costly and that could be a lot more \nfocused. We will deal with that.\n  But I am disappointed, frankly, that we aren't able to offer \namendments. That is why the objection is made to the request made by \nthe majority leader.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senator Daschle wasn't on the floor. \nI was hoping we could maybe mark a little time until he got here. He \nmay not be aware that we asked when we filed the cloture that the \nmandatory quorum under the rule be waived and the bill be pending for \ndebate only. And there was objection to that.\n  Then I suggested a period for the transaction of morning business \nbecause there are Senators who may want to speak on this or any other \nsubject. That was objected to.\n  Then I suggested we go to the Democratic substitute offered by \nSenator Moynihan and others and begin debate on that, which I thought \nwas a good usage of time; It didn't foreclose other amendments being \noffered or agreed to at a later point.\n  Perhaps others in his stead were trying to make a point. But my point \nis that I want us to have time for debate. I want us to use this \nafternoon and tomorrow. For those who may not be aware, when I file \ncloture, all I am doing is protecting our right to have a vote on \nending the filibuster, which doesn't ripen for 2 days. We could and \nwould be having debate this afternoon and all day Wednesday. If we work \nout an agreement on a list of amendments, we could vitiate that at any \ntime.\n  I note we have already done that several times this year. In fact, in \nthe first of the year we vitiated the cloture I had filed on the \neducation savings account legislation, as I recall. Several times we \nhave done it as a protection to make sure we get a vote before the \nweek's end. But we wound up working something out and thought we didn't \nneed to do it. I am hoping that is what will happen here.\n  But also, if I don't do it now this afternoon, since we haven't \ngotten a list of the amendments, this is not a surprise. It has been \naround a long time. Everybody knew the marriage tax penalty would be \ncoming up this week. The Finance Committee marked it up a couple weeks \nago.\n\n  Any Member who had or has amendments probably had an idea of what \nthey wanted to do. We have not asked to be given the final amendment, \nbut to be given at least some descriptive paragraph as to what the \namendments might do before we enter into an agreement.\n  If I didn't file cloture and we went out of session Thursday night, \nif we completed our business, completed the stock options bill and \ncompleted the budget resolution conference report and went out Thursday \nnight, if I didn't file cloture now but waited until tomorrow, if we \ncouldn't reach an agreement, then the marriage penalty issue would not \nhave come up until after the recess.\n  I worked on my income tax last night and I am not in a happy mood \nabout taxes. I know a lot of other people, coming up on April 15, would \nlike to know the marriage tax penalty at last will be coming to an end \nin whatever form, either by a formula developed by the Finance \nCommittee majority, Senator Moynihan, or others.\n  I emphasize for those who may not be aware of all the Senate rules, \nwe have to file cloture now to be assured to have a vote on that by \nThursday. I will work with Senator Daschle. We have worked out some \npretty thorny issues and some knots in the past that looked as if they \nwere unsolvable and we were able to agree and move to a final \nconclusion. I hope we can do that.\n  We do not want to get far afield and start debating Medicaid issues, \nMedicaid reforms, which the Finance Committee has never considered--or \nsomebody suggested a complete prescription drug package--without \noverall Medicare reform and without looking at the details of that \npackage. I understand it may be a pretty detailed package, but the \namendment may not be ready. How can we possibly agree to an amendment \nwhen we are not even sure of its structure, let alone what the details \nare. Maybe by tomorrow that amendment will be available and we can take \na look at it and other amendments and maybe come to an agreement to get \nto a conclusion sometime tomorrow during the day, tomorrow night, or \nThursday.\n  Senator Hutchison has been very patiently waiting. She has put a lot \ninto this. I yield for a question or comment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader to yield for \na question.\n  I am confused. It appears the distinguished deputy minority leader \nsuggested you were not conducting the Senate like the Senate. Yet you \nhave offered to go forward on the bill, you have offered to have the \nDemocratic amendment that is a substitute come forward, and you have \noffered to go into morning business so that no one is obligated.\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\n  The alternative, it seems to me, is to shut down the Senate entirely. \nI don't think that is conducting the business of the Senate as the \nSenate should be conducted.\n  I ask the distinguished leader, does it appear that the distinguished \ngroup from the minority doesn't want to debate the marriage tax penalty \nat all and would prefer to shut down the Senate rather than talk about \nthis very important tax correction for the hard-working people of this \ncountry?\n  Mr. LOTT. If we can't get an agreement to have consideration of \namendments or to have general debate or to have a morning business \nopportunity, the only other option I have now is to move to close the \nSenate for the day.\n\n  I hope we can find some way to work that out.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to my friend from Texas, I think maybe \nwe have watched the Senate operate the way it is not supposed to for so \nlong, we think the way it has operated the past year is the way it is \nsupposed to operate. The way the Senate is supposed to operate is when \nbringing a piece of legislation to the floor, it is open for debate and \namendment--not morning business, not debate only.\n  We have the opportunity under the Standing Rules of the Senate to \noffer amendments to pieces of legislation. That is all we are asking. \nWe have been here for some time. This session of Congress is about \nover. We have had two opportunities to offer amendments to pieces of \nlegislation, two amendments that were agreed upon by our distinguished \nmajority leader, and also the ad hoc chairman of the Rules Committee in \nthe Senate.\n  I think it is time we have legislation brought to this floor and we \ntreat it the way the Senate has always treated it for 200-plus years.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to Senator Reid's \ncomments and will yield further to Senator Hutchison, I believe just \nlast week we had the budget resolution, and we had well over 100 \namendments. Some of them were voted on, some of them were accepted, \nsome of them were voted on in the vote-arama. A number of them didn't \nrelate to the budget for the year. Everything imaginable was thrown in. \nI don't think Senators have felt as if they haven't had a chance to \noffer amendments on any kind of extraneous matter.\n  This issue of the marriage tax penalty is clear and understandable: \nAre Members for it or against it?\n  I fear my colleagues on the Democratic side are trying to change the \nsubject. I cannot believe they don't want to eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty. Let's have a full debate, let's have amendments on the \nmarriage penalty. But to get off into every other possible issue as a \nway to try to distract attention from doing what the American people \nsupport overwhelmingly, I don't understand that.\n  I think what we are trying to do makes good, common sense. Let's have \na full debate on the issue. Let's have relevant amendments. There are a \nlot of amendments that could be construed as being relevant.\n  I remember the Democrats came up with a way to offer a gun amendment \nto the education savings account, as I recall. They went way around the \ncorner to get it done, but we had a vote on it, and we moved on.\n  Senator Hutchison wants to comment or ask a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was going to ask the distinguished leader if the \ncomments made are correct that he has approved every amendment that \ncame forward. It seems to me we have voted on a number of amendments \nthat wouldn't have been the choice of the majority leader, but the \nmajority leader has tried to accommodate the minority. I can't think of \nanything we haven't voted on this year. Frankly, I can't think of one \nissue that we haven't addressed, whether we wanted to or not.\n  The idea being put forward that somehow the majority leader is \nrunning the Senate as if it is under his control, I think, is so far \nout of bounds it is almost laughable. I hope we could at least have \nmorning business to talk about whatever issues Members want to discuss.\n\n  I want to talk about the marriage tax penalty. My distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois wants to talk about organ transplants. I can't \nimagine why the distinguished minority would object to morning business \nso Members from his side and Members from our side could talk until, \nhopefully, the majority and minority leader are able to come to an \nagreement on some kind of reasonable timetable so we can enact marriage \ntax penalty relief for the 21 million American couples who pay a \npenalty, who are going to be writing their checks to the U.S. \nGovernment this week, realizing they are paying $800, $1,000, $1,400 or \nmore just because they are married and because the Tax Code clearly has \nan inequity that we have the ability to address.\n  We can have legitimate disagreements on this issue. If we are going \nto have irrelevant amendments, I ask the American people to look at the \nissue for what it is. Let Members debate, let Members talk about our \ndifferences on the issue. I hope the distinguished minority won't shut \ndown the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for her comments.\n  Let me add, perhaps it is just that Senator Daschle and the Democrats \nneed more time to work on amendments and to get to our side some \ndescription of the amendments. Maybe we can go ahead and go out \ntonight. That way, we have the rest of the evening and the night to \nwork on amendments and pick up again tomorrow.\n  I am trying to find a way to keep the discussion going. We could use \nanother hour or so to debate this or other issues.\n  If we can think of a way to do that, I am open to considering other \noptions.\n  I indicated to Senator Dorgan I would yield to him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the majority leader yielding. I want to make \nan observation with the question: As I understand, the majority leader \nhas sent to the desk two cloture motions, one on the underlying bill \nand one on the substitute, for purposes, as he described, to shut off a \nfilibuster which I suggest does not exist. That is all right. That is \nwithin the rules. We have all read the rule book in the Senate.\n\n  Circumstances in the Senate should exist in the following manner. You \nbring a piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate. Every Senator \nhere has a desk. You come here and you have certain rights and certain \nopportunities. One of those is to offer an amendment to legislation \nbrought before the Senate. As I understand the Senator from \nMississippi, he is saying he wants to see amendments Senators are going \nto offer. He would like to see them before he makes a judgment about \nwhether in fact they will be allowed to be offered.\n  I say the reason there is a substantial amount of anxiety building up \nin this Senate is that people were not elected from various States to \nsay: Go and do your thing in the Senate under the rules, and, by the \nway, we would like the majority leader to decide which amendments you \noffer shall be in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to that particular point, \nit is a common practice around here, as I am sure the Senator knows, to \ngive the courtesy of identifying what amendments we have and even the \namendments. We are not asking to see the amendments. We are asking to \nhave some idea of the general parameters of what is being proposed.\n  I do not believe that is asking too much. We do that for each other. \nSenator Daschle wants to see what we want to offer, and we want to see \nwhat you want to offer. That is a common practice around here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Except, if the majority leader will yield further, that \nis not what you are trying to do. What you have indicated is you want \nto limit the amendments. It is not a case of being curious to see what \nwe are going to offer. This goes on bill after bill after bill that is \nbrought to the Senate. You want to limit the amendments.\n  My point is this. When we deal with legislation on the floor of the \nSenate, everyone here has a right, it seems to me, to come and offer \namendments and have a debate on them. You have just filed two cloture \nmotions to shut off debate on a filibuster that doesn't exist. This \nhappens time and time again, and we are getting tired of it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I can understand the Senator's frustration. Also, I am sure \nhe can understand that, as the majority leader, I have to pay attention \nto the schedule, the time that is available,\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\nand the fact that there are, I think, an overwhelming number of \nAmericans--and Senators--who would like to get this marriage tax \npenalty removed from the Tax Code.\n  This is the week we can do it. When we come back, we will have other \nimportant issues to deal with: The agriculture sanctions issue; we have \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act; we have appropriations \nbills; we have the China permanent trade status--we have a long list of \nthings we need to try to do. We have not said it has to be three or \nsix, but we are saying we would like to see what we are talking about.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I make a suggestion then?\n  Mr. LOTT. What is really at stake is, once again, we want to get the \nmarriage tax penalty eliminated. We can talk schedules, procedures, \nrules, quorums, and all the other stuff into which the Senate gets \ncaught.\n  On occasion, I hear from my mother. She says: You know, what is all \nthat stuff you all talk about up there, all those rules and all the \nextraneous things? Get to the point.\n  The point is, we want to get rid of the marriage tax penalty. Let's \nsee if we can find a way to do that this week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I offer a suggestion, briefly? Discussion earlier \nwas, by Senator Reid: Why do we not just have it open for amendment? \nThe leader objected to that. You did not want that to happen. Why don't \nwe proceed and have it open for amendments and proceed on that basis?\n  Mr. LOTT. Can we get agreement we can proceed on the bill and all \nrelevant amendments to that bill? To the American people, and I think \nto most Senators, that makes good sense, to have the requirement that \nit be relevant to a marriage tax penalty. Again, I have not said we \ncould not go with something that moves afield from that. All I am \nsaying is we would like to see what we are talking about and know it is \nfair, we have thought it out, and the committee of jurisdiction has had \nan opportunity to review it.\n  So that is what I am trying to work out. Senator Daschle has been \npatiently waiting while we have exchanged pleasantries. I must say \nthis. I, a little bit, kind of enjoy finding someone else getting \nfrustrated trying to find a way to make this move forward. I know how \nyou feel.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, one thing we all agree is we want to \nresolve the problem of the marriage tax penalty. I think that is \nunanimous. Republicans and Democrats want to find a way to end the \nmarriage tax penalty.\n  I think there is also a possibility we can reach agreement on how to \nproceed on this bill. We are not going to do it today under the \nconfines that have been laid down. I think the majority leader's \nsuggestion we go out now is appropriate. Let's go back, try to define \nthe list, let's share lists, let's look at what we have, let's see if \nwe cannot resolve this procedurally first thing in the morning, and we \nwill go from there.\n  I share the frustration expressed by my colleague. We are not going \nto resolve this matter this afternoon. In the interests of expediting \nthis bill, and in consideration of the debate, why don't we just go out \nand pick it up first thing tomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield for a brief comment? I can't pass \nthis up. The example my friend, the majority leader, used is the budget \nbill where we had all these amendments. I say, first of all, that is \nnot substantive in nature. The President has no right to veto that \nbill. The amendments are basically set by statute. So that is not a \ngood example.\n  I think you would have to hunt hard to find another example.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just remind my colleagues, tomorrow is \nWednesday and the next day is Thursday. If we do not get the marriage \ntax penalty done in those 2 days, then it will be pending until after \ntax day, April 15, when we come back. That may be all right.\n  Let me say we are going to eliminate the marriage tax penalty this \nyear. We are going to do it on this day, and this week, or we will do \nit later and we will do it with another procedure. We have talked about \ngetting this done too long and haven't gotten it done. So we are going \nto come back to this one repeatedly this year. But it would be, I \nthink, very helpful to the people involved and to all of us if we could \nfind a way to go ahead and do it this way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2517-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 2000\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I appreciate the members of the minority \nallowing me to speak for a moment on this important piece of \nlegislation. It is legislation I cosponsored when Congress convened \nearlier last year. It was Kay Bailey Hutchison's bill to repeal the \nmarriage tax penalty. Since that time, the legislation has been adopted \nto provide for an essential repeal for most Americans. That is the \npending business before us. I have supported similar measures ever \nsince I came to the Senate in 1995, and I am very pleased the majority \nleader has attempted to schedule a vote on this prior to tax day.\n  As we have just seen, it may not be possible for the Senate to \nactually vote on repealing the marriage tax penalty prior to tax day, \nbut it would certainly be our hope that that could be accomplished \nimmediately thereafter, if not before.\n  This will be the third time in 5 years we have acted to mitigate the \nmarriage tax penalty. In 1995, Congress passed legislation that would \nhave provided a tax credit to married couples to partially offset this \npenalty. President Clinton vetoed that bill. In 1999, Congress again \napproved a measure to provide married couples with some relief.\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\nLast year's bill would have set the standard deduction for couples at \ntwice the deduction allowed for singles. It also would have set the \nlowest income tax bracket for married couples at twice that allowed for \nsingle taxpayers. Again, President Clinton vetoed that last September.\n  According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the total tax burden \nborne by American taxpayers dipped slightly in 1998. That is the good \nnews. The bad news is Americans still spent more on Federal taxes than \non any of the other major items in their household budget. For the \nmedian-income two-earner family, for example, Federal taxes still \namounted to 39 percent of the family budget, more than what they spent \non food, housing, and medical care combined. One of the reasons why \nthey paid so much is the continuation of the marriage tax penalty that \nexists in the Nation's Tax Code.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly half of all \nmarried taxpayers--about 21 million couples--filing a joint return paid \na higher tax than they would have if each spouse had been allowed to \nfile as a single taxpayer.\n  The marriage tax penalty hits the working poor particularly hard. \nTwo-earner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full 8 \npercent of their income to pay the marriage tax penalty. Eight percent \nis an extraordinary amount for couples who count on every dollar to \nmake ends meet.\n  I will give an example of the marriage tax penalty at work. In this \nexample, the penalty comes about because workers filing as single \ntaxpayers get a higher standard deduction and because income tax \nbracket thresholds for married couples are lower than the thresholds \nfor singles. Consider a married couple with each spouse earning about \n$30,000 a year. They would have paid $7,655 in Federal income taxes \nlast year. By comparison, two individuals earning the same amount but \nfiling a joint return would have paid $6,892 between the two of them. \nThat is a marriage tax penalty of $763, about a 10-percent penalty \nsimply for being married.\n  The average penalty paid by couples is even higher than that--about \n$1,400 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Think what \nfamilies could do with an extra $1,400. They could pay for 3 or 4 \nmonths of day care if they chose to send a child outside the home, or \nmake it easier for one parent to stay at home and take care of the \nchildren if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make \nfour or five payments on a car or minivan. They could pay their utility \nbill for 9 months.\n  The bill reported by the Finance Committee is the most comprehensive \neffort yet to eliminate the marriage penalty. It will increase the \nstandard for couples filing jointly to twice the deduction allowed for \nsingle taxpayers. It will widen the 15-percent and 28-percent tax \nbrackets. It will allow more low-income married couples to qualify for \nthe earned-income credit and preserve the family tax credits that are \ncurrently phased out by the alternative minimum tax.\n  Unlike President Clinton's so-called relief bill, the plan Chairman \nRoth brings to us today does not neglect married couples who choose to \nhave one parent stay at home to raise their children. It gives them \nrelief and, in so doing, it let's them know we value the choice they \nhave made to stay home and raise a family.\n\n  Unlike the Clinton plan, which would preserve the penalty for many \ncouples, our plan would eliminate the marriage tax penalty in its \nentirety. Sure, that means revenue loss associated with this \nlegislation is greater than the President proposed, but the smaller \ncost of providing relief under the Clinton plan is also indicative of \njust how little it would do to solve the problem. We should not be \nstingy when attempting to ensure fairness in the Tax Code.\n  Passage of this legislation will continue the good progress we have \nmade this year in making the Tax Code fairer. First, we passed the \nmeasure to repeal the Social Security earnings limitation, a tax that \nhas unfairly penalized seniors for more than 60 years simply because \nthey wanted to earn extra income to supplement their monthly retirement \nchecks. The measure is now law.\n  Hopefully, the marriage tax penalty repeal bill will pass with a \nstrong bipartisan majority, and President Clinton will rethink his \nopposition and sign it when it reaches his desk.\n  Another thing we can do to make the Tax Code fairer is eliminate the \ndeath tax. Although most Americans will probably never pay the death \ntax, overwhelming majorities still sense there is something terribly \nwrong with a system that allows Washington to seize more than half of \nwhatever is left after someone dies--a system that prevents hard-\nworking Americans from passing the bulk of their nest eggs to their \nchildren or grandchildren.\n  We can debate the merits of any number of changes in the Tax Code--\nwhether a flat tax is preferable to a sales tax; whether tax rates \nshould be reduced across the board; or whether we should make the Tax \nCode more conducive to savings and investment. There are legitimate \npoints to be made on all sides. But when it comes to fairness, we need \nto do what is right. The marriage tax penalty, as the earnings limit \nand the death tax, is wrong; it is unfair; and it is time to put it to \nrest.\n  I thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas for her hard work. I \nthank Chairman Roth for bringing it forward. I appreciate the work of \nthe majority leader in getting this matter before the Senate for a vote \nso we can finally end the marriage tax penalty.\n  I again thank Senator Hutchison for deferring to me for my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for making a wonderful statement about the importance of the \nmarriage tax penalty and tax relief in general for the hard-working \npeople of our country. He is absolutely right; people are paying a \nhigher rate of tax than they have ever paid in peacetime.\n  I am concerned that there seems to be a problem with taking up this \nbill and debating amendments. I am very concerned about what appears to \nbe an effort to not take up this bill and have relevant amendments \nconsidered.\n  We are going to disagree on the merits of the marriage tax penalty. I \nhope we come to a conclusion that will significantly lower the marriage \ntax penalty for most of the 21 million American couples who now pay \nthat penalty just because they are married.\n  I hope the distinguished minority will allow us to go forward with \nthe debate. I hope my colleagues will allow us to talk about our \ndifferences on this issue.\n  I want to be clear; the questions we have just heard in the last hour \nappear to be related to offering amendments which are not relevant to \nthe marriage tax penalty and could, in fact, kill the marriage tax \npenalty bill. If it is the Democrats' strategy to kill the marriage tax \npenalty bill for 21 million Americans in the name of other amendments \nthey want to offer that are not relevant, I hope they will think about \nthat.\n  We all want to address Medicare and prescription drugs. We have \naddressed minimum wage. There are many issues on which we can disagree, \nbut I hope we can all agree that those are not relevant to the marriage \ntax penalty, and that we will not let our disagreements on issues such \nas minimum wage or the way we want to provide prescription drugs to \ninterfere with a very simple concept, a very clean bill that gives \nmarriage tax penalty relief to 21 million American couples, which is \nexactly what the bill before us does.\n  In the Finance Committee, Republicans and Democrats of good will \ndebated the marriage tax penalty. They passed a bill out of their \ncommittee, and it deals with the marriage tax penalty. It did not deal \nwith extraneous issues because, in fact, the President asked us to send \nspecific bills to him so that he could make his decision on what he \nwould sign and what he would not, one tax cut at a time.\n  We will be able to test the President and his commitment to giving \nmarriage tax penalty relief. We sent him marriage tax penalty relief \nlast year. We sent significant marriage tax penalty relief to the \nPresident last year, and the President vetoed the bill.\n  The President said: Oh, you have the marriage tax penalty relief in \nconjunction with all these other tax cuts. We had across-the-board tax \nrate cuts that\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nwould have helped every American paying taxes. We had significant cuts \nin the inheritance tax. We had other tax cuts for small businesspeople. \nThe President said: That is too much. In fact, I think he said it was \nreckless to give people that much of the money they earned back to \nthem. I believe he said it was reckless.\n  The President said: Give me smaller tax cuts. So that is exactly what \nwe are doing. We are trying to give him a significant cut in the \nmarriage tax penalty. We are trying to say to the President: We want \nmarriage tax penalty relief. You have said you are for it. We are going \nto send you a bill that includes marriage tax penalty relief, that \ndeals just with marriage tax penalty relief.\n  I would think the Senate would be able to come to an agreement on a \nmarriage tax penalty bill--with relevant amendments of any type--and go \nforward to discuss our differences on the merits on marriage tax \npenalty relief.\n  That is what the majority leader offered the Democratic minority. He \noffered them the ability to have relevant amendments and disagreements \non the merits of this bill. That is fair. We all understand that. We \nhave a little different approach on marriage tax penalty relief. We can \ndebate those issues--if we have the chance. But it seems the Democrats \ndo not want us to have that chance. It seems they do not want to be \nrequired to have relevant amendments so we can discuss this and give it \nto the President to sign.\n  I hope it is not the Democrats' view that we should put this off. I \nhope they are not going to require that we not pass marriage tax \npenalty relief this week before we go into recess for a week to spend \nEaster with our families. I certainly hope that is not the result we \nare going to see here. I hope the result will be reached of a good \nmarriage tax penalty relief bill before we leave for a week of recess \nover the Easter holiday. I think we owe that to the people of this \ncountry.\n  I have received some mail from my constituents.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas will allow me to ask a question of her.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy to answer a question from the \nSenator from Kansas who, by the way, has been one of the leaders in \nseeking marriage tax penalty relief. He is a cosponsor of the bill \nbefore us today, along with myself. He was a cosponsor of the bill we \nsent to the President last year. He has talked on the floor about this \nissue perhaps more than any one of us.\n  I would be happy to answer a question by the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my distinguished colleague from Texas.\n  My question simply deals with an issue I have been raising now for 3 \nweeks on this floor, saying that when we get to the time of being able \nto actually pass marriage tax penalty relief--and we are there, and it \nis on the floor--let us not have a bunch of extraneous amendments that \nare irrelevant to the issue, that do not pertain to the issue of the \nmarriage tax penalty. For 3 weeks I have been coming to the floor \nsaying, let's not get to that point in time or let's not have the great \nDemocratic Party saying, we are for marriage penalty relief, and then \nblock us with other nongermane amendments.\n\n  My simple question to the Senator from Texas is, it appears from what \nshe is describing now, we are actually at that point where we could \npass marriage tax penalty relief before April 15, and we are being \nblocked by nongermane amendments of the Democratic Party. Is that the \ncorrect situation we are actually in now?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would just say, the distinguished Senator from \nKansas is making a very good point. He has raised this point for the \nlast 3 weeks. That is, are the Democrats going to block consideration \nof a real marriage tax penalty relief bill by requiring that extraneous \namendments that have nothing to do with marriage tax penalty relief be \noffered as a condition for bringing this bill to the floor? I think the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas is exactly right.\n  I have to stand up for my majority leader. I am so proud of our \nmajority leader for standing on the floor and offering the Democrats \nevery single option that would keep this floor open for debate. He \noffered them the option of going forward on their prime amendment. He \noffered them the option of offering any relevant amendment. He offered \nthem the option of just having morning business so that anyone can come \nto the Senate floor and talk about their issues of concern. That is \nexactly what our majority leader did. He did exactly what he should be \ndoing to move the business of the Senate along.\n  I have to say, in response to the Senator from Kansas, I think it is \nvery important it be known that the majority leader has allowed any \namendment to come before the Senate. Just last week, on the budget, \nmany of us had amendments that were knocked off--just knocked off the \nbudget--by an objection from a distinguished Member on the Democratic \nside because he did not want to vote on those amendments en bloc. There \nwere many amendments from both sides of the aisle that were just \nknocked off.\n  The distinguished majority leader did not do that. He allowed them \nall to come in. I think he has been the most open he could possibly be \nin allowing every single amendment of every possible conception to be \noffered on many of the bills we have had before us this year and, most \nrecently, last week on the budget bill. We have taken a position on \nevery single controversial issue that has been brought up in our \ncountry since the session started in January.\n  The distinguished majority leader today is asking that we be able to \ndebate marriage tax penalty relief, with any number of amendments that \nare relevant, because the distinguished majority leader believes we can \nhave differences in approach.\n  We passed a marriage tax penalty relief bill last year to which we \nall agreed. It was overwhelmingly passed. We sent it to the President, \nand it was vetoed. The President said: The tax cut is too much. We \ndon't want to give that much money back to the people who worked so \nhard for it. Send me something smaller.\n  That is exactly what the Finance Committee is doing. The Finance \nCommittee voted a bill out--smaller, but it does give relief to every \nsingle married person in this country. It gives total relief to people \nin the 15-percent bracket and the 28-percent bracket. It increases the \nearned-income tax credit for the poorest working people in our country. \nThat is what the bill does. So why wouldn't we be able to take the bill \nto the floor and debate it?\n  I think the Senator from Kansas is on to something. The Senator from \nKansas is saying, why would the Democrats want to kill marriage tax \npenalty relief with extraneous amendments?\n  We have had sense of the Senates.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wonder if my distinguished colleague \nfrom Texas would yield for another question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nKansas for a question.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Texas. I appreciate her \nleadership and the work she has done on this particular issue.\n  I guess what is troubling to me about the issues that are being \nraised now on the floor is that we actually have a chance to get this \ndone. It is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This isn't a policy \nstatement by any of the various parties. This is an actual chance for \nus to pass the bill.\n  The bill has cleared through the House. We could pass it in the \nSenate. We could get it to the President. The President has said he \nwants to be able to have a smaller tax cut. Here is one that would deal \nwith the marital tax penalty.\n  We are getting it blocked. It seems to me the President ought to step \nin now and call on the Democrat Members of the Senate to say, no, let's \nlet this bill clear on through. This is similar to the disaster relief \nissue. I remember a couple years ago--my colleague might--we had a \nsupplemental bill come through and people wanted to have some budget \nconstraints in that bill. There was an emergency need for that \nsupplemental, some disaster relief; some flooding was taking place. The \nDemocratic Party said: We have to have this supplemental for this \nemergency relief and really hammered on a lot of people about that \nissue until we passed it so that people could get disaster relief.\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n And we should have given that disaster relief.\n  Here you have virtually the same situation. We have a chance to \nactually do it--no more sense of the Senate; no more talking about it; \nno more just saying we ought to do it. With this bill we do it. We are \nactually being blocked by a parliamentary maneuver on the Democrat side \nof the aisle.\n  I hope the President will enter into this debate and call on Democrat \ncolleagues of ours to say, no, let's have a vote. Let's debate the \ndifferent sides of this issue of marriage tax penalty relief. There are \ndifferent policy ways to handle it. Let's have that good debate, but \ndon't tie it up with endless amendments or with what is taking place \nnow, where we are virtually shutting the floor down because we can't \nget agreement. This is too important to play that sort of politics.\n  I hope my Democrat colleagues are actually for eliminating the \nmarriage tax penalty. Let us have a spirited debate about their \ndifferent ideas. I appreciate my colleague from Texas carrying this \nissue forward. We have to deal with this now. Ahead of the April 15 \ndeadline would be the time to do it. This is the point in time to do \nit. People filling out their forms are seeing the marriage tax penalty \nthey are paying. Let's tell them hope is on the way; we will be able to \nget this dealt with.\n  I appreciate my colleague doing this. I hope we can get the President \ninvolved in calling some of our Democrat colleagues to say, let's pass \na bill and let's look at this issue on the merits. I know my colleague \nfrom Texas will continue to press that issue on the floor and \neverywhere else she can.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Kansas for making a very \ngood point. He is saying maybe now it is time for the President to step \nin and show his commitment on this issue. Maybe he can work with the \ndistinguished Democratic minority in saying, I think this is something \nwe ought to do, such as an emergency.\n  I guarantee Kervin and Marsha Johnson believe it is an emergency, as \nthey are filling out their tax forms this week. Kervin is a D.C. police \nofficer. His wife is a Federal employee. They were married last July. \nThis year they will pay $1,000 more in taxes because they got married 7 \nmonths ago.\n  I guarantee that Eric and Ayla Hemeon believe this is an emergency. \nEric is a volunteer firefighter and works for a printing company. Ayla \nworks for a small business. They have been married for 2 years and are \nexpecting their first child in about a month. Last year they paid \nalmost $1,100 in a marriage tax penalty just because they got married \nand that they would not have paid if they were single. They are filling \nout their tax forms right now, and they would like to see the Congress \ngive them relief from paying that $1,100 next year so they can buy \nsomething for their new baby.\n  Lawrence and Brendalyn Garrison believe this is an emergency. He is a \ncorrections officer at Lorton prison. She is a teacher in Fairfax \nCounty, VA. Last year we estimate they paid nearly $600 in a marriage \ntax penalty. They are really upset about it. When I talked to them last \nweek, they said: We have been married 25 years and we think you should \npass marriage tax penalty relief and make it retroactive.\n  I think they have a good point. They have been paying the penalty for \n25 years. This is an error in the Tax Code that must be corrected.\n  Jerri Dahl of Arlington, TX, believes this is an emergency. He wrote \nme a letter and said:\n\n       It is tax time again, and I am not going to let it go by \n     without attempting to do something about what I feel is a \n     terrible injustice to working people. I am not joking when I \n     tell you that my husband and I are seriously contemplating \n     divorce in order not to be penalized financially next year.\n\n  I think we have a number of people in this country who believe this \nis an emergency, who, as they are writing the check to the Government, \nbelieve the Senate should act on a bill that would give them relief \nfrom a payment they should not have to make. Most people in our country \nbelieve they owe a fair share of taxes to the Government. They love \nthis country and they want to do their part, but most people don't want \nto do more than they think is fair. When a single person in an office \nis sitting next to a married person in an office and they have the same \njob and make the same salary and the married person has to pay more in \ntaxes than the single person sitting at the next desk making the same \nsalary, that doesn't pass the test of fairness.\n  I commend the majority leader for attempting to bring this bill to \nthe floor. I commend my colleague, the Senator from Kansas, the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, \nand the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth. They have been working on this \nlegislation for a long time. Senator Roth brought the bill forward last \nyear. The President vetoed it and said it was too much. Senator Roth \ncame back this year. He originally had a different bill--it was a \ndoubling of the 15-percent bracket--but he listened to many of us who \nsaid, let's go to 28 percent so people in that middle-income bracket \ncan get relief. That is the middle-income couple who needs that money \nto be able to do more for their children or to buy their first house or \nto pay for the car.\n\n  The working people of our country deserve better government than they \nare getting today. They deserve better government than the Democrats \nshutting down the Senate because they don't want open debate on \nmarriage tax penalty relief.\n  I hope tomorrow they will change. I hope they will change and say it \nis OK to discuss this issue. It is OK to have disagreements, but let's \nkeep our eye on the ball. Let's come together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and correct the inequity in the Tax Code in this country \nthat says a married person and a single person in the same job making \nthe same salary should pay the same taxes.\n  That is what we are seeking today. I hope the Democrats will come \nback fresh tomorrow and say: We agree with you. Now is the time to do \nthe responsible thing. Let's correct the Tax Code to say every person \nworking in this country should pay their fair share of taxes but no \nmore. Let's give tax relief to the hard-working married couple who has \nbeen paying a penalty for 6 months or a year or 25 years. Let's correct \nit now because now is the time we can.\n  As the majority leader said about the gas tax reduction that we also \ntried to give people today: If not now, when? If not this, how?\n  Let us be a little more forthcoming in creativity when it comes to \nhelping the hard-working people of this country have the marriage \npenalty relief they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Thank you, Mr. President. I compliment my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Texas for all of her hard work and \nleadership in trying to correct the marriage tax penalty. It is an \nunfair quirk in our Tax Code that we hope we can finally bring to an \nend at some point this year.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Fitzgerald pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2398 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of Senator \nHutchison's bill to improve aviation security. Our colleague from Texas \nbrings unique expertise to this issue as a former member of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board. I want to thank her for her \ndiligence in this area over the past several years as a member of the \nCommerce Committee Aviation Subcommittee.\n  Among other things, Senator Hutchison's bill would make pre-\nemployment criminal background checks mandatory for all baggage \nscreeners at airports, not just those who have significant gaps in \ntheir employment histories. It would require screeners to undergo \nextensive training requirements, since U.S. training standards fall far \nshort of European standards. The legislation would also seek tighter \nenforcement against unauthorized access to airport secure areas.\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\n  I cannot overemphasize the importance of adequate training and \ncompetency checks for the folks who check airline baggage for weapons \nand bombs. The turnover rate among this workforce is as high as 400 \npercent at one of the busiest airports in the country. The work is \nhard, and the pay is low. Obviously, this legislation does not \nestablish minimum pay for security screeners. By asking their employers \nto invest more substantially in training, however, we hope that they \nwill also work to ensure a more stable and competent workforce.\n  Several aviation security experts appeared before the Aviation \nSubcommittee at a hearing last week. They raised additional areas of \nconcern that I expect to address as this bill proceeds through the \nlegislative process. For instance, government and industry officials \nalike agree that the list of ``disqualifying'' crimes that are \nuncovered in background checks needs to be expanded. Most of us find it \nsurprising that an individual convicted of assault with a deadly \nweapon, burglary, larceny, or possession of drugs would not be \ndisqualified from employment as an airport baggage screener.\n  Fortunately, this bill is not drafted in response to loss of life \nresulting from a terrorist incident. Even so, it is clear that even our \nmost elementary security safeguards may be inadequate, as evidenced by \nthe loaded gun that a passenger recently discovered in an airplane \nlavatory during flight.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hutchison, as well as experts \nin both government and industry circles, to make sure that any \nlegislative proposal targets resources in the most effective manner. By \nand large, security at U.S. airports is good, and airport and airline \nefforts clearly have a deterrent effect. What is also clear, however, \nis that we cannot relax our efforts as airline travel grows, and \nweapons technologies become more sophisticated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2521-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ``EXXON VALDEZ'' OIL SPILL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Senate passed S. 711, calendar No. \n235, a bill to allow for the investment of joint Federal and State \nfunds from the civil settlement of damages from the Exxon Valdez oil \nspill, on November 19 last year, in the last hours of the First \nSession.\n  The bill states that moneys in the settlement fund are eligible for \nthe new investment authority so long as they are allocated in a manner \nidentified in the bill. Specifically, S. 711 provides that $55 million \nof the funds remaining on October 1, 2002 shall be allocated for \nhabitat protection programs.\n  The accompanying report, S. Rept. 106-124, contains a provision in \nthe section-by-section analysis, subsection 1(e), stating that, with \nrespect to the $55 million for habitat protection programs, \n``[a]dditionally, any funds needed for the administration of the Trust \nwill also be deducted from these monies.'' I was surprised to see this \nprovision in the report because I do not believe that it reflects the \ncommittee's intent with respect to the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think the committee did speak clearly in the actual \nlegislative language of the bill, which requires that the new \ninvestment authority be allocated ``consistent with the resolution of \nthe Trustees adopted March 1, 1999 concerning the Restoration \nReserve.'' Among other things, this resolution separates the remaining \nfunds into two distinct ``pots'' of money: a $55 million pot which can \nbe used for habitat acquisition; and a $115 million ``pot'' that will \nbe used for research and monitoring activities.\n  As the Trustees have explained the resolution to me, the cost of \nadministration for habitat acquisition will come from the $55 million \nand the cost of administration for the monitoring and research will \ncome from the $115 million. Therefore, I am confident that the actual \nlegislative language of the bill is clear and that this was the \ncommittee's intent. This provision was very important to me in drafting \nthis bill because I have always been concerned about the tens-of-\nmillions of dollars the Trustees have spent on administration of the \nfunds.\n  We prepared a statement to clarify this matter last November. It \nshould have appeared in the Record at the point where the bill was \npassed (S15162-S15163). Regrettably, the statement was mislaid and did \nnot appear where it should have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2521-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

SCRIBNER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfriend of mine who is also a friend to the working men and women of \nMichigan, Edgar A. Scribner. Ed recently retired from his position as \nPresident of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO.\n  Ed Scribner began his working career with the Detroit Free Press in \n1950, a career which was interrupted from 1952-1954 when he served his \ncountry in Korea with the United States Army. He has always been an \nactive supporter of the rights of workers, and was elected Vice \nPresident of Teamster Local Union #372 in 1962. He also served his \nlocal as Trustee and President, and was selected for additional \nleadership positions with Michigan Teamsters Joint Council #43. In \n1988, he was first elected President of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-\nCIO, a position he has held until this year.\n  Ed's contribution to community life has truly known no bounds. He has \nworked tirelessly on behalf of numerous charities and took a leadership \nrole on behalf of United Community Services, metro Detroit's Torch \nDrive agency. In 1992, duty called Ed in a new direction when he was \nelected to the Board of Governors of Wayne State University, helping \none of the nation's leading urban research universities find new ways \nto serve metropolitan Detroit.\n  Through it all, as a labor leader, a humanitarian, and an education \nleader, Ed's calling card has been his sincerity. Those who know him \nhave come to appreciate the genuine affection he holds for people. \nWhile he's never been reluctant to take a stand concerning the big \nissues of his day, Ed has never forgotten that in the end it's all \nabout people and making their lives better.\n  Caring about people has been a way of life for Ed Scribner, not just \na job. So I have no doubt that even in his retirement, Ed will continue \nto serve his community in many ways. I am sure that his children, and \nespecially his grandchildren, will keep him at least as busy as his \ncommitments to the many non-profit and educational institutions with \nwhich he is currently involved. And I also know that the men and women \nof the AFL-CIO can count on Ed to continue to stand with them in their \nongoing efforts on behalf of the working people of our nation.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues will join me in extending \ncongratulations and best wishes to Ed Scribner, President of the \nMetropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO, on the occasion of his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2521-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2521-S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNITION OF FRANKLIN MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL RICK OTTO\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the past seven years, the \nchildren at\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nFranklin Middle School in Yakima, Washington have benefitted greatly \nfrom the dedication and hard work of their principal, Mr. Rick Otto. He \nhas been credited by his colleagues for turning the school around with \nhis new ideas, helping disadvantaged students, and creating a positive \natmosphere. I applaud Principal Otto's work to bring about such \nimportant changes and improvements in his school and am proud to \npresent Principal Otto with my next ``Innovation in Education'' Award.\n  Principal Otto has a distinguished record of service at Franklin \nMiddle School. For many years, he taught technology classes before \nworking as an assistant principal. In 1993, he became the principal and \nrealized that in order to improve Franklin Middle School, the community \nwould have to become more involved. Throughout his tenure, Principal \nOtto has built a strong relationship with parents, community leaders \nand residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. The work of Principal \nOtto and the community has made a tremendous impact resulting in a \nrenewed sense of discipline and higher expectations in student \nperformance.\n  One of the challenges taken on by Principal Otto was improving the \nacademic achievement of its high-concentration of non-English speaking \nfamilies as well as helping students traditionally described as \ndisadvantaged. Under Mr. Otto's leadership, Franklin created an ``At-\nRisk'' program which targets the children who are having trouble in \nschool, gives them more attention in the classroom, and monitors their \nimprovement. In the past five years, 69 percent of the students \nparticipating in the ``At-Risk'' program have improved in all areas of \ntheir education. The ``At-Risk'' program has also vastly improved the \nmorale of students and staff across the Franklin campus.\n  I have heard many words of praise from members of the Franklin Middle \nSchool community who regard him as a model educator and admire his \nsteadfast dedication to his students. Their words speak more highly of \nPrincipal Otto than I, as a United States Senator, ever could.\n  Clearly, Principal Otto is a leader in the field of education who \nrecognizes the challenges that exist in his school and works each day \nto meet those challenges and make his students better learners. I \napplaud Principal Otto and know that the past, present and future \nchildren attending Franklin Middle School will be better students \nbecause of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2522-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RESIGNATION OF LARRY WILKER, KENNEDY CENTER PRESIDENT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a few days ago, the president of \nthe Kennedy Center, Lawrence J. Wilker, announced that he will resign \nhis position at the Center at the end of this year. He plans to launch \na new Internet entertainment company, and I know that he will bring the \nsame ability, energy, and enthusiasm to that initiative as he brought \nto the Kennedy Center.\n  Larry Wilker has been a superb president for the Kennedy Center over \nthe past decade. He has made outstanding improvements in the Center's \nfacilities and its programming. He has led the Center effectively \nduring a time of significant growth and expansion. One of his most \nimpressive achievements has been the creation of the Millennium Stage, \nwhich offers free performances every afternoon at the Center.\n  I know that Larry Wilker will continue to be a leader in the national \nperforming arts community and an enduring part of the Kennedy Center, \nand I wish him well in his important and pioneering new undertaking.\n  Today's Washington Post contains an excellent editorial praising \nLarry and his many contributions to the Kennedy Center and the arts in \nthe nation. I ask that the editorial may be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 11, 2000]\n\n                       A Kennedy Center Departure\n\n       Lawrence Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center since \n     1991, is taking off for the dot-com world, leaving an \n     institution more vital and deeper in talent than before his \n     arrival. Former chairman James Wolfensohn, who hired Mr. \n     Wilker, did much to set the direction of the center toward \n     showcasing national and regional arts, livelier relations \n     with the local scene and a strong focus on arts education. \n     Under Mr. Wilker and center chairman James Johnson those \n     changes deepened and took institutional hold. Signs of this \n     emphasis range from the hugely popular free ``Millennium \n     State'' events daily at 6 p.m. in the Grand Foyer--catering, \n     as often as not, to a jeans-and-sweaters crowd--to the \n     splashy black-tie gala that marked the unveiling of a \n     refurbished Concert Hall in 1997.\n       Outreach doesn't accomplish much if the quality isn't there \n     to back it up. That lesson also has reverberated in the \n     Wilker era with the arrival of recognized names such as the \n     Washington Opera's Placido Domingo and the National Symphony \n     Orchestra's Leonard Slatkin. Mr. Wilker's own background in \n     theater production bolstered Kennedy Center sponsorship of \n     the Fund for New American Plays, which distributes as much as \n     $25,000 (gleaned mostly from corporate sources) for \n     production of promising works by young playwrights all over \n     the nation--some of which end up in Washington, some not.\n       Mr. Wilker says his Internet venture will make arts and \n     entertainment more widely available. His Kennedy Center \n     tenure has been, in large measure, an exercise in that same \n     mission, and one that has achieved success--despite being \n     waged not on the Net but in the clunkier coin of bricks, \n     mortar and federal budget battles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2522-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2522-S2523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION OF MICHIGAN-GENESEE VALLEY REGION HONORS \n                            DR.

As Executive Director, Dr. Levine oversees the \nday-to-day operations of the Medical Society, ranging from the \nresponsibilities of its financial, policy and staffing actions, to its \nlobbying activities, educational programming and media relations. He \nalso serves as the Executive Director of the Society's three \nsubsidiaries: the Medical Society Foundation, a 501C-3 educational and \nsocial policy charitable foundation; the Physicians Programs, Inc.; and \nthe Emergency Medical Centre of Flint, an urgent care center designed \nto provide a low cost alternative care site for the community at large. \nThe Emergency Medical Centre provides care for approximately 18,000 \nvisitors per year.\n  Prior to 1986, Dr. Levine served as Program Director for the Greater \nFlint Area Hospital Assembly. In this capacity, Dr. Levine directed a \nsix-hospital cooperative venture enabling these hospitals to provide \nbetter cancer care services to their patients. He developed and \nimplemented strategies for cooperation in research, education, \nbioethics, resource coordination, standards of care, fiscal strategies, \ncommunication with hospital staffs, promotion of member hospitals \noutside of the region, innovative programming, cancer screening, and \ncomputerized tumor registry and data system. He staffed a multi-\nhospital joint venture to implement Magnetic Resonance Imagery \ntechnology in the Flint area, and served as the Executive Director of \nCommunity Hospice, Inc., a multi-hospice association designed to foster \nhospice growth in the region.\n  Dr. Levine is also a founding board member and volunteer for the \nGenesee County Free Medical Clinic, and a charter member of the \nMichigan Hospice Organization Board of Directors. He serves on the \nMedicare Advisory Board for the Ninth Congressional District of \nMichigan, sits on the Board of Directors of Health Education Systems, \nInc., and is a Consultant to Michigan State Medical Society Committees \non Bioethics, on Membership Recruitment and Retention, and on Medical \nEconomics. He is also the State Medical Society's Liaison with Blue \nCross/Blue Shield, and a member of its task force on professional \nliability.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Dr. Levine for his outstanding work for not \nonly Genesee County, but the State of Michigan. His efforts have \ncontributed to a higher standard of medical care throughout the state. \nOn behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Dr. Levine \non being named\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\nthe Individual Health Advocate of the Year by the American Lung \nAssociation of Genesee Valley.

Within its educational programs, and \nparticularly in the health sciences, there is an interactive community \ncomponent: senior nursing students work with area schools to provide \nhealth education classes, along with basic health screening, for \nstudents; faculty and staff work with the Genesee County Health \nDepartment to train teams, working through area churches, to provide \ncitizens with health information; and the community has access to \ndiverse facilities and programs on campus, programs which are all aimed \nat improving the health of the community.\n  Mott Community College also hosts many important events where health \neducation is the theme. The annual Mott Community College Health Fair \nis a popular event which brings health professionals and the community \ntogether. The college holds national mental health town meetings, \nincluding a recent public forum which Ms. Tipper Gore chaired. On \nFebruary 5, 2000, the college hosted the first annual ``Family Asthma \nDay,'' in which three asthma specialists presented informal sessions on \nthe management of asthma. The event also included interactive sessions \nfor adults and children.\n  Mr. President, for over seventy-five years, Mott Community College \nhas worked to improve the quality of life of residents in the Genesee \nValley area. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I \ncongratulate Mott Community College on being named the Corporate Health \nAdvocate of the Year by the American Lung Association of Michigan-\nGenesee Valley Region. This award is the representation of the hard \nwork of many people who truly care about the Genesee County \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2523-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATOR'S WEEK\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring recognition to \na very special group of people in our Nation, our public safety \ncommunicators. These people are the ones who, hour after hour, stand by \nready to dispatch emergency assistance to Americans in times of crisis \nand often tragedy. In 1992, President George Bush set aside the week of \nApril 9th through the 15th to bring special recognition to all of those \nwho dispatch emergency aid across this great country. Everyday \nAmericans reach for the telephone to dial the numbers 9-1-1, seeking a \nvoice that will bring them the help they so desperately require. A \nparent holding a child who has suffered a life threatening injury, an \nelderly person who has no one else to turn to, or a family who has \nawakened to a home filled with smoke; they are all calling this number \njust waiting for the voice that will bring them much needed assistance. \nThe men and women who answer the 9-1-1 call are the ones who often make \nthe difference between life and death for thousands of people in this \ncountry every single day. Our 9-1-1 dispatchers are on call 365 days a \nyear, 24 hours a day, always there with that calm reassuring voice that \nputs hope back in the hearts of those in need. It is a great honor for \nme to bring recognition to these unsung heroes of our country and I \nhope that you will join me in offering your praise and thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2523-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2523-S2524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DR. JAMES BROWN AND THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS \n                           CONTROL CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nupcoming Tenth Annual Arms Control Conference taking place in \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico. In recognition of this Tenth Anniversary, I \nwish to emphasize the tireless efforts of this conference's founder, \ncoordinator, and inspiration, Dr. James Brown.\n  Dr. Brown's career has long emphasized arms control. Not only has Jim \nBrown devoted himself to this conference for the past decade, but he \nhas also been a practitioner. He served in several different capacities \nat the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, where he helped develop \nverification regimes for implementation of the UN Security Council \nResolution to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. He also \nworked in the Pentagon as a special assistant to the Deputy \nUndersecretary for Planning and Resources.\n  His academic resume is also impressive. Jim was a professor at \nSouthern Methodist University, and a visiting professor at Air \nUniversity. He was a founding director of the John Tower Center for \nPolitical Studies and co-taught courses with Senator Tower for eight \nyears. Jim Brown was also selected as a senior Fulbright Scholar at the \nUniversity of Ankara. Most notably, he has authored and edited nine \nvolumes of scholarly work and 35 articles on Arms Control.\n  Dr. James Brown has dedicated many years of his professional life in \npursuit of international understanding as a fundamental prerequisite to \nprogress on arms control and disarmament. Every year this conference \nreflects the culmination of his personal commitment. It is important to \nacknowledge the unique contribution that this conference has made and \ncontinues to make toward achievement of global peace and stability.\n  The disarmament and non-proliferation work of Sandia National \nLaboratories and the Cooperative Monitoring Center are greatly enhanced \nand supported by the annual Arms Control\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\nConference. This event should serve to underscore Sandia Laboratories' \nstaunch commitment to a safe and stable international security \nenvironment.\n  The success of this annual event owes itself to Jim's reputation, his \nintegrity, his personal relationships with a broad range of policy \nmakers throughout the global arms control community and their trust in \nhim. Jim's diligence has enabled the Albuquerque conference to grow \neven more in stature each year bringing credit on Sandia, the \nDepartment of Energy and the State of New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, New Mexico is fortunate to have Dr. Brown as a \ncitizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2524-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNITION OF MR. DARVIN ECKLUND, FOUNDER OF THE CEDAR HEIGHTS \n                ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES LEARNING CENTER\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in a continuing effort to recognize \nexcellence in education I would like to award Darvin Ecklund of the \nCedar Heights Environmental Resources Learning Center in Port Orchard, \nWashington with an `Innovation in Education' Award. Two years ago, Mr. \nEcklund, a Natural Resources teacher at Cedar Heights Junior High, \ncreated an after school center that focuses on environmental activities \nand teaches students the importance of rehabilitating our local natural \nresources. I think Mr. Ecklund's concept is a remarkable after school \noption for junior high students as an alternative, safe environment \nwhere they can learn and have fun at the same time.\n  The focus of the Cedar Heights Environmental Resources Learning \nCenter aims to stimulate kids toward saving the environment around \nthem. Recently, the Center renovated local ponds and developed plant \nlife to be used in future rehabilitation projects. Children learn to \nidentify common and scientific names of plants and wildlife. To date, \nover six hundred salmon have been raised in this Center! This is a \ntruly remarkable way to integrate science into children's lives with a \nhands on approach.\n  We all know that we live in a busy world where sometimes kids end up \nwaiting for their parents to return from work. I cannot think of a \nbetter way to see kids spend a few hours after-school, as well as \ngetting parents involved in their children's after-school activities. \nCurrently, there are over one hundred kids participating in this \nprogram. High school students are also part of Mr. Ecklund's staff and \nhelp organize activities and provide assistance as well.\n  Mr. Ecklund has also found a way for kids at the Cedar Heights \nEnvironmental Resources Learning Center to develop a relationship with \nthe retirement community across the street. The Center offers retirees \nan educational as well as relaxing place to come and share time with \nthe students. The Center has made the paths around the Environmental \nCenter wheel-chair accessible. After hearing this, I was encouraged \nthat this community has found a way to connect young people not only to \nthe environment, but to their elders. I applaud Mr. Ecklund for \ncreating such an innovative program that connects older and younger \nstudents to helping the environment and spending time with seniors.\n  Ms. Pat Green, Principal of Cedar Heights Junior High, said the \nfollowing about Mr. Ecklund: ``He is passionate about the environment \nand teaching kids how to raise fish as a sustainable resource. The kids \nare learning hands-on science in action!\"\n  Mr. Pat Oster, Assistant Principal of Cedar Heights Junior High \ncommends Mr. Ecklund's efforts, describing him as, ``a very caring and \nenergetic person who devotes generous time to the many students he \ninteracts with on a daily basis.''\n  I have been a long supporter of preserving the environment. I am \nimpressed by the originality of this program and hope other after-\nschool centers will follow in the footsteps of the Cedar Heights \nEnvironmental Resources Learning Center. This is truly science in \naction!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2524-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MRS. KATHERINE G. HEIDEMAN'S 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Mrs. Katherine \nGrayson Graham Heideman, resident of Hancock, MI, who today is \ncelebrating her 90th birthday. It is my pleasure to honor her not only \nfor having reached this landmark birthday, which is quite an \naccomplishment in itself, but also, and I think more importantly, for \nhaving lived her life in a manner truly worthy of commendation.\n  Mrs. Heideman was born in Audubon, Iowa, the daughter of Katherine \nGrayson Brown and James Melville Graham. She was the youngest of six \ndaughters. After attending high school in Audubon, she headed out west \nto continue her education, first receiving a B.A. from the University \nof California-Los Angeles in 1931, and then in 1934 earning an M.A. \nfrom the University of Southern California. For the next twenty years, \nMrs. Heideman taught English literature classes to intermediate \nstudents in four different states: California, Michigan, Illinois, and \nthe District of Columbia.\n  On July 6, 1934, Katherine married Bert Heideman. The couple remained \ntogether until in 1991, when Mr. Heideman passed away. They had three \nchildren together, Eric, Bert, and Eric. The eldest child unfortunately \ndied just six months after he was born, and Mr. and Mrs. Heideman named \ntheir third child in his honor and memory.\n  In 1958, Mrs. Heideman became the first woman to be named Houghton \nCounty, Michigan, Superintendent of Schools. She served in this \ncapacity for four years, then spent twelve years as Superintendent of \nthe Copper Country Intermediate School System, which includes Houghton, \nBaraga, and Keweenaw counties. During these years, Mrs. Heideman was a \npioneer in developing special education initiatives. All of her efforts \nculminated in 1974, when the Heideman Bill, HB5013, was passed into law \nin the State of Michigan. This law made it possible for an intermediate \nschool district to own and operate a school for handicapped children.\n  In 1982, Mrs. Heideman was elected to the Hancock City Council, and \nthere she has continued to fight not only for the rights of disabled \nindividuals, but also for the environment and the historic preservation \nof Houghton county. She is the author of a resolution forbidding any \nnuclear or toxic waste to be transported through the city of Hancock, \nand of a resolution condemning the dumping of iron ore tailings into \nLake Superior. Mrs. Heideman was a charter member of the Hancock \nHistoric Preservation Commission, and continues to be a strong voice in \nthe efforts to retain the city's old world charm. She has played an \ninstrumental role in the attempt to get the city of Hancock recognized \nas being the Finnish American culture center of the United States. And, \ndue to her efforts, a sister city relationship was formed with the \ncitizens of Porvoo, Finland. A candidate seven times, she now begins \nher eighteenth year representing the first ward.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Mrs. Heideman for her selfless dedication to \nimproving the quality of life for individuals not only in the city of \nHancock, but the entire State of Michigan. She is a remarkable woman \nand a true role model. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I \nwish Mrs. Heideman a happy ninetieth birthday, and best of luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2524-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/11/senate-section/article/S2524-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2524-S2525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nfrom Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas agreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide temporary protected status to certain unaccompanied alien \nchildren, to provide for the adjustment of status of aliens unlawfully \npresent in the United States who are under 18 years of age, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 alien children protection act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for many weeks, we have been dealing with \nthe tragedy of Elian Gonzalez. If this tragedy teaches us anything, it \nis that the U.S. immigration laws have not been constructed in a manner \nthat accounts for the special needs of our Nation's most precious \nresource--I also say our world's most precious resource--our children.\n  Yesterday, CNN-USA Today released a Gallup Poll on the Elian Gonzalez \ntragedy. That poll said by a 2-to-1 margin Americans believe Elian \nGonzalez should live with his father in Cuba rather than with relatives \nin the United States. But that same poll, also by a 2-to-1 margin, \nfound that Americans disapprove of the way the Government has handled \nthis case. That disapproval of the way in which the Government has \nhandled this case could be a disapproval of hundreds of cases if they \nhad the same notoriety as Elian.\n  I come this afternoon to introduce legislation that will require the \nFederal Government to dramatically improve its treatment of the \nthousands of unaccompanied children who arrive in the United States \neach year.\n  Many of us are parents. I personally have been blessed with four \nbeautiful daughters and 10 wonderful grandchildren. We all know the \nspecial joy a child brings to our lives. We know that bond across \ngenerations that relationship between a parent or a grandparent and a \nchild brings. We all want to pour all of the history, all of our \npersonal experience into safeguarding and into paving the way in the \nbest interests of our children.\n  The Bible tells us to take this responsibility seriously. In the book \nof Proverbs, it imparts this wisdom:\n\n       Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is \n     old he will not depart from it.\n\n  We all have that responsibility to train up a child.\n  As that passage from Proverbs suggests, we have a responsibility to \nprotect and nurture all of our children. Their future--our planet's \nfuture--depends on it.\n  Unfortunately, U.S. law prevents us from carrying out that \nresponsibility with respect to some of this planet's most vulnerable \nchildren.\n  Each year, there are about 5,000 unaccompanied children who are \ndetained by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Some \nchildren come to this country seeking asylum, others hope to be \nreunified with families, and others seek nothing but a better life. \nWhile many of these children ultimately are deported or voluntarily \nreturned home, some have legitimate claims which merit our attention.\n  Regardless of the outcome of their cases, in most instances, these \nchildren must endure the rigors of an immigration system that is \nanything but child friendly. Unfortunately, many children in INS \ncustody end up spending time in jail-like settings while their cases \nare pending. They have no one to guide them through complex immigration \nlaw and procedure.\n  Moreover, immigration laws are technical and inflexible and do not \npermit compassion or frequently even common wisdom to enter into the \nequation when determining the fate of a child.\n  I will give some examples. Six Chinese children were detained by the \nINS last year in Oregon. Though charged with no crime, they were sent \nto a juvenile detention facility for 8 months where they were exposed \nto violent youthful offenders who had committed crimes such as murder \nand drug trafficking. One of the group, a 15-year-old girl, was forced \nto remain at the jail for several weeks after she had been granted \nasylum, even though she had relatives living in New York.\n\n  Such innocent children should not have to endure exposure to hardened \njuveniles and criminals as part of their experience with the U.S. \nimmigration process.\n  Equally compelling is the story of a Kosovar Albanian boy who was \nsuffering from severe depression. He was held in a juvenile \ncorrectional facility for over 6 months during his immigration \nproceedings. The INS provided psychiatric care but by a professional \nwho spoke only English. After a mental episode, the boy was placed in \nthe maximum security section of the jail rather than being provided \nwith appropriate care. The INS even balked at placing the boy in foster \ncare after he was granted asylum, thus further delaying his stay in an \ninappropriate facility.\n  The Federal Government's insensitivity to child immigrants is also \nillustrated by a recent case of two children from the Caribbean. Their \nmother is a legal, permanent resident in the United States, but she had \nleft her minor children behind with the belief they would soon follow. \nThe mother promptly applied for visas for her children. Yet the \nchildren were required to wait in their home country for months and, in \nsome cases, even years before they could even get an interview at the \nlocal U.S. Embassy to pave the way for reunification with their mother.\n  These are just three examples of children who were improperly treated \nas a result of our current immigration laws. Many of these cases are \nthe result of INS's inherent conflict of interest: Children are \ndetained and frequently deported by the same agency that is responsible \nfor caring for them and protecting their legal rights. This system does \nnot work well enough, and it needs improvement. Children are entitled \nto receive care from child welfare authorities who will act in their \nbest interest and who are trained to protect children's rights.\n  Indeed, there is an irony. The Federal Government requires States to \nplace\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nchildren in facilities that are separate and apart from adult \ncorrectional facilities. The INS should at least abide by the same \nstandard with respect to alien children.\n  To address these problems, my legislation takes four actions: First, \nit requires that INS place children in its custody in a facility \nappropriate for children; in other words, no jails. These facilities \nare required to provide for the health, welfare, and educational needs \nof children.\n  Two, provide children in INS custody with a guardian ad litem to \nchampion that child's best interest. Notably, this guardian would not \nbe associated with the INS in order to eliminate any conflict of \ninterest.\n  Three, give the Attorney General the flexibility and the authority in \nextraordinary cases to evaluate a child's case on the basis of what is \nin the best interest of the child.\n  Four, to direct the General Accounting Office to conduct a study and \nreport back to Congress regarding whether and to what extent U.S. \ndiplomatic officials are fulfilling their obligation to reunify on a \npriority basis children in foreign countries whose parents are legally \npresent in the United States.\n  With these changes in the law, children will no longer be forced to \nstruggle through the immigration process alone under the adverse \nconditions to which they are currently exposed. The INS will have the \nflexibility to treat children in its custody with greater compassion \nand common sense.\n  I hope the recent attention which has and will continue to surround \nthe Elian Gonzalez tragedy will encourage us to shield all our children \nfrom the vagaries of U.S. immigration law. Our future generations \ndeserve to be protected, not persecuted or prosecuted. They deserve to \nbe inspired, not incarcerated. They deserve to have decisions about \ntheir future made consistent with what is in their best interest, not \nconfused by conflicts of interest.\n  I conclude with hope that this Congress will give attention to an \nissue which affects not one child but thousands of children who are in \nthe custody of the United States and whose treatment reflects our \nfundamental American values of justice and concern for their rights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and three \nnewspaper articles and editorials on the subject of ``INS Treats \nChildren Shamefully'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

USE OF APPROPRIATE FACILITIES FOR THE DETENTION OF \n                   ALIEN CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in \n     the case of any alien under 18 years of age who is awaiting \n     final adjudication of the alien's immigration status and who \n     does not have a parent, guardian, or relative in the United \n     States into whose custody the alien may be released, the \n     Attorney General shall place such alien in a facility \n     appropriate for children not later than 72 hours after the \n     Attorney General has taken custody of the alien.\n       (b) Exception.--The provisions of subsection (a) do not \n     apply to any alien under 18 years of age who the Attorney \n     General finds has engaged in delinquent behavior, is an \n     escape risk, or has a security need greater than that \n     provided in a facility appropriate for children.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``facility \n     appropriate for children'' means a facility, such as foster \n     care or group homes, operated by a private nonprofit \n     organization, or by a local governmental entity, with \n     experience and expertise in providing for the legal, \n     psychological, educational, physical, social, nutritional, \n     and health requirements of children. The term ``facility \n     appropriate for children'' does not include any facility used \n     primarily to house adults or delinquent minors.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADJUSTMENT TO PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS.\n\n       Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l)(1) The Attorney General may, in the Attorney \n     General's discretion, adjust the status of an alien under 18 \n     years of age who has no lawful immigration status in the \n     United States to that of an alien lawfully admitted for \n     permanent residence if--\n       ``(A)(i) the alien (or a parent or legal guardian acting on \n     the alien's behalf) has applied for the status; and\n       ``(ii) the alien has resided in the United States for a \n     period of 5 consecutive years; or\n       ``(B)(i) no parent or legal guardian requests the alien's \n     return to the country of the parent's or guardian's domicile, \n     or with respect to whom the Attorney General finds that \n     returning the child to his or her country of origin would \n     subject the child to mental or physical abuse; and\n       ``(ii) the Attorney General determines that it is in the \n     best interests of the alien to remain in the United States \n     notwithstanding the fact that the alien is not eligible for \n     asylum protection under section 208 or protection under \n     section 101(a)(27)(J).\n       ``(2) The Attorney General shall make a determination under \n     paragraph (1)(B)(ii) based on input from a person or entity \n     that is not employed by or a part of the Service and that is \n     qualified to evaluate children and opine as to what is in \n     their best interest in a given situation.\n       ``(3) Upon the approval of adjustment of status of an alien \n     under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall record the \n     alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the \n     date of such approval, and the Secretary of State shall \n     reduce by one the number of visas authorized to be issued \n     under sections 201(d) and 203(b)(4) for the fiscal year then \n     current.\n       ``(4) Not more than 500 aliens may be granted permanent \n     resident status under this subsection in any fiscal year.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ASSIGNMENT OF GUARDIANS AD LITEM TO ALIEN CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Assignment.--Whenever a covered alien is a party to an \n     immigration proceeding, the Attorney General shall assign \n     such covered alien a child welfare professional or other \n     individual who has received training in child welfare matters \n     and who is recognized by the Attorney General as being \n     qualified to serve as a guardian ad litem (in this section \n     referred to as the ``guardian''). The guardian shall not be \n     an employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n       (b) Responsibilities.--The guardian shall ensure that--\n       (1) the covered alien's best interests are promoted while \n     the covered alien participates in, or is subject to, the \n     immigration proceeding; and\n       (2) the covered alien understands the proceeding.\n       (c) Requirements on the Attorney General.--The Attorney \n     General shall serve notice of all matters affecting a covered \n     alien's immigration status (including all papers filed in an \n     immigration proceeding) on the covered alien's guardian.\n       (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``covered \n     alien'' means an alien--\n       (1) who is under 18 years of age;\n       (2) who has no lawful immigration status in the United \n     States and is not within the physical custody of a parent or \n     legal guardian; and\n       (3) whom no parent or legal guardian requests the person's \n     return to the country of the parent's or guardian's domicile \n     or with respect to whom the Attorney General finds that \n     returning the child to his or her country of origin would \n     subject the child to physical or mental abuse.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress commends the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service for its issuance of its ``Guidelines for Children's \n     Asylum Claims'', dated December 1998, and encourages and \n     supports the Service's implementation of such guidelines in \n     an effort to facilitate the handling of children's asylum \n     claims.\n\n     SEC. 6 GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE REPORT.\n\n       The General Accounting Office shall prepare a report to \n     Congress regarding whether and to what extent U.S. Embassy \n     and consular officials are fulfilling their obligation to \n     reunify, on a priority basis, children in foreign countries \n     whose parent or parents are legally present in the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Mar. 8, 2000]\n\n                     INS Treats Children Shamefully\n\n       Reaching the U.S. mainland usually is no easy feat for \n     illegal immigrants fleeing their homelands. Whether crossing \n     the ocean by boat or trudging miles across desert, immigrants \n     nearly always face a journey that is dangerous and traumatic. \n     For the children of these immigrants, who often have no say \n     in their parents' decision to flee to the United States, that \n     trauma too often is compounded once they arrive--by an \n     American immigration system that treats kids like criminals.\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service says children \n     detained by the agency must be moved to a safe, kid-friendly \n     environment within 72 hours of their initial detention, \n     unless they are suspected criminals or considered a flight \n     risk. Advocates for these children say that rule rarely is \n     enforced. Instead, immigrant children typically are separated \n     from their loved ones and locked in juvenile detention \n     facilities, often before the INS has a chance to determine \n     the family's status.\n       Because of a worsening space crunch at INS facilities, \n     nearly 1,000 of the 4,000 children detained by the INS within \n     the past year have been remanded to secure, jail-like \n     facilities where many have remained for months. The children \n     typically wear prison uniforms, and many are forced to mingle \n     with the teenage convicts also housed in the facilities. \n     Unlike the convicts, immigrant children get no legal \n     representation, and no adult guardians are appointed to \n     protect their interests.\n       This shameful treatment of children is a symptom of the \n     broader problems plaguing U.S. immigration policy. It is a \n     system that\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\n     allows legal U.S. residents to be detained indefinitely on \n     the basis of secret evidence. It is a system that no longer \n     gives judges discretion in deportation cases. And it is a \n     system that even the INS's own chief has described as slow, \n     inefficient and poorly managed.\n       The INS is expected to issue new rules that will require \n     jails housing non-criminal INS detainees to meet specific \n     standards of care. Immigrant advocates hope the new rules \n     will give detainees the right to make phone calls, meet with \n     lawyers and prevent guards from subjecting them to arbitrary \n     strip searches.\n       Even if those rules pass, they should be only the first of \n     many reforms initiated by the INS and Congress to ensure that \n     all detainees--especially children--are treated more humanely \n     by the U.S. government.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Mar. 21, 2000]\n\n                   Immigration Law Busts Up Families\n\n                       (By Llewelyn G. Pritchard)\n\n       Llewelyn G. Pritchard is a Seattle attorney at Helsell \n     Fetterman. He is chairman of the American Bar Association \n     Advisory Committee to the Immigration Pro Bono Development \n     and Bar Activation Project. He is a former member of the \n     boards of the Washington State Bar Association and the \n     American Bar Association.\n       Lately we have been bombarded with media stories about \n     immigrant families being ripped apart due to draconian \n     measures undertaken by the U.S. Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service.\n       There is the Atlanta story about the German mother of two \n     who, having applied for citizenship, faces deportation \n     instead because years ago she admitted to pulling another \n     girl's hair over the affections of a boy.\n       There is the Falls Church, Va., mom who called police after \n     repeatedly being beaten by her husband. She was arrested for \n     biting him after he sat on her. She faces deportation and \n     separation from her children, all of whom were born in the \n     United States.\n       But we don't have to look beyond he boundaries of \n     Washington to hear terrible tales.\n       There is the case of Emma Hay. This Puyallup mother of \n     four--all U.S. citizens--is being deported. Her crime was to \n     answer the telephone for a visiting relative who said he \n     didn't speak English well enough to talk to the caller.\n       By simply saying her relative ``couldn't help the caller \n     today, but could help tomorrow,'' Hay was caught in a drug \n     sting and charged with ``using a communications facility to \n     facilitate the distribution of cocaine.'' Although she \n     claimed she wasn't aware of her cousin's activities, she \n     pleaded guilty and was convicted on federal drug charges. She \n     got no jail time, and was placed on probation for three \n     years, which she successfully completed.\n       After living in our state for more than 20 years and \n     running a restaurant, Hay now faces deportation. While the \n     original incident earned her a probationary sentence because \n     she agreed to plead guilty, it has now become a deportable \n     offense.\n       Hay was grabbed by the INS upon returning from a vacation, \n     all because the tough 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act has tipped the legal scales \n     against non-citizens * * *. This draconian law reclassifies \n     past infractions and makes them deportable offenses even in \n     cases where no prison time has been served or where there is \n     evidence of rehabilitation.\n       This law also widely expanded the definition of aggravated \n     felony. Non-citizens convicted of ``aggravated felonies'' are \n     now not only deportable, but are also ineligible for a waiver \n     from deportation or even judicial review.\n       Woe to the immigrant who applies to become a citizen only \n     to be trapped in the INS web, as in the case of the German \n     mother in Atlanta, or who seeks to re-enter the country as \n     Hay did.\n       So now Hay sits in a Louisiana jail, thousands of miles \n     away from her lawyer and her children, awaiting deportation. \n     Her 20-year-old daughter has quit school to support the \n     family.\n       What's the benefit of justice to her, her family or our \n     country? There is none under this new act.\n       The INS has the fastest growing prison population in the \n     United States. There are more than 17,000 immigrants \n     detained, with predictions of 23,000 by year's end. Most \n     detainees do not have legal representation, even though the \n     INS adopted standards in 1998 allowing lawyer access in \n     federal INS facilities.\n       The majority, or 60 percent, are warehoused in state and \n     local jails, at great cost to our overburdened prison budget. \n     Those folks are far away from immigration lawyers and have no \n     guarantee of legal access. Even those in federal INS \n     facilities are in remote areas and access is often difficult.\n       We should be outraged. This can't be happening in America. \n     Newcomers live in all our communities, work at our sides, \n     attend our churches and our schools. They are our neighbors \n     and our friends.\n       But there is some good news.\n       The 60,000 member American Bar Association Section of \n     Litigation, which will meet in Seattle in early April, \n     announced that it will adopt our ABA immigration project as \n     one of its pro bono efforts, pairing up with lawyers with \n     detainees around the country.\n       Their efforts will help some of the most defenseless in our \n     country. I applaud and welcome them in this worthy fight.\n       We must make certain that the basic premise and promise of \n     our country is not forgotten: ``Justice for all.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Jan. 9, 2000]\n\n         The Littlest Refugees Merit Better Treatment From INS\n\n       Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris \n     Meissner projects uncommon compassion. ``Both U.S. and \n     international law recognize the unique relationship between \n     parent and child,'' she said in announcing her decision to \n     return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba. \n     ``Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both \n     American Immigration law and INS practice.''\n       Unfortunately her agency doesn't always practice what she \n     preaches. Case in point: Two children, ages 8 and 10, were \n     repatriated to Haiti while their mother, desperate with worry \n     not knowing what had happened to them, was brought to Miami \n     for medical care.\n       Yvena Rhinvil and her children were among some 400 \n     passengers on the boat from Haiti that ran aground off Key \n     Biscayne on New Years Eve. They were trying to enter the \n     United States illegally. Both the Coast Guard and INS now say \n     that they didn't know about the children. Had it known, INS \n     says it would have tried to keep the kids with their mother.\n       But Ms. Rhinvil says she spoke of her kids both to an \n     interpreter before being taken off the ship and once again on \n     land. What mother wouldn't?\n\n\n                         kids don't come first\n\n       If indeed the INS didn't know, it should have known before \n     it sent the children back. Nobody asked, which is \n     inexcusable. Fortunately an aunt watched Ms. Rhinvil's \n     children. But who knows if there were other unaccompanied \n     youths aboard that boat?\n       The problem is that the INS is not equipped either by \n     mission or staffing to look out for the welfare of children. \n     First and foremost it is an enforcement agency, charged with \n     protecting our borders. Both policy and practice reflect it.\n       Another case: A 15-year-old Chinese girl remained in a \n     Portland, Ore., juvenile jail more than six weeks after being \n     granted asylum and after an uncle in New York had agreed to \n     take her. She and five other teens fled China in April, only \n     to spend eight months in a criminal facility.\n       Unfortunately, locking up minors such as these teens is not \n     an exception. That's because INS practices regarding children \n     vary widely by their nationality and INS district. Even \n     though international law and common decency dictate that \n     refugee children be detained only as a last measure and only \n     for a short time, detention in criminal juvenile facilities \n     happens regularly in some districts. Without caretakers and \n     most often without legal advisers, what hope can detained \n     children have of knowing or demanding their legal rights?\n\n\n                           little protection\n\n       For the most part, the Florida INS District treats minors \n     better than most. Unaccompanied children without U.S. \n     relatives are often placed with Catholic Charities facilities \n     such as Boystown. Children who arrive with parents are \n     typically placed in a hotel until the family is deported or \n     released from detention.\n       Ideally all minors could be released to caring relatives, \n     and the INS frequently does this. Yet without the \n     intervention of child-welfare authorities, there is little \n     protection from abuse. The INS mandates such intervention \n     only when the child is from China or India because of the \n     track record of child servant-slaves. Yet Haitian children, \n     too, have been known to be sold into servitude.\n       Capricious and inconsistent treatment of children simply is \n     unacceptable when last year alone the INS had some 5,300 \n     minors in its custody.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Edwards, \n        Mr. Campbell, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Bryan, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n        Roth):\n  S. 2386. A bill to extend the Stamp out Breast Cancer Act; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        breast cancer research stamp reauthorization act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bill entitled \nthe Breast Cancer Research Stamps Reauthorization Act of 2000. I am \npleased that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has joined me as the lead \ncosponsor.\n  The Breast Cancer Research stamp is the first stamp in our nation's \nhistory\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\ndedicated to raising funds for a special cause. Since the stamp's \nissuance in the summer of 1998, the U.S. Postal Service has sold 164 \nmillion Breast Cancer Research stamps--raising over $12 million for \nbreast cancer research. In addition, the stamp has focused public \nawareness on the devastating disease and has stood out as a beacon of \nhope and strength around which breast-cancer survivors can rally.\n  Unfortunately, without congressional action, the Breast Cancer \nResearch stamp will expire on July 28, 2000. The Breast Cancer Research \nStamp Reauthorization Act of 2000 would permit the sale of the Breast \nCancer Research stamp for 2 additional years. The stamp would continue \nto cost 40 cents and sell as a first class stamp. The extra money \ncollected will be directed to breast cancer research at the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Department of Defense.\n  A Breast Cancer Research stamp remains just as necessary today as 2 \nyears ago. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among \nwomen in every major ethnic group in the United States. More than 2 \nmillion women are living with breast cancer in America, 1 million of \nwhom have yet to be diagnosed.\n  Breast cancer continues to be the number one cancer killer of women \nbetween the ages of 15 and 54. This year alone, 182,800 women will be \ndiagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,800 women will die from the \ndisease. The disease claims another woman's life every 15 minutes in \nthe United States.\n  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are \nbecoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. According to the \nAmerican Association for Cancer Research, 8 million people are alive \ntoday as a result of cancer research. The bottom line is that every \ndollar we continue to raise will save lives.\n  I am pleased to report that this reauthorization bill has over 39 \noriginal cosponsors and broad support within the health community.\n  Let me just repeat a couple of the glowing comments from the many \ngroups in support of this bill. It shows the truly astounding impact of \nthis stamp.\n  The Susan G. Komen Foundation writes:\n\n       The Breast Cancer Research stamp has not only raised \n     millions of dollars by providing a convenient and innovative \n     mechanism for public participation in the [battle against \n     breast cancer], but it has also focused public awareness on \n     this devastating disease.\n\n  Betsy Mullen of Women's Information Network--Against Breast Cancer \nadds:\n\n       This bill, if passed will provide an innovative, simple and \n     now proven way for individuals to make a substantial \n     contribution to fund federal cancer research and to continue \n     to be a part of what has become an effective public-private \n     partnership.\n\n  The American Association of Health Plan attests:\n\n       We've heard from our physicians about women who have \n     scheduled examinations or mammograms after purchasing the \n     stamp or receiving a card or letter posted with it.\n\n  Oliver Goldsmith, chairman of the Southern California Permanente \nMedical Group, writes:\n\n       The Breast Cancer Research stamp captures the essence of \n     innovation, volunteerism and partnership that are such an \n     integral aspect of our country's history and spirit. This \n     vital legislation will give all of us the opportunity to \n     continue to work together to eradicate breast cancer. The \n     American people can realistically continue to raise millions \n     of dollars a year to fund cutting edge research to end this \n     rampant disease that claims the lives of all too many breast \n     cancer victims in this country and around the world.\n\n  Other supporters of the Breast Cancer Stamp Reauthorization Act of \n2000 include the American Cancer Society, the American Medical \nAssociation, the Y-Me National Breast Cancer Organization, Leadership \nAmerica, the National Association of Women's Health, the American \nCancer League, the American College of Surgeons, Friends of Cancer \nResearch, the California Nurses Association, the Association of \nReproductive Health Care Professionals, and many others.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2387. A bill to improve global health by increasing assistance to \ndeveloping nations with high levels of infectious disease and premature \ndeaths, by improving children's and women's health and nutrition, by \nreducing unintended pregnancies, and by combating the spread of \ninfectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                       GLOBAL HEALTH ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nheld its third hearing on global health since 1997. Our first hearing \nwas the first of its kind in the Congress, when we highlighted how \ndisease outbreaks and impoverished public health systems half a world \naway directly threaten Americans. Since then, the interest in these \nissues in the Congress, the Administration, the media and the public \nhas skyrocketed.\n  Today, there are about a dozen pieces of legislation pending which \ndeal with some aspect of global health, the President has proposed \nmajor increases in funding and policy initiatives to encourage the \npharmaceutical companies to invest in new vaccines against HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, TB, and other major killers, and the World Health Organization \nis setting the pace for us all to tackle these challenges with new \nenergy and new resources.\n  This sea change is a reflection of the magnitude of the challenges \nand opportunities, as well as a recognition of the essential role the \nUnited States must play in global health.\n  There is no need to recite at length what has spurred this interest, \nbut I do want to cite a couple of illustrative facts:\n  In America, each year we spend over $4,000 per person on health care.\n  In the countries where 2 billion of the world's people live in \ndesperate poverty, only $3 to $5 per person per year is spent on health \ncare.\n  It would cost just $15 per person per year to address most of the \nurgent health needs of those 2 billion people.\n  With that $15 per person, we could prevent or cure the many millions \nof deaths caused by tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, diarrheal \ndiseases, measles, HIV/AIDS, and pregnancy related diseases.\n  That is the challenge we face. The benefits to the world, and to the \nUnited States, should be obvious. In an increasingly interdependent \nworld, reducing the threats posed by infectious diseases and poor \nreproductive health, and the social and economic consequences of \npoverty and disease, is absolutely key to our own future security and \nprosperity.\n  The Congress has become increasingly seized with these issues. \nHowever, while I strongly support most of the bills that have been \nintroduced--and I am a cosponsor of Senator Kerry's ``Vaccines for the \nNew Millennium Act,'' they have tended to focus narrowly on the \neradication of specific diseases and the development of new vaccines.\n  These are admirable and important goals, but I have always believed \nthat global health consists of a broader set of issues that must be \naddressed together. Our primary challenge is to provide the resources \nto enable developing countries to build the capacity--both human and \ninfrastructure, to support effective public health systems. That was \nthe motivation for my infectious disease initiative three years ago, \nwhich since then has provided an additional $175 million to support \nprograms in surveillance, anti-microbial resistance, TB, and malaria.\n  Today, in an effort to build on that initiative, I am introducing new \nlegislation to authorize an additional $1 billion to support five key \ncomponents of global health. The ``Global Health Act of 2000,'' targets \nHIV/AIDS; other deadly infectious diseases such as TB, malaria, and \nmeasles; children's health; women's health; and family planning.\n  Together, these five groups of issues account for over 80 percent of \nthe disproportionate burden of disease and death borne by the 2 billion \npeople living in the world's poorest countries. This legislation, an \nidentical version of which Congressman Joseph Crowley has introduced in \nthe House, has the strong support of the Global Health Council, the \nworld's largest consortium of private and public companies and \norganizations, agencies and governments, involved in public health.\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\n  We have the technology to do this. The key missing ingredient is \npolitical will, and resources.\n  We can, and we must, recognize that we need to think in terms of far \nlarger amounts of money if we are serious about global health. Every \ndollar of the additional $1 billion called for in my legislation, which \nis approximately double the amount we currently spend on these \nactivities, is justified and urgently needed. And the payoff would be \nenormous, both in terms of lives saved and in future health care cost \nsavings.\n  Senator McConnell, the chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, has been a strong supporter of global health, and I will \nbe working in the Appropriations Committee to obtain the funds we need \nto achieve these goals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH;\n  S. 2389. A bill to provide additional assistance for fire and \nemergency services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n          21st century fire and emergency services act of 2000\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, firefighters and EMS personnel are \ntruly our nation's first responders. When the tragic images of natural \nor manmade disasters flash across our TV screens, there is one image \nthat stands alone. The American firefighter is always there to rescue \nthe family from a burning building, always there in the wake of a \nnatural disaster, and is always there should a terrorist strike in our \nnation's heartland. These scenes are played out around our country on a \ndaily basis. And while we see these images on TV as just a part of our \nsociety today, what is not realized is the cost our first responders \nbear.\n  The 1.2 million men and women that serve in our nation's 32,000 fire \ndepartments do so with little fanfare, and often with little or no pay. \nOur nation's first responders ask very little of us, but, thankfully, \nthey are always there when we need them.\n  That is why I have introduced the 21st Century Fire and Emergency \nServices Act which is a companion to the House-passed legislation. This \nlegislation is an important step forward for the fire and EMS \ncommunity.\n  Every year I hear from fire departments in Delaware who are looking \nto acquire state-of-the-art equipment to enhance their performance on a \nfire scene, or attempting to secure funding to train personnel in arson \ndetection. I also hear from fire personnel seeking funds to create all-\nimportant fire prevention programs at local elementary schools. These \nare just a few examples. The point is that for all too many \ndepartments, after the general operating expenses are calculated, there \nis no funding for this equipment or special program. Funds raised \nthrough chicken dinners, bingo and bake sales can only go so far.\n  Back home, the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association is sending \nout the call for help. My legislation establishes two grant programs at \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. The first is an $80 million \ncompetitive grant program for volunteer and paid fire and emergency \nservices departments. With these 50/50 matching grants, I believe this \nlegislation will give departments throughout our country an opportunity \nto have the thermal imaging camera or the health and wellness program \nneeded to help them do their jobs even better.\n  Second, this bill establishes a $10 million burn research grant \nprogram through FEMA. Under this program, safety organizations, \nhospitals, and governmental and nongovernmental entities that are \nresponsible for burn research, prevention, or treatment are eligible \nfor competitive grants to continue their important work.\n  Finally, this bill recognizes the contributions of volunteer \nfirefighters by providing $10 million to fully fund the USDA's \nVolunteer Fire Assistance Program. This program allows the nearly \n28,000 rural fire departments nationwide to apply for cost-share grants \nfor training, equipping and organizing their personnel. These rural \nfire departments represent the first line of defense for rural areas \ncoping with fires and other emergencies.\n  Personally, I am excited about the technology that is available to \nfirst responders today, and I am committed to working to ensure that \nevery department in Delaware and throughout the country has the tools \nit needs to make us all safer in our homes and communities. Let's not \nwait for the next disaster to hear the call.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a grant program that provides incentives \nfor States to enact mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearms \noffenses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     project exile: the safe streets and neighborhoods act of 2000\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because I \nam troubled. Guns are falling into the wrong hands. It's killing our \nchildren. It's killing our friends and our neighbors. It's creating \nmayhem in communities across America. That's why I'm introducing \nProject Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act of 2000.\n  It's no secret that gun control measures are very controversial and \nare subject to a great deal of debate--as they should be. But, in the \nheat of that debate, we must not lose sight of the real issue--gun \nviolence. There is nothing controversial about protecting our children, \nour families and our communities by keeping guns out of the wrong \nhands--the hands of armed criminals--not law-abiding citizens, Mr. \nPresident, but criminals.\n  The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act offers a simple, commonsense \napproach to fighting gun violence. My bill would provide $100 million \nin grants over 5 years to those states agreeing to impose mandatory \nminimum 5-year jail sentences on criminals who use or possess an \nillegal gun. As an alternative, a state can also qualify for the grants \nby turning armed criminals over for federal prosecution under existing \nfirearms laws. Therefore, a state has the option of having armed felons \nprosecuted in state or federal courts. Qualifying states can use their \ngrants for any purpose that would strengthen the ability of their \ncriminal or juvenile justice systems to deal with violent criminals.\n  Back in 1991, the Federal Government implemented a program to aim \nantigun violence efforts at the root of the problem--at criminals. This \nprogram--known as project Triggerlock--directed every U.S. attorney to \ncoordinate with federal, state, and local investigators to bring \nfederal weapons charges against armed criminals. Sentences for these \nprosecutions wee generally more severe than they would have been under \nstate laws. The program was hugely successful. In fact, simply by \nmaking gun prosecutions a federal priority, starting in 1991, Project \nTriggerlock took away over 2,000 guns from violent felons in just 18 \nmonths.\n  Tragically, Mr. President, despite the success of Project \nTriggerlock, the current administration has not aggressively prosecuted \nall armed criminals. Between 1992 and 1998, for example, the number of \ngun cases filed for prosecution dropped from 7,048 to about 3,807--\nthat's a 46-percent decrease. As a result, the number of federal \ncriminal convictions for firearms offenses have fallen dramatically.\n  Even worse, some federal firearms laws are almost never enforced by \nthis administration. While Brady law background checks have stopped \nnearly 300,000 prohibited purchasers of firearms from buying guns, less \nthan one-tenth of one percent have been prosecuted. Similarly, federal \ncriminal prosecutions for possession of a firearm on school grounds \nnumbered just eight in 1998, despite the fact that 6,000 individuals \nwere caught carrying guns to school. There's something wrong with this \npicture, Mr. President, something terribly wrong.\n  I believe most Americans would agree that we should take guns out of \nthe hands of armed criminals. I believe that most Americans would agree \nthat criminals who possess a firearm or use a firearm during the \ncommission of a violent crime or a serious drug trafficking offense \nshould face severe penalties. And, Mr. President, I also believe that \nmost Americans would favor legislation that offers a single, \nnoncontroversial, commensense approach to fighting gun violence.\n\n  So, today, I, along with my colleagues, introduce Project Exile: The \nSafe Streets and Neighbors Act, which builds on the previous success of \nprograms like Project Triggerlock and offers the kind of practical \nsolution we need to thwart gun crimes.\n  This approach works, Mr. President. For example, in 1997, Virginia \nrevived Project Triggerlock under the name ``Project Exile.'' \nSpecifically, the city of Richmond and the U.S. attorney implemented a \nprogram based on one simple principle: any criminal caught with a gun \nserves a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years in federal prison. \nPeriod. End of story. As a result, gun-toting criminals are being \nprosecuted six times faster, and serving sentences up to four times \nlonger than they otherwise would under state law. Moreover, the \nhomicide rate in Richmond already has dropped 40 percent.\n  It is clear that programs like Project Triggerlock and Virginia's \nProject Exile work, while at the same time being very simple. But \nstill, federal gun prosecutions have declined considerably during this \nadministration because it has not emphasized these programs. Why? I \nhave repeatedly questioned Attorney General Reno and her deputies about \nthis decline, and their standard response is that the Department of \nJustice is focusing on so-called ``high-level'' offenders, instead of \n``low-level'' offenders who commit a crime with a gun. With all due \nrespect, I consider that response to be bureaucratic nonsense. One \nthing I learned as Greene County Prosecutor in my home state of Ohio is \nthat any criminal who commits a crime with a gun is a high-level \noffender. And, I'm willing to bet that any citizen who has ever been a \nvictim of a gun-crime would agree.\n  Furthermore, the idea that there are a lot of so-called ``low-level'' \noffenders, who commit only one crime with a gun, is just plain wrong. \nThe average armed criminal commits 160 crimes a year; that is an \naverage of three crimes per week. These people are, by themselves, \nwalking crime waves.\n  Along the same lines, Attorney General Reno recently said that she \nwould aggressively prosecute armed criminals, but only if they commit a \nviolent crime. Again, that type of law enforcement policy just does not \nmake sense. Current law prohibits felons from possessing guns--we \nshould enforce the law. We should aggressively prosecute armed \ncriminals before they use those guns to injure and kill people.\n  We need to take all of these armed criminals off the streets. That is \nhow we will prevent crime and save lives. Why wait for armed criminals \nto commit more heinous crimes before we prosecute them to the full \nextent of the law? Why wait when we can do something that will make a \ndifference now, before another Ohioan--or any American--becomes a \nvictim of gun violence.\n  Every state should have the opportunity to implement Project Exile in \ntheir high-crime communities. The bill that we are introducing today \nwill make this proven, commonsense approach to reducing gun violence \navailable to every state. Programs like Project Triggerlock and Project \nExile will take guns out of the hands of violent criminals. They will \nmake our neighborhoods safer. They will save lives.\n  We can take concrete steps toward making our streets and \nneighborhoods safer from armed criminals by passing the ``Safe Streets \nand Neighborhoods Act.'' I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support and pass this legislation. It's time to protect our \nchildren and our families. It's time to get guns out of the wrong \nhands. It's time we take back our neighborhoods and our communities \nfrom the criminals and take action to stop gun crimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 2391. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on (S)-6-chloro-3,4-\ndihydrol - 4 - cyclopropyethynyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 2392. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on (S)-6-chloro-3,4-\ndihydro-\n4E-cyclopropyethynyl - 4 - trifluoro-methyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n    legislation to temporarily reduce tariffs on hiv-combating drugs\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills, each of\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\nwhich would temporarily suspend the tariff collected on imports of two \nHIV-combating drugs, thus lowering their price for HIV-infected \nconsumers in the United States.\n  The two drugs are DPC 961 and DPC 083. They have been selected from \nhundreds of candidates to have superior attributes relative to \ncurrently marketed similar drugs. As such, their combined potency, \nexcellent resistance profile, lower protein binding, and longer plasma \nhalf life increases the probability that these drugs will successfully \ntreat both HIV patients who have not previously had a similar treatment \nas well as those HIV patients who have already developed resistance to \ncurrently available agents. According to publicly available \ninformation, there is no other HIV treatment in clinical trials that is \nexpected to be able to treat most patients with resistance to currently \navailable agents. DPC 961 and DPC 083 are also expected to have the \nadvantage of once daily therapy.\n  In addition, it is my expectation that the revenue impact of these \nmeasures will be determined by the Congressional Budget Office to be de \nminimus. There is no manufacturer of these drugs in the United States. \nIt is my hope that these measures will win the unanimous support of my \ncolleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2393. A bill to prohibit the use of racial and other \ndiscriminatory profiling in connection with searches and detentions of \nindividuals by the United States Customs Service personnel, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the reasonable search standards act\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nReasonable Search Standards Act. This act prohibits racial or other \ndiscriminatory profiling by Customs Service personnel. Representative \nJohn Lewis from Georgia has introduced similar legislation in the \nHouse.\n  Two years ago, I requested a GAO study of the U.S. Customs Service's \nprocedures for conducting inspections of airport passengers. The need \nfor this study grew out of an investigation report by Renee Ferguson of \nWMAQ-TV in Chicago and several complaints from African-American women \nin my home state of Illinois who were strip-searched at O'Hare Airport \nfor suspicion of carrying drugs. No drugs were found and the women felt \nthat they had been singled out for these highly intrusive searches \nbecause of their race. These women, approximately 100 of them, have \nfiled a class action suit in Chicago.\n  The purpose of the GAO study was to review Customs' policies and \nprocedures for conducting personal searches of airport passengers and \nto determine the internal controls in place to ensure that airline \npassengers are not inappropriately targeted or subjected to personal \nsearches.\n  Approximately 140 million passengers entered the United States on \ninternational flights during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Because there \nis no data available on the gender, race and citizenship of this \ntraveling population, GAO was not able to determine whether specific \ngroups of passengers are disproportionately selected to be searched.\n  However, once passengers are selected for searches, GAO was able to \nevaluate the likelihood that people with various race and gender \ncharacteristics would be subjected to searches that are more personally \nintrusive, such as strip-searches and x-rays, rather than simply being \nfrisked or patted down.\n  The GAO study revealed some very troubling patterns in the searches \nconducted by U.S. Customs Service inspectors.\n  GAO found disturbing disparities in the likelihood that passengers \nfrom certain populations groups, having been selected for some form of \nsearch, would be subjected to the more intrusive searches including \nstrip-searches or x-ray searches. Moreover, that increased likelihood \nof being intrusively searched did not always correspond to an increased \nlikelihood of actual carrying contraband.\n  Because of the intrusive nature of strip-searches and x-ray searches, \nit is important that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias \nin forcing passengers to undergo these searches.\n  GAO found that African-American women were much more likely to be \nstrip-searched than most other passengers. This disproportionate \ntreatment was not justified by the rate at which these women were found \nto be carrying contraband. Certain other groups also experienced a \ngreater likelihood of being strip-searched relative to their likelihood \nof being found carrying contraband.\n  Specifically, African-American women were nearly 3 times as likely as \nAfrican-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were only \nhalf as likely to be found carrying contraband. Hispanic-American and \nAsian-American women were also nearly 3 times as likely as Hispanic-\nAmerican and Asian-American men to be strip-searched, even though they \nwere 20 percent less likely to be found carrying contraband.\n  In addition, African-American women were 73 percent more likely than \nWhite-American women to be strip-searched in 1998 and nearly 3 times as \nlikely to be strip-searched in 1997, despite only a 42 percent higher \nlikelihood of being found carrying contraband. Moreover, among non-\ncitizens, White men and women were more likely to be strip-searched \nthan Black and Hispanic men and women, despite lower rates of being \nfound carrying contraband.\n  As with strip-searches, x-rays are personally intrusive and it is of \nparticular concern that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory \nbias in requiring x-ray searches of passengers suspected of carrying \ncontraband.\n  GAO found that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans were much \nmore likely to be x-rayed than other passengers. This disproportionate \ntreatment was not justified by the rate at which these passengers were \nfound to be carrying contraband.\n  Specifically, GAO found that African-American women were nearly 9 \ntimes as likely as White-American women to be x-rayed even though they \nwere half as likely to be carrying contraband. African-American men \nwere nearly 9 times as likely as White-American men to be x-rayed, even \nthough they were no more likely than White-American men to be carrying \ncontraband. Moreover, Hispanic-American women and men were nearly 4 \ntimes as likely as White-American women and men to be x-rayed, even \nthough they were only a little more than half as likely to be carrying \ncontraband. And among non-citizens, Black women and men were more than \n4 times as likely as White women and men to be x-rayed, even though \nBlack women were only half as likely and Black men were no more likely \nto be found carrying contraband.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing the Reasonable Search Standards \nAct. This bill is a direct response to the concerns raised by the GAO \nreport. The bill prohibits Customs Service personnel from selecting \npassengers for searches based in whole or in part on the passenger's \nactual or perceived race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual \norientation.\n  To ensure that a sound reason exists for selecting someone to be \nsearched, the bill requires Customs Service personnel to document the \nreasons for searching a passenger before the passenger is searched. The \nonly exception to this requirement is when the Customs official \nsuspects that the passenger is carrying a weapon.\n  The bill also requires all Customs Service personnel to undergo \nperiodic training on the procedures for searching passengers, with a \nparticular emphasis on the prohibition on profiling. The training shall \ninclude a review of the reasons given for searches, the results of the \nsearches and the effectiveness of the criteria used by Customs to \nselect passengers for searches.\n  Finally, the bill calls for an annual study and report on detentions \nand searches of individuals by Customs Service personnel. The report \nshall include the number of searches conducted by Customs Service \npersonnel, the race and gender of travelers subjected to the searches, \nthe type of searches conducted--including pat down searches and \nintrusive non-routine searches--and the results of these searches.\n  With this proposed legislation, I call on the Congress of the United \nStates to act, to make a commitment giving all persons entering and \nleaving our borders, regardless of gender, race, color,\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\nreligion, or ethnic background, the right to be treated fairly.\n  Lyndon B. Johnson once said, ``I am a free man, an American, a United \nStates Senator, and a Democrat, in that order.'' I am also all of \nthese, in that order.\n  As a man, I am saddened that, in this new millennium, women and \nminorities are disproportionately selected for intrusive searches at \nour nation's borders.\n  As an American, I am deeply troubled by the thought that any citizen, \nor non-citizen, might be detained and stripped or x-rayed because of \ntheir gender or the color of their skin.\n  As a United States Senator, I am proposing legislation to prohibit \nracial or other inappropriate profiling and establish statutory \nprocedures to track and prevent disproportionate search rates. This \napproval reflects our nation's basic posture of common sense and common \njustice.\n  I implore my colleagues to examine this issue from the viewpoint of \nthe nation and its entire people.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nstabilize indirect graduate medical education payments; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE TEACHING HOSPITAL PRESERVATION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill--\nThe Teaching Hospital Preservation Act of 2000--that would provide much \nneeded financial support for America's 144 accredited medical and \nosteopathic schools and 1,250 graduate medical education (GME) teaching \ninstitutions. Teaching hospitals are national treasures; these \ninstitutions are the very best in the world. Yet, today they find \nthemselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces reshape \nthe health care delivery system in the United States.\n  Markets do not provide for public goods such as teaching hospitals. \nEveryone benefits from public goods but no one has any incentive to \npay. It follows, therefore that for the most part teaching hospitals \nhave to be paid for by the public either indirectly through tax \nexemption or directly through expenditure.\n  The legislation I am introducing is similar to S. 1023--The Graduate \nMedical Education Payment Restoration Act of 1999--a bill I introduced \nduring the first session. Congressman Rangel is introducing an \nidentical bill in the House today.\n  My particular interest in this subject began in 1994, when the \nFinance Committee took up the President's Health Security Act. I was \nChairman of the Committee at the time. In January of that year, I asked \nDr. Paul Marks, M.D., President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer \nCenter in New York City, if he would arrange a ``seminar'' for me on \nhealth care issues. He agreed, and gathered a number of medical school \ndeans together one morning in New York.\n  Early on in the meeting, one of the seminarians remarked that the \nUniversity of Minnesota might have to close its medical school. In an \ninstant I realized I had heard something new. Minnesota is a place \nwhere they open medical schools, not close them. How, then, could this \nbe? The answer was that Minnesota, being Minnesota, was a leading state \nin the growth of competitive health care markets, in which managed care \norganizations try to deliver services at lower costs. In this \nenvironment, HMOs and the like do not send patients to teaching \nhospitals, absent which you cannot have a medical school.\n  We are, my friends, in the midst of a great era of discovery in \nmedical science--an era which might end prematurely if we are not \ncareful with our finances. It is certainly not a time to close medical \nschools. This great era of medical discovery is occurring right here in \nthe United States, not in Europe like past ages of scientific \ndiscovery. And it is centered in New York City. Progress over the past \n60 years has been remarkable: images of the inside of the human body \nbased on the magnetic resonance of bodily tissues; laser surgery; micro \nsurgery for reattaching limbs; and organ transplantation, among other \nwonders. Physicians are now working on a gene therapy that might \neventually replace bypass surgery. I can hardly imagine what might be \nnext.\n  The growth of managed for-profit care, which does not fund public \ngoods, combined with reductions in Medicare support for GME, is having \na deleterious effect on the financial position of teaching hospitals. \nThe Medicare program is the nation's largest explicit financier of GME, \nwith annual payments of about $5.4 billion in 1999. However, because of \npayment reductions set forth by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, \nMedicare support is eroding as well--down from $6.3 billion in 1997. \nAccording to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, between 1997 and \n1998, the margins for major teaching hospital have been slashed by more \nthan half, and are at their lowest point of the century. And this is an \naverage; individual hospitals have fared far worse.\n  With declining margins and many hospitals operating in the red, the \nmission of these fine institutions is in jeopardy. The teaching \nhospitals that we know and depend on today--including those in my state \nof New York-- may not be able to continue their work, or even to \nsurvive. If this is to happen, we could face what Walter Reich has \ncalled ``the dumbing down of American medicine.''\n  Last year, we forestalled some cuts enacted in the BBA by passing the \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) of 1999, however, this \nlegislation provided only short-term relief and does not go for enough. \nTo ensure that this precious public resource is maintained and the \nUnited States continues to lead the world in quality health care, my \nbill, the Teaching Hospital Preservation Act of 2000 would maintain \ncritically required funding.\n  The Teaching Hospital Preservation Act of 2000, with a total of 23 \ncosponsors, would freeze the scheduled reductions to the indirect \nportion of GME funding. Under the BBA, the indirect payment adjustor \nwas scheduled to be reduced from 7.7 percent to 5.5 percent by FY 2001. \nLast year, the BBRA slowed the cuts by holding the indirect payment \nadjuster at 6.5 percent in FY 2000, 6.25 percent in FY 2001 and 5.5 \npercent in FY 2002 and thereafter. BBRA restored about $500 million--\nover 5 years--in funding for teaching hospitals. The bill I introduce \ntoday would maintain the indirect payment adjuster at 6.5 percent. In \ntotal, this bill restores about another $2 billion over 5 years in GME \nfunding for teaching hospitals.\n  This bill would protect our nation's teaching hospitals and ensure \nthat the United States will continue to be in the forefront of \ndeveloping new cures, new medical technology, and training of the \nworlds finest medical professionals. Without this bill, the state of \nour nation's teaching hospitals and the delivery of health care will \nremain in jeopardy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teaching Hospital \n     Preservation Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REVISION OF REDUCTION OF INDIRECT GRADUATE MEDICAL \n                   EDUCATION PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 1886(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(B)(ii)) (as amended by section 111(a) of \n     the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement \n     Act of 1999 (113 Stat. 1501A-329), as enacted into law by \n     section 1000(a)(6) of Public Law 106-113) is amended--\n       (1) in subclause (IV), by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (2) by striking subclauses (V) and (VI) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(V) on or after October 1, 2000, `c' is equal to \n     1.6.''.\n\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Teaching Hospital Preservation \nAct that we are introducing today will restore much-needed support for \nthe nation's teaching hospitals by freezing the Medicare Indirect \nMedical Education adjustment at 6.5 percent. The so-called IME payments \nunder Medicare go to teaching hospitals to help defray their added \ncosts of caring for the sickest patients, training physicians, and \nproviding an environment in which clinical research can flourish. Under \ncurrent law, the IME payments will be reduced from their current level \nof 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent for fiscal year 2001 and 5.5 percent for \nfiscal year 2002 and future years. If these reductions take place, they \nwill have a devastating impact on the nation's teaching hospitals.\n  Enactment of this relief is essential to complete the task we began \nlast year in the Balanced Budget Restoration Act of 1999. Across the \ncountry, teaching hospitals continue to suffer severe financial losses. \nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges, even with \nenactment of last year's measure, the typical teaching hospital will \nstill lose more that $40 million in Medicare payments between 1998 and \n2002. At the most recent meeting of the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommittee, it was reported that the margins of major teaching hospitals \ndropped from 5.1 percent in 1997 to 2.3 percent in 1998. \nNotwithstanding major efforts by the leadership of this institutions to \nreduce their costs, there is every reason to believe this ominous trend \nis continuing.\n  In Boston, teaching hospitals lost $22 million just in the first \nquarter of the current fiscal year, and Boston is far from alone. The \nfinancial problems of the nation's pre-eminent teaching hospitals \naround the country are well-known. Cutbacks in care for patients, \nresearch, and teaching have already been implemented by many of these \nrespected institutions, and are being considered by many others. These \nteaching hospitals are the backbone of our health care system, and \nCongress should not stand silent in the face of these distressing \ndevelopments.\n  Teaching hospitals are facing substantially higher costs for drugs, \nlabor, medical devices and new technologies. The tight labor market is \npushing wages higher and higher. Despite these heavy financial \npressures. Medicare is scheduled to impose serious cutbacks in its \nreimbursements to teaching hospitals. The result of this shortfall may \nwell be disastrous for these indispensable institutions.\n  A significant part of the problem was caused by the excessive and \nunintended Medicare reductions required by the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997. Last year's Balanced Budget Restoration Act delayed reductions in \nthe IME adjustment. That relief was an important first step, but it was \nonly a first step. The legislation we are introducing today will ensure \nthat Medicare support for teaching hospitals remains at its current \nlevel.\n  The pre-eminence of American academic medicine is at stake. The \nnation's teaching hospitals provide the highest quality health care to \nthe sickest patients. They ensure the highest quality physicians \ntraining, and an unparalleled research capability. In addition, \nteaching hospitals are the safety net for 44 percent of the uninsured, \ndespite comprising only 6 percent of all hospitals. They perform a vast \narray of services to their communities, from neighborhood health \nprograms to drug treatment programs to well baby clinics. All of these \nprograms are in jeopardy if the currently scheduled cutbacks take \nplace. We cannot afford to let teaching hospitals fail. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in enacting this important bill this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 2396. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto contracts with the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District, Utah, \nto use Weber Basin Project facilities for the impounding, storage, and \ncarriage of nonproject water for domestic, municipal, industrial, and \nother beneficial purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n    legislation regarding the weber basin water conservancy district\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to take a step in addressing \nthe long-term water needs of Summit County, Utah. The bill I am \nintroducing today, to make a necessary technical correction, authorizes \nthe Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with the Weber \nBasin Water Conservancy District. This legislation would permit non-\nfederal water intended for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other \nuses to utilize federal facilities of the original Weber Basin Project \nfor various purposes such as storage and transportation.\n  In this case, the Smith Morehouse Dam and Reservoir was constructed \nby the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District in the early 1980's using \nlocal funding resources in order to create a supply of non-federal \nproject water. However, it has been determined that there is currently \na need to deliver approximately 5,000 acre feet of this non-federal \nSmith Morehouse water in conjunction with approximately 5,000 acre feet \nof federal Weber Basin project water to the Snyderville Basin area of \nSummit County, Utah and to Park City, Utah.\n  In 1996, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District entered into \naMemorandum of Understanding and Agreement to deliver this water \napproximately 14 miles from Weber Basin Weber River sources within a \ncertain time frame and dependent upon the execution of an Interlocal \nAgreement with Park City and Summit County. The Warren Act requires \nthat legislation be enacted to enable the District to move ahead with \nthis agreement with Summit County and Park City to deliver the water \nutilizing Weber Basin Project facilities built by the Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  There is an immediate need for the delivery of water to this area. \nThe Utah State Engineer halted the approval of new groundwater \ndevelopments in the area last year. At the same time, Summit County is \nexperiencing tremendous growth; in fact it is one of the highest growth \nareas in the state. Within the areas to be served, taxed by the Weber \nBasin District, there is a definite public need for an adequate, \nreliable, and cost effective water delivery project in order to meet \nthe future demands of this area.\n  Since there is precedent allowing the wheeling of non-federal water \nthrough federal facilities, my colleagues should realize that this is a \nnon-controversial piece of legislation. Therefore, I hope that Congress \nwill move quickly to pass this legislation next session and I look \nforward to working closely with my colleagues on the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources to move it quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Specter, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. \n        Kerrey):\n  S. 2398. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend the programs relating to organ procurement and transplantation; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               organ transplantation fairness act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Organ Transplantation \nFairness Act of 2000.\n  I thank my original cosponsors on this bill: Senators Schumer, \nDurbin, Santorum, Specter, Mikulski, Sarbanes, and Kerrey.\n  Our Nation's organ procurement and transplant system is in serious \nneed of change.\n  We could be saving more lives through organ transplants in this \ncountry than we are at the present time.\n  The purpose of our bill and the goals of our bill are threefold.\n  First, we want to increase the amount of organs that are being \ndonated all across the country.\n  There are many more people who need to receive organs to remain \nalive. They need organ transplants, and there are not a sufficient \nnumber of people donating those organs. This bill attempts to address \nthat issue.\n  Second, we want to bring greater fairness to how we allocate scarce \norgans after they are donated.\n  Right now those organs are not allocated in the best possible way. \nAnd because of problems in our allocation system, people are dying \nunnecessarily. We could be saving more lives.\n  The third goal of the bill is to seek to implement many of the \nrecommendations of the Institute of Medicine in\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\ntheir 1999 report entitled ``Organ Procurement and Transplantation.''\n  In attempting to improve the system of organ procurement transplants \nin this country, we have picked out many of the Institute of Medicine's \nrecommendations, and we tried to enact them into law. Our system is \nsaving many more lives than it used to.\n  Organ transplantation is fairly new to this country. If you go back \n20 years or so, there were very few organs being transplanted. But now \nmany more people are benefiting and going on to live healthy lives \nthanks to people who have donated organs, and thanks to successful \ntransplants. But as many lives as our system has saved, we are not \nsaving as many lives as we could.\n  I have a chart to demonstrate this. As of today, there are over \n68,000 American patients waiting for a life-saving organ transplant.\n  In 1998, the most recent statistics available, over 4,800 people died \nwhile on that organ transplant waiting list.\n  That means about 13 people a day are dying in this country while \nwaiting to get an organ that can be transplanted into their bodies.\n  I said earlier that we are not saving as many lives as we could save.\n  Let me demonstrate why that is the case, and why we know we are not \nsaving enough lives.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, in 1998, \nsome 71 percent of livers were transplanted to patients in the least \nurgent medical status categories. But at the same time that we were \ntransplanting those livers into patients in the least urgent medical \nstatus categories, in the same year, 1,300 patients died while waiting \nfor a liver.\n  How can it be that we are transplanting livers into patients who \naren't in the most critically ill categories, while at the same time \npeople in the most critical condition were dying for lack of a liver \ntransplant?\n  The reason for that is we have a system in our country that is based \non where you live. Whether you live or die because of an organ \ntransplant may depend not on how sick you are but on where you live in \nthis country.\n  Let's examine this a little bit more closely.\n  There is a private not-for-profit corporation in this country that \nhas been given the authority to be in charge of our Nation's organ \ntransplant and procurement network. They have set up a series of \nregions. They divided the whole country into regions. There are organs \nthat are available within those regions. But if you live outside one of \nthe regions where an organ is available, you are not liable to get one \nof the organs when it comes up.\n\n  As a Senator from Illinois, I think the simplest thing for me to do \nin illustrating this problem is to use Illinois as an example. Most of \nIllinois is in organ procurement organization district 29. You can have \na patient who lives in northern Illinois, just a few miles from the \nborder of Wisconsin, and this patient could need a liver transplant. He \nor she could be in status 1 medical condition, which means he or she is \nin the most critical category and in need of a liver transplant \nimmediately. A liver may become available just over the border in \nregion 37, the Wisconsin network. But that liver can't be sent to the \nperson in Illinois because that person in Illinois is in region 29--not \n37.\n  If a liver becomes available from a donor in Wisconsin, they will \nfirst look to see if they have a very critically ill person who needs a \nliver transplant in region 37. If they don't find such a person, then \nthey will go to somebody who is in a less urgent situation who doesn't \nneed the liver as quickly as that other person in Illinois. Thus, \nsomebody who may be in status 2, or even what they call status 3 \nmedical condition, which isn't as critical as status 1, could get the \nliver transplant up in Wisconsin. But that person a few miles south of \nthe border who needs the liver immediately, because he or she happens \nto live in Illinois, cannot get it. If an organ doesn't become \navailable in that region in which he or she lives, that person may not \nsurvive.\n  There is a saying in the real estate industry by the real estate \nbrokers and agents. When you go to them, they always tell you that \neverything and the value of your home depends on ``location, location, \nlocation.'' I bet not many Americans realize that in some cases if you \nare in need of a liver transplant or a heart transplant, your chances \nof survival are going to depend on your location, your location, your \nlocation.\n  The purpose of our bill is to try to open this system up, and instead \nof directing the organs to the people depending on where they live, \ninstead of determining whether people are going to live or die simply \nbased on accidents of geography, we try to bring sense to this whole \nsystem. We try to get organs to people in the most critical need of \nthose organs as soon as possible. We would hope to get those to the \nsickest people as soon as possible--the sickest people who have the \nchance of going on and having a successful transplant.\n  There comes a point when your organs are so damaged and you are so \nsick that it could be that a transplant would no longer help you. \nCertainly, we have to be careful to make sure that we get the organs to \nthose who are the sickest but who still have a good chance of surviving \nan organ transplant.\n  In addition, attempting to get the organs to the sickest patients \nfirst, making that our Nation's public policy, we would like to \nencourage a broader sharing of organs.\n  The Institute of Medicine's report suggested that each of these areas \nshould contain at least 9 million people. That is the minimum level for \noptimal sharing to get the organs out and save the most lives. We want \nto make sure we broaden these networks.\n\n  It isn't possible in all cases for all organs to be shared \nnationally. With the heart, for example, a heart cannot last much more \nthan 4 hours after it has been given by a donor. It has to be \ntransplanted quickly. Other organs, such as kidneys, my understanding \nis we can preserve them for over 24 hours, or even longer, and in that \ncircumstance it would be possible to have more nationwide sharing to \nget those organs allocated to the people who need them the most.\n  Another important provision of our legislation is to take a strong \nstand for the proposition that the private not-for-profit corporation \nthat now runs the whole Nation's organ procurement and transplant \nnetwork should have some public accountability. Members may have heard \nthat a bill passed by the House of Representatives provides no public \naccountability for this private corporation that has life or death \ncontrol over at least 68,000 Americans. There is no accountability in \nthat bill. They wouldn't be accountable to elected officials. They \ncould not be regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services. \nIf people had a complaint with how that organization was being run, \nthere would be little or no recourse. I guess you could knock on their \ndoors at their corporate headquarters in Richmond, VA, and ask them to \nlisten to you, but they wouldn't have to. They are private not-for-\nprofit corporations with no responsibility to make sure the best public \npolicy goals of this country are achieved.\n  I don't think that is right. I think we want this corporation to be \npublicly accountable to make sure that it is meeting the objectives of \nthe laws that are on the books and serving the public interest.\n  In addition, the Organ Transplantation Fairness Act of 2000 would \ncreate a national organ transplant advisory board. It implements the \nrecommendations of the Institute of Medicine in this regard by creating \nan advisory board that reviews the organ procurement and \ntransplantation network policies and advises the Secretary of our \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  We also put in place a process, based on sound medical criteria, for \nthe certification and recertification of what they call OPOs--organ \nprocurement organizations. It requires the OPOs that fail to meet \nperformance criteria to file a corrected plan, and they will have 3 \nyears to implement such a plan. We have to have a way of making sure \nthe organ procurement organizations in this country are doing a good, \nprofessional job. There has to be some accountability of those \norganizations.\n  One of the most important issues, of course, is encouraging more \norgan donations. Earlier this morning I had the opportunity to meet in \nmy office with several individuals who had actually been the recipients \nof donated organs. Those transplants they had had saved\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\ntheir lives. One of them was a constituent of mine. His name was Kent \nSchlink from Peoria, IL. When Kent was in his late twenties, he had to \nhave a heart transplant to correct a defect he had in his heart dating \nfrom his early childhood. He was very sick. He was on the waiting list \nfor quite some time. He ultimately had a heart transplant at St. \nFrancis Hospital in Peoria, IL, that saved his life. His life was saved \nat a time when he had a 6-month-old child. He has gone on to have \nanother child. To see him talk about the joy to be with his young kids \ndrives home what a gift people who donate organs make--a gift of life.\n  We also had the opportunity to meet in my office with Britney Green, \na young girl whom I believe is 13 years old. She had a liver transplant \nwhen she was 3 years old. She is currently on a waiting list for a new \nheart. She has had a very tough road to hoe, but she is a bright and \ncheerful young lady. She is very supportive and hopes we can improve \nthe system in this country.\n  Finally, I wish to mention one other young man who impressed me. His \nname is Danny Canal. Danny is 14 years old, and he is an incredibly \nbright, wonderful young man. He is a transplant recipient who actually \nhad a four-organ transplant, if you can believe that. Not only did he \nhave four organs transplanted, he actually had two sets of those organs \nbefore the third set began functioning properly. This wonderful young \nkid who has been saved by these organ transplants probably wouldn't \nhave had to have so many organs transplanted into him, because he \noriginally only needed a transplant of a small intestine. \nUnfortunately, it took so long, he was on the waiting list for the \ntransplant of that intestine so long that his other organs started to \nfail, to the point where he had to have his pancreas and other organs \nreplaced. Then there were problems and it took three times before they \ngot that right. He is a wonderful young man. It was a very moving \nexperience to hear his story.\n\n  We need to encourage more people to donate organs so there can be \nmore Danny Covals and Kent Schlinks and Britney Greens whose lives can \nbe saved in this country. Our bill does a lot to address that. We seek \nto establish a grant program to assist organ procurement organizations \nand other not-for-profit organizations in developing and expanding \nprograms aimed at increasing organ donation rates.\n  We create a congressional donor medal to honor living organ donors \nand organ donor families, and give credit to the tremendous gift they \nare giving by giving an organ. We establish a system of support for \nState programs to increase organ donation, and we provide some \nfinancial support to pay for nonmedical travel expenses of living \ndonors.\n  We have long had a transplant policy in this country that it was \nagainst public policy, against the law to pay people for donating \norgans. That creates many medical and ethical issues. I agree with that \nprohibition against paying people for donating organs. Everybody who \ndoes it is doing it just for the internal reward of helping somebody \nelse. They are not doing it for any financial gain. However, I think it \nis appropriate that we could at least help defray some of the \nnonmedical travel expenses of the living donors. Most health insurance \npolicies do, in fact, now in this country cover the medical expenses \nassociated with donating the organ.\n  The bill also bans lobbying by the organ procurement and transplant \nnetwork administrator. That is the private not-for-profit corporation \nin Richmond, VA. We prohibit that firm which administers the program \nunder contract with the Department of Health and Human Services from \nusing fees that it collects from transplant patients to lobby Members \nof Congress. That firm is collecting, I believe, $375 from every person \nwho is on an organ donor waiting list in the country. We want to make \nsure those fees are helping to match organs with patients so that more \npeople can be saved. We do not think they need to be using those funds \nto lobby Members of Congress.\n\n  Finally, one of the things the bill does is it actually comes in and \nabolishes State laws that are on the books in several States that are \nreferred to as organ hoarding laws. Several States now, I regret to \nsay, have enacted laws saying organs donated within their State borders \ncannot be given to people outside of their States. One of those States \nis the State of Wisconsin, that borders on my State of Illinois.\n  I love Wisconsin. I think it is one of the most beautiful States in \nour country. Every summer my family and I go up and we vacation in \nnorthern Wisconsin. We enjoy their fishing and beautiful forests and \nthe wildlife there. But I disagree with the law they have on the books \nthat says if somebody in Wisconsin donates an organ, it cannot save a \nlife in Illinois. I know Walter Payton, if he could have had an organ \ndonated from a Green Bay Packer fan, would have gladly accepted it.\n  We do not need to be engaging in the Balkanization of our country. We \ndo not need to have these kinds of barriers erected between States. We \nare, in the end, one nation, one giant state. This Balkanization has no \nplace in our country. A report from the Institute of Medicine and other \nreports have indicated the statutes on the books in these several \nStates greatly diminish the effectiveness and equity of a national \norgan transplant policy. We need to make sure that is no longer \nallowed.\n  The other thing I point out is many of the people from Wisconsin may \ncome down and get listed on a transplant list at a hospital in Chicago. \nThen the effect of that law, passed by the Wisconsin legislature, would \nbe to deny their own resident of the State of Wisconsin the ability to \nget the transplant at maybe a very renowned hospital in Chicago, or \neven one they go to in New York or another big State. That is \ninappropriate. It is not good public policy. Our bill would very firmly \nsay that those laws would no longer be allowed in the States, and I \nthink we would be on our way toward developing a much better national \npolicy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Organ Transplantation \n     Fairness Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the public interest to maintain and \n     continually improve a national network to ensure the fair and \n     effective distribution of organs among patients on the \n     national waiting list irrespective of their place of \n     residence or the location of the transplant program with \n     which they are listed, and to ensure quality and facilitate \n     collaboration among network members and individual medical \n     practitioners participating in the network activities.\n       (2) The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Network'') was created \n     in 1984 by the National Organ Transplant Act (Public Law 98-\n     507) in order to facilitate an equitable allocation of organs \n     among all patients on a national basis.\n       (3) The Federal Government should continue to provide \n     Federal oversight of the Network and is responsible for \n     protecting the public's health care interest and ensuring \n     that the policies of the Network meet the goals established \n     by this Act.\n       (4) The responsibility for developing, establishing, and \n     maintaining medical criteria and standards for organ \n     procurement and transplantation should be a function of the \n     Network, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     should provide oversight to ensure compliance with this Act \n     and other applicable laws.\n       (5) The network should be operated by a private \n     organization under contract with the Department of Health and \n     Human Services.\n       (6) The Federal Government is responsible for ensuring that \n     the efforts of the Network serve patients and donor families \n     in the procurement and distribution of organs.\n       (7) The Federal Government should take immediate action to \n     improve organ donation rates and increase the number of \n     organs available for transplantation.\n       (8) There is a significant disparity between the number of \n     organ donors and the number of individuals waiting for organ \n     transplants, and it is in the public's best interest to have \n     a system of organ allocation that ensures that transplant \n     candidates with similar severity of illness have similar \n     likelihood of transplantation irrespective of their place of \n     residence or the location of the transplant program with \n     which they are listed.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Organ Donation.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the factors that impact organ donation rates are \n     complex and require a multifaceted approach to increase organ \n     donation rates;\n       (2) the Federal Government should lead the national effort \n     to increase organ donation\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n     and develop programs with the transplant community to \n     research and implement a best practices approach to \n     increasing organ donation; and\n       (3) a generous contribution has been made by each \n     individual who has donated an organ to save a life.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrevise the coverage of immunosuppressive drugs under the Medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n comprehensive immunosuppressive drug coverage for transplant patients \n                              act of 2000\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning this bill I am introducing today, which will help many \nMedicare beneficiaries who have had organ transplants.\n  Every year, over 4,000 people die waiting for an organ transplant. \nCurrently, over 62,000 Americans are waiting for a donor organ. It is \nthis scarcity that has fueled the current controversy over organ \nallocation.\n  Given that organs are extremely scarce, Federal law should not \ncompromise the success of organ transplantation. Yet that is exactly \nwhat current Medicare policy does, because Medicare denies certain \ntransplant patients coverage for the drugs needed to prevent rejection.\n  Medicare does this in three different ways. Firstly, Medicare has \ntime limits on coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. Permanent Medicare \nlaw only provides immunosuppressive drug coverage for 3 years with \nexpanded coverage totaling 3 years and 8 months between 2000 and 2004. \nHowever, 61 percent of patients receiving a kidney transplant after \nsomeone has died still have the graft intact 5 years after \ntransplantation. 76.6 percent of patients receiving a kidney from a \nlive donor still have their transplant intact after 5 years post \ntransplantation. For livers, the graft survival rate after 5 years is \n62 percent. For hearts, the 5 year graft survival rate is 67.7 percent. \nSo many Medicare beneficiaries lose coverage of the essential drugs \nthat are needed to maintain their transplant.\n  Secondly, Medicare does not pay for anti-rejection drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, who received their transplants prior to becoming a \nMedicare beneficiary. So for instance, if a person received a \ntransplant at age 64 through their health insurance plan, when they \nretire and rely on Medicare for their health care they will no longer \nhave immunosuppressive drug coverage.\n  Thirdly, Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants \nperformed in a Medicare approved transplant facility. However, many \nbeneficiaries are completely unaware of this fact and how it can \njeopardize their future coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. To receive \nan organ transplant, a person must be very ill and many are far too ill \nat the time of transplantation to be researching the intricate nuances \nof Medicare coverage policy.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the ``Comprehensive \nImmunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients of 2000 Act'' \nwould remove these short-sighted limitations. The bill sets up a new, \neasy to follow policy: All Medicare beneficiaries who have had a \ntransplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of \ntheir transplant, would be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs \nwere needed.\n  I am introducing this bill on behalf of some of the constituents that \nI have met who are unfortunately very adversely affected by the current \ngaps in Medicare coverage.\n  Richard Hevrdejs was a Chicago attorney in private practice until \n1993. Unfortunately, he suffered a debilitating heart attack that year, \nwhich left him unable to work and on disability. In 1997, suffering \nfrom congestive heart failure, he was placed on a Heart-Mate machine at \nthe University of Illinois Medical Center (UIC). In April of 1998, he \nreceived a heart transplant at UIC but because UIC was not at the time \na Medicare approved facility for heart transplants, Medicare will not \ncover his immunosuppressive drugs. Richard was near death when he had \nhis transplant and was in no condition to research the intricacies of \nMedicare coverage policies. His drug costs are now around $25,000 per \nyear. He gets some assistance from the drug company medical assistance \nplans and he has a Medigap policy that provides a little assistance. \nBut for the most part, he is forced to watch all his savings dwindle \nbecause of Medicare's coverage gaps.\n  Anita Milton is from Morris, Illinois. In 1995, she became so \ndisabled that she was no longer able to work and was forced onto \ndisability. The following year, her lungs gave up and  she had to have \na bilateral lung transplant. Because Medicare s not available for 2 \nyears after a person becomes eligible for disability, Anita was not on \nMedicare when she had the transplant. Today, the huge bills for the \ntransplant remain at collection agencies. Because Anita was not on \nMedicare when she received her transplant, she does not receive \nMedicare coverage for the antirejection drugs that she needs. She \nreceives $940 in disability payments per month. She is now on Medicaid \nbut due to the spend down requirements in Illinois, she must spend $689 \non drug costs to get Medicaid converge for her drugs. In effect, she \ngets coverage every month. Anita cannot afford her anti-rejection drugs \nand she tried to scale back on them. This caused her to nearly reject \nthe transplant. Consequently, she has lost a third of her lung capacity \npermanently. As Anita said at a Town Hall meeting in Chicago in January \n``these Medicare and Medicaid rules make no sense.''\n\n  I am introducing this bill on the same day that another bill the \n``Organ Transplant Act of 2000'', which I am an original cosponsor is \nalso being introduced. The ``Organ Transplant Fairness Act'' also seeks \nto change another aspect of Federal law to improve the Nation's organ \nallocation system. The two bills are good companions. It makes little \nsense to improve the organ allocation system to maximize the success of \norgan transplantation and increase the number of lives saved, if we do \nnot at the same time reduce the ways that Medicare jeopardizes \ntransplants by denying transplant patients the anti-rejection drugs \nthey need to maintain their transplant.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill the \n``Comprehensive Immunosuppresive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients \nof 2000'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide jurisdictional standards for imposition of \nState and local business activity, sales, and use tax obligations on \ninterstate commerce, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 the new economy tax simplification act\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kohl to \nintroduce the New Economy Tax Simplification Act or NETSA. Electronic \ncommerce is reshaping our society. In many ways, the strong economic \nconditions we currently enjoy are a result of the convenience, lower \ncosts, and global connections provided by the internet. The question \nfor us as a nation is how to manage this new enterprise so that it \ncontinues to benefit our nation's economy, particularly in regard to \nthe taxation of e-commerce.\n  So far, the government's hands-off approach is working. Our nation's \nunemployment and inflation rates are at record lows and higher paying \njobs are being created at a tremendous rate. Many financial experts \nattribute the record low inflation rates to the Internet. A University \nof Texas study found that the Internet economy grew an astounding 68% \nrate in the past 12 months.\n  Another sign of the good times is the surplus revenue flowing into \nfederal and state treasuries all over the nation. The federal \ngovernment's budget is balanced for the first time in a generation and \nthe 50 states ended 1998 with a collective surplus of $11 billion. \nStates are seeing revenue increases of more than 5 percent a year \nthrough the 1990's. This hardly seems like a compelling rationale for \nlevying taxes on the Internet. Yet a heated debate is raging between \nthose who want to keep the internet free of taxes and state and local \ngovernments who seek to impose widespread taxes on internet sales.\n  The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce (ACEC), set up by \nCongress last year to develop recommendations on Internet taxes, \nrecently concluded its final meeting but failed to reach the required \nsupermajority to make any formal recommendations. Notably, it did agree \nby a simple majority vote to extend the current moratorium on Internet \ntaxes for five years.\n  The Commission is set to deliver it's report to Congress tomorrow. It \nwill recommend that we extend the internet tax moratorium for another \nfive years and I fully support this. The Commission will also ask \nCongress to establish nexus safeguards--to make clear when a State or \nmunicipality has the power to levy taxes. Our legislation establishes \nthese important nexus safeguards.\n  Currently, online sales are governed by the very same tax rules that \ngovern mail order sales. The existing rules of the road are based upon \ntwo prior Supreme Court decisions--National Bellas Hess case in 1967, \nand the Quill case in 1992. Both decisions established the power of \nstate tax authority to be limited by nexus--or the scope of a company's \nconnection to the taxing state.\n  Local sales taxes are incredibly complex. There are 7,600 different \ntax jurisdictions across the country--within these systems about 600-\n700 rate changes occur per year. There are 46 different sets of rules \n(45 states and the District of Columbia have state sales tax). If \nforced to comply with these rules, companies would be filing 425 tax \nreturns each month or 5,100 a year.\n  The Gregg/Kohl bill, the New Economy Tax Simplification Act (NETSA), \ncodifies these mail order tax rules as outlined in the Quill decision, \nupdating this decision for the 21st century.\n  Sales/use tax nexus rules are court-based, and income tax nexus rules \nare based upon a 1950s federal statute that applies only to tangible \ngoods. The Gregg/Kohl plan would codify nexus standards across the \nboard. This legislation would update and strengthen the nexus standards \nfor the 21st Century economy--ensuring that intangible sales, web pages \nand servers do not cause nexus. It maintains current constitutional \nprinciples and keeps state powers within their jurisdictions, and does \nnot try to pre-empt a state's tax authority within its own borders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2401\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senator Gregg and I are introducing \nlegislation, the New Economy Tax Simplification Act, to ask government \nto step out of the way of the growing Internet economy and take a \nmiddle ground approach to taxation of Internet commerce. Our \nlegislation does not stop any one State from forcing Internet companies \nwithin its borders to collect the sales taxes collected by any other \nbusiness within its borders. But it does stop every one of the over \n7000 local taxing jurisdictions from imposing every one of their unique \nrules, regulations, and rates on every business that sells over the \nInternet or through the mail.\n  We are not here today to ask for special treatment for companies that \nsell on the Internet. We simply want to make sure that businesses that \nare tackling the market with 21st century technology are not bled to \ndeath by the Byzantine local tax system.\n  All companies--regardless of whether they now sell over the Internet \nor not--benefit from the economic boom and consumer convenience \nprovided by computer commerce. If you don't sell over the Internet now; \nyou probably buy there. If you don't work for a company whose economic \nfortune is tied to Internet sales or information, your spouse, child, \nor neighbor probably does. If you haven't invested in one of these \nsuccessful Internet businesses, they have probably invested in you: in \nthe charities in your community, in the jobs that are growing our \neconomy everywhere; in the State programs financed by the taxes these \ncompanies rightly pay to the States in which they have a physical \npresence.\n  Our bill provides a clear set of standards for businesses operating \nacross state lines through mail-order sales or the Internet. And--very \nsignificantly--it also protects the rights of state and local officials \nto determine tax policy within their own jurisdictions.\n  Some have called for a complete ban on sales taxes on Internet goods. \nStill others have claimed that companies should collect sales taxes on \nall of their products without regard to the point of sale or the state \nor residence of the consumer.\n  We strike a balance between these two extremes. Just as my Wisconsin \nconstituents should not have to pay local sales taxes for schools and \nsewers in Texas, Nebraska, or New York; it also makes sense that a \nWisconsin business should not be forced to collect taxes to support \nfire and police protection in the other states. Businesses should \ncollect the sales taxes that support the government services they \nreceive.\n  But the main reason I am here today is to protect against a Federal \nred tape nightmare that would prevent the very growth that we all wish \nto promote. There are over 7,000 tax jurisdictions in this country, all \nwith their own tax rates, exemptions, audit requirements and appeals \nprocedures. Requiring compliance with all those jurisdictions would \nmean learning and complying with 46 sets of rules. Under this scenario, \ncompanies would have to file more than 425 tax returns every month. \nThat amounts to approximately 5100 tax returns every year.\n  Internet and mail order companies, as well as traditional main street \nstores who are developing or using Internet services, serve consumers \nwho like the convenience of phone or Internet shopping or who are \nunable to leave their homes to shop. They offer\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\ngreater convenience and greater choice. And they offer small specialty \nbusinesses the chance to grow into successful big businesses.\n  Our bill will allow these vital markets to continue to flourish--free \nfrom a tangle of tax red tape. It will also allow state and local \nofficials to continue to collect taxes as they see fit within their own \njurisdictions. We believe it strikes the proper balance, and we look \nforward to convincing our colleagues that it is worthy of their \nsupport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2402. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance and \nimprove educational assistance under the Montgomery GI bill in order to \nenhance recruitment and retention of members of the Armed Forces, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n       helping our professionals educationally (hope) act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before you today to introduce \nlegislation that addresses the educational needs of our men and women \nin uniform and their families. I call this measure the HOPE Act of \n2000: HOPE, Helping Our Professionals Educationally--that is, our \nmilitary professionals.\n  The great Stephen Ambrose, the marvelous historian of World War II, \nthe author of ``D-Day'' and other books, has said the GI bill is the \nsingle best piece of legislation ever passed by the Federal Government.\n  Last year, Time magazine named the American GI as the Person of the \nCentury--how appropriate. That alone is a powerful statement about the \nhigh value of our military personnel. They are recognized around the \nworld for their dedication and commitment to fight for our country and \nfor peace in the world. This past century has been the most violent one \nin modern memory. The American GI has fought in the trenches during the \nfirst World War, the beaches at Normandy, in the hills of Korea, in the \njungles of Vietnam, in the deserts of the Persian Gulf, and most \nrecently in the valleys of the Balkans.\n  During that period, the face of our military and the people who fight \nour wars has changed dramatically. The traditional image of the single, \nmostly male, drafted, and ``disposable'' soldier is now gone. Today we \nare fielding the force for the 21st century. This new force is a \nvolunteer force, filled with men and women who are highly skilled, \nmarried, and definitely not disposable. Gone are the days when quality \nof life for a GI meant a beer in the barracks and a 3-day pass. Now, we \nknow we have to recruit a soldier but retain a family.\n  We have won the cold war. This victory has further changed the world \nand our military. The new world order has given way to a new world \ndisorder. United States is responding to crises around the globe--\nwhether it be strategic bombing or humanitarian assistance--and our \nmilitary is often seen as our most effective response and our best \nambassadors. In order to meet these challenges, we are retooling our \nforces to be lighter, leaner, and meaner. This is a positive move. \nAlong with this lighter force, our military professionals must be \nhighly educated and highly trained.\n  Our Nation is currently experiencing the longest continuous peacetime \neconomic growth in our history. This economic expansion has been a boon \nfor our country. However, there has been a downside to this growing \neconomy insofar as our Armed Forces are concerned. With the enticement \nof quick prosperity in the civilian sector it is more difficult than \never to recruit and retain our highly skilled forces.\n  In fiscal year 1999, the Army missed it recruiting goals by 6291 \nrecruits, while the Air Force missed its goal by 1,732 recruits. Pilot \nretention problems persist for all services; for fiscal year 1999 the \nAir Force ended up 1,200 pilots short and the Navy ended 500 pilots \nshort. We have other problems. The Army is having problems retaining \ncaptains, while the Navy faces manning challenges for surface warfare \nofficers and special warfare officers. It is estimated that $6 million \nis spent to train a pilot. We as a nation cannot afford to continually \ntrain our people, only to lose them to the private sector. It is \nunarguably far better to retain than retrain.\n  There is hope that we are now beginning to address these challenges. \nLast year was a momentous one for our military personnel. The Senate \npassed legislation that significantly enhances the quality of life for \nour military personnel. I am the Ranking Democrat on the Armed Service, \nCommittee. The Senate, with my vote and support, passed legislation \nthat significantly enhances the quality of life for our military \npersonnel from retirement reform to pay raises. This Congress is on \nrecord supporting our men and women in uniform. However, more must be \ndone.\n  In talking with our military personnel on my visits to the military \nbases in Georgia and around the world, we know that money alone is not \nenough. One of the things I would like to do is focus on education as a \nwonderful addition to the positive incentives we offer people to come \ninto the military and stay in the military. Education, as a matter of \nfact, is the No. 1 reason service members come into the military. \nUnfortunately it is also the No. 1 reason why its members are leaving. \nWe have to restructure our educational program in the military. We have \nto have a new GI bill. We have to provide hope to our military people, \nhope that the military can become the greatest university they will \never encounter.\n  Last year the Senate began to address this issue by supporting \nimproved education benefits for military members and their families but \nwe encountered some concerns in the House. Since last year, we have \ngone back and studied this issue further. In reviewing the current \nMontgomery GI bill--named after the wonderful Representative from \nMississippi, Congressman Sonny Montgomery--we found several \ndisincentives and conflicts among the education benefits offered by the \nservices. These conflicts make the GI bill, which is actually an earned \nbenefit, less attractive than it could be.\n  My legislation will improve and enhance the current educational \nbenefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century.\n  One of the most important provisions of my legislation would give the \nService Secretaries the ability to authorize a service member to \ntransfer his or her basic MGIB benefits, educationally, to family \nmembers. Many service members tell us that they really want to stay in \nthe service, but do not feel that they can stay and provide an \neducation for their families. This proposed change will give them an \nopportunity to stay in the service and still provide an education for \ntheir spouses and children. It will give the Service Secretaries a very \npowerful retention tool by allowing them to authorize transfer of basic \nGI bill benefits, that are earned through the service of the service \nman or woman, anytime after 6 years of service.\n  To encourage members to stay longer, the transferred benefits could \nnot be used until completion of at least 10 years of service. I believe \nthat the services can use this much like a reenlistment bonus to retain \nvaluable service members. It can be creatively combined with \nreenlistment bonuses to create a very powerful and cost effective \nincentive for highly skilled military personnel to stay in the Service. \nIn talking with service members upon their departure from the military, \nwe have found that family considerations play a crucial role in the \ndecision of a member to continue their military career.\n  I found in discussions with military families and service members \nthat at the 8- to 10- to 12-year mark when young service members are \nbeginning to make a choice about whether to stay in the military, that \nchoice is driven not so much by their own choice to serve the country--\nobviously they want to serve the country and stay in the military--that \nchoice is more and more driven by family needs, whether their spouse is \nemployed or whether their spouse would like to gain an extra degree or \nwhether they need to create a college fund for their kids.\n  Reality dictates that we must address the needs of the family in \norder to retain our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n  My legislation would also give the Secretaries the authority to \nauthorize the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, known as VEAP. \nThose\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\nVEAP participants and those active duty personnel who did not enroll in \nMontgomery GI bill to participate in the current GI bill program. The \nVEAP participants would contribute $1,200, and those who did not enroll \nin the Montgomery GI bill would contribute $1,500. The services would \npay any additional costs of the benefits of this measure.\n  Another enhancement made by my proposal to the current GI bill \nextends the period in which the members of Reserve Components can \nutilize the program. I was shocked to find out that currently, Reserve \nmembers lose their education benefits when they leave the service or \nafter 10 years of service. Amazing, they have no benefits when they \nleave service. My legislation will permit them to use the benefits up \nto 5 years after their separation from the military. This will \nencourage them to stay in the Reserves for a full career.\n  It is obvious we are calling upon our reservists and our guards men \nand women more and more to fulfill our commitments around the globe. \nThis will, I think, fulfill this Nation's commitment, certainly to our \nreservists, for an improvement in their educational opportunities.\n  Other provisions of this legislation would allow the Service \nSecretaries to pay 100 percent tuition assistance or enable service \nmembers to use the GI bill to cover any unpaid tuition and expenses \nwhen the services do not pay 100 percent of tuition.\n  This will allow a service member an additional incentive to use the \nGI bill in service. Education begets education.\n  I believe this is a necessary next step for improving education \nbenefits for our military members and their families. We have to offer \nthem credible choices. If we offer them such options and treat the \nmembers and their families properly, we will show them our respect for \ntheir service and dedication, which they expect.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas and salute \nthe work she has done on behalf of retail businesses in border \ncommunities in Texas on the very issue I am about to discuss.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution seeking parity \namong the countries that are parties to the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement with respect to the personal exemption allowance for \nmerchandise purchased by returning residents. I am pleased to be joined \ntoday by Senators Moynihan, Kyl, Gregg, Hutchison, and Leahy as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  NAFTA was intended to remove trade barriers among the countries of \nthe United States, Canada, and Mexico. While some of the goals of NAFTA \nhave been realized, glaring inequities remain. One such inequity that \naffects small businesses, particularly retailers, located in border \ncommunities is the difference in personal exemption allowances \npermitted by the U.S. versus the allowances permitted by Canada and \nMexico.\n  For Maine citizens living near the U.S./Canadian border, moving \nfreely and frequently between the two countries is a way of life. \nCross-border business and family relationships abound. The difference \nin personal exemption allowances, however, puts Maine businesses near \nthe Canadian border at a considerable disadvantage in relation to their \nCanadian counterparts. Let me explain why. A United States citizen \ntraveling to Canada for fewer than 24 hours is exempt from paying \nduties on $200 worth of merchandise. For trips over 48 hours, the \nexemption increases to $400 worth of merchandise. Under our laws, \nCanadian stores are able to serve both Canadian and American customers \nand, because of the exemption level, can sell Americans a significant \namount of merchandise duty-free.\n  Unfortunately, this situation only works one way. A Canadian citizen \nis allowed a duty-free personal exemption allowance of only $50 for a \n24-hour visit and $200 for a 48-hour visit. This means that a Canadian \nshopping for the day in the border communities of Fort Kent, Madawaska, \nor Calais or indeed anywhere in Maine can bring home only $50 worth of \nmerchandise before a duty is imposed. This is a significant deterrent \nto Canadians who would otherwise shop in Maine communities.\n  This disparity harms many Maine businesses, including Central \nBuilding Supplies, a small, family-owned home building materials \nbusiness that has been in the same location in Madawaska, Maine for 35 \nyears. Its owner wrote to me concerned about this issue. Over the past \ncouple years, his small store has lost sales in kitchen cabinets, \nwindows, wood flooring, and ceramic tile largely due to the inequity in \nduty allowances and the exchange rate. Whether they are located in the \nSt. John Valley or in Washington County, small businesses cite similar \nproblems. The allowance disparity also hurts stores in the Aroostook \nCentre Mall and the Bangor Mall, which have traditionally attracted \nCanadian shoppers.\n  This discrepancy in personal exemption allowances gives an enormous \ncompetitive advantage to the Canadian and Mexican retailers. It gives \nthese retailers to our north and the south access to cross-border \nshoppers while limiting that same opportunity for American retailers. \nMr. President, this is not fair trade, and this is not free trade. This \nparity should be eliminated.\n  The resolution I am submitting today would express the sense of the \nSenate that the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of \nthe Treasury should initiate discussions with officials of the \nGovernments of Canada and Mexico to achieve parity with respect to the \npersonal exemption allowance structure. In the event that parity in the \npersonal exemption is not reached within one year after the date of the \nadoption of this resolution, this resolution would require the United \nStates Trade Representative and the Secretary of the Treasury to submit \nrecommendations to Congress on whether legislative changes are \nnecessary to achieve personal exemption parity. The steps set forth in \nthis resolution would begin to resolve this inequity. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its swift passage.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for not only yielding but for \ncosponsoring this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I commend my colleague from Maine for submitting this \nresolution. It is very similar to a resolution I submitted 2 years ago. \nUnfortunately, the U.S. Trade Representative has not taken this cause \nas a serious cause. I hope with bipartisan support on Senator Collins' \nresolution the U.S. Trade Representative will see this is an issue on \nthe northern border and on the southern border. It is a very serious \nissue that severely disadvantages retailers in the United States and \nalso is a handicap for the consumers in both Canada and Mexico that \nwant to purchase big items such as television sets, refrigerators, \nwashing machines, and dryers available on the borders that they are not \nable to purchase without huge tariffs.\n  We passed the North American Free Trade Agreement to do away with \ntariffs so we would have free and open trade across our borders. It is \nnot working when it comes to retailing in that cross border area where \npeople walk back and forth. Parity is achieved if you fly in and out of \nour three countries, but not if you go across by car.\n  It is a terrible inequity. I hope Senator Collins' resolution gets \nthe attention of our U.S. Trade Representative about the seriousness of \nthis issue.
