Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. I \nthank in particular Rev. Mike Coleman, of Hannibal, MO, for coming to \nthis Chamber today to call us to our highest and best. He prayed about \njustice and he prayed about mercy, he prayed about the components of \nattitude and spirit that will help us achieve that which the people \nhave sent us to do. The real opportunity we have is to live at the \nmaximums of our existence rather than to perform at the minimums. When \nwe invite the presence of the Almighty as we begin these proceedings, \nwe equip ourselves to point toward the maximums instead of to dwell on \nthe minimums.\n  So as we approach this day, I thank Rev. Mike Coleman for coming from \nHannibal, MO, hometown of Mark Twain. I think it was Mark Twain, the \nphilosopher, who said there is nothing quite so embarrassing as a good \nexample. Well, I do not think the Reverend is embarrassing to us, but \nhe does set a good example as he calls us to our highest and best, and \nit is the prayer of all of us together with him that today we would \nserve the people with compassion and dignity and with justice and \nmercy.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Virginia for allowing \nme to make these remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. It is a great \npleasure for those of us who join in the opening of the Senate to have \nthe Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. I have been here 21 years, and at \nlong last this essential and I think necessary practice, which is \ncelebrated all over America every day, particularly in the schools, and \nso forth, is now observed in the Senate.\n  The words of our guest Chaplain today were very stirring because this \ncould be one of the final days in our Senate life before we go on a \nrecess, which will enable us to join our families and spend some time \nwith our constituents and others.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to welcome the guest Chaplain as well and \nsay, in light of Mark Twain's reputation, Rev. Coleman could have \nhelped him a great deal in his attitude with a little enlightenment in \nspiritual matters.\n  I think Hannibal could have used the Reverend back in the time of \nMark Twain. It might have been a little bit different. I love Mark \nTwain, but he was a little wry. And I just want everyone to know I \nrecognize the irony of the guest Chaplain being from Hannibal, MO, the \nhome of Mark Twain.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be delighted.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It might have been that Mark Twain got that education \nafter he moved out East. He did end up more in the territory of the \neast coast, but his roots were solid and good, nourished by the right \nvalues.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no question about that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may just add a little to that \ncolloquy, it is my recollection that Mark Twain had some fairly pithy \nremarks on the Congress of the United States from time to time. Perhaps \nwe should include some of those in the Record. My\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nmother came from St. Louis, MO, so I feel that I am particularly \nblessed by the presence of this Chaplain today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10268-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Under the previous order, there now shall be \n30 minutes of debate equally divided to be followed with the vote en \nbloc on the nominations.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I thank the Senate leadership with \nrespect to this nomination. It has been a unique one for various \nreasons. The elements of that uniqueness are well known to my \ncolleagues. I shall not speak in detail about the tradition of \n``holds'' but I think much of the general public is somewhat perplexed \nabout the procedures in the Senate.\n  There has been discussion as to the procedure on this nomination and \nthe use of what is referred to as a ``hold.'' There is a diversity of \nviews within this body on the use of a ``hold,'' but, in my judgment, \nit is an important and proper procedure utilized by Senators in \nconjunction with what I view as the balance of power established by the \nConstitution in the coequal branches of the Government: the executive \nbranch, the power of nomination by the President, and the Senate and \nits power of advice and consent.\n  The use of the hold is an exercise of that balance of power between \nthe two branches. In this instance, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader and, of course, the minority leader, and others who have worked \nto bring this nomination to this point where today the Senate will \nrender its advice and consent on this very important nomination.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I thank many other Senators who have worked with \nme--Senator Hagel, Senator Grassley, Senator Voinovich, and my \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware, Mr. Biden who will be speaking \nmomentarily. I yield for the comments of the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to put a question to the Senator \non the hold because I have been reading newspaper reports that I think \nhave completely misinterpreted how the hold process operates. These \nreports have alleged that the Senate rules contain a provision that \nenables any Member of the Senate, in effect, to hold up action either \non a nominee or on legislation and sort of that is that. That is not \nthe case.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct; it is tradition--\n--\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is a courtesy that is extended to a Member when he \nplaces a hold. The leadership can move ahead if the Member is being \nrecalcitrant. Of course, it is up to Members to exercise a hold with \nsome self-restraint. They may get the extra time they need, but, in my \njudgement, it ought not to be used as a weapon that completely \nsubmerges the nomination or the legislation.\n  I interjected because I am very concerned. I have read a number of \nnewspaper reports that seem to suggest that the rules of the Senate are \nsuch that any Member can simply place a hold on a nomination and \npreclude any action. That is not the case. It is a courtesy that has \nbeen extended to Members by the leadership, but the leadership can \nalways move ahead if they determine it is an urgent matter. Of course, \nthey try to work it out so Members are willing to have it come up. That \nis what has happened in this instance.\n  I particularly express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia for his efforts to try to move this matter forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland. He is \nquite accurate in his recitation of the rules of the Senate. This is by \ntradition. I suggest we not deal too much with what took place in the \npast on this nomination, but I felt that this Record this morning \nshould reflect, for those who are following the nomination, my judgment \nwith regard to the tradition of a Senator seeking a hold.\n  Again, it is part of that balance of power between the two branches. \nFor example, Senator Grassley, in his case, feels very strongly about \nthe need to protect those individuals who are commonly referred to as \nwhistleblowers. They should be protected. Senator Grassley, after \nhaving talked with him many times, recognized the Holbrooke nomination \nis of importance, but he carefully evaluated his responsibility as one \nof those leaders in the Senate who have protected the rights of \nwhistleblowers. That is behind us.\n  Many Senators have worked on this nomination. I express my \nappreciation again to the leadership and those Senators, particularly \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  The facts about this nominee are well known. I have known him \npersonally for a number of years. I have watched his distinguished \ncareer, and in the course of the morning, I will add some facts. But I \nwant to yield the floor momentarily to my colleague from Delaware.\n  The point is that my concern about this nomination and its timeliness \nis because of the fact that we now have in Kosovo a force under the \nNATO Command of General Clark, Operation Joint Guardian. While we had \nhoped that this military operation would have had a smooth operational \nhistory, in fact it has encountered many unforeseen problems, problems \nwhere our troops and the troops of other nations had to perform all \ntypes of diverse duties. Many of these young men and women who are \ncourageously participating in this operation have had no formal \ntraining in the military with respect to many of the responsibilities \nthey are now undertaking.\n  The United Nations, under a force known as United Nations Mission in \nKosovo, referred to as UNMIK, has had a very slow start getting \norganized and into the field to perform duties that are currently being \nperformed by the NATO military.\n  One of the reasons for working to accelerate the consideration of \nthis nomination is that in knowing Mr. Holbrooke and his forcefulness \nand his background, he, I believe, is better qualified than anyone else \nI know of today to take on this important post and to accelerate the \nfunctions of the United Nations in this region.\n  The sooner they get in, the less risk to the men and women of the \nArmed Forces currently undertaking many missions which they are doing \nquite\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\nwell, despite the fact they have had little or no formalized training \nin operating civil, local governments in the village of Kosovo. \nFortunately, this force is under the command of the NATO Commander, \nGeneral Clark. General Clark and Ambassador Holbrooke have known each \nother for many years. They have worked together. They participated in \nthe Dayton accords, for which Ambassador Holbrooke deserves great \ncredit, and I will have further comment on that later.\n  Also, Ambassadors, when they report for their duties, may be \nfortunate to have a spouse who is quite interested in those duties and \nperform as a team. This is going to be an extraordinary husband and \nwife team of Richard Holbrooke and Kati Marton, his wife. She is a \nnoted authoress. She has roots in central Europe. She is a beautifully \neducated and cultured woman. I have had the privilege of knowing her \nfor a number of years. They will be an extraordinary team in this \nimportant post.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nbiography of Richard Holbrooke.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Richard C. Holbrooke\n\n       Richard C. Holbrooke was the chief negotiator for the 1995 \n     Dayton Peace Accord, which served to bring peace and an end \n     to human rights abuses in Bosnia, while serving as Assistant \n     Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, from \n     September 1994 to February 1996. Beginning June 1997, \n     Holbrooke served as Special Presidential Envoy for Cyprus, \n     and in 1998 he was Special Presidential Envoy for Kosovo. \n     Prior to becoming Assistant Secretary of State, he was U.S. \n     Ambassador to Germany.\n       President Carter appointed him in 1977 as Assistant \n     Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, a post \n     he held until 1981. During his tenure, among other major \n     events, the United States established full diplomatic \n     relations with China. He is the only person ever to hold two \n     regional Assistant Secretary of State posts.\n       Holbrooke began his governmental career in 1962, joining \n     the Foreign Service immediately after graduating from Brown \n     University. After studying Vietnamese, he was sent to Vietnam \n     and, in the following six years, served in a variety of posts \n     related to Vietnam--first in the Mekong Delta as a provincial \n     representative working on rural development, for the Agency \n     for International Development (AID), and then as a staff \n     assistant to Ambassadors Maxwell Taylor and Henry Cabot \n     Lodge. In 1966 he was reassigned to the White House, working \n     on the Vietnam staff to President Johnson. During 1967-69, he \n     wrote one volume of the Pentagon Papers, served as a special \n     assistant to Undersecretaries of State Nicholas Katzenbach \n     and Elliot Richardson, and was a member of the American \n     Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks on Vietnam, headed \n     successively by Averall Harriman and Henry Cabot Lodge.\n       Following these assignments Holbrooke spent a year as a \n     fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. \n     From 1970 to 1972 he was Peace Corps Director in Morocco. In \n     1972, he took leave from the Foreign Service to become \n     Managing Editor of the quarterly magazine Foreign Policy, a \n     position he held until 1976. During 1974-75 he also served as \n     a consultant to the President's Commission on the \n     Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign \n     Policy, and was a contributing editor of Newsweek magazine's \n     International Edition. In 1976 he coordinated National \n     Security Affairs for the Carter-Mondale presidential \n     campaign.\n       In 1981 he move to the private sector, forming a consulting \n     firm, Public Strategies, with James A. Johnson. He became a \n     Managing Director at Lehman Brothers in 1985. As a banker and \n     diplomat, he has traveled to over 100 countries, including \n     over 65 trips to China alone. He covered both domestic and \n     foreign clients at Lehman Brothers, working on a wide variety \n     of transactions.\n       In 1992 he chaired the Bipartisan Commission on \n     Reorganizing the Government for Foreign Policy.\n       His most recent position in the private sector has been as \n     Vice Chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, \n     based in New York.\n       Holbrooke has had long involvement in the non-governmental \n     organization community. He is current Chairman of Refugees \n     International; Chairman of the American Academy in Berlin; \n     Chairman of the National Advisory Council of the Harriman \n     Institute, and a member of numerous Boards of directors and \n     committees.\n       Holbrooke adds the Eleanor Roosevelt Val-Kil Medal to a \n     long list of distinguished awards and honorary degrees \n     already received. He is the author of ``To End a War,'' on \n     his Balkan peacemaking experiences, and co-author of Counsel \n     to the President, the memoirs of Clark Clifford, as well as \n     numerous articles on foreign policy.\n       Holbrooke was born on April 24, 1941 in New York. He \n     received a bachelor's degree from Brown University. He has \n     two sons, both television producers. He is married to author \n     Kati Marton and lives in New York.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that concludes my opening remarks. I may \nhave further remarks about this nominee, but I want to share the time \nnow with my distinguised colleague from Delaware. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is finally \nconsidering the nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be the United \nStates Representative to the United Nations.\n  Before stating my reasons why I strongly believe that Ambassador \nHolbrooke should be confirmed, let me briefly review the process which \nled us to this day.\n  In June 1998, the President announced his intention to nominate \nAmbassador Holbrooke for the job of UN Ambassador. The formal \nnomination was delayed, however, until February of this year by an \ninvestigation into alleged ethical violations by Ambassador Holbrooke.\n  That investigation culminated in a settlement with the Department of \nJustice in which Ambassador Holbrooke agreed to pay five thousand \ndollars in civil penalties.\n  Once the Senate received the nomination in February, the Committee on \nForeign Relations conducted its own inquiry, reviewing in great detail \nthe investigation conducted by the State Department Inspector General \nand the Department of Justice.\n  In June, the Committee conducted three separate hearings on \nAmbassador Holbrooke's nomination, reviewing first the ethical matters, \nthen reviewing issues related to the United Nations and UN reform, and \nthen reviewing Ambassador Holbrooke's involvement in United States \npolicy toward the Balkans.\n  On June 30 the Committee voted unanimously--on a voice vote--to \nreport Ambassador Holbrooke's nomination to the full Senate.\n  Since the Committee reported Mr. Holbrooke's nomination, it has been \nsubjected to a variety of reported ``holds'' by several senators, only \none of which, as I understand it, had anything to do with Mr. \nHolbrooke's qualifications to be ambassador.\n  This delay is quite extraordinary for a position of this importance. \nThe last two UN ambassadors were confirmed on the same day that the \nCommittee voted, and in the last two decades, the Senate has, on \naverage, voted within four days of the Committee's vote.\n  But we have now worked through all those and we are here today, for \nwhich I am grateful to the Majority Leader and the Chairman.\n  I believe the Senate should confirm Ambassador Holbrooke for a simple \nreason: he is highly qualified for the job.\n  There are few people who have had the kind of diplomatic experience \nthat Ambassador Holbrooke has had.\n  Ambassador Holbrooke had been in public service since the early \n1960s, when he entered the Foreign Service. Since then, he has served \nin a wide variety of diplomatic positions--in each case with \ndistinction.\n  In the Carter Administration, he served as Assistant Secretary of \nState for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Appointed at the age of 37, \nat the time he was the youngest person ever appointed as assistant \nsecretary.\n  In 1993, Ambassador Holbrooke returned to government service as \nAmbassador to Germany.\n  In September 1994, he became Assistant Secretary of State for \nEuropean and Canadian Affairs. Again, Ambassador Holbrooke established \na precedent: he became the first person to serve as assistant secretary \nof state for two different geographic regions.\n  A key challenge facing him upon his return to the United States was \nthe conflict in Bosnia, which by then had been raging since April 1992.\n  As Assistant Secretary, Mr. Holbrooke helped design and implement a \nstrategy that culminated in the signing of the Dayton Accords in \nNovember 1995, which brought an end to the Bosnian war.\n  Of course, several people in the U.S. government deserve credit for \nthe success at Dayton. But it cannot be denied that Ambassador \nHolbrooke--and the creativity and tenacity he brought to the task--was \ncritical to bringing about this diplomatic achievement.\n  In February 1996, for personal reasons, Ambassador Holbrooke resigned \nfrom full-time government service. At\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\nthe request of Secretary of State Christopher, he remained available to \nundertake special missions and to advise senior officials in the State \nDepartment. In 1997, President Clinton also asked him to become special \nPresidential envoy for Cyprus.\n  Throughout the three and one-half year period since leaving full-time \ngovernment service, Ambassador Holbrooke has never been paid a dime for \nhis efforts.\n  Mr. President, I daresay that there are few people with the \ndiplomatic experience that Mr. Holbrooke will bring to the job of UN \nambassador. He has significant experience at high levels of government. \nHe has deep experience in two regions. And he has recently supervised \nand managed a major diplomatic conference that culminated in the end of \na tragic war.\n  Let me state it as bluntly as I know how: we need Dick Holbrooke in \nNew York and we need him there now. It has been nearly a year since we \nhave had a UN ambassador.\n  The agenda facing the next UN ambassador is a long one.\n  The United Nations is taking the lead in establishing a civilian \nadministration in Kosovo. We need someone with Dick Holbrooke's skill \nand knowledge to make sure it gets done right.\n  The United Nations is greatly in need of reform. We have promised the \nUN that we will pay nearly one billion dollars in back dues if these \nreforms are made. Ambassador Holbrooke promised that UN reform will be \nhis ``highest sustained priority.'' We need someone with Dick \nHolbrooke's negotiating skills to help bring them about.\n  The UN Security Council remains seized with the issue of dismantling \nIraq's arsenal of mass destruction. We need someone with Dick \nHolbrooke's toughness to carry that task forward.\n  In sum, I believe Ambassador Holbrooke has all the qualities \nnecessary to be an excellent UN ambassador, and I believe that the \nSenate should confirm him forthwith.\n  Let me turn briefly to the issues that delayed Mr. Holbrooke's \nnomination.\n  Last July, soon after the President announced his intention to \nnominate Mr. Holbrooke, an anonymous letter arrived in the Office of \nthe Inspector General at the Department of State alleging that \nAmbassador Holbrooke may have violated ethics laws and regulations.\n  Spurred by this letter, the Inspector General opened a wide-ranging \ninvestigation that took over five months, involved dozens of \ninterviews, and the production of thousands of pages of records.\n  Earlier this year, while the nomination was pending, the Inspector \nGeneral opened a second investigation, this time based only on an oped \narticle in the Washington Post.\n  The first investigation culminated in a civil settlement between \nAmbassador Holbrooke and the Department of Justice in which Ambassador \nHolbrooke agreed to pay five thousand dollars to settle allegations \nthat he violated Section 207(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code.\n  To this day, Ambassador Holbrooke denies that he violated the law, \nbut he settled the matter in order to avoid further delay of the \nnomination. The second investigation was closed almost as quickly as it \nwas opened, with no punishment imposed against Ambassador Holbrooke.\n  The Committee obtained the thousands of pages of documents that were \nproduced in the investigations of Ambassador Holbrooke, and has \nreviewed them independently.\n  I have reviewed all these matters closely, and I do not believe that \nthey even begin to rise to the level where they should be considered \ndisqualifying.\n  I do not make this statement lightly. I am a strong supporter of the \nethics laws, and believe they must be rigorously enforced. Government \nemployees, as Ambassador Holbrooke stated in his first hearing before \nthe Committee, must maintain the public trust.\n  I have known Richard Holbrooke for two decades, and am presumptuous \nenough to call him a friend. I do not believe that he is an unethical \nperson, and I find totally inconsistent with his character any \nsuggestion that he is.\n  On the contrary: Dick Holbrooke is a dedicated public servant who, as \nthe record compiled by the Committee demonstrates, willingly devoted \ndozens--if not hundreds--of hours to assisting the government in the \npast several years, to the detriment of his commitment to his private \nemployer.\n  Every senator can be assured that the Committee has left no stone \nunturned.\n  The Committee sought and received access to every document reviewed \nby the investigators, and received access to internal documents of the \nWhite House, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, \nincluding the memorandum setting forth the reasons why a criminal \nprosecution of Mr. Holbrooke was not warranted.\n  Mr. President, my friend from Virginia is very diplomatic. My friend \nfrom Virginia is a man of grace and elegance. My friend from Virginia \nis a man who is able to get things done not merely because of his \nintellect but because of his style.\n  I am not as elegant as my friend from Virginia, so I will just say it \nout loud. This would not have happened without my friend from Virginia. \nThe truth of the matter is, it took a Republican of stature, seniority, \nand influence in this area to break this loose. He is going to get mad \nat my saying this, but I think it is a shame that was required, but I \nthank him for it because he was relentless over the last 5 months in \ntrying to get us to this point today.\n  I will ruin his reputation here, but the President owes him a debt of \ngratitude, the Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, the Senate owes him \na debt of gratitude, and Mr. Holbrooke, I know, is grateful for his \neffort. Because as the Senator from Virginia indicated, there is a \nsignificant agenda facing our next Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I appreciate \nhis thoughtful remarks, but, again, it was a team effort by a number of \nus, including the Senator from Delaware.\n  I want to make the point here, the distinguished chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Mr. Helms, and Senator Biden's colleagues \non that committee held a hearing. There was a unanimous vote, and Mr. \nHelms reported this nomination to the floor. It did pass through there \nwith the approval of the committee on which the Senator serves.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I never had a doubt, nor did any of my \ncolleagues, that if we ever got any forum in which we could discuss the \nqualifications of Richard Holbrooke, he would win unanimously. We never \ndoubted that. But it took a lot to get it to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to get a vote in the Foreign Relations Committee, and once \nit got to the floor, to move it forward.\n  I want to say something about these holds. I have been here 27 years. \nI have been a sitting Senator longer than the Senator from Virginia. \nThere are only seven people who have been in the entire Senate longer \nthan I. We have lost our sense of proportion. Holds have nothing to do \nwith--nothing to do with--the balance of power here when used in the \nfashion they were used.\n  Let me explain what I mean by that. It is one thing to say, I am \ngoing to hold up that bill from passing because the bill left out two \nbridges in my State that are critical to the commerce of my State. \nThere is a correlation between the spending of money and the impact on \nmy State--a sense of proportion.\n  If I say that I am going to hold up the next Director of NASA because \nI want answers on how the space program is going to work, that is \nreasonable. There is a sense of proportion. There is a relationship \nbetween NASA and the head of NASA.\n  But when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for several years, \nor were I to become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I \nsaid: By the way--and, by the way, the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee did not do this--were I to say: You know, I realize \nthe President's nominee for the Supreme Court may be a good guy, or \ngood woman, but I'm going to hold her up because the Dover Air Force \nBase is being closed, that is no sense of proportion, that is an abuse \nof power--an abuse of power. That is totally unreasonable.\n  Let's get straight what this was about. We held up one of the single \nmost important foreign policy personnel decisions to be made by this \nadministration. And not a person in this\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nSenate would disagree with that assertion. Why? Because one Senator \nwanted someone on the Federal Election Commission whom he did not get, \nand another Senator thought that some second-tier person who worked at \nthe U.S. mission to the U.N., who in fact was disciplined, should not \nhave been disciplined.\n  The process in the law that calls for review of that person's case is \nunderway. The person who helped write that process into the law decides \nthat the process isn't working quickly enough or getting the result he \nwants, so they hold up the Ambassador to the United Nations at this \nmoment in our history.\n  I respect both the gentlemen who did those things personally, but I \nrespectfully suggest--as we Catholics say, when you are a little kid \nand you go to confession, they say you learn to examine your \nconscience. Go examine your conscience and tell me whether there is any \nsense of proportion.\n  As I stated earlier, since 1981, in the case of nominations for UN \nambassador, the average amount of time--the number of days between the \ntime that nominee was reported by the Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe time that that nominee was voted on in the Senate was 4 days--4 \ndays.\n  The reason I mention this is, you know what I am afraid of? I say to \nmy friend from Virginia and my Republican colleagues. When the \nDemocratic Party takes control, we are going to learn wrong lessons \nfrom you all, we are going to learn the wrong lessons.\n  I remember when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we had the \nClarence Thomas nomination. Before Anita Hill came along we had a vote, \nand it was 7-7. Guess what. Technically, that means he did not get \nenough votes to be voted out. I had some very liberal Democrats, hard-\nedged Democrats, like your hard-right Republicans, say: Mr. Chairman, \nit's within your power not to report him to the floor.\n  How responsible would it have been for me, as the chairman of the \ncommittee--which I could have done--to prevent the Senate from voting \non a Supreme Court nominee? The Republicans would have done that, based \non their conduct on this nomination. And guess what. If it happens \nagain, mark my words, Democrats are going to join this place who are \ngoing to learn all the wrong lessons from this abuse of power, this \nlack of proportionality.\n  I am not going to say any more about it. The reason I am not is that \nit is done. But I really, truly hope and plead with my colleagues, on \nboth sides of the aisle, have a sense of proportion here. We dodged a \nbullet here because of the incredible work of Senator Helms and Senator \nWarner on the Republican side and the eventual yielding on the part of \nothers. Reason ultimately prevailed. But this is a bad, bad, bad \npractice; and this is a good, good, good nominee.\n\n  I will conclude, because others want to speak, by stressing two \npoints about Mr. Holbrooke. One, in all my years in the Senate, no one \nin the Senate who has come before our committee is more qualified to do \nthe job for which he has been nominated than this man--none; not one.\n  Secondly, this is an ethical man. This man's ethics have been \nquestioned under what I believe to be an aberration. We put in the \nlaw--and I voted for inspectors general, but guess what. The law can be \ntriggered by an article in a newspaper. That can hold up a nomination \nfor months and months, requiring intensive investigation. This is the \nmost investigated man we have had for the United Nations, and there is \nnot an unethical drop of blood in this guy's veins.\n  So I think there are three things we have to do.\n  Let's put this man in place. Let this incredible energy and \nintellectual horsepower that this fellow has go to work on behalf of \nAmerica. Two, let's reexamine whether or not we exercised any \nproportionality here in holding this up. And three, I would ask my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider joining with me and \ngoing back and relooking at the way in which the inspector general's \noffice is triggered and worked so we avoid this kind of thing in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might just advise my colleagues, the previous order \nis that the Senate will vote at 10. I ask unanimous consent that that \nbe extended to, say, 10 minutes after 10, to afford other colleagues an \nopportunity to contribute their remarks. I am sorry, but the leader is \nvery anxious, given the heavy calendar of work today, and I think it is \nimportant we proceed to this nomination. So if each of the remaining \nSenators can take 1 or 2 minutes, that would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. I object. Mr. President, I am sorry, but I would \nlike to have up to 5 minutes, and I did not realize I would be shut \noff.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will just accommodate the 5 minutes, then. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Texas have 5 minutes. What are \nthe requests of the other Senators? Two or three minutes? So I ask \nunanimous consent that we go to the hour of 10:15, at which time we \nthen, hopefully--have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Richard Holbrooke to be the United States representative \nto the United Nations with the rank of Ambassador. Ambassador Holbrooke \nhas rendered superb service to our Nation during the course of his \ncareer. His diplomatic experience makes him an ideal choice for this \nvery important position.\n  We need good, strong leadership at the United Nations. We have been \nwithout a permanent representative now for an extended period of time. \nAn able, competent, skillful diplomat can make a big difference in \nterms of serving the national interests of our country.\n  Dick Holbrooke has had an illustrious career. He joined the Foreign \nService in 1962. He had assignments in Vietnam, where he worked closely \nwith Ambassador William Porter, Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, and \nAmbassador Henry Cabot Lodge. From the very beginning he was right in \nthe middle of the decisionmaking arena and was recognized for his \nextraordinary talents. He was the Director of the Peace Corps in \nMorocco. He then left the Government for a while and was a managing \neditor of Foreign Policy magazine, one of our leading foreign policy \nthink magazines, where he did an outstanding job. In the mid-1970s, he \nwas senior consultant to the President's Commission on the Organization \nof the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy.\n\n  This is a man who has committed his entire career to analyzing and \nenhancing the foreign policy of the United States in the name of \nserving our national security interests. He held two assistant \nsecretaryships within the Department of State: Assistant Secretary for \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs and Assistant Secretary for European and \nCanadian Affairs. He has also served in a very distinguished way as our \nAmbassador to Germany.\n  I have worked closely with him in his capacity as Presidential \nSpecial Envoy to Cyprus, where he has striven mightily to try to move \nthat issue forward.\n  He will do a terrific job at the United Nations. He has done an \nexcellent job in every government position he has held. His commitment \nand dedication are obvious for all to see. I think the Senator from \nDelaware was right in saying that there were attacks on Dick \nHolbrooke's character which were extremely unfortunate and without \nbasis or justification. To his credit, he withstood all of that. A \nlesser person might have walked away and said: Who needs to put up with \nthis? But he has a driving sense of serving the country and serving the \nnational interest.\n  Dick Holbrooke has addressed difficult, complex foreign policy issues \nin an extremely incisive and competent way. We need that skill at the \nUnited Nations. That is the skill he will bring. I am relieved that the \nnomination is finally before us for judgment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Dick Holbrooke to \nbe our Ambassador to the United Nations. He will serve our Nation and, \nindeed, the world well in this position.\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Richard \nHolbrooke to the position of United States Permanent Representative to \nthe United Nations. I would say that this debate is long overdue.\n  The United Nations is a very important tool in America's foreign \npolicy arsenal and our ambassador to the U.N. is the key to unlocking \nthat power. For the past ten months, however, that post has stood \nvacant, thereby degrading our influence at the U.N. Today we have an \nopportunity to correct that omission and restore some of the United \nStates' leadership in that world body.\n  There are few things the United States as a nation holds more dear \nthan the ideals our country was founded on nearly 223 years ago. We \ncontinue to lead the global fight for freedom, for democracy, for \npeace, and for respect for human rights. For the past five decades, it \nhas been the United States' strong, clear and persistent voice in both \nthe Security Council and the General Assembly which has convinced other \nnations to support those same ideals.\n  Looking back on those fifty years, it is clear that our work at the \nUnited Nations has, by and large, been a success. Today, the United \nNations is one of the most powerful champions of human rights, freedom \nand peace around the world. The U.S. has used the United Nations to \nsupport our foreign policy in places as far flung as Korea, Libya, \nIraq, and Bosnia.\n  Without the United Nations, the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am \nFlight 103 would probably never have faced a judge to account for their \nactions. Similarly, Saddam Hussein would still be free to terrorize \nboth his neighbors and his own citizens. If it were not for the United \nNations sponsored Implementation Force in Bosnia, war, bloodshed and \ngenocide would still rule that nation. Today, the United Nations is \nengaged in helping to implement certain aspects of the peace settlement \nin Kosovo--which we all hope and pray will put an end to the bloodshed \nthere as well.\n  While we are all familiar with United Nations peace keeping efforts \nin Bosnia and Iraq, we must not forget that men and women wearing the \nU.N.'s signature blue helmets are keeping the peace in places as \ndisparate as Angola and Tajikistan. In all, there are currently 16 \ndifferent on-going peace keeping operations on four continents.\n  As we embark on the next stage of involvement in Kosovo--one in which \nthe United Nations will have an important role--it is tremendously \nimportant that we are represented in that world body. We must not allow \nany additional delay to further erode our leadership.\n  Last fall, President Clinton tapped an exceedingly qualified diplomat \nto head our delegation to the United Nations. Richard Holbrooke has \nserved our nation well in a wide variety of posts--from Assistant \nSecretary of State for two different regions to Ambassador to Germany.\n  Today, many of our thoughts are focused on the Balkans and this first \nreal chance to bring peace to Kosovo. It is particularly fitting, \ntherefore, that among Ambassador Holbrooke's greatest achievements are \nthe Dayton Peace Accords which ended the civil war and genocide in \nBosnia.\n  Five years ago, it was the war and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, not \nKosovo, that captured the world's attention. Innocent civilians were \nmurdered and raped simply on the basis of their ethnicity. Venturing \ninto the market to buy food entailed the risk of instant death at the \nhands of snipers or soldiers with a mortar on a nearby hilltop. Each \nday was a fight for survival.\n  Today, however, Bosnia is rebuilding. In 1995, talks held thousands \nof miles away from the battlefields--in Dayton, Ohio--silenced the \nsounds of gunfire and ended the massive human rights abuses. The man \nwho brought the Serbs, Bosnians and Croatians together for those talks \nand fought hard to reach a settlement is sitting before us today.\n  As Ambassador Holbrooke well knows, it is often easier to wage war \nthan to make peace. In spite of the daunting odds, however, Ambassador \nHolbrooke did make peace and for that he deserves our praise.\n  Following his return to the private sector in 1996, Ambassador \nHolbrooke continued to serve his country. Without any compensation from \nthe government, Ambassador Holbrooke focused his efforts on trying to \nend the dispute on the island of Cyprus and the bloodshed in Kosovo.\n  The success or failure of the Kosovo agreement it will be determined \nby whether the United States, our NATO allies and Russia stay the \ncourse together. The job of bringing this broad coalition together and \nkeeping it together will not be an easy one, but it is one with which \nAmbassador Holbrooke has experience--experience we need at the United \nNations at this critical juncture.\n  It is important to mention the other critical issue which is damaging \nour reputation and effectiveness at the U.N.: our failure to pay our \ndues. The funds we owe the U.N. are formal treaty obligations, not \noptional contributions. Today, we are in grave danger of losing our \nvote in the General Assembly. Imagine the irony if the United States, \none of the founders of the United Nations, loses its vote in that \norganization's primary decision making body. The compromise Chairman \nHelms and Senator Biden worked out with respect to our dues will go a \nlong way to repairing the damage if we are able to convince our \ncolleagues in the House to refrain from attaching poison pills to this \nbill. We already missed one opportunity to pass that compromise, namely \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I remain hopeful, \nhowever, that the compromise, which is a part of the Senate passed \nState Department Authorization bill and now in conference with the \nHouse will become law before the end of this session of Congress.\n  Now is the right time to confirm a new ambassador to the U.N. He has \nthe requisite experience for the job and, even more importantly, is a \nproven peacemaker.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion I add my voice to those who have already \nspoken expressing their gratitude to Senator Helms and Senator Biden, \nwho are the chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for the leadership that my friend and colleague from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has shown on \nthis nomination, and for many others who have spoken on behalf of \nRichard Holbrooke, in many cases, not because they agree with the \npolitics of Richard Holbrooke or necessarily agree with every position \nhe has taken on various public matters, but because there is an \nunderstanding that in our country, regardless of administration and \npolitics, we need good, talented people, who analyze issues well and \nbring an energy and a passion and a commitment to public policy.\n  For those reasons, I am particularly grateful to our friends on the \nother side who may not agree with Richard Holbrooke but understand he \nis a talented human being.\n  I underscore the point that Senator Sarbanes made. Too often we \ndiscourage good people in this country from serving their Nation \nbecause we have created a gauntlet that one has to go through prior to \nconfirmation that will discourage other people from even thinking about \ngoing through this process. What you expose yourself and your family to \nto take on positions to serve your country is becoming far too much. I \nthink as a body we ought to take a closer look at what we ask people to \ngo through whom we ask to serve their Nation.\n  Richard Holbrooke has a distinguished career, as Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Warner and others have pointed out, going back more than 30 \nyears. He has been through an awful lot over the last year and a half, \nalmost 2 years now.\n  I particularly am concerned about the inspector general at the State \nDepartment, as my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee know. I \nhave written an amendment, which was adopted, that requires that those \npeople in the State Department who are accused of wrongdoing have a \nright--I know this sounds like a radical thought--to know what they are \naccused of and have an opportunity to respond to the accusation before \nthe reports are written. That is not the case today.\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator mean that at the moment you are not \npermitted to find out what the charges are and the nature of the \naccusations?\n  Mr. DODD. That is absolutely correct. In the case of Richard \nHolbrooke, he was not allowed to find out what the charges were against \nhim for well over a year. A common criminal accused of a felony in this \ncountry has that right. It seems to me if we have a system inside our \ngovernment where a mere accusation of someone can result in months and \nmonths of delay or public retribution, not to mention legal costs to \ndefend yourself, something is terribly wrong with that process. We are \ntrying to correct it.\n  Again, I don't want to spend the time talking about the problems we \nhave but to commend one individual for persistence, who wants to serve \nhis country, who is going to do, in my view, a remarkably fine job for \nall of us. I am sorry it took so long for him to arrive at this point, \nbut I am grateful he has. Again, for those who made it possible, I \nthank them and am confident that Richard Holbrooke will serve our \nNation well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak about why I am going to \nvote against the Holbrooke nomination. I start by saying, I have never \nput a hold on this nomination. I thought the process should go forward \nin due course. I think Richard Holbrooke is a principled man. I think \nhe is a committed public servant. I admire his tenacity, his \ndedication. I have nothing personal against Richard Holbrooke.\n  I am voting against him because I disagree with the policy that he \nhas put forward in the Balkans. I just can't, in good conscience, vote \nfor someone who I think is taking our country in the wrong direction.\n  This is his policy: that the United States should spend billions of \ndollars, wear and tear on our equipment and our troops, stretching our \nmilitary for a goal that I believe is not achievable.\n  I would commit our military immediately if I thought the goal and the \nmission were the correct one, but I believe our policy in the Balkans \nis to force factions to live together in an American model, when the \ncircumstances are different from any we have ever had in our country. I \ndon't think we can put American requirements into the Balkans with any \nchance to succeed.\n  We have had a policy that the United States could use force of vast \nproportions without strategically assessing what would be more \nproportional responses in line with our own security threat and our \nother responsibilities in the world. Richard Holbrooke did not allow \nthe United States, through his policies, to lift the arms embargo on \none faction in Bosnia, so one group was unarmed against two groups that \nwere armed. I think if we had lifted the arms embargo 3 years before \nthe Dayton accords, those people would have had a fair chance. I don't \nthink we would have seen the mass slaughter of the Moslems that we did. \nI disagree with that policy.\n  We never looked at the opportunity for self-determination in the \nBalkans. We never looked at the opportunity to let these people form \ngovernments within their ethnic groups. They are 98 percent in ethnic \ngroups now in Bosnia, but we are still trying to force them to have a \ncoalition government. If we walked out today, I think every expert \nwould agree the fighting would continue.\n  The Washington Post yesterday had a headline, ``NATO Losing Kosovo \nBattle.'' This was not a headline 2 months ago. It was yesterday.\n  The reason is, we have a policy in the Balkans that I think is going \nto hurt our own national security by overdeploying our military troops, \nby wear and tear on our equipment, by not having a sense of proportion \nin looking for other options, not looking at all of our commitments in \nthe world, but instead trying to force an American model that I think \nis unrealistic today.\n  I think there are other options to try to help the people in the \nBalkans create stability with self-determination and then, eventually \nmaybe, they would be able to live closer together in harmony.\n  Mr. President, I want to say I am only voting against Mr. Holbrooke \non his foreign policy principles, not on him as a person. I will say \nagain that I think he is a committed public servant. I think he is \ntenacious in his beliefs, and I admire that in a person. I just believe \nthat our foreign policy is going in the wrong direction in this \ncountry. I think we are going to pay a high price for it, and I think \nRichard Holbrooke is one of the architects of this policy that I \nbelieve is quite erroneous. So, for that reason, I will vote against \nRichard Holbrooke.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have had a chance to discuss the role of \nthe U.S. at the United Nations with the nominee on a number of \noccasions and I am confident that the President has nominated the right \nman for the job. Mr. Holbrooke has a reputation for being a tough \nnegotiator and a practiced arm-twister and those are exactly the \nattributes we need in our next Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  It's not going to be easy to get the UN to implement the Helms-Biden \npackage even though there is widespread agreement on the need for \nreform. I believe Ambassador Holbrooke has the skills necessary to \nleverage our position as the most powerful nation in the world--and as \nthe largest contributor to the UN--to ensure greater transparency and \naccountability in that organization. That is why I have \nenthusiastically backed the nomination of Mr. Holbrooke and look \nforward to working with him in the future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nRichard Holbrooke to be America's Ambassador to the United Nations, and \nI am pleased that the Congressional delay in reaching this vote has \nfinally ended.\n  Richard Holbrooke has a long and distinguished record of public \nservice and is an outstanding diplomat. He clearly has the necessary \nexperience, background, and skills to ably represent America's \ninterests at the United Nations.\n  Richard Holbrooke has served with great distinction in many previous \ncapacities, and all of us who know him have great respect for his \nability and judgement. He has served as the President's Special Envoy \nto Cyprus, as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian \nAffairs, as U.S. Ambassador to Germany, as Assistant Secretary of State \nfor East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and as a Peace Corps Director in \nMorocco.\n  Of his many extraordinary accomplishments, he is best known for his \nskillful work in presiding over the long and difficult negotiations to \nachieve the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, which ended the war in \nBosnia.\n  The United Nations is a complex institution involving many \ninternational interests, and I'm confident that Richard Holbrooke will \nrepresent our country well. Our representative must be an exceptional \nnegotiator. Richard Holbrooke is a skilled negotiator with the ability \nto articulate clearly our country's ideals and persuade other members \nof the international community to support these ideals as well. He's an \noutstanding choice for this very important foreign policy position, and \nI'm proud to express my strong support.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am pleased to vote for the confirmation of Ambassador \nRichard Holbrooke to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations \nand even more pleased to see the Senate vote on this important \nnomination in advance of the August recess so that Ambassador Holbrooke \ncan start on his important assignment.\n  Ambassador Holbrooke brings unique qualifications to this position. \nHe began his government career in 1962 joining the Foreign Service \nafter graduating from Brown University. Among the many posts he has \nheld are Special Presidential Envoy for Cyprus in 1997, Assistant \nSecretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, Assistant \nSecretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Peace Corps \nDirector in Morocco and U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Ambassador \nHolbrooke was the chief negotiator for the Dayton Peace Accord in \nBosnia.\n  I had occasion to evaluate Ambassador Holbrooke's work in some detail \nwhen I served as Chairman of the Intelligence committee which undertook \na\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\ndetailed investigation of the sale of Iranian arms to Bosnia. \nAmbassador Holbrooke was involved in a complex, highly sensitive matter \nand he discharged his duties with professionalism.\n  In undertaking the complex negotiations on Bosnia, Ambassador \nHolbrooke again performed a great service for the United States. His \nlast minute negotiations with Yugoslavia's President Milosevic, while \nunsuccessful, showed his unique talents which will be put to good use \nfor our national interest in his new capacity as U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I believe the Senator from Virginia \nyielded a couple minutes to me earlier.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut, and also to Senator Hagel, who has been very helpful in \nthis nomination. At the conclusion of his remarks, the vote will occur.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I first thank those who have finally \nbrought the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to the floor of the Senate, \nparticularly the senior Senator from North Carolina and the senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, who have done yeoman's work here in \nthe national interest.\n  Secondly, I wanted to say this about the nominee himself, who I have \nbeen privileged to come to know. In my opinion, Richard Holbrooke is \none of America's great natural resources. Certainly, he is one of our \ngreat diplomatic resources. He has had a career that has been described \nin detail here that puts him at the top ranks of those who have served \nAmerica in the international arena. He is a person of principle, \npurpose, intellect, and enormous energy and talent. He combines the \nsense of American purpose, which, incidentally, is reflected in his \nwork on behalf of the policy of the United States, representing the \nCommander in Chief of the United States in regard to the Balkans, about \nwhich my friend from Texas has just spoken. He combines that sense of \nAmerican principle and the continuing vitality of America's morality in \nthe world with extraordinary, tough-minded, practical, and \ninterpersonal diplomatic skills.\n  We are fortunate to have a person of this talent willing to serve our \nNation. I am confident that he will advance our national security and \nprincipled interests in the United Nations. I am proud to support the \nnomination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the nomination \nof Richard Holbrooke to be this country's Ambassador to the U.N. I was \nthinking the other day when we were engaged in the Foreign Relation \nCommittee's fourth hearing on Mr. Holbrooke --four hearings on Mr. \nHolbrooke. We looked rather closely and thoroughly at his policies, his \nbackground, his professional and personal life. He did not come up \nshort in all of those areas. But I was thinking, I don't know if there \nhas been an individual who has been more probed and investigated for \nthis very important position than Mr. Holbrooke.\n  I have believed for a long time that the President of the United \nStates deserves his team. As he nominates his team for the Senate to \npass judgment on, give advice and consent, as constitutionally is our \nresponsibility, if that individual possesses the high moral quality and \nqualifications, and the high professional standings, qualifications, \nand experience, then the President needs his team.\n  I echo much of what has been said this morning about how important it \nis that we get our Representative of the United Nations. Now, we have \ndifferences of opinion in philosophy and policy, and I appreciate that. \nEvery Senator has his or her own position, as it should be. But I will \nsay this as my last comment about Mr. Holbrooke. I hope and I believe \nhe will make every effort to bring some bipartisanship to foreign \npolicy. It seems to me that we have allowed bipartisanship in foreign \npolicy and national security affairs to erode and come undone to the \npoint where it is dangerous.\n  I believe both sides are responsible. I think the President hasn't \nreached out enough, and I think we in the Congress have made foreign \npolicy and national security affairs a more brittle, raw political \ndynamic. If we don't come back together, as bipartisanship needs to be \nsewn back together in these very important issues for the future of our \ncountry and stability of the world, we will pay a high price. I hope \nthat Mr. Holbrooke will lead that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator. He has been very \nhelpful throughout the nominating process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is, Will \nthe Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Richard Holbrooke, \nof New York, to be the Representative of the United States of America \nto the United Nations with the rank and status of Ambassador \nExtraordinary and Plenipotentiary, and the Representative of the United \nStates of America in the Security Council of the United Nations, and \nthe nomination of Richard Holbrooke, of New York, to be a \nRepresentative of the United States of America to the Sessions of the \nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations during his tenure of service as \nRepresentative of the United States of America to the United Nations, \nen bloc.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), and \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu), would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I yield the floor to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations subcommittee, I \nconfirm again we are going back to the Interior appropriations bill. We \nhope to and plan to have debate on amendments beginning right away. We \ncould have a recorded vote on one of the amendments within the next 15 \nto 30 minutes. We will continue working on the Interior appropriations \nbill until we get an agreement as to exactly when to proceed to the \nreconciliation conference report.\n  I will not propound a unanimous consent request at this time, but it \nis my hope we can get an agreement to begin at 1 o'clock on the \nconsideration of a reconciliation conference report, and we debate it \nfor 6 hours, of course, equally divided in the usual form, and the vote \nthen would occur around 7 o'clock.\n  We do not have that worked out yet. If we require more time, if we \nhave to be in later, then of course the vote would go later in the \nnight, perhaps 8 o'clock or, if we cannot get that worked out, we will \ngo however long we need to go tonight and we would vote on Friday \nmorning sometime. But we hope to get an agreement where we could \ncomplete that and have a vote around 7 o'clock tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in just a moment I will have several \nagreed-upon amendments to propound and hopefully they will be agreed to \nvery quickly.\n  Then Mr. Smith of New Hampshire is here with the first contested \namendment. I hope we can finish as many as three amendments that are \nlikely to require rollcalls between now and 1 o'clock. After the Smith \namendment that deals with the National Endowment for the Arts, I hope \nwe will have an opportunity to go to an amendment by Mr. Graham of \nFlorida and Mr. Enzi, relating to Indian gambling. While I have not \nfound the Senator yet, I would like, after that, to go to an amendment \nby the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, on forest roads. Others may \nintervene.\n  We also have a number of amendments that will be agreed upon from \ntime to time. My own reading of our list of amendments is that they are \nreasonably limited, even at this point. Several require votes. I hope \nnone will require a long and extensive debate. The majority leader \nwants, as early as possible, to get an agreed-upon list of amendments. \nI suspect we will be asking for unanimous consent to say all amendments \nmust be filed by, say, sometime this afternoon. So Members who have \namendments about which they have not notified the managers are \nencouraged to do so as promptly as possible.\n  I believe the majority leader wishes to finish this bill, as well as \nthe reconciliation bill on taxes, before the recess begins sometime \ntomorrow.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 1563 Through 1568, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, my amendment to the \nInterior appropriations bill is a very simple one. It eliminates all \nfunding for the National Endowment for the Arts. This amendment has \nbeen considered by the Senate in the past, unfortunately \nunsuccessfully. I know where the votes are, but I believe it is \nimportant we make a statement about this because I do not believe the \nFederal Government should be spending money for this.\n  This amendment does not try to reform the agency. This amendment does \nnot try to restructure the agency. It simply shuts it down in fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  I want to take a little different tack on this. Many who have spoken \nin the past on the National Endowment for the Arts, as far as \nelimination of funding, have focused heavily on some of the \nreprehensible and repulsive, frankly, types of material that has been \ndisplayed and called ``art.'' I am not going to do that this morning. \nMost Members are fully aware of the kinds of things that have been \nfunded by this agency.\n  I remind every Member that we took an oath to support the \nConstitution. All of us at one point stood right where the pages are \nnow sitting and said that we would bear true faith and allegiance to \nthe Constitution of the United States of America. I certainly believe \nthat every Member took that oath seriously. That is why I am hopeful I \nmight be able to persuade my colleagues to support this amendment \nbecause, frankly, whatever opinion you may have of it, is \nunconstitutional to have the National Endowment for the Arts funded by \nthe Federal Government. I can prove that.\n  A constituent challenged me on this one time and wrote:\n\n       Where in the Constitution of the United States does it say \n     that the Federal Government is authorized to fund art?\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       Where in the Constitution of the United States does it say \n     that the Federal Government is authorized to fund art?\n\n  I challenge any of my colleagues to show me that in the Constitution, \nand I will reconsider my amendment.\n  I offer this amendment because I have not been able to find this in \nthe Constitution. The authors of our Constitution envisioned a \ngovernment of limited powers, and if it does not say you do it in the \nConstitution, then it is reserved to the people and the States. If the \nState or the people want to fund a State endowment for the arts, I \nwould not have a problem with that. That is entirely within their \nparameters.\n  The framers made it clear--very clear--that unless the Constitution \nexplicitly granted a power to the Federal Government, that power would \nbe reserved to the States, to the localities, to civil society, or to \nthe people.\n  I know there are many--and this is the frustrating part for me--too \nmany in this body who reject that vision. I have been here going on 9 \nyears, and it is very frustrating for me to watch the Constitution of \nthe United States being trampled time after time. Just a week or so \nago, we passed more gun controls and sent it to conference. Gun \ncontrol, however you may feel about the need for gun control, is \nunconstitutional because we have a second amendment that says we have \nthe right to keep and bear arms. Whatever you may feel about that \nissue, we did not come here to pass laws about our personal beliefs. We \ncame here to pass laws that support the Constitution of the United \nStates of America.\n  When we swear to uphold that document, we agree to live by that \nvision whether we like it or not. Whether we disagree or agree, we \nshould live with that vision. Regretfully, we do not always do that \nhere.\n\n  This amendment is my effort--just a small effort--to move a little \ncloser to the founders, move a little closer to that vision of limited \nconstitutional government. It is interesting that I have to say move a \nlittle closer. Why do we have to move closer to the vision of the \nfounders when we are supposed to uphold the Constitution and enforce \nthat vision, not move a little closer to it. We should be there.\n  It is a bad idea. Whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional, \nit is a bad idea to use taxpayers' funds to subsidize art. But it is \nunconstitutional. Whether it is a good idea or bad idea, it is \nunconstitutional, and that is the point I am making.\n  Most of my colleagues will recall the controversies in which this \nagency has been embroiled. I referenced them briefly in the beginning \nof my remarks. I am not going to get into all of it because we have \nheard it before. But funding the exhibition of sadomasochistic \nphotographs, funding the exhibition of a photograph of a crucifix \nsubmerged in human waste, funding the exhibition of a performance \n``artist'' who smeared chocolate across her naked torso, or how about \nthe other NEA funding artist who exposed his audience to HIV-infected \nblood--all of these things were funded by the taxpayers of the United \nStates in the name of art.\n  Let me repeat that. Funding of sadomasochistic photographs, funding \nof a photograph of a crucifix submerged in human waste, funding of a \nso-called performance artist who smeared chocolate across her naked \ntorso, and a man who exposed his audience to HIV-infected blood, all \nfunded by the taxpayers of the United States of America.\n  I ask you to reflect, if you are a taxpayer, on the fact that you \nwork pretty hard for those dollars, and when you pay those taxes every \nApril 15 to Uncle Sam, you probably hope it is used to preserve and \nprotect and defend the United States of America, perhaps to promote \neducation or some positive thing. But do you really want your money to \ngo to this kind of so-called art?\n  The question is, some people may say this is art, but there are \npeople out there who will disagree. There are people who will say: If I \nwant to put a crucifix in urine and call that art, I have a right to do \nthat; it is a free country. You do. I will fight to my death to say you \nhave a right to do that. I may not agree it is art, but that is your \nposition and you have a right to it.\n  But the question is, Is it constitutional to fund art? Even more so, \nIs it constitutional to fund this kind of stuff? Do you want your \ntaxpayer dollars being spent for this? The sad part about this--we have \nseen this in debate after debate, in amendment after amendment, year \nafter year, as we tried to stop this. Senator Helms has been involved \nin this many times, to his credit, as a leader in trying to expose this \nagency. Senator Ashcroft, who is my original cosponsor, has also been \ninvolved in this and has been a leader on this.\n  But the defenders of the NEA, the National Endowment of the Arts, \nalways tell you--you will hear it after the vote on this amendment, I \nam sure, if not before--that they believe these outrages are a thing of \nthe past, that all of the things I just cited about the crucifix in \nhuman waste, and so forth, are all in the past: We have cleaned up the \nagency. It is not happening anymore. It is old news. We heard you. We \nlistened, and we made the changes.\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\n  I am sorry to tell you, that is not true. I will prove that in a few \nmoments. Once you really understand the NEA, you will not be surprised \nto learn that the outrages continue, and not only do they continue, \nthey are all too common in this agency.\n  Let me illustrate the point about a grant that made news earlier this \nyear. The events surrounding this grant were described in an article in \nthe New York Times.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this New York Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 10, 1999]\n\n  U.S. Cancels Grant for Children's Book Written by Mexican Guerrilla\n\n                           (By Julia Preston)\n\n       Mexico City.--A macaw with scarlet and violent plumes soars \n     across the cover of a book called ``The Story of Colors,'' \n     inviting children to read a folk tale about Mexican gods who \n     took a gray world and filled it with brilliant hues.\n       There are a few surprises, though, in this eye-catching \n     bilingual children's book just published by a small publisher \n     in El Paso, Texas, which won a grant from the National \n     Endowment for the Arts.\n       Its author is Subcomandante Marcos, the political \n     mastermind and military strategist of the Zapatista \n     guerrillas of southern Mexico. On the inside flap, he appears \n     in a photo with a black ski mask hiding his face and bullet-\n     laden ammunition belts slung across his chest.\n       On Tuesday, the chairman of the Endowment, William J. \n     Ivey--who is working to rebuild the agency after its recent \n     reprieve from a death sentence issued by congressional \n     Republicans--abruptly canceled the grant for the book. Ivey \n     overruled a multilayered, year-long grant approval process, \n     acting within hours after the book was brought to his \n     attention by a reporter's phone call.\n       He said he was worried that some of the Endowment's funds \n     might find their way to the Zapatista rebels, who led an \n     armed uprising in 1994 against the government of Mexico.\n       Ivey's decision stunned the Cinco Puntos Press, a \n     shoestring operation that had laid out $15,000 to print 5,000 \n     copies of the book, half of which was to be paid by the \n     Endowment grant. The books are ready to be distributed and \n     carry the Endowment's logo on the last page, together with an \n     acknowledgment of ``generous support'' from the agency.\n       ``This is spineless,'' said Bobby Byrd, a poet and editor \n     of books on border issues who runs the publishing company \n     with his wife and daughter from their home in El Paso. ``This \n     book is essentially about diversity and tolerance, everything \n     the NEA is supposed to stand for, and they just don't have \n     the courage to publish it.''\n       ``The Story of Colors'' reflects a literacy, sometimes \n     whimsical side that has distinguished Subcomandante Marcos, \n     the only non-Indian among the Zapatistas' highest leaders, \n     from other steely Latin American guerrilla commanders. (His \n     real name is Rafael Sebastian Guillen Vicente, and he is a \n     former university graphics professor.)\n       In the text, the masked rebel leader describes himself as \n     lighting up his pipe, one of his hallmarks, and sitting down \n     on a jungle pathway to hear a tale from an Indian elder named \n     Antonio. The old man recounts how mythical gods grew bored \n     with the universe when it was tinted only in grey, and went \n     about inventing colors one by one. In the end they pin all \n     the colors on the tail feathers of the macaw.\n       The bird ``goes strutting about just in case men and women \n     forget how many colors there are and how many ways of \n     thinking, and that the world will be happy if all the colors \n     and ways of thinking have their place,'' the text concludes.\n       The illustrations are bright, broad-stroked paintings of \n     gods with horns and bug-eyes done by Domitila Dominguez, a \n     Mexican Indian artist.\n       Spun in the sensuous tradition of Latin storytelling, the \n     tale includes elements that might be controversial in the \n     mainstream American children's book market. As the story \n     opens, the text reads, ``The men and women were sleeping or \n     they were making love, which is a nice way to become tired \n     and then go to sleep.''\n       The double-page illustration shows a reclining naked woman \n     in a sexual embrace with a figure that appears to be a male \n     god.\n       There are no references to the Zapatistas' cause or their \n     military tactics, but in a cover blurb, Amy Ray, a member of \n     the Indigo Girls, a Grammy-winning American song duo, says, \n     ``This beautiful book reminds us that the Zapatista movement \n     is one of dignity that emanates from the grassroots of the \n     indigenous people of Mexico.''\n       ``The most important thing is that it is a beautiful \n     book,'' said Byrd, whose press specializes in bilingual \n     children's books. ``A lot of our stories in the United States \n     have been cleaned up with a politically correct sentiment, \n     and so much detail has been washed away.''\n       He added, ``I can imagine how someone would rewrite this \n     for an Anglo audience,'' referring to non-Hispanic Americans. \n     ``There wouldn't be anybody smoking or making love.''\n       ``The Story of Colors'' was originally published in Spanish \n     in 1997 by a press in Guadalajara, Mexico called Colectivo \n     Callejero, which supports the Zapatistas' cause.\n       Byrd said that he provided a copy of the original to the \n     Endowment when he applied for the grant to translate it in \n     March 1998. His first request, for $30,000 to translate a \n     total of five books, passed two levels of review at the \n     agency but the funds were cut back to $15,000. Byrd said he \n     conferred repeatedly with literature experts at the Endowment \n     when he chose to leave ``The Story of Colors'' in a revised \n     grant request he presented to translate only two books. Cinco \n     Puntos Press (the name means Five Points in Spanish) \n     received a written notice in February that the funds had \n     been approved. The only step left was for the agency to \n     send the money.\n       Ivey, the Endowment chairman, said that he was not \n     concerned about the book's contents and had not seen the \n     finished printed book. When he went over the grant records \n     Money night, he said, he became worried about rights \n     payments, which the El Paso press had contracted to make to \n     the publishing group in Mexico.\n       ``There was an uncertainty about the ultimate destination \n     of some part of the funds,'' Ivey said. ``I am very aware \n     about disbursing taxpayer dollars for Americans' cultural \n     life, and it became clear to me as chairman that this just \n     wasn't right for the agency. It was an inappropriate use of \n     government funds.''\n       An Endowment official, who spoke on the condition of \n     anonymity, said that it is very unusual for the chairman to \n     step in at the last moment to override the work of several \n     review committees, including the 26-member National Council \n     on the Arts, which includes six federal lawmakers.\n       Byrd said he had made it clear in his grant proposal that \n     no part of the grant would go to the author, Subcomandante \n     Marcos, because the guerrilla leader has declared he does not \n     believe in copyright and formally waived his rights in talks \n     with the Mexican press. Byrd said that rights would be paid \n     to the Guadalajara Press for the use of the artwork.\n       When Republicans gained control of the Congress in 1995, \n     they were frustrated with the Endowment's support for art \n     works they regarded as offensive and vowed to eliminate the \n     agency. But the House moderated its views under election year \n     pressures and voted overwhelmingly in July 1998 to keep the \n     agency alive.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This grant had to do with a grant to a \npublisher for a children's book. Listen carefully, a children's book. \nThis was a grant to a publisher for a children's book, paid for by the \ntaxpayers under the National Endowment of the Arts, at a time--\nrecently--when we had been told that the agency had cleaned up its act \nand that this was no longer prevalent; no longer do they do these \nterrible things I just mentioned.\n  The grant that I am referring to for this children's book had been \napproved at every level of the NEA's review process. It was canceled at \nthe last minute by the agency's chairman.\n  Somebody might say: Well, there you go. It worked. They stopped this \ngrant for a children's book; it wasn't appropriate for children. So \nwhat is your argument, Senator?\n  Let me finish. Why did they cancel at the last minute? Because the \nChairman of the NEA found out that the book's author was a Mexican \nguerrilla leader. The chairman was afraid that the royalties would \nbenefit the Mexican guerrillas. So the reason for the grant \ncancellation was because of the Mexican guerrilla group, not because of \nthe content.\n  Let's take a look at the content. The New York Times reported that \nthis children's book contained sexually explicit illustrations and \ntext; in other words, this children's book, with sexual content, would \nhave received the NEA support this year--not 10 years ago; this year--\nif there had not been the other issue about royalties going to Mexican \nguerrillas.\n  I submit there is an inherent flaw in the peer review process that \nled to this circumstance, and all the other outrages over the years. \nThe peer review process does not reflect the values of the decent, \nhard-working, tax-paying Americans who fund this agency.\n  Let me just find the article from the New York Times, which I have \nentered into the Record.\n  I want to remind you, again, that this grant was canceled because the \nmoney would go to a Mexican guerrilla group, and there was no reference \nwhatsoever to the content.\n  This is a children's book. I would ask my colleagues and the American \npeople to ask yourselves whether you want your tax dollars to go for \nthis kind of stuff for a children's book:\n\n       The illustrations are bright, broad-stroked paintings of \n     gods with horns and bug-eyes\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\n     done by [a man by the name of] Domitila Dominguez, a Mexican \n     Indian artist.\n       Spun in the sensuous tradition of Latin storytelling, the \n     tale includes elements that might be controversial in the \n     mainstream American children's book market. As the story \n     opens, the text reads, ``The men and women were sleeping or \n     they were making love, which is a nice way to become tired \n     and then go to sleep.''\n       The double-page illustration shows a reclining naked woman \n     in a sexual embrace with [a] figure that appears to be a male \n     god.\n\n  We could go on and on and on.\n  This is a children's book. It was canceled because the money went to \nMexican guerrillas, not because of the content. So you see, the agency \nhas not cleaned up its act. They have been getting away with this year \nafter year after year. And why do they get away with it? They get away \nwith it very simply because we won't stop the funding. We don't have \nthe courage to stop the funding.\n  Again, the business about censorship--this is about the Constitution \nof the United States of America, which we are sworn to uphold and \ndefend. Show me in the Constitution where the National Endowment of the \nArts should be funded and why it should be funded. Show me.\n  When we try to say anything about it, we are always accused of \ncensorship. The Smith amendment solves that problem by allowing the \npublic to support the art works they wish voluntarily. You want to \nsupport a children's book that shows a naked woman and a naked man in a \nsexually explicit embrace? Go ahead. You want to show that to your \nchildren? Be my guest. You want to raise your children and teach them \nto read and show them the pictures? Be my guest. But it is not \nconstitutional. And it ought not to happen in the Senate by funding \nthis kind of stuff. We should not be funding art at all, let alone this \nkind of art.\n  So that is how it was done in America for the first 189 years of our \nhistory: Voluntarily you support the arts. Voluntarily you look at what \nyou want to look at. You show your children what you want to show them. \nBut you do not fund it by taking money from the rest of us to do it.\n  Let me just pause here for a moment to make a point. We could go \nthrough a litany of items that are unconstitutional that we pass on \nthis floor almost literally every day--certainly every week.\n  I just ask the rhetorical question to the people of America: When are \nwe going to wake up? We saw it time after time. We saw it with the \nClinton impeachment: As long as my 401(k) and my retirement account is \ndoing well, and as long as I am making money, as long as I have a job \nand 3 or 4 weeks of vacation, and everything is going fine, I don't \ncare about the morality of this country. I don't care that the \nCommander in Chief did what he did. It is OK with me. Poll after poll \nafter poll said just that.\n  Let me tell you. That is the same thing. Time after time after time, \nyear after year after year, we vote to fund the National Endowment of \nthe Arts. We are told every year that all this stuff that I just \nreferred to has been cleaned up and it does not happen anymore. It \ndoes.\n  Yet why does it happen? Don't blame the National Endowment of the \nArts. I don't blame them. I don't blame the Chairman. I don't blame the \nboard. I don't blame any of them for this.\n  I blame the Senate, the House, and the President of the United States \nbecause we pass it and he signs it. We have been doing it year after \nyear after year. They are going to keep right on spending your money as \nlong as you keep giving it to them.\n  So don't blame them; don't direct your anger at them. You should \ndirect it right here to the people who vote that money. Sooner or \nlater, as the frog in the pot boils slowly and then is cooked before he \nrealizes it, the Constitution of the United States is going to slip \nthrough the fingers of all of us.\n  It is happening. We are going to continue to let it happen by these \nkinds of votes. If we want to take seriously what we stood there and \ntook the oath to do, to protect and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America, we ought to vote against funding the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  So that everybody understands, there are essentially two major \npolitical parties in the United States right now, some smaller parties. \nHere is the Democratic Party on the NEA. This is a quote right out of \ntheir platform:\n\n       We believe in public support for the arts, including the \n     National Endowment for the Arts. . . .\n\n  That is the 1996 Democrat platform; ``Responsible Entertainment.'' It \nis an honest statement. They have made it very clear they support this. \nIt doesn't necessarily mean they are implying that they support the \nkinds of things I have said, but it does mean that as long as you \ncontinue to fund it and you don't stop it, those kinds of things are \ngoing to continue to be funded.\n  What we have in the Democratic platform is a statement that is \nunconstitutional. It is totally unconstitutional. To support the arts, \nincluding the National Endowment for the Arts, with taxpayer dollars is \nunconstitutional. But I think Members will find, when they see the \nvotes taken on my amendment in a few minutes, that most of the members \nof the Democratic Party will support their platform. They will vote, I \nthink, probably overwhelmingly, probably 90-95 percent--maybe 100 \npercent, I am not sure--in favor of the National Endowment for the Arts \nand against my amendment. They will live up to their platform. I \npersonally believe they are taking an unconstitutional vote, but that \nis their right. They can do it. They were elected just as I was, and \nthey can vote any way they want to. I respect that right.\n\n  Let us look at the Republican Party platform. The Republican Party \nplatform on the NEA, same issue:\n\n       As a first step in reforming government, we support . . . \n     defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, \n     redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus . . . \n     [one of the] agencies we seek to defund or to privatize [is] \n     the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n  That is the 1996 Republican platform: ``Changing Washington from the \nGround Up.'' We are going to change Washington from the ground up. I \nsupport that statement because it is unconstitutional not to support \nit. The Government should not be funding, under the Constitution, the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. If one sees that statement and \nrealizes that is the position of the party, then one could logically \nconclude that 90-95 percent of Republicans will vote to support their \nplatform and vote to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. We \nwill see. Don't bet on it.\n  That is the platform. So when the votes come, it will be interesting \nfor the public to look to see who supports their platform. Will the \nDemocrats support their platform, albeit unconstitutional in my view, \non this issue, or will the Republicans support their platform? Let us \nsee where the votes fall.\n  Let me issue a challenge to anyone listening: Take a look at the \nvotes after it is all over. See who the Republicans are, see who the \nDemocrats are, and see who supports the Republican platform and see who \nsupports the Democrat platform.\n  This amendment takes out the entire funding, which is about $99 \nmillion. People will say that is not a lot of money. I guess around \nWashington it is not. But it sure was a lot of money around a little \ntown called Allentown, NJ, where I grew up before I moved to New \nHampshire. That was a whole lot of money. I know a whole lot of people \nwho worked real hard--farmers, merchants, teachers--for those dollars. \nFor this kind of money to be spent from them, I think it is wrong. It \nis wrong morally, philosophically, and, as I said before, it is \nunconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, seeing no other speaker on my behalf at this time, I \nask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the floor and appreciate the \nchairman's consideration in offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire, argues for his amendment striking the appropriation for \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, as I have listened to him, on two \ngrounds. The first ground is that the appropriation is \nunconstitutional. The second ground is that it is undesirable.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire that Members of the \nSenate of the United States have a responsibility, just as do sworn \nmembers of the\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\njudiciary of the United States, to consider carefully the \nconstitutional implications of all of the work they do. I disagree with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, however, on what seems to me an easy \nquestion to answer: the constitutionality of an appropriation of this \nnature. In fact, I think the Senator from New Hampshire implied or \nillustrated the weakness of his own argument when he said, just a few \nmoments ago, why should the people of the United States be paying for \nan activity of this sort as against paying for the education of our \nchildren, among other items that he listed.\n  The education of our children is no more mentioned in the \nConstitution of the United States than are the arts or any other \ncultural activity. Yet it is clearly constitutional, as well as \nappropriate, for the Congress of the United States to support the \neducation of our children and, for that matter, our young people \nthrough college and through graduate school, and we do so with \nincreasing enthusiasm in each and every year.\n  The same interpretation of the Constitution of the United States that \nallows and encourages us to do that for education allows us to do so \nfor cultural activities, including the National Endowment for the Arts. \nIf support for the National Endowment for the Arts is unconstitutional, \nso is support for the Library of Congress--I see nothing about a \nlibrary in the Constitution of the United States--so is support for the \nNational Gallery of Art, for the Smithsonian Institution, and for the \nAir and Space Museum, for all of the other cultural activities \nenthusiastically and, I may say, appropriately supported by the \nCongress of the United States.\n\n  No, there is no precedent and no serious legal argument against the \nconstitutionality of our support, modest as it is, for the National \nEndowment for the Arts. There has been, however, a considerable \nargument during the course of the last decade or perhaps two decades \nover the appropriateness of the support for the arts or, alternatively, \nover the way in which the National Endowment for the Arts spends its \nmoney. Again, I think a vast majority of the Members of both Houses of \nCongress think, in the abstract, that it is appropriate to spend a \nmodest amount of money on the arts.\n  From the very beginning of the Republic, we have decorated this \nbuilding with all kinds of works of art that are not necessary for the \nfunctioning of the Congress of the United States. I don't think anyone \nhas ever challenged either the appropriateness or the constitutionality \nof the use of Federal money for the arts in that respect.\n  But climaxing in 1995, there was widespread criticism of a \nsignificant number of grants made by the National Endowment for the \nArts--criticism that I think was totally valid--and some of those \nspecifics the Senator from New Hampshire has illustrated here once \nagain.\n  In 1995, when this debate was at its height, the proponents of the \narts severely restricted the ability of the National Endowment for the \nArts to make individual grants, and many of these highly criticized \nexpenditures were to individuals rather than to groups and \norganizations. Overwhelmingly, today, money for the National Endowment \nfor the Arts goes to States' arts agencies and through grants to a wide \nrange of cultural institutions, many of them, fortunately--more than \nwas the case in the past, though perhaps not quite enough--to \norganizations in the smaller communities of the United States, outside \nof major metropolitan areas, either to bring various forms of music, \ndance, theater, the visual arts to those smaller communities, or to \nsupport the creation of such art in those communities in a way that I \nthink is highly enthusiastic. And it becomes increasingly difficult for \nthe critics of the Endowment to say that the moneys we appropriate here \nare used on matters that are not artistic or are totally and completely \ninappropriate.\n  The present Chairman of the Endowment and the predecessor Chairman of \nthe Endowment have worked diligently and, I think, quite successfully \nin seeing to it that that was not the case. We created congressional \nnonvoting members of the National Endowment. The Senator from Alabama, \nwho is one of those members, is here on the floor. He has expressed to \nme his frustration frequently with the way in which some of his \nadvice has been ignored. But I think his very presence has a salutary \neffect on the way in which the Endowment is managed.\n\n  As a consequence, there was a bitter division between the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives in which the House, on at least one \noccasion--and I think two--did defund the National Endowment and it was \nrejected by a substantial majority in the Senate. This year, it has \ndisappeared. The House of Representatives has funded the Endowment. If \nmy memory of the bill is correct, there is only a $1 million, or 1-\npercent, difference between this bill and the bill that passed the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  For me, perhaps the most significant and weighty argument in favor of \nthis appropriation is an argument I have made on behalf of a number of \nother programs that involve partnerships among the Congress of the \nUnited States, State governments, and the private sector. That is the \nfact that I do not believe there is a single arts group or institution \nin the United States of America that receives all of its funding from \nthe National Endowment for the Arts.\n  As a matter of fact, there may not be any that receives 10 percent of \nthe amount of money that they spend from the National Endowment for the \nArts. Overwhelmingly, its grants are modest in amount. They are sought \neagerly by far more applicants than can possibly receive those grants, \nbecause the very fact that the National Endowment for the Arts has \ngiven $20,000, or $30,000, or $100,000 to a particular organization \nadds a degree of prestige and imprimatur to the activities of that \norganization that make its efforts to secure private funding--and in \nalmost every case, the great majority of the funding of these \norganizations comes from the private sector--makes securing that \nfunding easier. Whether it is right or not, contributors seem far more \nlikely to contribute to an organization that has been recognized by the \nNational Endowment for the Arts than they are willing to do so with \nrespect to the thousands of other arts organizations and groups that \ndon't receive such funding.\n  So the appropriation here is considerably less than 1 percent of the \nmoney in this appropriations bill that goes to the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and multiplied many times over by support from the private \nsector. This is true in other areas in my bill, and one I am very \ninterested in, funding for the renewal of salmon runs in the State of \nWashington. We have money here that will go to a foundation that \nguarantees that it can double or triple the amount of money actually \ngetting into the field for this purpose, instead of taking on something \nthat would otherwise be wholly and completely a responsibility of the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe the serious debate over the future of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts has passed. I think it has passed \nbecause the National Endowment is reformed. I think it has passed \nbecause they are now doing what I believe the Endowment was originally \nintended to do, and doing it in almost every case with a remarkable \ndegree of thoughtfulness and good sense. What we come up with here, \nrepresenting only a tiny percent of what goes in the arts activities in \nthe States, is nevertheless very important in that support and vitally \nimportant in securing the private sector support for the arts, and that \nhas been in the past and will be in the future a primary source of the \nmoney.\n  Regrettably, I oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire \nin this connection. If he wishes to speak again, I am going to yield \nthe floor now. I note the presence of the Senators from Florida and \nWyoming, and I know the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, wants to \nspeak on this issue. So we are not going to bring it to a vote now. \nWhen the Senator from New Hampshire has made his comments, I will ask \nunanimous consent to go on to the next amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Was the Senator from Florida seeking to \nrespond to the amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, he is here on his own amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I have just a few brief \nresponses to my colleague.\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\n  I believe it would be a fallacy to equate Government funding, its own \nactivities, legitimate functions of the Government, to fund those \nactivities such as the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian, which \nobviously are document preservation, artifacts, and historical \nmatters--that is legitimate, in my view; but to equate that with the \nGovernment funding of private activities is where I have my \ndifferences. I think that is the difference--the Government funding its \nown activities versus the Government funding private activities.\n  I believe that art, in terms of the examples I gave, is and should be \nfunded privately because there is a matter of what is art and what is \nnot art, which is a matter of personal opinion. I don't believe \ntaxpayers should fund somebody else's view of what art is or is not. I \nalso think it is wrong for us to act without explicit constitutional \nauthority, whether it is in the arts, or education, or anything else.\n  The Senator from Washington is correct. I misspoke when I said \neducation. I should not have used that term because, also, the Federal \nGovernment, in my view, does not have a legitimate role in determining \nthe education of our children. I believe that is a local matter that \nought to be done by the States, the local communities, and parents.\n  Finally, to say it is a good thing for a Federal agency to provide a \n``seal of approval'' for the arts so that the private sector will know \nwhat to support, that is a threat to art.\n  I think that threatens the legitimate issue of art in that government \nhas no business telling people what good art is or what bad art is. I \ndon't think there is any room for the government in art.\n  Frankly, it is very interesting when you pick out the platform of the \nRepublican Party and read it. Some don't believe we should read our \nplatforms. But I happen to believe we should.\n  In the 1996 Republican Platform, there is a quote of Senator Bob Dole \nof March 10, 1995, in which he said:\n\n       On November 8, 1994, the American people sent a message to \n     Washington. Their message is my mandate to rein in \n     government, reconnect it to the values of the American \n     people, and that means making government a whole lot smaller, \n     a lot less arrogant and getting it out of matters best left \n     to the States, cities, and families across America.\n\n  That is all I am trying to do. What I am trying to say is if there is \nsome family out there--I can't believe there would be, but there may \nbe--who would like to have a children's book shown to their children \nshowing a naked man and naked woman embracing in the act of sex, if \nthey want to show that to their children, as I said before, I guess \nthat is up to them, but I don't think we ought to be funding it.\n  Furthermore, finally, what the Republican Platform said at that time \nwas:\n\n       As a first step in reforming government, we support the \n     elimination of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban \n     Development, Education, Energy, and the elimination, \n     defunding, or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, \n     redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus. \n     Examples of agencies that we seek to defund or to privatize \n     are the National Endowment for the Arts, the National \n     Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting, and the Legal Services Corporation.\n\n  I am quoting out of the platform. Finally:\n\n       In addition, we support Republican sponsored legislation \n     that would require the original sponsor of proposed \n     Federalization to cite specific constitutional authority for \n     the measure.\n\n  If you are going to offer something as an amendment or a bill which \nultimately may become law, then cite constitutional authority for it \nbecause, after all, we are here to protect and defend the Constitution.\n  That is the only point I am trying to make. I understand that the \nvotes have never been here to eliminate this agency. I don't expect \nthem to be here this time.\n  I don't mean to argue, other than to say that I ask my colleagues to \ntry to move back to the constitutionality issue because I believe that \nis what this is all about. If you make an exception, even if this was \nart that was pleasing to me, if it was art that I liked, that I \napproved of, it would be the same argument--that it has no business \nbeing funded. It is not constitutional. I don't believe that we should \nbe funding it.\n  I see my colleague from Missouri. I know he is an original sponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \namendment offered by Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire.\n  This amendment, which eliminates the $99 million appropriated to the \nNEA, gives Senators the opportunity to decide whether the Federal \nGovernment should be in the business of judging and funding art.\n  There are only two ways a Federal government could be involved in \nfunding art: either by judging it or by funding it randomly. I don't \nthink either of those is a good alternative for the Federal Government.\n  I hope a majority of my fellow Senators will agree with me that the \nFederal Government should resign from its role as a national art \ncritic--telling us what to enjoy or what not to enjoy, and spending our \nmoney to tell us that this is good or that is bad.\n  It seems to me that to have the Federal Government as an art critic \nto determine what type of art is superior to another type of art is not \nsomething that a free nation would want to encourage. Government should \nnot be in the business of subsidizing free speech, putting its so-\ncalled ``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval'' on certain pieces of so-\ncalled art.\n  When the government funds art, it will always have to make value \njudgments on what is art and what it is not. I don't think that is an \nappropriate function of government. The only way to get out of this \nbusiness is to stop government from funding art.\n  I guess you could fund art randomly--spin the wheel, and whichever \nartist's name comes up, give them the money. But you would have to \ndecide who got to be part of the lottery.\n  For those who say this is an issue of free speech, my view is that \nspeech is not free if government funds it. As a matter of fact, it is \nfunded speech, and not free speech.\n  When we tax people, we take their dollars coercively. We simply say \nthat if you do not give us the money, you go to jail. Try not paying \nyour taxes and find out whether it is enforced or not. You will find \nout that the IRS can be very convincing and very persuasive because \nthey have this independent capacity to coerce the dollars.\n  Government subsidies, even with the best intentions, are dangerous \nbecause they skew the market toward whatever the government grantmakers \nprefer. The National Endowment for the Arts grants place the stamp of \nofficial U.S. Government approval on funded art. This gives the \nendowment enormous power to dictate what is regarded as art and what is \nnot.\n  A number of art critics and people in the arts community, have \nobserved this.\n  Jan Breslauer, Los Angeles Times art critic said in 1997 that,\n\n       [T]he endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in \n     identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes \n     racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else. The \n     art world's version of affirmative action, these policies . . \n     . have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American \n     arts--pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce \n     work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than \n     their best creative instincts.--The Washington Post, March \n     16, 1997.\n\n  I would like to call myself an artist because I like to engage in \nmusical performances. I like to engage in the writing of music, and the \nwriting of poetry. But I feel a little below par, so I can't really \ncall myself an artist. There have been some who have said that some of \nmy stuff might qualify for art. But I have never qualified for a grant, \nand I don't want a grant. My wife always teases me, saying: You can't \nsell it. You can't even give it away.\n  But the idea of government funding art means that we would begin to \nbend the artist away from true expression towards something for which \nthe government was providing a subsidy. That is the point that Jan \nBreslauer makes--that this subsidy has had ``a profoundly corrosive \neffect on the American arts''--taking people away from the true \nexpression of art, ``pigeonholing artists and pressuring them.''\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\n  The concept of pressure and art is a very difficult concept to \nreconcile. I think of Michelangelo painting on the Sistine Chapel and \nthe Pope demanding one thing and another. I don't know if it is true, \nbut it is said that in response to that pressure, Michelangelo painted \ncertain people in hell as a way of indicating that he would resist the \npressure.\n  Joseph Parisi, editor of Poetry Magazine, the nation's oldest and \nmost prestigious poetry magazine, has said that disconnecting \n``artificial support systems'' for the arts, such as cuts in NEA \nfunding, has had some positive effects. Parisi has said that cuts in \nfederal spending for the arts are causing ``a shake-out of the \nsuperficial. The market demands a wider range, an appeal to a broader \nbase. Artists and writers are forced to get back to markets. What will \npeople buy? If you're tenured, if the government buys, there's no \nresponse to irrelevance.''--Atlanta Constitution, Nov. 8, 1996.\n  In short, the government should not pick and choose among different \npoints of view and value systems, and continuing politicizing the arts. \nGarth Brooks fans pay their own way, while the NEA canvasses the nation \nfor politically correct ``art'' that needs a transfusion from the \nTreasury. It is bad public policy to subsidize free speech.\n  Why I should pay full freight to go see a country star, and the \nMercedes limousine set should get a subsidy to go to the ballet, I \ndon't know.\n  On this point I refer Senators to section 316 on page 106 of the \nSenate bill, which makes a case for elimination of the funding of NEA. \nIt says the NEA can only fund those individuals who have received a \n``literature fellowship, a National Heritage Fellowship or''--I am \nstill quoting--an ``American Jazz Masters Fellowship.''\n  I know very little about music, but I spend a lot of time in music. I \nknow and appreciate that jazz is a great form of American music. But \nfor the life of me, I cannot understand why the Federal Government \nbelieves it has the wisdom to use taxes paid by a hard-working plumber \nor a policeman or a painter to decide which jazz master should be \nsubsidized and which jazz master should not be subsidized. Even if we \ncould subsidize all jazz masters, is it fair to fund jazz masters and \nnot pay stipends to a master classic pianist, a composer, a struggling \nrhythm and blues artist, or a rock-and-roller?\n  The fact that the Federal Government does not have infallible wisdom \nto serve as the Nation's art critic underscores the brilliance of our \nFounding Fathers who, in writing the Constitution, specifically voted \nagainst provisions calling on the Federal Government to subsidize the \narts. This is not a new request. The founders considered this and \nrejected it.\n  Although funding for the NEA is small in comparison to the overall \nbudget, elimination of this agency sends a message that Congress is \ntaking seriously its obligation to restrict the Federal Government's \nactions to the limited role appropriately envisioned by the framers of \nthe Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is there a specific \nthreat of authority that could reasonably be construed to include \npromotion of American jazz masters as compared to or in \ncontradistinction to classical pianists or ordinary guitar pickers.\n  During the constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787, \nDelegate Charles Pinckney introduced a motion calling for the Federal \nGovernment to subsidize the arts in the United States. Although the \nFounding Fathers were cultured individuals who knew firsthand of \nvarious European systems for public arts patronage, they overwhelmingly \nrejected Pinckney's suggestion because of their belief in limited \nconstitutional government.\n  Accordingly, nowhere in its list of powers enumerated and delegated \nto the Federal Government does the Constitution specify a power to pick \njazz masters over guitar pickers.\n  It is noteworthy what the Constitution does provide. Article I, \nsection 8, states:\n\n       The Congress [of the United States] shall have Power . . . \n     To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by \n     securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \n     exclusive Rights to their respective Writings and \n     Discoveries;\n\n  We can protect the work of artists from unlawful and inappropriate \nappropriation by those who would steal those works and profit from \nthem. In other words, our Founding Fathers established the noble goal \nof protecting intellectual property of those who are involved in \nscience or the arts. The Founding Fathers did not think the way to \nprotect the rights was to subsidize them or contaminate them or to \nprefer one or another. Instead, they believe Government protection \nshould extend to protecting their initiative, their creativity, and \ntheir discovery.\n\n  Some have taken comfort in the recent Supreme Court decisions that \nhave upheld the Federal statute directing the NEA to take into \nconsideration ``general standards of decency and respect for the \ndiverse beliefs and values of the American public'' in making grants.\n  While some have said this ruling will appropriately address the \nconcerns over the type of art the NEA will fund, I don't think that is \nthe case. Moreover, in response to the Finley decision, Chairman Ivey \nsaid the ruling was a ``reaffirmation of the agency's discretion in \nfunding the highest quality of art in America'' and that it would not \naffect his agency's day-to-day operations. That was a quote from the \nNew York Times.\n  These court cases do nothing to solve the underlying issue of whether \nGovernment should fund and decide what is art. Suffice it to say the \ntime has come to end the Federal Government's role of paying for and \nthereby politicizing art. Art should be pure, not politics, and it \nshouldn't ever become pure politics; it can, when art is elicited, \nshaped, and coerced in order to comply with Federal guidelines.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for offering this amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. In \na way, I am grateful this amendment has come to the floor. I think this \nSenate should go on record: Will we decide to go on the course \nsuggested by Senator Ashcroft of Missouri and Senator Smith of New \nHampshire and say there will be no funding of the arts in America, that \nwe have decided now at this moment in our history that we will walk \naway from governmental assistance to the artists across America who are \nstarting out and trying to develop their own skills?\n  I think that is an important question. I know as well as those \nlistening to the debate that over the last 10 or 12 years there has \nbeen a lot of controversy about the National Endowment for the Arts. \nThere have been some controversial grants, grants for art projects \nwhich I personally found reprehensible.\n  The bottom line is, it is as wrong to condemn the National Endowment \nfor the Arts because of one or two grants as it is to condemn any \nMember of the Senate for one or two votes. Each Member can make a \nmistake. Each Member can do something unpopular. Each Member can do the \nwrong thing in the eyes of the public. Yet to condemn Members as \nindividuals is just not fair, just, or American. Nor is it fair for \nMembers to condemn the National Endowment for the Arts for things that \nwere done many years ago.\n  Over the last several years, it has been my good fortune to be a \nnonvoting member of the National Council of the Arts, meeting every 6 \nmonths to review the applications for assistance to the NEA. Several \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives have shared in \nthat responsibility. It has been an eye-opener to sit as I have with \nmen and women from across America and to consider those who come to the \nNational Endowment for the Arts asking for assistance.\n\n  Listening to the speeches on the floor, one would think that these \nare people who come in with some grand political agenda or they are \nlooking for some big government seal of approval. That is not the case \nat all. By and large, these are creative people looking for an \nopportunity. Some of the opportunities which they have presented as a \nresult of the National Endowment for the Arts are amazing in their \nscope.\n  Think of the impact if we eliminate the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\n Let me tell Members about one particular program. I am sorry the \nSenator from Missouri cannot hear this because I think he would \nappreciate it since he was born in the city of Chicago. I think he \nwould understand the importance of this program.\n  In my home State of Illinois there is a program called the Merit \nMusic Program. The Merit Music Program is an exceptional effort \ninspired by one lady who decided that she would try to reach down to \nthe poorest schools in the city of Chicago and find those kids who had \nmusic potential. What she has done over the years is to literally bring \nin hundreds of kids each year who learn how to play a musical \ninstrument. These are kids who live in some of the poorest housing in \nChicago, and their most prized possession will be a violin, a clarinet. \nThey will develop musical skills.\n  Each year, I try to attend their recital on Saturday while kids from \nkindergarten on up play their musical instruments. It is an amazing \nperformance from kids who come from the poorest families. It is a \nperformance that is made possible by the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n  These kids get a chance to learn to play a musical instrument. One \nmight say, well, that is a nice hobby; what can it mean? When we follow \nthese kids through their music education, what do we find? Every single \none of these kids goes to college. These kids, given a chance at \nartistic expression, not only have wonderful fulfillment, they have \nambition. They decide they can rise above what they have seen around \nthem in their neighborhoods. That is what art and music can do.\n  I am almost at a loss for words--which is something to say for a \nSenator--when I hear those on the other side of the aisle stand and \nsay: Well, what good is this? Why would we do this? Why would we \nencourage this?\n  In downtown Chicago we have a block that has become known as Gallery \n37. In the Loop in Chicago it stands out. It is ultimately going to be \ndeveloped by some big company, I am sure. Over the last several years, \nwe have decided that Gallery 37 will be an artistic opportunity for \nkids all across Chicago, kids who can show their artistic wares, who \ncan learn skills in art, and perhaps even be trained for jobs in art. \nIt really has become a magnificent undertaking of that community that \nreaches out all across Chicago. The rich, the poor, the black, the \nwhite, the brown, all come together--Gallery 37, National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  If you go home to your community in your State, whatever it might be, \nI guarantee you will find the recipients of the grants from the \nNational Endowment for the Arts are not some people living in these \nivory towers but, rather, the folks living in your community. Does your \ncity have a local symphony orchestra? My guess is, if not this year, \nthen at some year in the past, the National Endowment for the Arts has \nhelped that symphony orchestra. Does your school system have an art \nprogram that encourages kids and moves them along? Many of those \nprograms across America receive assistance from the National Endowment \nfor the Arts.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts last year received $98 million \nout of a Federal budget of about $1.7 trillion. We took $98 million to \ngive to the National Endowment for the Arts. That is a lot of money; I \nwill concede that point. In the context of the big Federal budget, \nthough, it is a very tiny piece. But it is a piece of Federal spending \nthat is used to encourage artistic creation and expression.\n  Of what value is that expression to those of us who are simply art \nconsumers? Let me tell you a personal story. My mother was an immigrant \nto this country. She came at the age of 2 from Lithuania with her \nmother and grew up in East St. Louis, IL. She made it to the eighth \ngrade, and that is when she had to stop and go to work as a switchboard \noperator at a telephone company. She raised me and my two brothers, and \nshe was a woman who was always trying to learn and to appreciate \nthings. I would like to tell the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, \nshe used to put us in the family car on a Sunday afternoon and we would \ngo across the bridge to the St. Louis Art Museum, and my mother and I \nwould walk through there looking at paintings. Frankly, she had no \nknowledge of art, but she knew what she liked and appreciated. How many \nSunday afternoons we walked through there and I looked at those \npaintings. As a kid, I was totally bored. As I got a little older, I \ncame to appreciate them. But here she was, a simple woman, immigrant \nwoman, a blue-collar worker, who thought it was important her son see \nart and what it stands for.\n\n  So when I hear the arguments made that this is unfair to blue-collar \nworkers across America, to ask them to take a tiny fraction of their \nFederal taxes and devote it to the arts, I think those critics miss the \npoint. Visit museums on The Mall here in Washington or in any city \nacross America, and I guarantee you will see a cross-section of \nAmerican life, the rich and the poor, the educated and the uneducated, \nall appreciating what art can bring to our lives. This is not something \nfor which we should apologize. It is something we should be proud of. \nThe legacy we will leave in America for future generations is not just \na legacy of concrete and steel; it is a legacy of art as well.\n  Those who visit countries around the world, wherever they may be, \nusually stop first at the art museums because they want to see the \ncollections. It says something about the value of art when it comes to \ncivilization. To think we would take a step backwards on the floor of \nthe Senate today and decide we will no longer, after years and years, \nprovide assistance and money for the arts is unthinkable. It is \nunthinkable. In a way, I appreciate the opportunity to have this \namendment. Let's have a record vote. Let's see how many people here \nwant to join a group which basically says that the United States of \nAmerica, with all of its richness, with all of its diversity, cannot \nafford $98 million to encourage the arts.\n  Let me tell you about another art project that received a decoration, \nan award from the National Endowment for the Arts. It is called Street \nLevel Art, and it is an amazing thing. It is in the city of Chicago \nagain. Two young men who worked for advertising agencies decided they \njust didn't quite like going to work 9 to 5 every day. They wanted to \ndo something more. So they gathered together equipment from people who \nwere getting new versions of computers and videotape machines and the \nlike. They put it in a little storefront on Chicago Avenue, and they \ninvited kids from junior high and high school across Chicago to come \nafter school to learn how to make documentary films and to do animation \nfor cartoons.\n  I met a young lady there who lived on the south side of Chicago who \nliterally had to take three buses after school to get to the Street \nLevel Art Program, but she was so excited at the prospect of developing \nher skills, her creativity in art. This is another group that received \nan award from the National Endowment for the Arts. For Senators to come \nto the floor and say get Government out of this business is to \nbasically say do not get the seed money to Street Level, don't give the \nseed money to Gallery 37, don't give the seed money to Merit music. If \nwe did, if we said we are going to close the door and turn out the \nlights on Government involvement for the arts, would we be a better \nnation for that? I do not think so.\n\n  I think, frankly, the National Endowment for the Arts has done an \nexcellent job. It has learned some valuable political lessons over the \nlast several years. It is unfortunate the sponsors of this amendment do \nnot concede that point and they cannot join the other Members of the \nSenate to come with me to these meetings twice a year to see what is \ninvolved because not only education programs but children's festivals, \nliterary programs, orchestras, museums, dance companies, all receive a \nhelping hand from this National Endowment for the Arts.\n  I see Senator Sessions from Alabama on the floor here. He has joined \nme at meetings of the National Endowment. The President has proposed a \nprogram. It is called ``Challenge America.'' A point made by Senator \nSessions at one of our meetings, and a valid one, was that the National \nEndowment for the Arts should reach out into communities which have not \ntraditionally been served and helped by the National Endowment, and \nthey are doing that. I think that is the right thing to do because we \ncan encourage artistic expression in the rural areas of Alabama and the \nrural areas of Illinois. I think we will be better for it.\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not provide a great deal of funding for \nthat, but the bottom line is that it is a concept we should pursue in \nthis country. As it stands, this is still in the concept stage, but it \nis an important concept, particularly when it comes to educating and \nreaching out to young people at risk of dropping out of school or \nbecoming delinquent or abusing drugs.\n  We spend so much time here on the floor wrestling with problems that \nAmerican families are worried over, not the least of which was the \nshooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. We are trying to \nread and study and speak among ourselves and say: What is going on in \nthe minds of these children that they would become so violent, grab a \ngun, and shoot at their classmates?\n  Even though I am a parent and proud of the three children my wife and \nI raised, and our grandchild, I do not consider myself a specialist in \nthis area. But I do remember from my own life experience, watching my \nkids grow up, if you give a young person a chance for fulfillment, that \nyoung person sometimes will show you that chance has not been \nsquandered and will make something good of it. Some of them will be the \nbest students in the class. Others may not be great when it comes to \ngrades, but they may turn out to be excellent artists or excellent \nmusicians.\n  If we close down the NEA and turn out the lights, as this amendment \nsuggests, we are turning out the lights on a lot of young children in \nAmerica who just need an opportunity to express themselves, to prove \nthemselves. Without that opportunity, they will certainly be \nfrustrated; I hope not worse. But it really would be a loss for this \nNation.\n  I sincerely hope this amendment is defeated, and I hope it is \ndefeated overwhelmingly because I believe, in defeating this amendment, \nwe will make it clear that when it comes to freedom of expression and \nencouragement of arts, even though our investment is relatively small \nin terms of the larger Federal budget, it is still important because it \nsays what we are about in America. We are about encouraging diversity \nof opinion, encouraging artistic expression, encouraging our young \npeople to fulfill themselves.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in defeating this amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not yield my place in the floor but----\n  Mr. GORTON. No. But simply for the benefit of all Members, if the \nSenator from Minnesota could give us some kind of estimate as to how \nlong he will speak? Because we are going to another matter soon. When \nhis remarks are over, I will move to table the Smith amendment. We will \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  I misled my colleagues from Florida and Wyoming, who have an \namendment that I think can be disposed of relatively quickly and I \ntrust without a rollcall vote. But because of the lunch hour, I hope we \ncan get to a vote on this amendment without disrupting everyone.\n  Does the Senator from Virginia wish to speak on this amendment?\n  Mr. ROBB. Not on this amendment, Mr. President, but I would like to \nmake a statement at the appropriate time on this legislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I will be \nrelatively brief. I will try to keep my remarks under an hour.\n  Did the Senator hear what I said? I was kidding. I said I would keep \nmy remarks under an hour. Was that the Senator's approval? In 10 \nminutes I will be able to say what I need to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, without his losing his right to the floor, I \nwould like to make a few brief remarks on this amendment also.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I will certainly wait.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida says I cannot \ndo it in 10 minutes, but I am going to prove him wrong.\n  I do not know whether I can add that much to the remarks of Senator \nDurbin. I have heard the Senator speak quite often. I actually think \nthat was one of the strongest statements. Really. I wish I were not \nfollowing him.\n  I say to all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, this \nwill be a healthy vote because we ought to vote on how we view the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. As a Senator from Minnesota, I think \nthe most important thing we can do as Senators is to do our work every \nday in such a way that we can assure equal opportunity for every child. \nThat is the way I approach this topic, I say to my friend from New \nHampshire.\n  Senator Durbin's point was well taken. What you want to do with \nchildren, starting at a very early age, is you want to take that spark \nof learning that all children have--they are so eager--and we need to \nignite it. Different children are good at different things. Some are \nreally good at academics, at least the way we define formal academics; \nsome are athletes; some are musicians; some are artists.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts has done an absolutely fabulous \njob of funding some of the most wonderful community arts partnerships \nyou ever want to see in the State of Minnesota, by the way, rural as \nwell as urban. There is some great work with at-risk kids, some great \nwork with all the children in Minnesota--white us, black us, brown us--\nall of us. It is united. It is wholesome.\n  There have been mistakes made. I agree with Senator Durbin, Jane \nAlexander understood that and did a great deal to correct some of the \nmistakes that had been made. I do not think that has been properly \nacknowledged in this amendment that my colleagues bring to the floor.\n  Overall, it is so enriching and it is so exciting to see what is done \nwith these community arts partnerships.\n  I did not get a chance to hear the remarks of my colleague from \nMissouri, so it would not be fair to him--he is not here--for me to \neven try to respond to what I think he may have said based upon what \nSenator Durbin said.\n  I have had a chance to visit with the arts community. I have had a \nchance to see some of these projects take hold in Minnesota, in our \nneighborhoods, in our communities, urban, rural, and suburban, and I am \nespecially focused on children and kids.\n  This does not have a thing to do with blue collar, white collar, high \nincome, low income, middle income. This has really been some wonderful, \nnurturing, enriching work with children in Minnesota, some of whom have \nreally come into their own as a result of the way in which the NEA \ngrants and good art work and artists have reached them. Some of the \nthings that these kids do, some of the ways in which they are creative \nand express themselves, some of the ways in which they, in turn, \ncontribute to community, based upon the nurturing and the support from \nthe NEA grants--it is just a marvelous thing to see.\n  Yes, mistakes have been made, but I call on Senators to be our own \nbest selves. I do view this as a vote that has a whole lot to do with \nchildren, a whole lot to do with kids, a whole lot to do with the \nimportance of community arts partnerships. I hope this amendment will \nbe defeated with a resounding vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment that is being \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire, my good friend Mr. Smith. He \nand I serve together on the Armed Services Committee. I have great \nrespect for him and certainly for many of his viewpoints. But on this \nmatter, I will oppose his amendment.\n  I am a product of the Depression as well as the days and some of the \nyears ante-Depression. When I graduated from high school in 1934, which \nwas 65 years ago now, I was the valedictorian of the class. Of course, \nwe only had 28 in the class. If there had been 29, I might not have \nbeen the valedictorian. But I was very fortunate in going to the Mark \nTwain High School and grade school in a coal mining community in \nsouthern West Virginia.\n  Mark Twain High School had a faculty that probably would have matched \nthe faculty of a junior college in these\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\ndays. Teachers did not get paid much, but they were highly dedicated \nteachers.\n  The principal of the high school was a man by the name of William \nJennings Bryan Cormany. And his wife, Marguerite Cormany, was an \nexcellent music teacher. Mr. Cormany was a strict disciplinarian. He \nwas the kind of high school principal we should have all across this \ncountry these days. We paid attention in his class. He taught physics. \nHe was an excellent teacher.\n  His wife organized a high school orchestra and a band. She wanted me \nto be in the band. I was the bass drummer. The bass drum was larger \nthan I was, but I was the bass drummer. She also talked me into taking \nlessons on the violin. My foster father was a coal miner, and through \nthe sweat of his brow, he bought me a violin. I can remember the \nSaturday afternoon when we piled into a large flat-bed truck and went \nfrom Stotesbury to Beckley, about 15 miles away.\n  I went back home that night. I had a violin case tucked under my arm \nwith a violin in it. My dad paid all of about $28 or $29 for this \nviolin, violin bow, and violin case. I went home that night and had \nvisions of becoming a Schubert or a Chopin. I could see myself being \none of the great artists. Those were dreams.\n\n       How great it is to believe the dream\n       As we stand in youth at the starlit stream,\n       But greater still to live life through\n       And find at the end that the dream is true.\n\n  I dreamed of being a great musician. My natural father was a \nmusician. He was not an educated man. He never took a music lesson in \nhis life. I never knew him very well. I only lived with him about a \nweek in my life. He was my natural father.\n\n  I lost my mother when I was less than a year old. She died with the \ninfluenza in 1918. But she wanted my father, if she died with the \ninfluenza, to give me to one of his sisters who had married a Byrd. She \ndied the next day or so after she came down with the flu.\n  My father just had a natural talent for many things. When he went out \nto pick the beans in the garden, he would be memorizing chapters from \nthe Bible. He could play almost any instrument he ever put his hands \non--the organ, the banjo, the guitar, the Autoharp, and so on. He had a \nnatural talent for music.\n  I inherited some of that talent for music. I loved it. And so my coal \nminer dad, who was my uncle, bought this violin for me. I started \ntaking lessons when I was in the 7th grade in school. When I graduated, \nof course, I was still in the orchestra and in the band.\n  By that time, I had also learned to play many of the old mountain \ntunes. My music teacher, Mrs. Cormany, did not take that very well. She \nwas not very happy that I would go out behind the schoolhouse and play \n``Old Joe Clark'' on my fiddle or ``Arkansas Traveler'' or ``The \nMississippi Sawyer'' or ``The Chicken Reel.'' She did not approve of \nthat. But I did it nevertheless. So, I came to learn to play ``by \near,'' as they say.\n  Well, now, my boyhood without that music would have been an empty \nboyhood. I started out in life where the bottom rungs in the ladder \nwere not there. They were missing. There was not the first rung or the \nsecond rung. As I say, I grew up in the Depression, which was a hard, \nhard life at best.\n  But the music did something for me. It did for me what David's music \ndid for Saul when he appeared before King Saul. Music through the ages \nhas come from the depths of the soul of man. It has been an inspiration \nto him Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel; Leonardo da Vinci and the \nMona Lisa; Phidias, who was a great sculptor at the time of Pericles. \nPericles lived in the latter half of the 5th century. I remember the \nPeloponnesian Wars lasted from 431 to about 404 BC. Phidias was a great \nsculptor at that time.\n  All through the ages, men have had this desire to use their talents. \nWe read about seeing the forms of animals or persons carved into the \ncaves of ancient mankind and on the obelisks in Egypt. We know about \nthe cuneiform writings, the Sumerians, the Hittites, the ancient \nChinese. The ancient peoples drew word pictures before they learned to \nwrite.\n  There is something about man that is above the animal. Do not tell me \nthat man is an animal. I know they teach that in school, but they are \nall wrong. They are 100 percent wrong. Man is not an animal. An animal \ncannot draw a picture. An animal cannot paint a picture. An animal \ncannot play a violin. An animal cannot memorize the multiplication \ntable. Man is not an animal.\n  God created man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his \nnostrils the breath of life. There is a spark of the divinity in man. A \nman is a little above the beasts of the field, a little lower than the \nangels, but there is that spark of divinity. There is something in \nmankind that tends to lift his spirit in the lofty flights of song and \npoetry. Music is one of those talents that is ingrained in the genes of \nman.\n  I can certainly understand the feelings of Senators with respect to \nsome of the recipients of funds from the National Endowment of the Arts \nin years gone by. They were absolutely foolish, stupid to make those \nawards. It was colossal stupidity on the part of the Endowment to award \ngrants to people who had such motives and objectives as a few of them \nhad. But they were a tiny few. I think it would be a very serious \nmistake here to strike this from the bill.\n\n  Who knows, there may be a little Michelangelo, there may be a little \nBenjamin West. Benjamin West said that one day he took to his mother \nsome childish drawings of birds, and his mother took him up on her \nknee, kissed him, and said: ``Son, you will grow up to be a great \npainter.'' Benjamin West said that it was a mother's kiss that led him \nto become a great painter. The encouragement that his mother gave him \nafter seeing the childish drawings and paintings that he had made \ncaused him to aspire to do greater things.\n  I can remember that my dad was very poor, the man who raised me. At \nChristmastime, he never gave me a cap buster or a cowboy suit. In \nsaying this, I do not denigrate those things. But he gave me a \nwatercolor set or a drawing tablet or a book. He did not want me to be \na coal miner, as he had been.\n  So here we are today. In a sense, we can feel that in passing this \nlegislation, as we are passing it, and providing funds--and funds are \nhard to come by--but we are in a sense providing a little watercolor \nset or a drawing tablet--we can put it down to that level--to some \ntalented, ambitious, deserving achieving person.\n  I close with this poem, if I can recall it, which tells the story. \nWho knows, out of these funds there may not be just one, but there may \nbe many masters--masters--as they develop the talents that are borne \nwithin their genes. Many people have those talents and never have the \nopportunity to develop them. So, where we can, I think, provide the \nopportunity and the encouragement, we ought to do it. That is a side of \nlife--a side of our culture that is uplifting. We should not attempt to \ndampen it down, or discourage or put it beyond the reach of those who \ncannot otherwise afford it.\n\n     'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer\n       Thought it scarcely worth his while\n     To waste much time on the old violin,\n       But held it up with a smile:\n     ``What am I bidden, good folks,'' he cried,\n       ``Who'll start the bidding for me?''\n     ``A dollar, a dollar''; then, ``Two!'' ``Only two?\n       Two dollars, and who'll make it three?\n     Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;\n       Going for three----'' But no,\n     From the room, far back, a gray-haired man\n       Came forward and picked up the bow;\n     Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,\n       And tightening the loose strings,\n     He played a melody pure and sweet\n       As a caroling angel sings.\n\n     The music ceased, and the auctioneer,\n       With a voice that was quiet and low,\n     Said: ``What am I bid for the old violin?''\n       And he held it up with the bow.\n     ``A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?\n       Two thousand! and who'll make it three?\n     Three thousand, once, three thousand twice,\n       And going, and gone,'' said he.\n     The people cheered, but some of them cried,\n       ``We do not quite understand\n     What changed its worth.'' Swift came the reply:\n       ``The touch of a master's hand.''\n\n     And many a man with life out of tune,\n       And battered and scarred with sin,\n     Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,\n       Much like the old violin.\n     A ``mess of pottage,'' a glass of wine;\n       A game--and he travels on.\n     He is ``going'' once, and ``going'' twice,\n       He's ``going'' and almost ``gone.''\n     But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd\n       Never can quite understand\n     The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\n       By the touch of the Master's hand.\n\n  Let us defeat this amendment and reject it overwhelmingly let us \ncontinue to make it possible for some future masters to lay their \ntalented hands upon the culture of our own civilization and thereby \nbenefit all of posterity.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only reason I sought recognition is to \nspeak before the motion to table is made. I apologize to my friend, the \nmanager of the bill, recognizing how badly he wants to move on. I feel \ninclined to speak on this amendment.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, my friend, I have had many \ninspirational times on the Senate floor, and most of them have been \ndirectly attributable to the Senator from West Virginia. If what we \njust listened to, was not inspirational, then someone wasn't listening.\n  I had the honor a week ago to participate in a parliamentary exchange \nwith the British Parliament. I was able to meet with a small group of \nBritish parliamentarians, with a number of Senators in West Virginia. \nThe hosts of that event were Senators Byrd and Stevens. It was a \nwonderful weekend where we talked issues.\n  One evening we were able to meet and have a social event in a place \ncalled Kate's Mountain in West Virginia. I had been there only once \nbefore. I came to realize, on my first trip to West Virginia at Kate's \nMountain, what that song, those West Virginia hills where I was born, \nmeans to someone from West Virginia because Kate's Mountain is part of \nthose West Virginia hills. I appreciate those hills, even though I \nwasn't born in those West Virginia hills. Part of the entertainment \nthat night, just a few days ago, was a blue grass band playing. Senator \nByrd participated in the entertainment. He took the microphone and \nproceeded to sing. It was a wonderful, fun, entertaining evening.\n  Well, Mr. President, I can't sing. I can't play a musical instrument. \nBut there is no one in the world that enjoys music more than I enjoy \nmusic. I have tried to play music. I have tried to sing. I can remember \nas a young man in high school, I wanted to sing. I went to try out for \nthe choir at Basic High School in Henderson, NV. I can still remember \nthe choir director, Chapman Wooten, a wonderful man, but he could \nunderstand talent when he saw it. He didn't see it in me. He said I \nshould continue playing football and baseball and pass on the choir.\n  I didn't make the choir. In fact, I only was there a few minutes. But \nI still love music. I can't paint a picture. I have tried. My \ngrandchildren paint better than I do. But I love to see people paint \npictures, and I love to see the finished product. I have in my home \npaintings that may not be very valuable, but they are valuable to me. \nThey are paintings I have bought because I loved those paintings. I can \nremember the first painting I ever bought. I was just out of law \nschool. I went to the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas and a man by the \nname of McCarthy had an exhibit there. I don't know if he has ever made \na living painting, but I gave him $75 for a painting that I still have. \nIf you come in my home, there is the first painting that I ever bought. \nI bought that painting because it reminded me of my wife. It is a \npainting of a woman. I love that picture.\n  I was born and raised, as most of you know, in a little place called \nSearchlight, NV. We had very little entertainment in Searchlight. There \nwasn't a church to go to. I never went to a church until I went to high \nschool. There wasn't one to go to. In the whole town there was one \nperson who played a piano. I don't know how well she played it, but she \nplayed the piano for Christmas programs. That is about all I can \nremember. She was a woman of some note. She was not noted for playing \nher piano. She had been married 14 times. I know that because she was \nmarried to a few of my uncles. But she played the piano. She was our \nmusic in Searchlight. Any program we had, she was part of it.\n\n  I am sure in that little town of Searchlight there were people who \ncould have played, if there had been someone there to give them a \nlesson, someone who could paint a picture, if there was someone who \ncould teach them how to paint a picture. In the entire time that I was \ngrowing up in Searchlight, I don't remember a single person playing a \nmusical instrument because they didn't play one. I don't remember a \nsingle person painting a picture because they didn't paint a picture. \nThere was no one there to help us, to encourage us.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts is a program that I envision as \nhelping kids like Harry Reid growing up in rural America, rural Nevada. \nIt also helps kids in urban America, but I think of it as to what I can \nrelate to. The National Endowment for the Arts is a program that is \nimportant for people in this country.\n  I can remember first becoming acquainted with the National Endowment \nfor the Arts because Senator Byrd allowed me to conduct some of the \nhearings when he was chairman of the Interior Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee. I conducted the hearings. I loved doing that. \nWe conducted hearings relating to the National Endowment for the Arts. \nI became so impressed with the work that they do that I have been a fan \never since.\n  In Elko, NV, we benefit from the National Endowment for the Arts and \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities. There is a great program; it \nis world famous now. It is called the Cowboy Poetry Festival. It took \nyears to get off the ground. A man by the name of Cannon got it \nstarted. He started off in Utah, and he did everything he could because \nhe had this idea that there was cowboy poetry that should be preserved \nand perpetuated. He couldn't get it off the ground. He went to private \nfoundations. He did everything he could. They didn't think his idea was \nvery good. He went to Elko, NV, and luckily the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts helped him get this \nprogram started. Now it is world famous. You can't find a motel or a \nhotel room when this festival is occuring. People recite poetry. There \nare books on western American history that are written and talked about \nand presentations made. It is because of these programs, the National \nEndowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities.\n  In Nevada, we benefit all over. There are so many things. I have a \nspate of papers here talking about how great these programs are. One \nfrom Delores Nast. She doesn't teach art. She is not a teacher. She \nloves art, though. She writes: Many Nevadans believe strongly that part \nof our tax dollars should be directed towards support of our Nation's \ncultural and educational initiatives.\n  What an understatement. The most powerful Nation in the entire world \ncan't spend a few dollars on helping kids from Searchlight, NV, learn \nto paint a picture or play a musical instrument. Yes, we can do that. \nWe must do that.\n  I am not going to, as I say, hold up the manager of this bill. I only \nwant to say that we in Nevada believe in the National Endowment for the \nArts. There are some people who criticize it, but they criticize \nanything dealing with government. I am proud of supporting the National \nEndowment for the Arts. I am proud of supporting a motion to table this \namendment. It should be tabled overwhelmingly because we, the most \npowerful Nation in the world, need to spend more, not less, on the \narts.\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont has \na quick unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on roll call No. 258, I was recorded as \nvoting ``nay.'' I ask unanimous consent to change my vote to ``yea.'' \nThis will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to voice my \nsupport for the Arts in general, and specifically for the National \nEndowment for the Arts. I also want the Senate and my constituents to \nknow that I would have demonstrated this support with my vote if I had \nnot been engaged in an important meeting at the White House while the \nvote was taking place.\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\n  This meeting today concerned the future of the steel industry and the \nAdministration's commitment to work with Congress, the industry and \nlabor to ensure that unfair and illegal imports are returned to pre-\ncrisis levels. As my colleagues and constituents know, my commitment to \nthe future stability and viability of our domestic steel industry--\nwhich is critical to the economic well-being of West Virginia--is \nunwavering, and for that reason I felt it necessary to remain at the \nWhite House for this important meeting.\n  Unfortunately, the vote on the Smith Amendment was called earlier \nthan anticipated, and I missed the vote. I would have voted against the \nSmith Amendment if I could have been in the chamber because I believe \nin funding for the arts, including the National Endowment for the Arts. \nI take comfort in the fact that the lopsided margin meant that my vote \nwas not necessary to ensure funding for the NEA. I understand that some \nhave challenged NEA's funding decisions in recent years, but I believe \nthe agency has done an admirable job in modifying its policies and \ndecision making process to respond to concerns. Thanks to these \nefforts, the NEA is a stronger organization. The arts and the NEA \ncontribute greatly to our culture, and it is a valuable investment in \nmy view.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I add my voice in support of the National \nEndowment of the Arts, and in opposition to Senator Smith's amendment. \nThe NEA continues to provide valuable seed money to support a range of \nworthy endeavors, such as orchestras, inner-city arts outreach programs \nand efforts to preserve vanishing American cultural institutions. In \naddition, the NEA plays a strong role in promoting private investment \nin the arts and helps to bring culture to those Americans who are \nordinarily unable to afford access to the arts. As a country, we ought \nto continue to support these efforts. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I compliment both the Senator from Nevada \nand the Senator from West Virginia on very thoughtful and fascinating \nstatements on this matter.\n  I move to table the Smith amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1569.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from Colorado (Mr. Allard) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:06 this \nafternoon the Senate begin consideration of the reconciliation \nconference report, notwithstanding the receipt of the papers, and there \nbe 6 hours for debate to be equally divided in the usual form with the \nvote to occur at the conclusion or yielding back of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBB. Reserving the right to object, may I ask a question of the \nmajority leader.\n  Is it the majority leader's intention to return to the underlying \nbill, the Interior appropriations bill, at the conclusion of \nconsideration of the tax bill today?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, to respond to the Senator's question, it is. \nWhen we complete reconciliation, at the conclusion of this 6 hours or \nyielding back time, which theoretically could occur, then when that is \ncompleted our intent is to go back to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The agreement we had last week was that this week we would try to \ncomplete these two appropriations bills, Agriculture and Interior, \ncomplete the reconciliation conference report, and try to get as many \nnominations confirmed as we could get cleared on both sides.\n  We are still assiduously pursuing that goal.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, continuing to reserve the right to object, I \nask the majority leader, without specifically asking for an additional \nunanimous consent request, that if it is his intention to proceed, \nthose of us who have been waiting through two sessions to either raise \npoints of order, offer amendments, or whatever the case may be, to the \nInterior appropriations bill, might be able to do so tonight after \nconclusion of this bill. I am in full agreement with the expedition of \na number of matters that have been pending on this floor, particularly \nsome of the appointments. While I may not favor the tax bill that will \nbe taken up this afternoon, I am in favor of moving the trains.\n  With that, if the majority leader is prepared to give that verbal \nunderstanding his concurrence, I will not object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I give my concurrence in that. We intend to \nreturn to the Interior appropriations bill. I believe the distinguished \nmanager of this legislation would be glad to agree we would go to this \nissue immediately upon return, with a vote if one is required.\n  Mr. GORTON. If the majority leader will yield, I would be delighted \nto have the first item to be dealt with, with respect to the Interior \nappropriations bill, immediately after the vote on the tax bill, be the \npoint of order the Senator from Virginia wishes to raise.\n  Mr. ROBB.

Our \nchairman did a superb job, never an easy one with the other side. But \nhere it is before us and he is to be congratulated. I, for one, am \ndeeply grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. He has headed many of these conferences. I particularly recall \nsome of the transportation conferences he has headed in which he did \nlandmark work. Having kind words coming from him and praises is doubly \nimportant to me. I greatly appreciate them. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the conference report \nto accompany S. 507, the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. This \nmeasure, similar to water resources legislation enacted in 1986, 1988, \n1990 and 1992, is comprised of water resources project and study \nauthorizations, as well as important policy initiatives, for the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers Civil Works program.\n  This bill was introduced by Senator Warner at the beginning of this \nyear. In previous years, the Senator from Virginia had been the \nchairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of the \nSenate. In that role he guided a similar bill through the Senate during \nthe previous Congress. We are very grateful for his hard work on this \nlegislation and sticking with the project considering the new demands \non his time as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Unfortunately, the House was unable to pass a companion measure last \nyear because of a dispute over flood control and water supply in the \nState of California. So, this WRDA bill is somewhat overdue.\n  This year, S. 507 was adopted unanimously by the Senate on April 19, \n1999. On April 29 of this year, the House of Representatives adopted \nits version of the legislation by a vote of 418 to 6.\n  Since that time, we have worked together with our colleagues from the \nHouse of Representatives and the administration to reach bipartisan \nagreement on a sensible compromise measure. Because of the numerous \ndifferences between the Senate- and House-passed bills, completion of \nthis conference report has required many hours of negotiation.\n  To ensure that the items contained in this legislation are responsive \nto the nation's most pressing water infrastructure and environmental \nneeds, we have adhered to a set of criteria established in previous \nwater resources law. Mr. President, let me take a few moments here to \ndiscuss these criteria--that is--the criteria used by the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to determine the merit of \nproposed projects, project studies and policy directives.\n  In 1986 Congress enacted and President Reagan signed a Water \nResources Development Act that broke new ground. Importantly, the 1986 \nAct marked an end to the sixteen-year deadlock between Congress and the \nexecutive branch regarding authorization of the Army Corps Civil Works \nprogram.\n  In addition to authorizing numerous projects, the 1986 Act resolved \nlongstanding disputes relating to cost-sharing between the Army Corps \nand non-federal sponsors, waterway user fees, environmental \nrequirements and, importantly, the types of projects in which federal \ninvolvement is appropriate and warranted.\n  Each flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, or other \nproject requires a local cost share that is applied uniformly across \nthe nation.\n  Second, projects are not authorized until various reports and studies \nhave been completed to assure that the projects are justified from \neconomic, engineering and environmental perspectives.\n  Third, projects must fit within the traditional mission of the civil \nworks program of the Army Corps. That mission includes flood control, \nimprovements to navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental \nrestoration.\n  These are the precepts that we have applied to the provisions \ncontained in the pending conference report. Although there are special \ncircumstances that justify exceptions to every rule, I believe that \nthis bill does a good job of adhering to the fundamental purposes and \nprinciples of the WRDA program.\n  Water resources legislation has been enacted on a biennial basis \nsince 1986, with the exception of 1994.\n  The bill we are bringing back from conference today includes scores \nof projects with a total federal authorization of approximately $4.3 \nbillion. Importantly, more than $1.5 billion of this amount will go \ntoward environmental mitigation and restoration and water cleanup \nprojects for sewage discharges, stormwater retention, and the control \nof combined sewer overflows.\n  A bill like this takes hard work by many parties. I would like to \nsalute our Senate conferees, Senators Smith, Baucus, Moynihan, \nVoinovich, and Boxer. As I said earlier, Senator Warner has been the \nkey player on this bill as its author, manager and member of the \nconference committee.\n  Senate staff playing a key role on this bill included Ann Loomis for \nSenator Warner and JoEllen Darcy for Senator Baucus. On my staff, first \nDan Delich and, after he left us, Abigail Kinnison and Chelsea \nHenderson, have worked many long hours to make this bill possible.\n  On the House side, the chairman of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, Congressman Shuster, and committee members, \nCongressman Oberstar and Congressman Boehlert deserve high praise for \ntheir work. We thank them very much for the spirit of compromise they \nbrought to the conference and for their efforts to complete this task \nbefore the recess.\n  I am pleased to bring this conference report to the Senate. I trust \nthat those who every day depend on the fine work of the Corps of \nEngineers to protect their lives and their livelihoods will benefit \ngreatly from the legislative work that has been done.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the adoption of \nthe Conference Report to accompany S. 507, The Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999, WRDA.\n  As we all know, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998 passed \nthis Chamber last year, but was never enacted. This Conference Report \nbuilds upon the work done on that legislation and includes some \nadditional projects and programs for the Army Corps of Engineers. With \nthe adoption of this conference report, we wrap up some unfinished \nbusiness from the 105th Congress and are back on course for development \nof a Water Resources Development Act for 2000.\n  S. 507 authorizes projects for flood control, navigation, shore \nprotection, environmental restoration, water supply storage and \nrecreation, as well as several studies which will be the basis for \nfuture Corps projects. The projects have the support of a local sponsor \nwilling to share the cost of the project with the Federal Government.\n  Many of the projects contained in this bill are necessary to protect \nthe nation's shorelines, along oceans, lakes and rivers. Several of the \nnavigation projects need timely authorization in order to keep our \nports competitive in the global marketplace. The projects will be \nreviewed by the Army Corps of Engineers and must be in the federal\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\ninterest, technologically feasible, economically justified and \nenvironmentally sound in order to go forward. In other words, these are \nprojects worthy of our support.\n  Furthermore, the bill authorizes studies, including a comprehensive, \ncumulative impact study of the Yellowstone River in my home state of \nMontana, that need to get underway so that we can make informed \ndecisions about the future use and management of these precious \nresources.\n  In addition, the conference report contains a new continuing \nauthorities program, known as Challenge 21. This program, proposed by \nthe Administration and supported by the conferees, emphasizes non-\nstructural flood damage reduction measures and riverine and wetland \necosystem measures that conserve, restore and manage the natural \nfunctions and values of the floodplain. We hope that this new program \nwill integrate needed flood damage reduction with the ecosystem in a \nmore natural way than traditional brick and mortar. Programs like \nChallenge 21 will help move the traditional Corps' mission into the \nnext century.\n  I am pleased the conference report has been approved.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \nenact the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. This important \nlegislation continues the Corps of Engineers civil works critical \nmission to provide flood control, hurricane protection, river and \nharbor navigation improvements, environmental restoration of our \nnation's waterways and other water resource infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  Since 1986 when the Congress and the Executive Branch reach agreement \non landmark cost-sharing principles that apply to the preparation and \nconstruction of these projects, the Congress has endeavored to enact \nthis reauthorization bill on a two-year cycle.\n  As the former Chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Congress enacted \na water resources reauthorization bill in 1996. Regrettably, due to the \ncomplexities involving a project to provide flood protection for the \nSacramento, California area, the House and Senate were unable to \nresolve the differences concerning this project in 1998.\n  Today, the conference report before the Senate includes those \nprojects in last year's bill along with other construction projects \nthat the Corps of Engineers has reviewed and judged to be in the \nnational interest. Through a comprehensive process to study and analyze \nthe scope of individual projects, the Chief of the Corps of Engineers \nhas found the 45 authorizations for new construction projects to be \ntechnically sound, economically justified and environmentally \nacceptable.\n  Mr. President, this simply means that the Federal taxpayer will \nreceive a higher return on the economic benefits resulting from \nconstruction of these projects compared to the individual construction \ncosts. Also, for these projects, a state or local government will \nprovide from 35 percent to 50 percent of the costs of construction.\n  The Corps civil works program provides significant protection to \nlives and property from flooding and coastal storms. The maintenance of \nour river and harbor navigation channels are critical for us to \nmaintain a competitive edge in a ``one-world'' economic market.\n  The value of water resource projects is well-documented. In 1997, \nCorps flood control projects prevented approximately $45.2 billion in \ndamages. The Corps continues to support the navigation channel \ndeepening projects so that the larger class of cargo ships and super \ncoal colliers can call on our commercial water ports. The value of \ncommerce on these waterways totaled over $600 billion in 1997, \ngenerating approximately 16 million jobs.\n  Mr. President, the conference report also contains very important \nprovisions to strengthen and expand the Corps new focus on \nenvironmental restoration of our nation's waterways. We have \nestablished a new program, known as ``Challenge 21'', which provides \nthe Corps with the direction to work with local communities to \ndeveloped non-structural flood control projects. This is an initiative \nthat will hopefully produce less-costly flood control options. This \nprogram will be important to financially-strapped communities who may \nnot be able to afford to provide the 35 percent local costs for a \ntraditional flood control project. Also, this program will foster the \npreservation of sensitive ecosystems that provide vital flood \nprotection in the floodplain.\n  Challenge 21 also has the potential to produce significant savings in \nthe reduction of flood damages and Federal flood damage assistance \ncosts.\n  Mr. President, since the enactment of the 1986 water resources bill \nwhich established cost-sharing requirements for the construction of \nwater projects, I have been committed to applying these requirements to \nprojects authorized in subsequent bills. I applaud my Senate colleagues \nfor enacting Senate legislation that adhere to these rules. The cost-\nsharing requirements have been successful in leveraging non-Federal \nfunds and they have ensured that only those projects with the greatest \nmerit, economic benefit and local support move forward.\n  It was my view, along with Chairman Chafee and the Ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, that we must insist on the cost-sharing requirement for \nprojects authorized in this bill. I regret, however, that the \nconference report does not apply the cost-sharing principles in all \ncases.\n  I would just ask my House and Senate colleagues to remember the 10-\nyear stalemate that existed between the Congress and the Executive \nBranch from 1975 to 1986. At that time no water resource projects moved \nforward because the Executive Branch insisted on some level financial \ncontribution from those who would benefit from these projects. By 1986, \nthe Congress and the Administration reached agreement on a fair \nallocation of costs and since that time there has been an orderly \nprocess for planning, designing and constructing water resource \nprojects.\n  We must not abandon cost-sharing rules, or else there is the very \nreal possibility of again triggering a halt to Federal funding for \nthese important projects. I will continue to work to follow the \nrequirements of the 1986 bill and stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, which was three years in the making, \ninvolved a great deal of staff time and commitment. I want to express \nmy appreciation to the staff of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--Jimmie Powell, the Staff Director, Dan Delich, Abigail \nKinnison, Chelsea Henderson, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Ellen Stein and Peter \nWashburn for all of their efforts. Also, the professional expertise of \nthe Corps of Engineers was invaluable. I particularly want to thank \nLarry Prather, Gary Campbell and the many dedicated professionals at \nthe Corps of Engineers Headquarters for their technical evaluation of \nthe many projects that came before the Committee for consideration.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the conference report.\n\n\n                 the savannah harbor deepening project\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to request that the Chairman of \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee help me to clarify \nthe intent of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project that appears in \nSection 102 of the 1999 Water Resources Development Act. It is my \nunderstanding that this legislation authorizes a project to deepen the \nSavannah River channel to a depth of up to 48 feet subject to a \nfavorable report by the Chief of Engineers and a favorable \nrecommendation of the Secretary by December 31, 1998.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The senior Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding as well, that both the Chief of \nEngineer's Tier I Environmental Impact Statement and Feasibility Report \nprovide for the establishment of a stakeholders' evaluation group which \nwill have early and consistent involvement in the project, and as part \nof the process, the EIS requires the development of a mitigation plan \nto fully and adequately address predicted and potential adverse impacts \non, among other things, the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge; striped \nbass population; short-nose sturgeon; salt water and fresh water \nwetlands; chloride levels; dissolved oxygen levels; erosion; and \nhistorical resources. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my further understanding that before this \nproject is carried out, the Secretary, in consultation with affected \nfederal and non-federal entities, must develop a mitigation plan \naddressing adverse project impacts and that the plan must be \nimplemented in advance of or concurrent with project construction and \nmust ensure that the project cost estimates are sufficient to address \nall potential mitigation alternatives. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his assistance and look \nforward to working with him on this important matter.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Will the Chairman yield for two additional questions on \nthis project?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would be happy to answer any questions the Senator may \nhave.\n  Mr. CLELAND. As the Senator recalls, during the Senate's \nconsideration of the Water Resources Development Act in the 105th \nCongress, we discussed the matter of whether the bill authorized the \nSecretary or the Georgia Ports Authority to proceed with construction \nof the project without the respective department heads concurring on an \nappropriate implementation plan and mitigation plan and that it was our \nunderstanding that the bill did not provide such authority. In this \ncurrent version, is this still your understanding?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Further, is it still the Senator's understanding that \nany funds to be appropriated by Congress for the project must be \nallocated in a manner that ensures that project impacts are fully and \nadequately mitigated and are otherwise consistent with the mitigation \nplan developed by the Secretary and the stakeholder evaluation group?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to clarify \nthese understandings.\n\n\n                           howard hanson dam\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Committee for its \nefforts to help resolve several very important and contentious issues \naffecting the Howard Hanson Dam project in Washington state.\n  I applaud the Howard Hanson provision in the Managers Statement \naccompanying this legislation, which recognizes the ongoing \nnegotiations between the Corps of Engineers and the National Marine \nFisheries Service with respect to the Corps' responsibilities under the \nEndangered Species Act for the protection of threatened Puget Sound \nChinook Salmon. These fish runs are directly impacted by the Corps of \nEngineers' operation of Howard Hanson Dam and, as a consequence, the \nCorps will be asked to bear responsibility for these impacts under the \nESA.\n  I appreciate the Committee's acknowledgment that the requirements of \nESA might force a revision of the cost allocation for the Howard Hanson \nproject. Given the urgent need to have mitigation measures in place as \nsoon as possible to protect salmon runs in the Puget Sound region, is \nit the Committee's intent that the Corps provide a proposal for a cost \nreallocation to the Committee for consideration in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act for the year 2000?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is the Committee's intent to urge the Corps and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service to complete their ESA consultation \nexpeditiously so that a cost share adjustment can be considered by the \nCommittee in a timely manner.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                    american river watershed project\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, and Senator Voinovich, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and my ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus, a question on the Water Resources Development \nAct of 1999 as we prepare to give approval to the conference report.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I will be happy to respond to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I first thank the leadership of this \ndistinguished committee and its members for their perseverance in \nworking to finally pass the Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, an \neffort that has taken about a year. I also want to say how I appreciate \nSenator Voinovich's leadership as our new chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Despite our hard work and achievements, I am disappointed at the \noutcome in conference on the American River Watershed project. We \nfailed to include the Senate program for providing a 170-year level of \nflood protection for the City of Sacramento in the American River \nWatershed. The Senate bill represented the local consensus agreement to \nincrease in the level of flood protection for our state capital, \nSacramento. Sacramento's 400,000 residents, 130 schools and 5,000 \nbusinesses are located in the flood plain at the confluence of the \nSacramento River flowing from the north and the American River, which \ncascades from the High Sierra mountains, from the east. The most likely \ncause of a flood would be a breach in the American River levees which \ncould inundate 55,000 acres.\n  The damages from even a 100-year flood would be comparable to the \n1989 Loma Prieta earthquake which caused 63 deaths, almost 4,000 \ninjuries and $8 billion in direct property damage. Sacramento has one \nof the highest levels of risk and one of the lowest levels of \nprotection.\n  There was a year-long effort to pressure this Congress to link \nextraneous water supply projects to this flood control measure, despite \nthe fact that by unanimous vote in the Senate and a 418-to-6 vote in \nthe House, WRDA bills were approved with no special set aside for water \nsupply projects in California that would override the water agreements \nand planning processes that have taken years of sweat, blood and tears \nto put into place. We were able in this conference to stop inclusion of \nthose water supply projects, and we achieved an increase in the level \nof protection for Sacramento from 90-year to 140-year level of \nprotection. However, this level is unacceptable. It still puts 400,000 \npeople at too high a risk of disaster.\n  I would like to ask the leadership of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure if \nthey believe as I do that this conference report reflects only an \nincremental step in our efforts to increase protection for Sacramento \nand that more needs to be done to remove this risk.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I look forward to working with the Senator on more \nimprovements for flood protection for Sacramento in subsequent WRDA \nbills.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The Senator from California is correct. We have \nprovided important improvements for the flood protection for \nSacramento. However, we can do better, and I think we should consider \nincreased protection in the future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues. I do note that, while I am \ndisappointed at the outcome on the American River, this bill does \nprovide numerous benefits for my state of California. The new dredging \nproject for the Port of Oakland will enhance international trade and \nthe regional economy and enable new efficiencies at the port to be \nundertaken with the new intermodal terminal. In addition, the dredge \nspoil will help restore wetlands in Marin County where a portion of the \nformer Hamilton Army Airfield is being used for environmental \nrestoration. We have new flood protection plans authorized in Santa \nClara, the Yuba River Basin, Sacramento area, the City of Santa Cruz, \nand Fresno County. We have priority designations throughout the state \nfor the new riverine ecosystem restoration program to encourage natural \nflood control systems and we have assistance for important new water \nreclamation projects in the San Ramon Valley and the South Bay area of \nLos Angeles.\n  But more work needs to be done to protect Sacramento, and we will \naddress those needs in the next WRDA bill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement on the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 which provides \nfor the development and improvement of our Nation's water resources \ninfrastructure. This legislation authorizes water resource projects of \nvital importance to our nation's and our states' economy and maritime \nindustry as well as our environment.\n  I am particularly pleased that the measure includes a number of \nprovisions for which I have fought to ensure\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nthe future health of the Port of Baltimore and of Maryland's \nenvironment.\n  First the bill authorizes nearly $28 million for needed improvements \nto Baltimore Harbor Anchorages and Channels. Many of the existing \nanchorages and branch channels within Baltimore Harbor were built in \nthe first half of this century and are no longer deep enough, wide \nenough or long enough to accommodate the vessels now calling on the \nPort of Baltimore. Many of the larger ships must now anchor some 25 \nmiles south of Baltimore in naturally deep water, resulting in delays \nand increased costs to the shipping industry. Also, the narrow widths \nof some of the branch channels result in additional time for the pilots \nto maneuver safely to and from their docking berths. In June 1998 the \nChief of Engineers approved a report which recommended a number of \nimprovements including: (1) widening and deepening Federal anchorages 3 \nand 4; (2) widening and providing flared corners for state-owned East \nDundalk, Seagirt, Connecting and West Dundalk branch Channels; (3) \ndredging a new branch channel at South Locust Point; and (4) dredging a \nturning basin at the head of the Fort McHenry Channel. The report \nidentified the project as ``technically sound, economically justified \nand environmentally and socially acceptable.'' This project has been a \ntop priority of mine, of the Maryland Port Administration and of the \nshipping community for many years and I am delighted that this \nlegislation will enable us to move forward with this important project.\n  Second, the legislation directs the Corps of Engineers to make \ncritically needed safety improvements to the Tolchester Channel in the \nChesapeake Bay. The Tolchester Channel is a vital link in the Baltimore \nPort system. It was authorized in the River and Harbor Act of 1958 and \naligned to take advantage of the naturally deep water in the Chesapeake \nBay, along Maryland's Eastern Shore. This alignment, which is shaped \nlike an ``S,'' has posed a serious navigation problem and safety risks \nfor vessels. Ships must change course five times within three miles, \noften beginning a new turn, sometimes in the opposite direction, before \ncompleting a first turn. With vessels nearly 1,000 feet in length, it \nis difficult to safely navigate the channel, particularly in poor \nweather conditions. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Maryland Pilots \nAssociation have expressed serious concerns over the safety of the area \nand have long recommended straightening of the channel due to the \ngrounding and ``near misses'' which have occurred in the area. The cost \nfor straightening the Tolchester ``S-turn'' is estimated at $12.6 \nmillion with $1.3 million coming from non-federal sources. This \nauthorization enables the Corps to proceed expeditiously with these \nimprovements and address the serious concerns of those who must \nnavigate the treacherous channel. With $5.8 million already included in \nthe fiscal 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, this provision \nwill ensure that these improvements will be undertaken in the near \nfuture.\n\n  Mr. President, the Port of Baltimore is one of the great ports of the \nworld and one of Maryland's most important economic assets. The Port \ngenerates $2 billion in annual economic activity, provides for an \nestimated 62,000 jobs, and more than $500 million a year in State and \nlocal tax revenues and customs receipts. These two projects will help \nassure the continued vitality of the Port of Baltimore into the 21st \nCentury.\n  In addition to port development and improvement projects, the measure \ncontains a provision which will help significantly to enhance \nMaryland's environment and quality of life and help achieve the goals \nand vision of the Potomac American Heritage River designation.\n  It authorizes $15 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nmodify the existing flood protection project at Cumberland, Maryland to \nrestore features of the historic Chesapeake and Ohio Canal adversely \naffected by construction and operation of the project. Mr. President, \nthe C Canal is widely regarded as the Nation's finest relic of \nAmerica's canal building era. It was begun in 1828 as a transportation \nroute between commercial centers in the East and frontier resources of \nthe West. It reached Cumberland in 1850 and continued operating until \n1924 when it succumbed to floods and financial failure. In the early \n1950's, a section of the Canal and turning basin at its Cumberland \nterminus was filled in by the Corps of Engineers during construction of \na local flood protection project. Portions of the Canal were proclaimed \na national monument in 1961 and it was officially established as a \nnational historical park in 1971. Justice Douglas described the park \n``* * * not yet marred by the roar of wheels and the sound of horns. * \n* * The stretch of 185 miles of country from Washington to Cumberland, \nMaryland, is one of the most fascinating and picturesque in the \nNation.''\n  The National Park Service, as part of its General Management Plan for \nthe Park, has long sought to rebuild and re-water the Canal at its \nCumberland terminus. The NPS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement, \nMOA, with the Corps to undertake a study of the feasibility of \nreconstructing the last 2200 feet of the canal to the terminus, through \nand adjacent to the Corps' flood protection project. The Corps \ncompleted this study in July 1995 and determined that ``it is feasible \nto re-water the canal successfully; the canal and flood protection \nlevee can co-exist on the site without compromising the flood \nprotection for the City of Cumberland; re-construction and partial \noperation of the locks is feasible; and, based on the as-built \ninformation available, underground utility impacts can be mitigated at \nreasonable cost to allow construction of the canal and turning basin in \nbasically the same alignment and configuration as the original canal.'' \nA subsequent Rewatering Design Analysis estimated the total project \ncost at $15 million. This authorization will enable the Corps to \nproceed with restoring a 1.1 mile stretch of the C Canal and \nrevitalize the area as a major hub for tourism and economic \ndevelopment.\n  The conference agreement also authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers to undertake a study for control and management of waterborne \ndebris on the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna River is the largest \ntributary of the Chesapeake Bay, draining an area of about 27,500 \nsquare miles. It is also one of the most flood prone river basins in \nthe nation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates several \nreservoirs for flood control and other purposes and there are three \nlarge hydroelectric dams on the lower Susquehanna. During high flow \nevents, enormous amounts of debris, including trees, branches and \nmanmade materials, are carried downstream and ultimately into the \nChesapeake Bay. Most recently, the flood waters of January 1999 \ndeposited tremendous amounts of debris as far as Anne Arundel County, \nMaryland, creating hazards to navigation, damaging boats and bulkheads, \naggravating flooding and clogging beaches and shorelines. This \nlegislation will enable the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the \neconomic, engineering and environmental feasibility of potential \nmeasures to control and manage the amount of waterborne debris as well \nas determine if new and improved debris removal technologies can be \nutilized in the Susquehanna.\n  Finally, the conference agreement includes several other provisions \nwhich will help address important water resource needs in Maryland and \nnearby communities including the flood protection project for the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the studies for the West View Shores \nCommunity of Cecil County, Welch Point and Chesapeake City, MD.\n  I want to compliment the distinguished chairmen of the Committee and \nthe Subcommittee, Senators Chafee and Warner, and the ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, for their leadership in crafting this legislation and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10290-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10290-S10303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TAXPAYER REFUND AND RELIEF ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, the fundamental question before Congress \nthese past few weeks, as we have debated the Taxpayer Refund Act of \n1999, is quite simple: Is it right for Washington to take from the \ntaxpayer more money than is necessary to run the Government?\n  The issue of tax relief is not any more complicated than that, and \nthe outcome of the conference between the Senate and House makes it \nclear that we believe Government is not automatically entitled to the \nsurplus that is, in large part, due to the hard work, thrift, and risk-\ntaking of the American people.\n  Individuals and families are due a refund, and that is exactly what \nwe do with this legislation. We give the people a refund. We do it in a \nway that is fair, broad based, and empowering. We do it in a way that \nwill benefit nearly every working American, a way that will help \nrestore equity to the Tax Code, and provide American families with the \nrelief and resources they need to meet pressing concerns.\n  This tax refund legislation will help individuals and families save \nfor self-reliance in retirement. It will help parents prepare for \neducational costs. It will give the self-employed and underinsured the \nboost they need to pay for health insurance, and it will begin to \nrestore fairness to the Tax Code by addressing the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  How do we accomplish all of this? We begin by reducing our marginal \nincome tax rates by a point. In other words, the 15-percent tax bracket \nwill drop to 14 percent, and the 39.6-percent top rate will drop to \n38.6 percent. The new 14-percent bracket will be extended upward to \ninclude millions of Americans who are now paying taxes in the 28-\npercent bracket.\n  These changes will benefit individuals and families across the \neconomic spectrum. For example, an individual with $40,000 of income \nwill save over $700. An individual earning $50,000 will save over $800. \nUnder this bill, a taxpayer with $70,000 of income will save over \n$1,000.\n  This is significant tax relief. When fully phased in, a middle-class \nfamily of four with an adjusted gross income of $80,000 will save \nalmost $3,000 a year. This is real savings, money that can be used by \nindividuals and families to meet their pressing needs and objectives.\n  To restore equity to the Tax Code, this legislation also meets a \nbipartisan objective by providing relief for the marriage tax penalty, \nand it does this by doubling the standard deduction and the 15-percent \ntax bracket for married couples filing jointly.\n  We can all agree on how important this is. For too long, husbands and \nwives who have worked and paid taxes have been penalized by their dual \nincomes. This plan will address that inequity by giving working \nAmerican couples greater relief.\n  Let me give an example. Two individuals, each making $35,000 a year, \nface a penalty of almost $1,500 when they marry. Under this \nlegislation, that penalty will be addressed in two ways: first, by \ndoubling the standard deduction and, second, by doubling the 15-percent \ntax bracket to include their combined income.\n  The marriage penalty relief offered in this bill retains the Senate \nposition on the amount of relief received, and it even provides relief \nfor people receiving the earned income tax credit.\n  To help families with their education expenses, the legislation \nbefore us allows taxpayers to increase their contributions to education \nIRAs, or what will--under the provisions of this bill--be called \neducation savings accounts. Allowable contributions will rise from $500 \nto $2,000 annually.\n  And these funds will be available to meet expenses for all students, \nfrom kindergarten through college. Beyond increasing the level a family \ncan save for education, this Tax Relief Act also makes interest earned \non qualified State and private school higher education tuition plans \ntax free--a most important development, in my judgment. It also extends \nemployer-provided educational assistance for undergraduate studies, and \nit repeals the 60-month rule on student loan interest deductions. This \nwill allow individuals to claim tax deductions on interest that they \npay on their student loan, without the imposition of a time limit.\n  To help families meet health care and long-term care needs, this \nlegislation provides a 100 percent above-the-line deduction for those \nwho pay more than 50 percent of their health insurance premiums. This, \nof course, includes the self-employed. The plan also provides an \nadditional personal exemption for those who care for an elderly \nrelative in their home.\n  As you can see, this legislation is, indeed, empowering; it addresses \nconcerns that are vitally important in the lives of our families, coast \nto coast. It provides across-the-board tax relief. It addresses the \nmarriage tax penalty.\n  It makes education more affordable for all students--kindergarten \nthrough college. And it helps our families meet their health care and \nlong-term care needs. But it doesn't stop here; it does much more.\n  The legislation before us phases out the alternative minimum tax. It \nprovides capital gains tax relief, simplifying the rate structure, and \nreducing the individual capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 18 \npercent, beginning with the current 1999 tax year. For those \nindividuals taxed at the lowest individual rate, their capital gains \ntax rate is reduced from 10 percent to 8 percent.\n  In addition, the tax basis of certain assets may be increased by an \n``inflation adjustment,'' so that any capital gain attributable to \ninflation is not subjected to tax. Also, we have maintained the 2 \npercent capital gains rate differential that is imposed on long-term \ncapital gains from depreciable real estate, by reducing that rate from \n25 percent to 23 percent.\n  Another very important measure is the treatment of estate taxes. This \nlegislation completely phases out and ultimately repeals the Federal \nestate, gift, and generation skipping taxes. It also corrects technical \nproblems in the House provision.\n  Each of these will be a powerful tool in the hands of taxpayers and \nfamilies who will use these changes--their relief--to meet the needs \nthat are unique to their situation. However, a couple of major \nprovisions in this bill that I would like to outline in some detail \nwill--like the across-the-board tax rate cut--benefit everyone, \nenabling individuals and families to prepare for self-reliance and \nsuccess in retirement. These, of course, include the expansion of \nindividual retirement accounts and pension programs.\n  Under the bill, IRA contribution limits will be increased over the \nnext 7 years until they reach $5,000. And taxpayers who are close to \nretiring will be allowed to make catchup payments in their plans. These \nchanges will in my judgment, be incredibly beneficial. For example, an \nindividual without an employer-provided pension plan, who contributes \nthe maximum amount allowable, as it increases over the next 7 years--\nwith the magic of compounding interest--will be able to put away over \n$31,000 for retirement. In year 7 and beyond, he or she will be able to \nput away the full $5,000 annually.\n  With the catchup provision--applicable for people over the age of \n50--if those 7 years pass just prior to the taxpayer's retirement, the \namount, for example, he or she could save in those 7 years under this \nbill would be over $44,000. This bill also increases the income \nthreshold for those who can take full advantage of Roth IRA accounts up \nto $200,000 for a couple filing jointly.\n  For employer-provided plans, this bill increases the maximum amount \nan individual can contribute to a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) plan or a 457 \nplan. Starting next year, an employee may contribute up to $11,000 to \nhis employer's 401(k) plan In each year thereafter, he could contribute \nincreasing amounts to his 401(k), and in 2005, he will be able to \ncontribute a full $15,000. To show you how empowering this is, if John, \na 35-year-old, contributes the maximum amount allowable over the next \n30 years, his 401(k) plan benefit at retirement would increase by over \n$1.2 million.\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\n  In addition, if John's employer established a newly added Plus \nAccount program under its 401(k) plan, that amount would be nontaxable \nwhen John receives it at retirement. The Plus Account program--as \naddressed in this bill--lets an employer establish an account which has \nthe same tax treatment as a Roth IRA. That means that John would have \nover $1.2 million in nontaxable income.\n  Finally, this bill gives small businesses a new incentive to \nestablish a retirement plan for their employees. The contribution \nlimits for a SIMPLE plan--a defined contribution plan only for small \nbusinesses--have been increased in this bill to encourage small \nbusiness owners to establish such plans. The incentive to establish a \nSIMPLE plan is easy to understand. Small business owners who offer \nSIMPLE plans will be able to save up to $10,000 in the plans they \nestablish.\n  This will be a great benefit to them, but in order to save their own \nmoney--as part of the SIMPLE plan--they will have to provide their \nemployees with a contribution to their own plans of up to 2 percent of \ntheir salary.\n  At the same time, under this plan the employees could also receive a \nmatching contribution from their employer of up to 3 percent of \ncompensation if they decide to contribute to the SIMPLE plan.\n  Now, I believe this is good policy. It will encourage Americans to \ntake advantage of these opportunities and provide for their retirement \nfuture. As with almost every provision in this Taxpayer Refund Act, the \ncatalyst is the individual and the family, using tax relief to meet \ntheir needs. Every measure I have outlined as part of the Taxpayer \nRefund Act of 1999 is important, as each rightfully returns resources \nthat Americans can use to meet their current needs, and the refund \nbeing offered comes from surplus funds. In other words, this broad-\nbased tax relief package can be passed, signed into law, and, indeed, \nstill leave sufficient resources in Washington to take care of Social \nSecurity, Medicare reform, and other necessary Government obligations.\n  Let me repeat that: This broad-based tax relief package can be \npassed, signed into law, and still leave sufficient non-Social Security \nfunds available to address comprehensive Medicare reform, including a \nprescription drug benefit. We can offer this relief and still pay down \nthe debt and keep the budget balanced. We can do all of this for one \nvery simple reason: The work, the investment in job creation achieved \nby Americans everywhere, has succeeded in creating long-term economic \ngrowth. As I have said before, it is not right that the reward for this \nsuccess is that today our taxes are the highest percent of our gross \nnational product of any time in postwar history.\n  After paying for the Government programs for which Congress has \nplanned and budgeted, a refund from the surplus must now be returned to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I know there is wide agreement that Americans deserve relief. This is \nthe bill that will give them relief. We must and should support it.\n  We must keep in mind that major tax cuts must be done through the \nreconciliation process. This is, indeed, a lengthy, time-intensive \nprocess. We have successfully completed it. I am proud to say that this \nconference report, as it stands today, carries no provision that was \nnot in either the House or Senate bill. In other words, nothing \nextraneous was added in conference. It is clean and representative of \nthe direction received by those who crafted the Senate and House bills.\n  Frankly, this is a first in tax history. It represents a tremendous \namount of work by our colleagues, Members of the House, and the staff \nin both Chambers. Those who believe we may be coming back to do this \nagain in September are mistaken. This is the tax bill for this year. We \nwon't have a second chance on this. When we come back after recess, our \ntime and attention will be focused on Medicare reform, a vital issue \nthat concerns us all.\n  For those who are concerned that this major relief package may be too \nbig, please be reminded that there are important trigger mechanisms \nincluded in this bill. If we don't continue to reduce the payment on \nthe interest on the national debt--let me repeat that--if we don't \ncontinue to reduce the payment on the interest on the national debt, \nthen the tax relief included here will be reduced to compensate \naccordingly.\n  Well, the bottom line is that this is tax relief in which we can have \nconfidence. It meets the criteria we established before we began. It is \nfair. It restores equity to the Tax Code and makes education more \naffordable. It helps taxpayers prepare for self-reliance and \nretirement. This legislation will help families keep their homes, their \nfarms, and businesses safe from death taxes. It makes health care more \naffordable.\n\n  I believe these are objectives that are shared by everyone. They are \nobjectives that can be embraced by Senators and Congressmen on both \nsides of the political aisle.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote for passage, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I begin on a general point with \nwhich our revered chairman has just concluded, which is the reservation \nof the Social Security surpluses of the next decade for purposes of \nretiring the debt. This is a fact easily unobserved because we are not \narguing about it. There is agreement here. What we will do, we will cut \nthe national debt by more than half, the publicly held debt, and the \ninterest costs accordingly.\n  Just a few years ago interest costs had become the third highest item \nin our budget. It is not noticed because we don't debate it. We don't \ndecide how much we will pay in interest costs; it is automatic. But \nthis has now happened. There has been a great recovery of American \nGovernment finances from a grim moment in 1992 when we had a fiscal \nyear with a $290 billion deficit.\n  I will point simply to this morning's New York Times and the lead \nstory, sir. I will just read the headline, ``Government Plans to Buy \nBack Bonds and Save Interest: Would retire some debt using the surplus \nto replace high-interest securities at lower rates''--a complex \nproposal being worked out in Treasury under Secretary Summers. Also, in \nthe business section of this morning's New York Times, there is another \nstory, ``The Dwindling Market in U.S. Treasury Bonds,'' discussing how \nthe market is going to respond to the bond buy back. And there is this:\n\n       ``This is a sea change,'' said James M. Keller, senior vice \n     president and portfolio manager for Treasury securities at \n     Pimco Advisors, an asset management firm. ``I was struck by \n     the Treasury's observation that the last time there were two \n     back-to-back years of budget surpluses was in 1956 and 1957. \n     I wasn't alive then, so this is a new thing for me.''\n\n  Indeed, it is a new thing and hugely to be welcomed.\n  I might also say that the chairman stated that this bill, which we \nwill vote on at 7:06 this evening, is a clean bill; there is no \nprovision in it that was not in either the House or the Senate \nproposals. But now I have to say to the Senate, with the utmost \ndeference to my friend--I say to the Senators from Nebraska, Florida, \nMinnesota, Senator Bingaman--we have the word of the chairman, and his \nword is absolutely bondable in this body. If he says it, it is so. But \nthat is the only way you would know it is so because we just received a \ncopy of the bill this morning, and certainly have not been able to \nreview all 589 pages.\n  This is not the way to handle the second largest tax decrease in \nhistory. There was no conference on this matter. We met formally for 20 \nminutes, and the negotiation was entirely between party leaders of the \nmajority. It is an age-old practice of the Congress to, at the end of a \nconference, distribute the signature papers that the conferees sign or \ndo not sign. I was the conferee for this side of the aisle; no \nsignature paper came to me.\n  There was no participation of any kind from this side of the aisle. I \nthink that would be true in the House as well as in the Senate. That is \nsomething we have to watch in terms of our procedures. It was not the \nway the Senate conducted itself in such a matter when I first came here \nand became a member of the Finance Committee.\n  During the debate last week on the Senate version of the \nreconciliation bill, I attempted to put the debate in a ``doctrinal \nperspective,'' as I put it. I traced the development from the 1960s of \nan intellectual movement which holds that the only way to restrain the\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\ngrowth of Government is to deliberately create a protracted fiscal \ncrisis. This was disarmingly put by then President-elect Reagan. It was \njust 16 days before his inauguration in 1981. He said:\n\n       There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be \n     cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can \n     lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of \n     voice and breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply \n     reducing their allowance.\n\n  So in 1981 to 1983, the allowance of the Federal Government was \nreduced. While other intervening events--a sharp recession in 1981-82--\nimpacted on revenues, nonetheless, there was a precipitous drop in \nrevenues from 19.0 percent of GDP in 1980 to 17.5 percent of GDP in \n1983. Simultaneously, the recession and defense buildup conspired to \nincrease outlays from 20.2 percent of GDP in 1979 to 23.6 in 1983. The \nresult, a huge gap--6 percent of GDP--between revenues and outlays, and \ndeficits of $200 billion or more ``as far as the eye could see,'' to \nquote the former Director of OMB, David Stockman, and with this huge \ngap, the national debt quadrupled from under $1 trillion to $4 trillion \nbetween 1980 and 1992.\n  In August of 1993, with a deficit of $290 billion, we chose to \nconfront that, to raise taxes and reduce outlays by a little more than \na half trillion dollars. More recently, the Office of Management and \nBudget estimated that ``the total deficit reduction has been more than \ntwice this--$1.2 trillion.'' In 1997, a bipartisan measure was passed. \nWe are now in a situation of reasonable surplus, reasonable \nexpectation. But there is no reason to act on a surplus that does not \nyet exist.\n  Here we are, with unemployment at 4.3 percent, near zero inflation, \nreal economic growth at 4 percent, and an economy in the ninth year of \nan expansion. All the economists--the ones we care much about--are \nsaying: Not now. Alan Greenspan suggested, speaking before the Senate \nand House Banking Committees just last month, the most effective means \nthat we can have to regenerate the economy and keep the long-term \ngrowth path moving higher is if we hold tax cuts until we need a \nstimulus. Contrariwise, to stimulate when you don't need it is to \ninvite inflation--inflation, which is a tax on anyone when interest \nrates go up. Anybody who pays a car loan and has a credit card or a \nmortgage pays it.\n  Dale Jorgenson described this persistent interest in cutting down the \nsize of Government by reducing revenue ``fiscal disaster'' in his 1995 \ntestimony before the Finance Committee. Yet it persists as a \nconviction. There is very little testing of the proposition.\n  I won't go on too long in this doctrinal discourse, but back in 1973, \nHerbert Kaufman of the Brookings Institution published a small book \ncalled ``Are Government Organizations Immortal?'' He reported that of \n175 organizations he could identify in the Federal Government in 1923, \nno less than 148 were still there a half century later, and of the \nothers, most of their functions had just been moved to different \norganizations.\n  Recently, the Cato Institute, a conservative group here in \nWashington, looked at the half dozen organizations which the 1995 House \nContract With America targeted for extinction--$75 billion worth of \nprograms, out. Sir, not one of them is out. Indeed, the appropriations \nfor them have gone up by $2 billion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table prepared by the \nCato Institute and printed in the Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 3, 1999]\n\n                              Growing Back\n\n       In 1995, the House GOP's ``Contract With America'' targeted \n     $75.3 billion worth of programs for extinction. Now the \n     government spends $77 billion on those programs. Here are \n     some of the targeted agencies and programs for which spending \n     has risen, in millions of dollars.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Program                          1995       1999\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDepartment of Commerce............................     $3,401     $4,767\nDepartment of Education...........................     31,205     34,360\nSchool-to-work grants.............................         82        503\nGoals 2000........................................        231        507\nManufacturing Extension Partnerships..............         40        128\nAid to East Europe and Baltic states..............        332        450\nEconomic Development Administration...............        350        438\nAdult education...................................        299        400\nStar Schools......................................         25         45\nSummer youth employment and training..............        867        871\nBilingual and immigrant education.................        225        386\nTrade adjustment assistance.......................        268        307\nIntelligent transportation system.................        143        185\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Cato Institute analysis of federal budget.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Somehow we have to come to terms with this whole \nassumption. Perhaps something like the Hoover Commission on the \norganization of the executive branch needs to be done. Some of us have \nthe assumption that we really aren't that serious. As that brief \nceremonial meeting of our conferees this week opened, our respected \nfriend--and we have known each other for a quarter century--Bill Archer \nsaid in his opening remarks:\n\n       We don't need full-time Government and part-time families; \n     we need part-time Government and full-time families.\n\n  In no way to cast any suggestion that he is anything but absolutely \nsincere, I don't think the proposition would survive close inquiry. I \nasked him: Sir, do you think we could settle for ``a part-time Marine \nCorps, or a part-time Federal Bureau of Investigation?'' No, you don't \nmean that.\n  I, for one, very much share the view that the Federal Government has \ntaken on too many matters and needs to be cleared out a very great \ndeal. Our Federal system makes that possible, and the world situation \nin which we now find ourselves makes it necessary but not through the \nillusion that it will happen simply by reducing revenues.\n  I wish to make the point that we can't afford this tax cut. We may \nwant one in 5 years time or in 3 years, but not at this time. That is \nwhy the fate of this measure has already been settled.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, tax expenditures are \nprojected to cost about $672 billion in 2003. While we have not yet had \ntime to adequately scour the conference report for all of its \nprovisions, a cursory review indicates that, the bill we are asked to \nvote on today would increase annual tax expenditures by about $19 \nbillion in 2003.\n  Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a \ntax expenditure is a revenue loss:\n\n       . . . attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws \n     which allow a special exclusion, exemption or deduction from \n     gross income or which provide a special tax credit, a \n     preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.\n\n  The problem is that we continue to use tax expenditures as a way of \nfunding programs that we do not seem to have the will to finance with \noutlays--a problem made all the more severe by the caps on \ndiscretionary spending alluded to earlier.\n  On a more global scale, 40 years ago Walter Heller, Chairman of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers in the Kennedy-Johnson Administration \nspelled out the criteria for evaluating tax expenditures--criteria \nwhich most tax expenditures fail to meet. In testimony before the House \nWays and Means Committee Heller stated that Federal fiscal policy \nrelies on income taxes for three central roles: (1) Placing resources \nat the Government's disposal in a non-inflationary way; (2) Offsetting \nfluctuations in the private economy; and (3) Bringing the distribution \nof income more closely into line with public preferences.\n  Heller then argued that the use of the tax code to promote other \nobjectives should be subject to stern tests, which can be summarized as \nfollows:\n  Is the tax preference for a legitimate public purpose?\n  Is the tax preference the most effective way to achieve that purpose?\n  Is the preference targeted?\n  In Heller's view most tax preferences fail the test. Yet, he noted we \npersist in expanding tax preference because:\n\n       The back door to Government subsidies marked ``Tax Relief'' \n     is easier to push open than the front door marked \n     ``Expenditures. . . .''\n\n  Besides, tax expenditures need not be reviewed annually through the \nappropriations process.\n  This bill also adds to the complexity of the tax code. I have long \nbeen concerned that today's tax system is so complex that ordinary \ntaxpayers have difficulty following the rules. For example, under the \nbill capital gains are indexed. The Senate Finance Committee held \nhearings on February 16, 1995 regarding the enormous new record keeping \nburdens that would be required to calculate the gain or loss on common \ntransactions. The New York State Bar Association stated that:\n\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\n\n\n       Congress should reject any proposal to adjust or ``index'' \n     the basis of capital assets for inflation. [A]n indexation \n     regime would create intolerable administrative burdens for \n     taxpayers and administrators as well as offer numerous tax \n     arbitrage and avoidance opportunities for aggressive tax \n     planners.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation wrote at that time that ``[i]ndexing \nwould involve a significant amount of record keeping'' and that it \n``would substantially increase the number of calculations necessary to \ncalculate taxable gain for many common transactions.''\n  Even if this bill did not risk a return to protracted fiscal crisis, \nand even if its 589 pages did not add to the complexity of the code, it \nshould be rejected because most of the benefits accrue to those already \nwell-off.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that the bill \njustifiably provides most of the tax relief to those who pay most of \nthe taxes. But their analysis is incomplete since it is based solely on \nthe distribution of income taxes. For example, taxpayers earning less \nthan $50,000 pay 36 percent of payroll taxes; while those earning over \n$200,000 pay only 7 percent of payroll taxes.\n  The conclusion is very different if the analysis is based on the \ndistribution of all federal taxes--income, excise, and payroll. Those \nearning less than $50,000 pay almost a quarter of the taxes, which is \nthe same percentage as those earning over $200,000. So, why is it that \nthe Republican tax bill before us today only provides 14 percent of the \ntax cut to those earning less than $50,000 while providing 78 percent \nof the tax cut to those earning over $80,000? Even worse, why does 45 \npercent of the tax cut go to the top 5 percent of income earners, those \nearning over $155,000? Should we not provide a more equitable tax cut?\n  We might also consider heeding the advice of Herbert Stein, Chairman \nof the Council of Economic Advisers in a Republican Administration. In \nan op-ed in yesterday's Wall Street Journal Mr. Stein had this to say:\n\n       . . .I [have] come to the conclusion that we should not \n     make a large tax cut at this time. But my purpose here is not \n     to sell that conclusion. What I am trying to do is to sell \n     the idea that we need a more systematic, explicit and \n     thorough public discussion of the tax vs. debt reduction \n     issue and to illustrate what some of the elements of such a \n     discussion would be.\n\n  We have not had that debate.\n  I see that my learned friend, the gallant Senator from Nebraska, is \nhere, and I think he would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may require to \nSenator Kerrey.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from New York very much.\n  I am sorry I didn't wear the same necktie that he did. Other than \nthat, we are deeply matched.\n  Mr. President, first I want to compliment Chairman Roth. I believe \nall through the Finance Committee deliberations and last week on the \nSenate floor he held true to two ideas that I share.\n  The first is that we can cut taxes. The second is we must do so \nfairly. Indeed, the net effect of cutting taxes by nearly $800 billion \nover ten years is to give the American people an $800 billion increase \nin their after-tax income. I believe we can do it safely. We have $3 \ntrillion in surpluses forecast over the next ten years. And I don't \nbelieve that cutting taxes will generate inflation if done correctly.\n  In his original package, the Chairman held true to the idea that some \nstandard of fairness need be applied in how the income tax cuts would \nbe distributed. He attempted to do that. Doing that caused him a little \ngrief on his side of the aisle. I appreciate very much what the \nchairman attempted to do with his original tax cut package.\n  Accordingly, I voted for the package enthusiastically on the floor. I \nbelieve it was a good proposal. I may have written it a little \ndifferently if I were the one who was doing the writing. But I thought \nit was a balanced proposal and a good proposal, and I was fully \nsupportive of it. I was one of four Democrats to do so.\n  Thus, I come to the floor with some regret. I say to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle that you should know that people like me \ntook a position that said we were prepared to vote for a tax cut of \n$800 billion. The Chairman's original package received 57 votes on this \nfloor. I understand the other side has been working all night to get \nthe votes to pass the package we have before us and I suspect the most \nvotes this package will receive is 52. So I say to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, if you are trying to get a piece of \nlegislation passed to try to change the law and give Americans an \nincome tax cut, you are going in the wrong direction. With the \nPresident threatening to veto the bill, it seems to me that a better \napproach would have been to try to get more votes, not fewer.\n  I am here, regrettably, to say that I will not only change my vote \nfrom an enthusiastic ``aye,'' but I will now change and be voting \nenthusiastically ``no.'' Let me tell my colleagues why.\n  First of all, I want to identify some things that are in this package \nthat I think would be good. I appreciated very much the chairman \nfighting for them and getting them into the bill, and I am fully \nsupportive of them.\n  Eliminating the marriage penalty is terribly important. There are new \nprovisions in here which will make it more likely that Americans will \nsave and will have the resources they need for retirement. There are \nprovisions in here which will make it more likely that Americans will \nhave health insurance, and that will make it more likely that Americans \nwill be able to afford the cost of higher education.\n  I do not object at all to eliminating the inheritance tax. I \ncosponsored legislation to do that. I am not going to take a great deal \nof time explaining why, as a Democrat, I reached that conclusion. I am \nprepared, if anybody is interested, in debating it at a later time.\n  I am not ideologically opposed to lowering the capital gains tax.\n  There are many things in this proposal that I, in short, like or \ndon't have strong objections to. It is this test of fairness which I \nbelieve was applied to the Senate version that I find lacking in the \nconference report.\n\n  Let me take the one provision that is the most important provision in \nthe Senate version.\n  The provision that cut the lowest tax rate on income from 15 to 14 \npercent that was in the Senate finance bill would have cut taxes for \nfamilies in Nebraska with an income of $46,000, for a family of four, \nby $440. It would have cut taxes on a U.S. Senator with a spouse and \ntwo kids by $440 as well. That was the idea.\n  I am not interested in engaging in class warfare. I have no quarrel \nwith upper-income Americans or upper-income Nebraskans. Quite the \ncontrary. In Nebraska, there were 775,000 federal income tax returns in \n1996. Of that, 6,500 had adjusted gross incomes of over $200,000. That \nis a relatively small number. But they paid almost a third of all the \n$3.6 billion in federal taxes paid by Nebraskans.\n  So I am not here to say that upper-income people don't deserve a tax \nbreak. I think it is very important for us to take a look at America \nand try to discern which taxpayers are most in need of help. It is, it \nseems to me, a fair question for us to ask. And to try to apply a \nstandard of fairness, it seems to me, is something we ought to be \ndoing.\n  Under last week's proposal, a single Member of Congress, I would have \ngotten a $260 tax rate cut, just as a single person with $26,000 of \nincome. But under this proposal, by decreasing the taxes for everyone \nat higher rates as well, a Member of Congress, a single Member such as \nmyself, I am going to get a tax cut of $1,185. I get over $900 more \nunder this proposal. And if I got married, I would do even better.\n  I can make an argument that because I am paying more taxes I ought to \nget more of a tax cut. But look at households. A family of four with \n$46,000 worth of income probably ought to have a larger tax cut than I \ndo. At the very least, I should not receive more than they do. That is \nwhat I mean when I say that this bill, when it passed here last week, \nmet the minimal standard of fairness.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that if you are \ntrying to figure out how to get more votes and not fewer, you have now \nfigured out how to get fewer. You had 57 votes on this side last week. \nThe high water mark today, in my view, is likely to be 52. I understand \nthat the conference report had to be reopened in the later\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nhours of yesterday evening and some provisions had to be put in to woo \nsome votes for a bare majority. I know there were some concerns that \nthe Vice President might be sitting up there at the end of business \ntoday and there might be no more than 50 votes for this legislation. \nAll of that should be a sign. You had 57 votes. Yesterday you did not \nhave 50. Something is going in the wrong direction.\n  I believe a majority of Democrats and Republicans in chamber, want to \napply a standard of fairness. The distinguished junior Senator from \nTexas, offered an amendment on this floor last week that would increase \nthe standard deduction for a married couple. Why did she want to \neliminate the marriage penalty for people who are using the standard \ndeduction? It got a lot of Democratic votes and a lot of Republicans \nvotes. Indeed, I think it was the only amendment that actually broke \nthe 60-vote requirement. That is a clue. That was a fairness issue and \nthe junior Senator wanted that fairness applied to married people who \ntake the standard deduction, people who do not itemize, people who are \ngenerally not in the upper reaches of income in this country.\n  I'm not talking about crafting a social engineering package. What I \nam talking about is applying a standard of fairness.\n  As I said, I have great respect for the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I believe he attempted to apply a standard of fairness, and, \nin my judgment, his package of last week passed that test. I voted for \nit enthusiastically. But the conference committee report does not pass \nthat test. It does not pass the test of fairness.\n\n  So I enthusiastically and confidently will vote ``no'' on it. I do so \nregrettably because I believe there was an opportunity this year not \njust to do this but to get a bipartisan solution on Medicare and to get \na bipartisan solution on Social Security. The package before us today \ndoes not bode well for future bipartisan efforts to come up with those \nsolutions.\n  This bill had 57 votes last week. As I said, were it not for the sort \nof last-minute work to try to have some changes to get some additional \nvotes, it might not have even 50 votes later today when we will have a \nvote on final passage.\n  I say to my Republican friends, if you want to cut Americans' taxes, \nlisten not just to what Democrats are saying but also listen to what \nRepublicans are saying. They want a standard of fairness applied. It is \na legitimate concern.\n  I don't know how many Members of the Senate believe that $800 billion \nis too much. I believe the distinguished occupant of the Chair does. He \nfought very hard as mayor and Governor, and I think he is coming to \nthis Congress saying we ought to be careful not to spend the surplus \nand lose all the progress that we have made. Fine. Make that argument.\n  But for the majority of us who believe that $800 billion is not too \nmuch, if we want to persuade our reluctant colleagues to support \ncutting taxes for American families, then you have to apply a standard \nof fairness, a test of fairness. You may not like doing it. You may \nbelieve your ideology tells you that you should do something else. But \nif you want to change the law and get this done, you had darned sure \nbetter do it, because not only will you not get the strong majority you \nwill need but you will never, in my judgment, get the President of \nUnited States to sign a piece of legislation that doesn't attempt to \nmeasure and apply some test of fairness.\n  Again, I appreciate very much the work that the distinguished \nchairman did, Senator Roth of Delaware, as well as the ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Moynihan. I appreciate very much the leadership of \nboth of them. Senator Moynihan led the Democrats in the committee to \ncome up with a $300 billion tax cut proposal. It had a very key \ncomponent in there, which was to increase the standard deduction for \nindividuals. That takes a number of people off the income tax rolls, \nreduces the top tax rate for many and simplifies tax filing for \nmillions.\n  I suggest to my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthat if you want to get a bill, that is the kind of proposal that you \nshould have included in this package and it is unfortunate that you did \nnot. It is unfortunate that the centerpiece of the tax proposal that we \nvoted for last week--the reduction of the 15 percent tax rate to 14 \npercent--was not left alone. If there is a second chance to consider a \ntax bill this year, I hope we will work harder to pass a bill that will \nget significant support from this side of the aisle and the way to do \nthat is to ensure a bill meets a basic standard of fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes on behalf of the minority to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Delaware. Let me start out by \nsaying I also appreciate the work of Senator Roth as the chair of the \nFinance Committee. However, I am in profound disagreement with this \nreconciliation bill, this tax cut bill, that comes before the Senate--\n$792 billion in tax cuts, aggregate amount.\n  According to Citizens for Tax Justice, the top 1 percent of taxpayers \nwould receive 42 percent of the benefits, while the bottom 60 percent \nwould receive only 7.5 percent of the benefits. Regarding \ndistributional effect, my colleague from Nebraska talked about a \nstandard of fairness: 60 percent of all taxpayers would get an average \ntax cut of $65; the wealthiest 10 percent would get an average tax cut \nof $1,322; the wealthiest 1 percent would get an average tax cut of \n$5,281.\n  This tax cut bill that the Republicans bring to the floor of the \nSenate is ``Robin Hood in reverse'' economics. Even worse, I think it \nrepresents a politics of illusion.\n  Not that long ago others, I think former President Bush, talked about \nvoodoo economics. He was referring to a set of proposals in the early \n1980s that said we could have massive tax cuts, increase Pentagon \nspending, make the investments we needed to make as a nation, and \ncontinue to reduce the deficit. That is not what happened.\n  It is pretty simple, I say to the people in Minnesota, and to the the \npeople in the Nation. We are in agreement, I hope, that of the $3 \ntrillion of surplus, $2 trillion is Social Security. It is not touched. \nIt is to make sure that system will be solvent. Of the other $1 \ntrillion, three-quarters of it is in assumed cuts--assuming we have the \neconomic growth in discretionary domestic spending.\n  With this proposal before the Senate that the Republicans bring to \nthe floor of the Senate, not only do we have tax cuts and benefits to \npeople in inverse relationship to need, a ``Robin Hood in reverse'' \neconomics, but we have a politics and an economics of illusion. We are \ngoing to explode the debt. We are going to build the debt up again. In \naddition, we are not going to be making the investments that we in our \nspeeches on the floor of the Senate say that we are for.\n  I heard my colleague from Delaware talk about health care, talk about \neducation, talk about children, talk about tax cuts. One more time, to \nuse the old Yiddish proverb: ``You can't dance at two weddings at the \nsame time.''\n  We are not going to be able to have this amount of tax cuts, $792 \nbillion in tax cuts, and at the same time continue to pay down the debt \nand make the kind of investments we need to make. We are going to see, \nAmerica, is cuts in Head Start, cuts in low-income energy assistance, \ncuts in community policing, cuts in environmental protection, cuts in \nveterans' health care, and cuts in Pell grant programs. We are not \ngoing to make any of the investments to which we say we are committed.\n  I think this tax cut legislation before the Senate is in many ways \nmore serious than bad economics. And it is bad economics. It is bad \neconomics because it will build up the debt rather than pay down the \ndebt. It is bad economics because it could very well lead to higher \ninterest rates. It is bad economics because it is the last thing we \nought to do in an expanding economy. In addition, it is bad economics \nbecause we are not going to be able to make the investments that my \ncolleague from Delaware says we are committed to at the same time we \nare doing all these tax cuts.\n\n  It is also an illusion. It will put this country in a straitjacket \nwhere we are not going to be able to do one positive\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nthing to make sure we have equal opportunities for every child in this \ncountry. We are not going to increase Head Start benefits; we are going \nto cut them. We are not going to increase health care benefits for our \ncitizens; we are going to cut them. We are not going to do anything \nabout the acute shortage of affordable housing; we are going to cut \nhousing programs. We are not going to get it right for veterans in \nhealth care; we are going to cut. We are not going to do anything about \nthe shameful statistic of right now providing benefits for only 1 \npercent of the kids who would benefit from Early Head Start in our \ncountry; we are going to cut.\n  There is not one Senator who can come to the floor of the Senate and \ndebate me on the argument I have just made. That is exactly what we are \ngoing to do.\n  This is also an ideological debate. If Members believe--and maybe \nthis is what my colleagues now believe, let me now give credit--when it \ncomes to the most pressing issues of people's lives in the United \nStates of America, or Minnesota, that there is nothing that the \ngovernment can or should do, if you don't think we should be making any \nof these kinds of investments in Pell grants, or affordable child care, \nor Head Start, or community policing, or veterans' health care, or \nhealth care, or affordable housing, then you would be for this \nconference report. What this will do is put this country in a \nstraitjacket where any kind of an investment that any Senator will talk \nabout to expand opportunities for our citizens will be, by definition, \nfiscally irresponsible because we won't have any of the revenue.\n  I conclude this way. The political argument behind these tax cuts is \na pretty effective argument if you listen to it only up to a point. The \nargument is that we built up the surpluses--maybe, assuming the economy \ncontinues to perform. Let's give it back to the citizens; it is your \nmoney. People in Minnesota, it belongs to you.\n  I maintain, as a Senator from Minnesota, it doesn't belong to me; it \ndoesn't belong to adults. It belongs to our children, and it belongs to \nour grandchildren. Whatever surplus there is ought to be used to pay \ndown the debt. We put it on their shoulders. Whatever surplus there is \nought to be used to make sure their Social Security and Medicare is \nthere, just as it will be there for us. It ought to be used to make \nsure there are opportunities for children so that our children and our \ngrandchildren have the same opportunities that we have had.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, is committed to early \nchildhood development. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, \ncame to the Senate with a commitment to children. I know that. That is \nhis passion, and he will make an enormous difference. I don't care \nwhether he is Republican or not. I know what he cares about, and I know \nhe is an effective Senator.\n  With this measure of tax cuts, if this legislation passes, we will \nnot only not be making any additional investments in the way we should \nin early childhood development, such as Early Head Start or Head Start, \nmuch less what we really should be doing for child care, much less \nnutrition programs, much less affordable housing programs, we will be \ncutting those programs.\n  That is shameful. That is unconscionable. That is exactly what we \nwill be doing. I say to the President of the United States of America, \nMr. President, you should veto this legislation. Let's not get into \nWashington, DC, bargaining where we say $500 billion or $600 billion is \na reasonable compromise. If that is what we do, we still will not be in \na position to make any of these investments. We still will see cuts in \ndiscretionary spending to the tune of hundreds of billions of \ndollars. Let's pay down the debt. Let's make sure we make a commitment \nto Medicare and Social Security. More than anything else, I would \nrather see more of the emphasis on an investment in children. I believe \nwhen we pay down our debts, the most important debt we can pay off is \nthe debt we would leave our children.\n\n  What we owe our children is to make sure that every child in the \nUnited States of America--regardless of color of skin, regardless urban \nor rural, regardless high income or low income or middle income--has \nthe same chance to reach his and her full potential. These tax cuts \nwill make that impossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, just so the record is clear, we have 6 \nhours, 3 hours to a side. The two managers have agreed we will go back \nand forth from one side to the other when people are present. But that \nis not the case now. So I yield 15 minutes on behalf of the minority to \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is an editorial that appeared in the \nNew York Times on August 2. It says: ``Here we go again.'' That is \nexactly what this tax bill is all about. Here we go again.\n\n       Back in 1980 Ronald Reagan assured one and all that he \n     could cut taxes sharply, increase defense spending \n     substantially and balance the Federal budget.\n\n  That is the promise he made. It did not work out that way. The \ndeficits exploded. George Bush at the time:\n\n       . . . famously derided Mr. Reagan's supply side fantasies \n     as ``voodoo economics.''\n\n  We all remember that. The veteran Washington Post reporter Lou \nCannon, in his book ``President Reagan, the Role of a Lifetime'' \ndescribed the reaction of James Baker, Mr. Reagan's own chief of staff, \nto the transformation of economic fantasy into national policy. He \nwrote:\n\n       Though not particularly well-versed in economics, Baker \n     suspected there was something screwy about the idea that \n     massive tax cuts would increase government revenues. Later, \n     he would privately express regrets that the deficits had \n     `gotten away' from the administration and wished he had paid \n     more attention to the consequences of the tax cuts.\n\n  Here we go again. Again, we have the fantasy being held out to the \nAmerican people that somehow you can have a massive tax cut, you can \nhave a big defense buildup, domestic needs will not be hurt, and \nsomehow it is all going to add up. The problem with it is it is highly \nunlikely to happen. Let's just check the record. It shows very clearly \nwhat happened in the Reagan administration when they had this fantasy \nthat they were going to cut taxes dramatically, have a big defense \nbuildup. Somehow it was all going to add up. It did not add up and this \nplan does not add up.\n\n  This is what happened back then. President Reagan inherited a deficit \nof just under $80 billion and he promptly shot it to $200 billion. That \nis what happens when we just put our head in the sand and get wedded to \nan ideology and do not care about the economic results, or the economic \nfallout. This plan is a disaster. I do not know how else to say it. It \nis risky; it is radical; it is reckless. We would make a profound \nmistake to pass it today.\n  We then went into the Bush administration and the deficits went up, \nup, and away again. It went up to $290 billion in 1990.\n  In 1993, President Clinton came into office and we passed a 5-year \nbudget plan to cut spending and, yes, raise income taxes on the \nwealthiest 1 percent. That plan worked. Each and every year of that 5-\nyear plan the deficit came down until finally we have achieved a \nbalanced budget. Why would we ever want to go back? Why would we ever \nwant to repeat the incredible mistakes this country made in the 1980s \nthat threatened the economic security of this country, that put this \ncountry's economy in a ditch, that led to recession, that led to job \nloss, that led to an extinguishment of economic growth? Why would we \nwant to repeat that tragic mistake? Yet here we are. ``Here we go \nagain.'' Goodness knows, don't we have more common sense than this?\n  This is not just my view. This is the view of economist after \neconomist who has looked at this proposal. Mr. Samuelson, the \ncolumnist, wrote:\n\n       The wonder is that the Republicans are so wedded to a \n     program that is dubious as to both policy and politics.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted the other \n     day, tax cuts might someday be justified to revive the \n     economy from a recession or to improve the prospects of a \n     sweeping program of tax simplification. But there is no case \n     for big tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget \n     surpluses.\n\n  That is what this is. These are plans based on projections of what \nmight\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nhappen over the next 10 years. What a risky way to run the economy. \nWhat a reckless way to run economic policy, to run out here and shovel \n$800 billion out the door before the money is collected. That puts this \nentire economy at risk. That puts this entire period of bringing down \nthe deficit at risk. That puts this entire successful economic policy \nof improving economic growth, reducing unemployment, reducing inflation \nat risk. It is a mistake we should not make.\n  This columnist points out:\n\n       Suppose that spending exceeds projections by one percentage \n     point of national income and that tax revenues fall below \n     projections by the same amount. In today's dollars, these \n     errors . . . not out of line with past mistakes . . . would \n     total $170 billion annually. Most of the future surpluses \n     would vanish.\n\n  That is the reality. We are betting the farm on projections of what \nis going to happen over the next 10 years. Does anybody believe these \nprojections are going to come true?\n  I used to be responsible for projecting the income of the State of \nNorth Dakota. That was my job. I can tell you, projecting 5 years out \nis very risky. Frankly, it is hard to project 1 year out. Projecting 10 \nyears out is a total crapshoot and we are basing the economic security \nof this country on a 10-year projection? Are we really going to do \nthat?\n  I ask my colleagues, are we really going to do that? Is this what you \nare seriously proposing for the United States, after the economic \nsuccess we have enjoyed by reducing the deficits, by reducing debt?\n  Some of the very same people who said the 1993 plan would not work \nare here today, advocating this risky scheme. The 1993 plan, as I \nshowed, worked. That 5-year deficit reduction plan, in fact, reduced \nthe deficit each and every year. But when we passed it in 1993, the \nother side said it would crater the economy; it would ruin us.\n  This is what Senator Gramm, who is on the Budget Committee and on the \nFinance Committee, said back in 1993:\n\n       I want to predict tonight that if we adopt this bill the \n     American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the \n     deficit 4 years from now will be higher than it is today and \n     not lower. . ..When all is said and done, people will pay \n     more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, government \n     will spend more money, and the American people will be worse \n     off.\n\n  That is Senator Gramm in 1993 when we passed the plan that did just \nthe opposite. Let's look at the record. We passed that plan in 1993, \nand here is what happened: Unemployment went down to the lowest level \nin 41 years.\n  Senator Gramm and the advocates of opposition to the 1993 plan, who \nare the very ones who are the advocates of this plan today, were wrong. \nThey said it was going to increase unemployment. They were wrong. We \nhave the lowest unemployment in 41 years. They said that that economic \nplan would increase inflation. They were wrong. That plan reduced \ninflation to the lowest level in 33 years.\n  Mr. President, it does not stop there. Look at the economic growth. \nThey said the 1993 plan would retard economic growth. They were wrong. \nLook at the record. We have the strongest economic growth during the \nlast 6 years of any administration going back to the administration of \nLyndon Johnson.\n  Friends, people who are listening across the country, let's think a \nminute: Is the economy in good shape or is the economy in bad shape? I \nthink every one of us knows we have the strongest economy in anyone's \nmemory. That was built on a plan of reducing the deficits, relieving \npressure on interest rates, making America more competitive, reducing \nhome interest loans, reducing car loans, reducing student loans, \nbecause there was less deficit, less debt. Now we are on the brink of \ncompletely changing that policy and going back to the bad old days of \ndeficits and debt and decline. Are we really going to turn back the \nclock to those days? I hope not. I hope we do not make as foolish a \nmistake as that.\n  Because of the 5-year plan put in place in 1993, not only have we \ngotten the lowest unemployment, the lowest inflation in decades, the \nstrongest economic growth in decades, we have also seen welfare \ncaseloads decline dramatically. That is the record. That is the fact.\n  The other side says: Oh, but wait a minute. Taxes are the highest \nthey have been in 20 years.\n  They are not telling the whole story. Here is what has happened. \nRemember when we had deficits, we had a gap between the revenue of the \nUnited States and the spending of the United States. The blue line is \nthe spending; the red line is the revenue.\n  Go back to 1993. There was the gap. That was the deficit, $290 \nbillion. We cut the spending line, and we raised the revenue line. That \nis how we balanced the budget. We cut spending; we raised the revenue \nline.\n  When they say the taxes are the highest they have ever been, again, \nthey are not telling the whole story. Revenues are strong because the \neconomy is strong, but individual taxpayers are not paying more in \ntaxes; most are paying less. That is not the Senator from North Dakota \nspeaking, that is the respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. \nThey analyzed the tax burden, including payroll taxes and income taxes, \nof a family earning just under $20,000 a year. They looked at 1979, and \nthey looked at 1999.\n  In 1979, that family was paying 8.6 percent of their income in \ntaxes--payroll taxes and income taxes. That burden has been reduced to \n5 percent. Why? Because when we raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 \npercent in the 1993 plan, we also cut taxes on 28 million Americans by \nincreasing the earned income tax credit. So we reduced taxes for \nindividuals.\n  The same is true for a family of four earning $35,000 in 1999. Again, \nthe respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche went out and looked \nat their tax burden: 1979, 11.2 percent. That has been reduced to 10.5 \npercent in 1999. It is also true of a family earning $85,000 a year. In \n1979, they had a total tax burden of 17 percent; in 1999, 16.3 percent.\n\n  Does that mean there should not be any tax relief? No. We should have \ntax relief, but we ought to have a responsible package of tax relief, \nnot one that threatens to put us back in the economic ditch of deficits \nand debt. Unfortunately, that is what the Republican plan does.\n  On the question of the fairness of this proposal, if this is fair, I \ndo not understand fairness. They are going to give to the top 1 percent \nin this country with an average income of $837,000 a $46,000 tax cut. \nThey are going to give to the bottom 60 percent of the income earners \nin this country, the vast majority of people on average, a tax \nreduction of $138. That does not strike me as very fair.\n  Let's check their math. We have heard over and over they are just \ngiving 25 percent of the money that is available in surplus back in a \ntax cut. That is interesting math they are using. Let's check it.\n  The total surplus is $2.9 trillion. That is the CBO estimate.\n  I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes on behalf of the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Look at what CBO is projecting--and I emphasize \nprojecting--as the surplus over the next 10 years, $2.9 trillion. But \n$1.9 trillion of that is Social Security. If you take that out, you \nhave $1 trillion left. Republicans are proposing nearly $800 billion of \ntax cuts. When you do that, you add interest costs of $141 billion. \nThat only leaves $63 billion left for debt reduction, for strengthening \nMedicare, for domestic needs. They are using not 25 percent of what is \navailable; they are using 94 percent of what is available, because we \nhave all agreed that none of the Social Security money is available.\n  The only way they get this number of 25 percent being used for a tax \ncut is when they include Social Security in the base. Are they \nproposing we are going to use 25 percent of the Social Security money \nfor a tax cut? No. So they are using phony statistics. They are \napplying this 25 percent to two-thirds of the money that is Social \nSecurity money. They are taking 94 percent of the money that is truly \navailable for this risky tax cut.\n  Here are the choices: Republicans say $800 billion of tax cuts; \nnothing to strengthen Medicare; nothing for domestic needs; they have \n$63 billion unallocated.\n  Our proposal in the Senate was balanced. We said save every penny of \nSocial Security for Social Security and\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\nthen one-third for tax relief; one-third to strengthen Medicare--and, \nby the way, this money is not needed immediately so it can be used for \nthe next 15 years to pay down debt--and one-third of the money for \nhigh-priority domestic needs, such as education, defense, and \nagriculture.\n  That leads our friends on the other side to say: There go the \nDemocrats again; they just want to spend money.\n  Let's examine that notion. This blue line shows constant buying power \nof what we do with Federal spending now for domestic needs. That is \nwhat would happen if we had constant buying power. The Democratic plan \nis represented by this red line. It is a cut from current buying power. \nHere is the Republican plan down here. They have a massive cut, $770 \nbillion over the next 10 years from what current buying power would \npermit.\n  They do not want anybody to talk about this, but the reality is, they \nare advocating deep cuts in education, in defense, in agriculture, and \nin all the rest--parks, law enforcement--because there is no way to \navoid this mathematical reality. They came to this Chamber with a chart \nthat said, yes, you could accommodate this tax cut if you froze all \ndomestic spending for 10 years. It has never been done. What is amazing \nabout it is that it is not what they are doing in the Appropriations \nCommittees that meet every day. They are spending additional money.\n\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. On behalf of the minority, I yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is yielded 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let's be honest with the American people. This plan \ndoes not add up. It threatens to take us back to a period of growing \ndebts. It fails to meet high-priority domestic needs such as education \nand agriculture and defense. It does not do anything to secure Medicare \nfor the future. It is not real. It is not balanced. It is not \nresponsible. This plan is not conservative.\n  It is radical; it is risky; it is reckless. It ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be granted 2 additional minutes from the minority \ntime so he might be able to respond to a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think Senator Conrad makes the most \ncompelling presentation in the Senate on these budget matters. The \ncharts he has used today have been extraordinary in their description \nof the folly here with respect to this plan.\n  I want to ask the Senator to go back to a couple charts with respect \nto those who made predictions some years ago because I thought that was \nvery telling. The practice of augury in old Roman times was that the \nhigh priest would read the flights of birds and the entrails of cattle \nin order to evaluate the future.\n  We have some folks who are practicing augury in the Senate. They are \nthe prophets who have described to us how wonderful this plan is. I \nknow the Senator used, a bit ago, the same kind of descriptions from \nthese same prophets 7, 8 years ago.\n  Could the Senator refer to that again, because I think that is most \ntelling who brings this plan to the Senate, and what were their \npredictions previously?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I remember so well. I remember being on the floor of the \nSenate the day we passed the 5-year plan that got us back on track. I \nremember Republican leaders saying if we passed the plan, it would \ncrater the economy. I remember Republican leaders telling us if we \npassed the plan it would increase unemployment, it would increase \ninflation, that it would cost jobs, that it would wreck the economy. \nThey were wrong, and they were wrong on every single count. They said: \nIf you raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, and you cut spending, \nit is going to create a nightmare. They were wrong. They were \nabsolutely wrong.\n  Maybe we are not reminding people enough. Maybe we are not learning \nthe lessons of the past, but we have to because we should not go back \nto the days of deficits and debt that put this economy in the ditch.\n  So I am very hopeful we will learn from the past and we will \nrecognize that to come out here, based on a projection over the next 10 \nyears, to justify a massive tax-scheme giveaway that blows a hole in \nthe budget, blows a hole in the deficit, leads us back to the path of \ndebt and is a profound mistake.\n\n  It makes us all feel good. I would love to have a tax cut. I have two \nkids in college, and it is expensive. But I care more about their long-\nterm future. I care about them inheriting a world that is less debt-\nladen than what we have done to them so far. Because our generation--\nand here it is--has taken the debt from 1980, and here we are today. \nThis is what we have done with the national debt. We have run up the \ndebt from less than $1 trillion to nearly $4 trillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 final minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is what we have done in our generation. We have \ntaken this national debt of less than $1 trillion and run it up to \nnearly $4 trillion. That is the publicly held debt. Gross debt is even \nhigher. But this is publicly held debt.\n  Is that the legacy we want to leave, that we ran up the debt on our \nwatch? I do not think so. This is what could happen if we stay the \ncourse. This is what the Congressional Budget Office tells us could \nhappen if we stay the course. We could actually eliminate publicly held \ndebt over the next 15 years. But it will not happen with this plan \nbecause we apparently all have our hand out. We want to take care of \nourselves first and forget about the future. I hope that is not the \nlegacy we leave.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. On behalf of the minority, I yield 20 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague, the chairman.\n  Mr. President, last year we learned a very satisfying and important \nlesson. That is that there are rewards for fiscal discipline. After \nalmost three decades of deficits and mounting national debt, we finally \nwere able to eke out a small surplus. The very prospect of that small \nsurplus has been a major contribution to one of the longest and most \nexpansive periods of economic growth in our Nation's history. This \nfiscal discipline helped us to create favorable economic and fiscal \nconditions to address our long-term national challenges, especially our \nlong-term commitments in Social Security and Medicare.\n  This, frankly, is a time of national celebration. The question is, \nWhat kind of celebration? Will it be a prudent and patriotic \ncelebration of our success where we will channel our justified \nenthusiasm for our accomplishment into positive national family and \nindividual goals or will it be a wanton and reckless celebration? \nBecause our success, our opportunity to celebrate, did not give us \nlicense to return to the free spending, free period of increased \nindebtedness of the recent past. No. We owe it to our children and our \ngrandchildren to save this money, to save this money until we have \ndealt with our future obligations to them.\n  Unfortunately, several major legislative actions in the 105th, now \nthe 106th, Congress have made a mockery of our promise to maintain \nfiscal discipline. As an example, in February of this year, the Senate \npassed a military pay bill, with great enthusiasm and with great \nacclamations among those who would be particularly benefited and who \nhoped that it would strengthen our national security. The problem is, \nwe did not provide a means of paying for it. So we were, in essence, \nsaying we will pay for it out of our surplus.\n  If last February's legislation was just an aberration, a momentary \nlack of judgment, an inadvertent haste to turn from impeachment to \nlegislation, it might have been forgiven. Sadly, it cannot be so \ncharacterized. It, in fact, was part of a pattern of a continued lack \nof fiscal discipline. It was the second time, in fact, within 8 months \nthat we had proven ourselves unwilling to\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\ntake the hard decisions and too willing to sacrifice the well-being of \nfuture generations on the altar of expediency.\n  It was in October of 1998, in the waning hours of last fall's budget \nnegotiations, that we passed a $532 billion omnibus appropriations \nbill. Included in that bill was $21.4 billion in so-called emergency \nspending. Since that $21.4 billion of emergency spending could be \napproved without the necessity of finding any way to pay for it, that \nfunding came right out of the surplus. It took $3 billion out of the \nfiscal 1998 surplus. It took $13 billion out of the 1999 surplus. It \nwill take $5 billion out of this year's surplus.\n  The action would have been even mildly palatable had all of the \nsupposed emergency funds been allocated to true emergencies. But, in \nfact, many of the items that were funded out of the $21.4 billion were \nitems which had in the past been considered normal, regular obligations \nof the Federal Government, not the necessary, sudden, urgent, \nunforeseen, temporary needs that are supposed to be the hallmarks of \nreal emergencies.\n  In June, we made our third raid on the Social Security surplus, a \nsupplemental appropriations bill that again cloaked many nonemergency \nspending items in emergency designation under the title of Kosovo. With \nall the negative public attention that had been focused on our previous \nraids, one would have thought that we might have at least been \nembarrassed back into fiscal responsibility. But, again, I am sorry \nthat was not the case. So another $4 billion was taken out of the \nsurplus through emergency spending for 1999 and $7 billion will be \ntaken out in the year 2000.\n  What have we done thus far? We started with a total surplus for 1999 \nof $137 billion, of which $124 billion was Social Security. But after \nwe had taken $13 billion for the emergency of 1998 and $4 billion for \nthe emergency of 1999, we have reduced our surplus down to $120 \nbillion. So we have spent every penny of the off-budget surplus, and we \nhave spent $4 billion of the Social Security surplus to fund these \nemergencies.\n  Now, what is the chart for the year 2000? We started out with a total \nsurplus of $173 billion, of which $147 billion was Social Security. We \nhave the $5 billion from 1998, we have the $7 billion bloated Kosovo \nemergency expenditure, and just last night, we voted yet another \nemergency expenditure of $8 billion for agriculture. Today we have on \nthe floor a tax bill that will cut the revenue for the year 2000 by $5 \nbillion. So what started off as a $173 billion surplus has already \nshrunk to $148 billion. Every dollar of that surplus is Social Security \nsave $1 billion, which, as I will point out in subsequent remarks, is \nhighly in danger.\n  The action yesterday relative to agriculture represents the \ndifficulty of the dilemma. Certainly American farmers are facing \ndistressful circumstances. I happen to be an American farmer. I think I \nunderstand something of their plight. But the way to deal with this \nproblem is not by temporary emergency fixes. The way to deal with this \nproblem is to look at the underlying causes, which might be that we \nhaven't been adequately dealing with fundamental issues such as crop \ninsurance reform or that we have not been sufficiently aggressive in \nour trade policy in order to ensure there are open markets for American \nagricultural goods. Those are some of the ways in which we ought to be \ndirecting our attention, not through emergency spending to deplete our \nsurplus.\n  The budget resolution says that emergency spending must meet five \ncriteria. It must be necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and it must \nnot be permanent. I suggest that many of these expenditures we have \nmade over the last 2 years fail to meet those standards of emergency.\n  Our fiscal irresponsibility, however, is not limited just to \nemergency appropriations. We have defined the surplus as the difference \nbetween estimated revenue and estimated expenditures. Yet in arriving \nat those estimated expenditures, we have used unrealistic standards. We \nhave created expenditure expectations that no one in this Congress \nbelieves are, in fact, going to be met; thus, the necessity to resort \nto these kinds of emergency measures. While we are doing that, we are \nalso fundamentally deceiving the American people as to what our Federal \nGovernment's policies will be.\n\n  Let me use one example.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the end of my remarks to have printed in \nthe Record an article from the New York Times of July 25, ``National \nParks, Strained by Record Crowd, Face a Crisis.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There is no better time than in early August to talk \nabout the state of our national parks, because this is a time of the \nyear when hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens are taking \nadvantage of one of America's great treasures--its national park \nsystem. But it is a treasure which we have been systematically looting \nthrough indifference. It is stated in this article that in an \nassessment made last year, the Park Service estimated it would cost \n$3.54 billion to repair maintenance problems at national parks, \nmonuments, and wilderness areas, maintenance that has been put off for \ndecades, in some cases, because of lack of money.\n  Mr. President, while we may deceive ourselves into the statement that \nwe have this significant surplus, it is a surplus which is being \nderived by a systematic underfunding of important national priorities, \npriorities which we know eventually are going to be met, but which we \nare now deceiving ourselves into the false illusion that there is an \nunrealistic surplus, a surplus which we can now use to fund these \nmassive tax cuts.\n  The time is now to provide some honest leadership for the American \npeople, not hollow statements and false promises. I am afraid that that \nleadership and honesty are not to be found in the tax bill before us \ntoday.\n  What I think we need to do is to put first things first. As \nEcclesiastes says: There is a time for all things. There is a season to \nplant and there is a season to harvest.\n  What is the season today, in this time of national celebration of the \nresults of fiscal discipline? I suggest the season for today is to deal \nwith the challenges of our children and our grandchildren, starting \nwith two critical national programs.\n  We should provide for the solvency of Social Security for our \nchildren and our grandchildren, and we should strengthen Medicare and \nbring it into the 21st century by providing it with the tools \nnecessary, not just to deal with illness but to do what Americans \nwant--to provide for their health and well-being. We should be funding \nthose medical services that will prevent disease and illness, that will \nmaintain our American people in their highest state of health. \nUnfortunately, when we have spent the resources that would be necessary \nto fund this tax cut before having dealt with Social Security and \nMedicare, there will be no money left to deal with Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  The statement will be made that Social Security is off the table; we \nhave already dealt with it; that by placing all of the Social Security \nsurplus into a lockbox to protect it for Social Security, we have \ndischarged that responsibility. Well, first, I say that we have a very \nleaky lockbox. Willie Sutton was once asked: Why do you rob banks? The \nanswer was: That is where the money is. Well, the lockbox assumes the \nmoney has already gotten to the bank. But Jesse James figured out that \nif he could rob the train before the box got to the bank, he could get \nthe money before it could be placed in the vault. That is essentially \nwhat this emergency spending loophole is allowing us to do. We are \nlooting the lockbox before the money arrives.\n  Even if we put the full amount of the Social Security surplus into \nthe Social Security program, we would only have extended its solvency \nfor our children to the year 2034.\n  The Greenspan Commission of the early 1980s had recommended that we \nought to fund Social Security on a three-generational program, which \nwould mean through the year 2075. We have not completed our task if the \nonly thing we have done is to secure the solvency of Social Security to \nthe year 2034.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity to lead the Nation in the way \nin which I believe thoughtful Americans wish to go. They wish to be \nprudent at\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nthis time. They wish to celebrate the successes of fiscal discipline \nand to continue those successes. They want to take care of today's \nseason of business first. They do not want us to embark upon a reckless \ncourse which would dissipate our ability to deal with our future needs \nand place us in the precarious position of depending upon unrealistic \nestimates of future revenues and a totally unrealistic expectation of \nfuture national needs.\n  So the issue is not the details of this tax proposal, although I \nbelieve an examination of that detail would indicate this plan is \nwoefully lacking in basic principles of fairness and equity to all \nAmericans. But the fundamental deficiency of this tax bill is its lack \nof timeliness. We should not be considering any tax cut until we have \ntaken care of priority business--protecting Social Security for three \ngenerations and strengthening Medicare. We should not be considering \nany tax measures until we are certain the projections of revenue and \nthe estimates of future needs are based on realistic, not political, \nassessments.\n  After we have carried out those first tasks, then if there are funds \nleft available--and I suggest there probably will be --then we could \nconsider what would be an appropriate form of returning that measure \nback to the American people through a tax cut. But, for today, the \nanswer must be no to the measure that is before us. I hope that soon we \nwill be answering yes to the responsibility we have to do America's \nfirst business first.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 25, 1999]\n\n        National Parks, Strained by Record Crowds, Face a Crisis\n\n                         (By Michael Janofsky)\n\n       YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WY--In growing numbers that now \n     exceed 3.1 million a year, visitors travel here to America's \n     oldest national park to marvel at wildlife, towering \n     mountains, pristine rivers and geological curiosities like \n     geysers, hot springs and volcanic mudpots.\n       Yet many things tourists may not see on a typical trip \n     through Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres spread across parts \n     of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming could have a greater impact on \n     the park's future than the growl of a grizzly or spew of Old \n     Faithful.\n       For all its beauty, Yellowstone is broken. Hordes of summer \n     tourists and the increasing numbers now visiting in the \n     spring, fall ad winter are overwhelming the park's ability to \n     accommodate them properly.\n       In recent years, the park's popularity has created such \n     enormous demands on water lines, roads and personnel that \n     park management has been forced to spend most of \n     Yellowstone's annual operating budget, about $30 million, on \n     immediate problems rather than investing in long-term \n     solutions that would eliminate the troublesome areas.\n       Yellowstone is not the only national park suffering. With \n     the nation's 378 national park areas expected to attract \n     almost 300 million visitors this year, after a record 286 \n     million in 1998, many parks are deferring urgently needed \n     capital improvements.\n       For instance, damaged sewage pipes at Yellowstone have let \n     so much ground water from spring thaws into the system that \n     crews have had to siphon off millions of gallons of treated \n     water into meadows each of the last four years.\n       And with budget restraints forcing personnel cutbacks in \n     every department, even the number of park rangers with law-\n     enforcement authority has dropped, contributing to a steady \n     increase in crime throughout Yellowstone.\n       ``It's so frustrating,'' Michael V. Finley, Yellowstone's \n     superintendent, said. ``As the park continues to deteriorate, \n     the service level continues to decline. You see how many \n     Americans enjoy this park. They deserve better.''\n       Over the last decade the annual budget of the National Park \n     Service, an agency of the Interior Department, has nearly \n     doubled, to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year 1999 from $1.13 \n     billion in 1990, an increase that narrowly outpaced \n     inflation.\n       But in an assessment made last year, the park service \n     estimated that it would cost $3.54 billion to repair \n     maintenance problems at national parks, monuments and \n     wilderness areas that have been put off--for decades, in some \n     cases--because of a lack of money.\n       The cost of needed repairs at Yellowstone was put at $46 \n     million, the most of any park area in the system. But the \n     park service report shows that budget limits have forced \n     virtually all national parks to set aside big maintenance \n     projects, delays that many park officials say compromise \n     visitor enjoyment and occasionally threaten their health and \n     safety.\n       Senator Craig Thomas, a Wyoming Republican who is chairman \n     of the Subcommittee on National Parks, and Bob Stanton, \n     director of the park service, negotiated a deal this week to \n     spend $12 million over the next three years for Yellowstone \n     repairs.\n       Other parks may have to wait longer. The Grand Canyon \n     National Park depends on a water treatment system that has \n     not been upgraded in 30 years, a $20 million problem, park \n     officials say. Parts of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal \n     National Historical Park along the Potomac River are \n     crumbling, another $10 million expense. The Everglades \n     National Park in South Florida needs a $15 million water \n     treatment plant.\n       Even with a heightened awareness of need among Federal \n     lawmakers and Clinton Administration officials, money to \n     repair those problems may be hard to find at a time when \n     Congress is wrestling over the true size of a projected \n     budget surplus and how much of it will pay for tax cuts. If \n     billions were to become available for new spending, the park \n     service would still have to slug it out with every other \n     Federal agency, and few predict that parks would emerge a big \n     winner.\n       It is a disturbing prospect to conservationists, parks \n     officials and those lawmakers who support increased spending \n     to help the parks address their backlog of maintenance \n     problems.\n       ``It's kind of like a decayed tooth,'' said Dave Simon, the \n     Southwest regional director for the National Parks and \n     Conservation Association, a citizens' group that is working \n     with Yellowstone to solve some of the long-term needs. ``If \n     you don't take care of it, one day you'll wake up with a \n     mouthful of cavities.''\n       The parks' supporters like Representative Ralph S. Regula, \n     an Ohio Republican who is chairman of Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on the Interior, concede that budgetary \n     increases as well as revenue from new programs that allow \n     parks to keep a greater share of entrance fees and concession \n     sales have been offset by inflation, rising costs and daily \n     operational demands that now accommodate 8.9 percent more \n     people than those who visited national parks a decade ago.\n       With few dollars available for maintenance programs, the \n     parks suffered ``benign neglect,'' Mr. Regula said, adding: \n     ``It's not very sexy to fix a sewer system or maintain a \n     trail. You don't get headlines for that. It would be nice to \n     get them more money, but we're constrained.''\n       Denis P. Galvin, the deputy director of the National Park \n     service, noted that only twice this century, in the 1930's \n     and in 1966, has the Federal Government authorized money for \n     systemwide capital improvements, and he said he was not \n     expecting another windfall soon.\n       ``Generally,'' Mr. Galvin said, ``domestic programs come at \n     the back of the line when they're formulating the Federal \n     budget, and I just don't think parks are a priority.''\n       Perhaps no park in America reflects the array of hidden \n     problems more than Yellowstone, which opened in 1872, years \n     before Idaho, Montana and Wyoming became states.\n       Park officials here say that the longer problems go \n     unattended, the more expensive and threatening they become.\n       The budget restraints have meant reducing the number of \n     rangers who carry guns and have the authority to make \n     arrests.\n       Rick Obernesser, Yellowstone's chief ranger, said the \n     roster had dwindled to 112 from 144 over the last 10 years, \n     which often means leaving the park without any of these \n     rangers from 2 A.M. to 6 A.M.\n       Next year, Mr. Obernesser said, the park will have only 93 \n     of these rangers, about 1 for every 23,000 acres compared \n     with 1 for every 15,000 acres when his staff was at peak \n     strength.\n       That has not only led to slower response times to \n     emergencies, like auto accidents and heart attacks, he said, \n     but also to an increase in crime. Since the peak staffing \n     year of 1989, he said, the park has experienced significant \n     increases in the killing of wildlife, thefts, weapons charges \n     against visitors and violations by snowmobile drivers.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Delaware to yield \nme 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to yield 20 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment my colleague, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for his leadership \nin bringing the bill to the floor. In addition, I compliment Senator \nLott and Senator Domenici because they helped make this happen.\n  The Senate, earlier this year, passed a budget resolution that says \nlet's use most of the surplus that is projected to pay down the \nnational debt. As a matter of fact, let's use over two-thirds of it to \npay down the national debt. I have heard complaints from colleagues on \nthe Democrat side saying we don't do enough. Frankly, we pay down the \nnational debt more than the Democrats have proposed and more than the \nPresident has proposed. Maybe that is not enough for them, but it is \nmore than they have proposed.\n  I compliment Senator Domenici and Senator Lott, as well as Senator \nRoth, for laying the groundwork to say let's\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\ntake at least one-fourth of the surplus projected and let the people \nkeep it. Some people say give it back to them. Well, I don't think they \nshould ever have to send it to Washington, DC, in the first place; it \nis their money.\n  That is the issue. Are we going to allow the taxpayers to keep one-\nfourth of the surplus, or are we going to insist on that money going to \nWashington, DC, and Washington spending it? Obviously, there is no \nlimit on the number of demands we have on spending other people's \nmoney. We can spend it all just like that. It is quite easy, in fact it \nis the easiest thing to do. Now, we finally have an opportunity, as a \nresult of the significant surplus, to allow people to keep more of it.\n  We do that in this bill. We have come up with a bill that I believe \nis fair, balanced, and I think is a good tax bill, a tax bill for \ntaxpayers. I will go into some of the benefits. First, I want to \nrepudiate some of the comments that were made against it. One Senator \nsaid it was too much. It is one-fourth of the surplus.\n  I don't think that is too much. We have given tax cuts in the past \nwhen we didn't even have a surplus. I happen to have supported those. \nWe passed a tax cut in 1997--a strong majority of Congress passed it. \nWe didn't have a surplus then. I think it was the right thing to do. We \ngave a tax cut because, in some cases, rates were too high. We said if \nwe have a tax cut, it will stimulate the economy and raise more money. \nGuess what. That is what happened.\n  We cut the capital gains tax both in 1995 and in 1997. The President \nvetoed it in 1995. He signed it in 1997. When I say ``we,'' I am \ntalking about Republicans because we didn't have any support in 1995 \nfrom our Democrat colleagues--maybe with one or two exceptions. We \npassed it in 1997. We cut capital gains from 28 to 20 percent. It \nhelped the economy and raised a lot of money. It beat the expectations \nby the CBO and the Treasury Department. Why? We reduced the tax on \ntransactions by about 230 percent and ended up having more financial \ntransactions. As a result, you have more income and more taxes. It \nhelped the economy. Many of us said that would happen, that it would \nhave a very positive impact.\n  Let me touch on one other thing. A couple of colleagues said you \ncan't have this tax cut because it benefits high-income people. Heaven \nforbid, somebody making $500,000 is going to get a greater benefit than \nsomebody making $10,000. Let me just step back a little bit. Is this \ntax cut too high, too generous for high-income people? I don't think \nso.\n  Let me talk about rates. I believe marginal rates impact on whether \nor not somebody is going to do extra work. I have been in the private \nsector. I used to have a janitorial service, and marginal rates kept me \nfrom doing more work. I had a situation where I was making enough money \nto combine income and Social Security taxes. I was working about 40 \npercent of the time for the Government, and I said that is enough. I am \nnot going to work more if the Government is going to take almost half \nof everything I make. It denied the advancement and expansion of my \nbusiness--a small business.\n\n  I might mention, that small business is where most additional new \nemployees are starting. Somebody says, wait a minute, this tax cut is \nunfair, it benefits the high income bracket. Look at what we do for \nhigh income. We reduce every single income bracket by 1 percentage \npoint. The low end is 15 percent and we reduced it to 14 percent. The \nhigh income is 39.6 percent, and we reduced it to 38.6 percent, and so \non. There is a 28 percent bracket; we move that to 27.\n  Somebody says, that benefits the high income. Wait a minute. We \nreduce it in every single bracket by 1 percentage point. It so happens \nthat for the 15-percent bracket, to move down 1 point, that is a 7-\npercent reduction. If you move a 39.6 percent down to 38.6, that is a \n2.6-percent reduction--less than half of a percentage reduction of the \n15-percent taxpayer, or the lower income taxpayer. So I don't think \nthis is tilted in any way. If anything, if one really looks at this, it \nmakes the system more progressive.\n  So the argument that this benefits upper income doesn't fly, and it \ndoesn't fly with history. Look at what the tax cut rates were when \nPresident Clinton was sworn into office. The maximum rate in 1992 was \n31 percent. After the Clinton tax increase--or maybe I should say the \nDemocrat tax increase because it only passed by Democrats, with the \nVice President breaking the tie vote twice in this Chamber--it \nincreased the maximum rate from 31 to 39.6 percent. Actually, it went \nhigher than that because they also took the cap off the Medicare tax \nand said you have to pay Medicare tax on all income, all salary, and \nall wages. So you have payroll taxes and Federal income taxes and \nSocial Security taxes, and no limit, no base, no cap on Medicare taxes.\n  Medicare tax is 1.45 percent of payroll, plus your employer's \ncontribution; that is 2.9 percent. So a person in the maximum bracket \npays actually 39.6, plus 2.9 percent Medicare. That is a total of 42.5 \npercent. When Bill Clinton was sworn in, the maximum rate was 31 \npercent. One year later, it was 42.5 percent on all income, all wages, \non everybody in the country.\n  That is a massive tax increase. That is a 37-percent increase.\n  What are we doing in this bill? We are reducing that by one point. We \nreduce it from 39.6 to 38.6; 38.6 is a whole lot more than 31.\n  So, the tax cut that we are proposing is just a small fraction of the \ntax increase President Clinton and the Democrats passed in 1993--a \nsmall fraction. Yet some of my colleagues are saying we can't do that. \nIt might deny us the ability to spend more money. We have a whole \nlaundry list of people parading to Washington, DC, saying: Give me some \nmore money because we want to spend it. We want more of your money \nbecause we can spend it better than you can.\n  Finally, I want to address the comments of one of our colleagues who \nsays we favor a tax cut, but we don't believe now is the time to do it. \nWait a minute. When are you going to do it, if not now?\n  We have estimates of a $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. \nAnd we are not going to do it now? Will we only give you a tax cut if \nit is $4 trillion, or $5 trillion? At what point would our colleagues \nsay it is time to let people keep more of their own money? We are \ntaking too much from them. If my colleagues are not going to agree to a \ntax cut that is only one-fourth of the surplus, they will never agree \nto one.\n  It absolutely amazes me how our Democrat colleagues all marched in \nstep in 1993 and said: We are going to support this tax increase \nbecause Bill Clinton wants it.\n  You might remember that Bill Clinton shortly after that said, Oops, \nsurprise, I agree with the business community. We increased taxes too \nmuch. He actually admitted to that. A lot of Democrats were mad, but he \nadmitted to it anyway and then he went ahead and vetoed our tax cut in \n1995.\n  Then in 1997, he eventually agreed to a tax cut and everybody seemed \nto favor it. I guess whatever Bill Clinton says the Democrats march in \nline to.\n  I don't know. But we cut taxes in 1997. We reduced capital gains from \n28 to 20 percent--very positive things. They might think that was a bad \nthing to do. No one offered an amendment saying let's bring capital \ngains back up to 28 percent saying that it was terrible. A lot of \npeople debated against it in 1997. But it was the right thing to do.\n  We cut taxes for families in 1997. We passed a $500 tax credit for \neach child in 1997. Bill Clinton campaigned for it in 1992. He didn't \ndeliver in 1993. As a matter of fact, in 1993 he increased taxes. That \ntax cut didn't happen until 1997. Republicans passed it. The President \nvetoed it. We passed it in 1997 and he eventually signed it.\n  A family of four with an income of less than $80,000 has $2,000 per \nyear that they can keep. A family with four kids gets to keep $2,000 \nmore per year because Republicans in Congress said we are going to pass \nit. We promised to and we did.\n  We established the Roth IRA.\n  We did some good things in 1997. Guess what? We didn't have the \nprojected surplus in 1997 that we have in 1999. Now we have trillions \nof dollars of anticipated surplus. Let's give one-fourth of it back to \nthe American people. Let's let them keep it. They shouldn't have to \nsend that much to\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\nWashington, DC. Their taxes are too high.\n  I will go through a couple of examples that we correct in this bill \nto show why their taxes are too high and what we do about it. There are \ntoo many people who send too much to Washington DC. Let me address a \ncouple of those examples.\n  I mentioned a self-employed person. A self-employed person, an \nindividual, makes $25,000. They are taxed at the marginal bracket of 15 \npercent on everything they make up to $25,000. Above that they are \ntaxed at 28 percent. If somebody has a painting service in rural \nDelaware, and paints houses and works for himself, that individual has \na taxable income of $25,000, and probably is not considered wealthy by \nmost people's standards. Any additional contract that person makes, any \nadditional income that person makes, is taxed at 28 percent. He also \nhas to pay Social Security and Medicare tax. That is 15.3 percent on \ntop of the 28 percent. Add those two together, and it is 43.3 percent. \nHe has to pay State income tax. In my State that is 6 or 7 percent. For \nany additional dollar that individual makes painting houses, fifteen \ncents of it goes to the government.\n\n  That is too high. That is far too much.\n  For a married couple right now that makes $43,000, it is the same \nthing. For any additional dollar they make, half of it goes to the \ngovernment, if they are self-employed.\n  That is too high. So we cut that.\n  We provide marriage penalty relief and several other positive things. \nLet me go through some more of the changes.\n  I mentioned that we cut all brackets by one percent. That benefits \nthe lower more than the upper brackets. The lower brackets get a seven-\npercent reduction and the upper brackets get a 2.8 percent reduction. \nThat is not stacked towards the higher income people. It is a tax cut \nfor all taxpayers, and it benefits, percentage-wise, the lowest income \ntaxpayers first. The lowest income taxpayer gets the break first.\n  Again, for somebody who says this is weighted towards the wealthy, it \nis absolutely totally and completely false.\n  We widen the 15 percent bracket. We make it 14 percent. Then we widen \nit. We ship $3,000 more of income into the 14-percent bracket instead \nof the 28-percent bracket.\n  That is a very positive change for an individual with an income up to \n$25,750. That means they get to save $390. That is fairly significant. \nI think that is very significant.\n  For a couple you are talking about double that amount. So they get to \nsave a significant amount as well.\n  Marriage penalty relief: What did we do? Some people do not \nunderstand what we did. We said we would double the bracket by \nincreasing the standard deduction--basically doubling the standard \ndeduction for an individual. If you look at the income tax forms, and \nsay you are filing as individuals, or joint. If you file as married, \nyou don't get twice the individual deduction. So, frankly, it would be \nbetter off if a married couple filed as individuals. They are penalized \nfor filing jointly.\n  Does it make any sense for our Tax Code to penalize people for being \nmarried to the tune of $1,400 per family? That is wrong. This bill \neliminates that for most couples.\n  What do we do? We said, Let's double the standard deduction. It \nshould be twice as much for those who are married as it is for \nindividuals.\n  We do that with this legislation because the biggest hit is on \nmarried couples, and the marriage penalty is that individually they are \ntaxed at 15 percent. For joint income tax they are taxed at 28 \npercent--almost twice as high. We move those rates to 14 and to 27 \npercent. We are saying for all of the income that is taxed up to 14 \npercent they should have twice that bracket amount for a couple. That \nis not the way the tax code is right now.\n  Let me explain it.\n  Individuals today are taxed at 15 percent up to $25,000. You say, OK. \nThat is for an individual, and it would make sense for a couple then to \nbe taxed at 15 percent up to $50,000. But that is not the present law. \nThe present law says above $43,000 they are taxed at 28 percent. So \nthey have $7,000 that they are taxed at a higher rate, twice the rate \nas what they should be. We eliminate that. We double the 15 percent \nbracket for married couples.\n  So if it is $25,000 at 15 percent for an individual, it would be \n$50,000 for a couple.\n  What does that mean in savings to a couple that makes $50,000? It \nmeans $980 a year that they will be able to keep. We are not going to \npenalize couples because they happen to be married and because they \nhappen to file joint returns.\n\n  I want to compliment the chairman, because he has worked very hard in \nsupporting this.\n  We have $100 billion in tax relief for married couples by eliminating \nthe marriage penalty in this legislation--that is one eighth of this \nbill.\n  When we debated this legislation on the floor of the Senate last \nweek, no one said take out the marriage penalty.\n  The marriage penalty tax elimination is one of the most important \naspects of this bill and we are going to make it happen.\n  The upper rate reductions that I mentioned move one percent down.\n  That may not happen, because we have a trigger mechanism that says if \nwe don't meet the deficit reduction targets the tax cut doesn't happen.\n  That is not the case for marriage penalty relief.\n  I encourage my colleagues. If you believe in getting rid of the \nmarriage penalty, you had better vote for this bill. It is one of the \nmost significant reforms that we have in this legislation.\n  What else did we do? Why should somebody be in favor of this?\n  We eliminate the death tax.\n  We changed the current unified credit into an exemption.\n  What does that mean? Right now everybody knows that we have a unified \ncredit that says if you have a taxable estate above $650,000, you don't \nhave to pay a death tax. If you pass away, your survivors and kids \nwon't have to pay any death tax.\n  We changed that unified credit into an exemption.\n  What does that mean? Once you have to pay the tax, you start paying \nat 39 percent.\n  By making an exemption, you start out at a lower rate. So any taxable \nestate will be taxed at an 18 percent rate.\n  The beginning rate of a taxable estate will be 18 percent instead of \n39 percent. We will be helping out estates that are just over the \nthreshold, estates that are $1 million or $1.5 million. That is a very \npositive change.\n  Eventually, in 9 years, by the year 2009, we eliminate the death tax. \nAt that point, estates should be taxed when the property is sold--not \nin the event of death but when the property is sold. If your kids \ninherit a business or ranch, they don't have to pay inheritance tax \nuntil they sell it; if they sell it, then they are taxed capital gains. \nAnd they have to pay tax on the base, going back to the original base. \nThat is how it should be. If they sell, they should pay capital gains; \nif they don't sell, they shouldn't be hit.\n  I learned the hard way. This inheritance tax makes people sell \nbusinesses all the time. It makes people sell farms, ranches, homes--\njust name it--to cover estate taxes. That is wrong. If they should \nchoose to sell it, then let them pay the tax on the gain. That is what \nwe do here and that is a very significant provision in this bill.\n  What else do we do in this bill? We reduce capital gains taxes. We \nhave proven time and time again, going back to the time of John F. \nKennedy, reduce taxes and we generate more money to Government, \nparticularly with marginal rates and capital gains rates. We reduced \nthe capital gains rate in 1997 from 28 to 20 percent, and it raised a \nlot of money for the Federal Government. In this bill, immediately \ngoing back to January 1 of this year, we reduce the capital gains rate \nfrom 20 percent to 18 percent.\n  Beginning January 1 of next year we index capital gains. What does \nthat mean? It means we will quit taxing inflation. If someone has a \nhome and that home is escalating in price through inflation, they won't \nhave to pay taxes on that inflated gain because the home really hasn't \nincreased in value, it is just staying up. That is a very positive \nprovision and I compliment the authors of the bill for their hard work.\n  We increase IRA deductions from $2,000 to $5,000. We haven't \nincreased it\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\nsince we passed IRAs many years ago. That is another significant \nprovision, so people are saving and are not so dependent on an employer \nor the Federal Government.\n  We allow self-employed persons to deduct 100 percent of their health \ncare costs. Right now they can deduct 45 percent. This measure affects \nnearly 16 million taxpayers. It is a very positive provision. We allow \n100-percent deductibility of health insurance for workers without \ngenerous employers. If you do not work for a generous employer, you can \ndeduct your health care costs.\n  We increase child care tax credits.\n  We have AMT reforms so people don't get stuck paying an alternative \nminimum tax just because they are taking tax credits that Congress has \nalready passed.\n  We allow small businesses to be able to expense up to $30,000 a year. \nWe increase that from $19,000. This is a provision that will benefit \nthousands and thousands of businesses, small businesses, all across the \ncountry.\n  I say to my colleagues, this bill is a good tax bill, it is a fair \ntax relief bill. It allows small business, individuals, and married \ncouples an opportunity to keep more of their own money instead of \nsending it to Washington, DC.\n  I urge my colleagues on behalf of the taxpayers all across America to \nvote ``yes'' on this bill later this evening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na couple of tables showing the distributional effects. Changes that we \nare making will show the greatest percentage of reductions are \ncertainly pushed towards the lower income. For example, on married \nfiling jointly, the rate reduction is 7 percent but the biggest \nreduction actually is for incomes of $40,000 to $60,000, receiving \nsignificant reductions, up to 17 and 22 percent, because of the \nmarriage penalty relief that we have added.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these tables printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                                                              IMPACT OF RATE REDUCTION & BRACKET

Senate\n\n       TAXPAYER REFUND AND RELIEF ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n                              (Continued)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I begin by commending the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, and our leadership, Senators Lott and \nNickles, for their tremendous work on this bill. Members have heard \nSenator Nickles discuss the details of the bill, the many things that \nhave been included in this bill. Through his leadership, a lot of the \nthings that Members of the Republican Party and people I represent who \nhave talked to me about tax policy wanted in this bill have gotten \nincluded in the bill. I think they did a tremendous job in ensuring \nthat the tax relief for taxpayers became a part of this tax package.\n  I won't go over the details of the bill as Senator Nickles has just \ndone, but I want to note that this is, as he said, the largest middle-\nclass tax cut since Ronald Reagan was President. It is based on the \nsame kind of progrowth, broad-based policies that will let all \ntaxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to take a minute to congratulate and thank my \nfriend and colleague from Arizona for his leadership in the entire tax \nreduction effort, but particularly in estate taxes. The Senator from \nArizona has been principal sponsor of a bill to reduce and eliminate \nthe estate taxes. We have incorporated most all of that provision in \nthis bill.\n  I want to compliment him because I am confident eventually--maybe \nthis bill will be vetoed; I hope not; I hope the President \nreconsiders--we will pass a bill to eliminate the death tax. The \nSenator from Arizona deserves great accolades and credit for being a \nprincipal player in making that happen.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the distinguished assistant majority leader. I agree \nthat by including the repeal of the estate tax, sometimes called the \ndeath tax, in this legislation, we have laid down a marker and pretty \nwell ensured that sooner or later it is going to be repealed.\n  Obviously, for the time being, we may have to pay it down a little \nbit and find it is repealed in maybe the ninth or tenth year. \nHopefully, by virtue of the fact we have agreed that it has to go \neventually, we will repeal it, and hopefully it will be sooner rather \nthan later because some of my friends have kidded, saying: You know, it \nis fine you get this repealed 9 years from now, but that means I have \nto hang on for another 9 years. I am not sure that is possible. Besides \nthat, I have to do the expensive estate planning in the meantime.\n  We prefer to get that eliminated sooner rather than later. I think it \nis a testament to the leadership of Senator Nickles, majority leader \nSenator Lott, and Senator Roth, as well as our friends in the House who \nwere in agreement that the death tax had to go. That important \nprovision was included in this election.\n  Rather than describe the specifics of this program, let me note, when \nI turned on the television this morning I heard a report on CNN. \nReporters had gone to Orange County in California. They found the \naverage citizen on the street there really didn't like this tax relief \nthat much.\n  They said: Why do we need to do it? After all, shouldn't we be saving \nthe Social Security surplus for paying down the debt or for Social \nSecurity?\n  I say as plainly and clearly as I can: That is exactly what we do. We \nare not spending the Social Security surplus. Every dime of the Social \nSecurity surplus is set. It is not the subject of this tax bill.\n  There are two kinds of surplus. First, FICA taxes fund the Social \nSecurity payments to seniors. We collect more in FICA taxes than \ncurrent beneficiaries require under Social Security. So there is a \nsurplus. We don't use that for the tax cut.\n  Now, there are all of the other tax payment provisions of the code. \nWe have to pay income tax, the estate tax, the capital gains tax, these \nother taxes. They, too, are producing more revenue than we need. We are \nnot spending as much as we are collecting. That is the surplus we are \ntalking about for tax relief.\n  As Senator Nickles said a moment ago, out of the entire surplus, only \n25 cents of it is going for tax relief. When some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle or the President say we can't afford tax \nrelief; we should be saving the Social Security surplus, they are \nfooling the American people. The truth is, the Social Security surplus \nis not being used for this tax relief--not a penny of it.\n  As a matter of fact, those people who say we should pay down the \nnational debt should understand that both under the President's plan \nand under our plan, any amount of the Social Security surplus that \nisn't necessary for Social Security is used to do what? Pay down the \nnational debt. That is what the Social Security surplus is being used \nfor.\n  Let's not be confused. There are good reasons for a tax cut. The \nmoney for the tax cut is not coming out of the money for Social \nSecurity or for paying off our national debt. That is the fundamental \npoint I wanted to reiterate.\n  Different provisions of the bill stress the point that Senator \nNickles made, which is that finally we have achieved in law--we will by \nthe time we vote for this--that the death tax is going to be repealed. \nI think that sends a very important message as we continue to craft tax \nlegislation. Should the President veto this bill, that will permit us\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nto include that principle in whatever eventually is sent to the \nPresident and, hopefully, signed into law.\n  The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act, which is really the largest \nmiddle-class tax cut since Ronald Reagan was President, is based upon \nthe kind of broad-based, pro-growth policies that will help all \ntaxpayers and keep our nation's economic expansion on track.\n  Mr. President, this measure really represents a departure from the \nkind of targeted tax cuts that we have seen in the past. Taxpayers will \nnot have to jump through hoops, or behave exactly as Washington wants, \nto see relief. If you pay taxes, you get to keep more of what you earn. \nIt is as simple as that. The marginal income-tax rate reductions in \nthis bill refund to all taxpayers a share of the tax overpayment that \nhas created our budget surpluses. Those in the lowest income-tax \nbracket will see a seven percent reduction in their taxes. Those in the \nhighest tax bracket will see a reduction of about half that size. I \nwould have preferred an across-the-board reduction that helped everyone \nmore than this. But recognizing the constraints imposed on the Finance \nCommittee by the budget resolution, I think this is a very good \nproduct.\n  In addition to marginal rate reductions, the bill would eliminate two \nof the most egregious taxes imposed on the American people: the \nmarriage-tax penalty and the death tax. There is simply no reason that \ntwo of life's milestones should trigger a tax, let alone the steep \ntaxes that are imposed on people when they get married and when they \ndie. Eliminating them is the right thing to do.\n  To eliminate the marriage penalty for most taxpayers, the standard \ndeduction for joint returns would be set at two times the single \nstandard deduction, and the new 14 percent income-tax bracket would be \nadjusted to two times the single bracket, phased in over the life of \nthe bill. This will solve the problem for most taxpayers, but we need \nto make clear that, although we have devoted fully 50 percent of the \nrelief in this bill to broad-based and marriage-penalty relief, we will \nnot have eliminated the marriage penalty entirely. We will still need \nto come back and address the problem for taxpayers who choose to \nitemize.\n  The bill also phases out the death tax over the next several years, \nso that by 2009 it is completely eliminated. I would ask Senators to \ncarefully review the details of what is proposed here, because I \nbelieve they will find that the bill offers a way for those on both \nsides of the aisle to bridge our differences with respect to how \ntransfers at death are taxed.\n  The beauty of the proposal is that it takes death out of the \nequation. Death would no longer be a taxable event. It would neither \nconfer a benefit--the step-up in basis allowed under current law--nor a \npenalty--the punitive, confiscatory death tax.\n  The provisions are based upon the bipartisan, Kyl-Kerrey Estate Tax \nElimination Act, S. 1128, which would treat inherited assets like any \nother asset for tax purposes. A tax on the capital gain would be paid, \nthe same as if the decedent had sold the property during his or her \nlifetime, but the tax would be paid only if and when the property is \nsold.\n  If the beneficiaries of an estate hold onto an asset--for example, if \nthey continue to run the family business or farm--there would be no tax \nat all. No death tax or capital-gains tax. It is only if they sell and \nrealize income from the property that a tax would be due, and then it \nwould be at the applicable capital-gains rate.\n  This simple and straightforward concept attracted a bipartisan group \nof cosponsors, including Democratic Senators Kerrey, Breaux, Robb, \nLincoln, and Wyden, and about a dozen Senators from the Republican \nside. If the President makes good on his threat to veto this tax-relief \nbill, our bipartisan initiative provides a blueprint for how we should \ndeal with the death tax in future tax legislation.\n  Mr. President, another important feature of this tax bill is its \ncapital-gains tax-rate reduction. It will reduce capital-gains tax \nrates another two percent, so that the top rate is only about two-\nthirds of where it was just a few years ago.\n  Why is another capital-gains reduction important? Let me quote \nPresident John F. Kennedy, who answered that very question: ``The \npresent tax treatment of capital gains and losses is both inequitable \nand a barrier to economic growth.'' He proposed excluding 70 percent of \ncapital gains from tax, which, if you applied the same concept today, \nwould result in a top rate of about 11.88 percent. That is lower than \nthe top rate of 18 percent proposed in the bill we have before us.\n  President Kennedy explained that ``[t]he tax on capital gains \ndirectly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk \ncapital from static to more dynamic situations, the ease or difficulty \nexperienced by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the \nstrength and potential for growth of the economy.''\n  In other words, if we are concerned about whether new jobs are being \ncreated, whether new technology is developed, whether workers have the \ntools they need to do a more efficient job, we should support measures \nthat reduce the cost of capital to facilitate the achievement of all of \nthese things. Remember, for every employee, there was an employer who \ntook risks, made investments, and created jobs. But that employer \nneeded capital to start.\n\n  President Kennedy recognized that. He recognized that our country is \nstronger and more prosperous when our people are united in support of a \ncommon goal--and that we are weaker and more vulnerable when punitive \npolicies divide Americans, group against group, whether along racial \nlines or economic lines.\n  While some politicians may employ divisive class warfare to their \npolitical advantage, President Kennedy had the courage to put good \npolicy ahead of demagogic politics. I am with him, and I support the \ncapital-gains reduction in this bill.\n  There are several other provisions that I want to mention briefly, \nbecause they, too, will help keep the economic expansion going: the \nincrease in the IRA contribution limit, the alternative minimum tax \nrelief, and the increased expensing allowance. These are things that \nwill encourage the capital formation needed to help keep the United \nStates competitive in world markets, producing jobs and better pay for \nour citizens.\n  The bill addresses the critical issue of health care as well, \nproviding an above-the-line deduction for prescription-drug insurance, \nand a 100 percent deduction, phased in over time, for health-insurance \ncosts for people not covered by employer plans.\n  We encourage savings for education by increasing the amount that \nindividuals can contribute to education savings accounts. Funds in \nthese accounts could be used for elementary and secondary education \nexpenses, in addition to higher education. The exclusion for employer-\nprovided educational assistance would be extended, and the 60-month \nlimit for deducting interest on student loans would be repealed.\n  Mr. President, a few final points before closing. Providing the tax \nrelief in this bill will not require us to use any of the Social \nSecurity surplus in any year. In fact, all of the Social Security \nsurplus will be reserved for Social Security. In all, about 75 percent \nof anticipated budget surpluses over the next decade would still be set \naside for Social Security, Medicare, and other domestic priorities, \nincluding debt reduction.\n  It is only the remaining 25 percent of the available surplus that \nwould be refunded to American taxpayers. In other words, we are \nproposing to refund just 25 cents of every surplus dollar back to the \npeople who sent it to Washington. It is a sensible and a modest \ninitiative.\n  Remember, the $792 billion in tax relief would be provided over a 10-\nyear period. If you include enough years in the calculation, of course, \nthe amount sounds large, but we are really only talking about an \naverage of $80 billion a year.\n  To put that into perspective, the federal government will collect \n$1.8 trillion this year alone. It will collect $2.7 trillion by the end \nof the 10-year period, in 2009. The amount of tax relief we are \nconsidering is very modest--not risky, not irresponsible at all, as the \nPresident would have us believe.\n  Even accounting for the proposed tax cut, the debt would be reduced \nsubstantially. The Budget Committee chairman gave us the numbers last \nweek. Publicly held debt would decline from\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\n$3.8 trillion to $900 billion by 2009. Interest costs are forecast to \ndecline from more than $200 billion annually to about $71 billion a \nyear. In fact we reduce debt and debt-service costs more than the \nPresident would in his budget, because President Clinton would spend \nnearly $1 trillion on new initiatives. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, part of the President's new spending would even be \nfunded out of the Social Security surplus.\n  To the extent that there is any surplus in the non-Social Security \npart of the budget, it is because we will have already taken care of \nthe core obligations of government--things like education, health care, \nthe environment, and defense. It is true that we may not launch some \nnew initiatives, or fund lower priority programs, but I believe it is \nappropriate to refund part of the tax overpayment to hard-working \ntaxpayers before funding new endeavors.\n  Mr. President, if a corner business did what the federal government \nis doing, it would be accused of gouging. We are charging the taxpayers \ntoo much, taking more than the government needs to fund its \nobligations. We ought to return this overpayment to the people who \nearned it, instead of thinking up new ways to spend it in Washington.\n  Mr. President, again I commend the leaders who were able to put this \npackage together. I intend to vote for it and encourage my colleagues \nto do so.\n  I yield whatever time is remaining to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support on conference \nreport on the Taxpayers Refund and Relief Act of 1999 and urge my \ncolleaguess to support it. I congratulate Senator Roth and his staff on \ngetting such a great bill to the floor of the Senate. I urge the \nPresident of the United States to reconsider his threat to veto it.\n  It is a good bill. It is responsible in its timing. It is responsible \nin its provisions. And it is definitely responsible to let the American \ntaxpayers keep a little more of their own money.\n  On the basis of fact, it is difficult to dispute the fairness or the \ntiming for a tax cut in general.\n  Federal tax rates are at an all-time, peace-time high, consuming more \nthan 20.6 percent of the Nation's economic output. That is a higher tax \nrate than any year except 1944 at the height of World War II when \nFederal taxes consumed 20.9 percent of the gross domestic product.\n  At the same time, we are anticipating record budget surpluses. The \neconomists tell us that over the next 10 years, the Federal Government \nwill take in nearly $3 trillion more than it needs. Even if we set \naside $1.9 trillion of that surplus to safeguard Social Security and \npay down the public debt, the Federal Government will still have $1 \ntrillion more than it needs over the next 10 years.\n  It is hard to imagine a more opportune or reasonable time to cut \ntaxes. Tax rates are at record highs--budget surpluses are at record \nhighs. What more do you need?\n  In a similar vein, it is difficult to dispute any of the major \nprovisions in this bill on the basis of fairness. It does a lot of good \nthings.\n  It reduces each of the personal income tax rates, which currently \nrange from 15 percent to 39.6 percent by 1 percentage point so that \nlow- and moderate-income taxpayers receive a larger real cut than those \nin higher income brackets.\n  It reduces the capital gains tax moderately and indexes capital gains \nto account for inflation. It encourages savings by increasing IRA \ncontribution limits from $2,000 to $5,000.\n  It would eliminate the odious death tax which destroys family \nbusinesses and farms. Point by point, it is difficult to portray any of \nthese provisions as radical or unfair.\n  It is also difficult to question the fairness of the bill's \nprovisions which try to eliminate the marriage penalty that exists \nunder current tax law and which forces 20 million married couples to \npay about $1,400 a year more in taxes than unmarried couples.\n  In an effort to eliminate this inequity, the Taxpayer Refund Act \nincreases the standard deduction and raises the upper limit of the 14-\npercent bracket for married couples.\n\n  The individual provisions in the tax cut bill are reasonable and \nfair.\n  Still, the President insists that a $792 billion tax cut is \nirresponsible and reckless. Even though our Republican plan sets aside \n$1.9 trillion to secure Social Security and pay down the public debt--\neven though it reserves another $277 billion to pay for Medicare reform \nor other essential services--even though the tax cuts are phased in \nslowly over 10 years, the President claims it is reckless and \nirresponsible.\n  It is easy to understand why. He wants to spend more.\n  He says cutting taxes $792 billion is reckless but he didn't have any \nqualms about proposing 81 new spending programs that would cost $1.033 \ntrillion in his budget proposal this year.\n  He clearly believes that the money belongs to the Federal \nGovernment--not the taxpayers. And he clearly plans to find ways to \nspend that surplus if given the chance. That is the big question that \nfaces the Nation right now. Whose money is it and is it more \nresponsible to give some of it back to the taxpayers than it is to \nspend it?\n  I have heard a lot about Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Allen \nGreenspan's recent testimony before a Senate Committee on which I serve \nand, admittedly, he was not overly enthusiastic about cutting taxes \nright now.\n  He would prefer that we use all the budget surplus to pay down the \ndebt. But, he also made it clear that the worst thing we could do is to \nspend the surplus on new programs. He made it clear that cutting taxes \nwould be preferable to expanding Federal spending. Our tax bill already \npays down the debt more than the President's plan and if we don't cut \ntaxes now, make no mistake about it, the President will find plenty of \nways to spend the rest of that surplus.\n  This bill simply says that when tax rates are at record highs and the \nGovernment has more money than it needs to protect Social Security and \nMedicare and to pay down the debt, the responsible thing to do is to \ngive some of that money back to the people who pay the taxes.\n  There is nothing reckless about the Republican tax cut. It protects \nSocial Security and Medicare. It reduces the debt more than the \nPresident's plan.\n  It reserves several hundred billion to pay for essential services or \nto pay the debt down even more. The timing is right. The provisions are \nfair. It simply allows the Nation's taxpayers to keep a little more of \ntheir own money.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. ROTH. I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware and \ncommend him for his outstanding work in respect to this piece of \nimportant legislation. The Republican plan is a good plan for several \nreasons, the first of which is that the Republican plan protects every \nsingle cent of the Social Security surplus. None of it is to be \nconsumed in the tax cut or in tax relief. Every penny of money from the \nSocial Security trust fund is to be protected--$1.9 trillion over 10 \nyears.\n  When the President presented his budget earlier this year he said we \nshould protect 62 percent of the Social Security trust fund. There is \nan important distinction. We would protect every cent. The President \nproposed spending $158 billion of the Social Security benefits over the \nnext 5 years. We said zero. I am happy to say he went back to the \ndrawing board. He still comes back with a plan that spends $1 trillion \nmore in 10 years, including about $30 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus, but it is closer to the Republican plan which protects Social \nSecurity. It is very important to understand the Republican plan does \nnot invade Social Security in order to have a tax cut.\n  Since Congress took Social Security off budget in 1969, the Democrats \nhave never protected every dime of Social Security surpluses, and \nfrankly neither have we until this year.\n  In addition to protecting Social Security, the Republican plan pays \ndown the national debt. What is important is that over the next 10 \nyears we will pay off almost half of the national debt. That is \nresponsible. Most homeowners do not pay off half their mortgage in 10 \nyears. On a 30-year mortgage, it takes about 15 years to get halfway \nthrough the process.\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n  Mr. President, $1.9 trillion of the $3.6 trillion in publicly held \nnational debt will be paid off. We will reduce the national debt from \n41 percent of the gross domestic product to only 14 percent of the \ngross domestic product.\n  On the other side, in contrast, they want to spend more money and \nleave Americans with a higher national debt. President Clinton's plan \nprovides $223 billion less in debt reduction than does ours.\n  The Republican plan also saves more money for Medicare. Over the next \n10 years, the Republican plan sets aside $90 billion for fixing \nMedicare, in contrast to President Clinton's new Medicare entitlement \nthat provides only $46 billion for additional funding over that period.\n  After attending to all these priorities, after setting aside Social \nSecurity, after attending to and making sure we pay down half the debt, \nrunning it down from 41 percent of the gross domestic product to 14 \npercent of the gross domestic product, the Republican plan cuts taxes \nfor every taxpayer; it cuts taxes for married couples, for savings in \nIRAs, for college education, for health care, cutting the bottom rate \nand every other rate by 1 percent.\n  In addition, the Republican plan reduces the marriage penalty for \ncouples, thanks to the outstanding work of Senator Hutchison of Texas. \nI was pleased to have joined her, along with Senator Brownback of \nKansas, in accelerating that kind of relief in our effort. The \nRepublican plan will make the standard deduction for married couples \ndouble that for singles. We will also increase the rate bracket for \nmarried couples, making it possible for them to become married couples \nwithout paying a penalty. In contrast, the President's plan and the \nDemocratic plan would spend more money on Government, leaving less \nmoney for our families.\n  If your faith is in government and in bureaucracy and your faith is \nnot in families and in our communities, then you want to sweep \nresources to Washington and spend it here. If you believe the greatness \nof America is in the families and the hearts of the American people, \nthen leaving some of their resources, which they have earned, with them \nis wise policy.\n  President Clinton's plan calls for $1 trillion more in spending over \nthe next 10 years. The American people did not balance the budget just \nso they could be the victims of more spending. Out of approximately $3 \ntrillion in total surpluses over the next 10 years, our plan devotes \nonly $792 billion, less than a quarter of the entire total surplus, to \ntax cuts. The Republican plan protects Social Security, cuts the \npublicly held debt in half, and provides needed relief to every \ntaxpayer while protecting the opportunity to reform and address the \nneeds of Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first I add my thanks and appreciation to the chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for the leadership he \nhas provided in getting a very fair, responsible, realistic, reasonable \ntax cut this far. It has been a rather remarkable achievement. It is \nthe right thing for America.\n  I rise to state my strong support for this bill. We have heard a lot \nof talk about standards of fairness, is this right, does it help \neveryone. That is a good question, an appropriate question.\n  I ask these questions: What can be more fair than an across-the-board \nreduction in marginal tax rates? Everyone who pays Federal income tax \nbenefits.\n  Let's put some perspective on this. This tax cut bill is focused on \nthose who pay taxes. It might be a revelation for some, but actually it \nis true and we acknowledge that right from the beginning. This is about \ntax relief for those who pay Federal income taxes.\n  Another relevant question is: What is more fair than ensuring people \ndo not pay more in taxes just because they are married? Was it fair \nthat we penalized married couples? No. This tax bill addresses that \nissue, and we do something about it. In fact, we make it fair.\n  Are only rich people married? I don't think so. I think a lot of \nmiddle-class people are married. I think a lot of people at the bottom \nof the economic structure who pay Federal income taxes are married. \nSurely, they will benefit from this tax bill.\n  Another question: What is more fair than making sure farmers--we have \nbeen talking about farmers all week--and small businesspeople, the \nengine of economic growth in America, don't have to sell their farms or \ntheir businesses in order to pass them on to their children so they, in \nfact, can keep farming?\n  That is fair. Are there people in the middle-class economic structure \nof America who so fit? I think so.\n  Another question: What is more fair than making sure self-employed \nindividuals have the same opportunities as big corporations when it \ncomes to deducting the cost of health insurance? I think that is rather \nfair.\n  What about this: What is more fundamentally fair than giving back to \nthe American people their money when they are paying too much in taxes, \nsay, over $3 trillion more in taxes projected over the next 10 years?\n  This bill does that. It does it fairly; it does it reasonably; it \ndoes it realistically; and it does it responsibly.\n  We have heard in this Chamber over the last few minutes some of my \ncolleagues talk about Social Security. My goodness, all responsible \nlegislators, all responsible Americans would not dare take Social \nSecurity surpluses and use those for tax cuts. We are not talking about \nthat. If the American public gets a sense that there is just a hint of \ndemagoguery in this, they might be right and they actually might be on \nto something because the fact is, this plan does not do that.\n  All Social Security surpluses are laid aside. We do not cut Medicare. \nWe do not cut into spending. We provide for the adequate national \ndefense requirements and, in fact, increase national defense spending \nover the next 10 years, veterans' benefits, and education benefits. \nThat is where every 75 cents of this $1 overpayment goes. The other 25 \ncents goes back to the taxpayer.\n  This is not theory or some abstract debate. You either favor tax cuts \nor you do not. We can all dance around this and we can confuse each \nother and say: It's not fair and it's not reasonable.\n  In the end, this place is about decisionmaking, hard choices. It is \nabout hard choices, and you either agree that we should cut taxes or \nyou do not. That is what we are going to vote on today. There are two \nclear choices: Give the American people a tax cut or keep the money in \nWashington where it surely will be spent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to register my \nstrong support and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair and thank the chairman for yielding \nme time.\n  I, too, rise, as the Senator from Nebraska just did, in strong \nsupport of returning to the American public what they have overpaid. \nAnd that, to me, is good business practice. If a business gets \noverpaid, we think they would be honest enough to see that they have \nbeen overpaid and give back the money to the person who paid more money \nthan was needed for what they were buying. In fact, if business did not \ndo that, you would think they were ripping you off.\n  It is somewhat incredible to me to imagine how the American public, \nwhen they see they are overpaying their taxes--we have more money than \nis needed to pay for the needs of Government, which are immense; $1.9 \ntrillion, some pretty big need--the American public, at least through \nthe polls, are saying: Well, keep it. We really don't need it. We don't \nreally need a tax cut. At least that is what the polls would have you \nbelieve. I do not believe that.\n  I do not believe it is good business for the Government to keep money \nthat it does not need because what the Government will do is what a \nbusiness would do. They will take it and use it to benefit themselves, \nnot benefit the customer.\n  I think that is what we are seeing happen already this year in \nWashington with the surplus projected for\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\nnext year to be some $14 billion. People are just banging down the door \nto spend that money. We spent half the surplus last night. The \nprojected surplus is half gone. If we pass the Ag appropriations bill \nin the form it passed last night, it will be half gone. My guess is the \nHouse, and others, will want to pass even more than that.\n  So what my big concern is--I think the Senator from Nebraska hit the \nnail on the head--if we leave the money here, it will be spent. It will \nnot be spent to benefit the broad economy. It will not be spent to \nbenefit the average taxpayer in America. It will be spent to benefit \nthose who are loud enough or politically powerful enough to get that \nmoney set aside for them.\n  That is not the way things should operate when, you, the taxpayer \nhave paid more than you should, that we are going to take that money \nand give it to someone who screams the loudest to get that money here \nin Washington, or who has the political clout to get that extra money \nhere in Washington. No.\n  What we have done in this modest tax relief package--everyone says \nhow big this tax relief package is. This is modest tax relief. This is \nincremental tax relief. This phases in over a 10-year period of time. \nThis is tied to meeting our surplus targets. In other words, if our \ndebt payments do not go down as projected, guess what. Most of this tax \ncut, or a big portion of it, does not even happen in the future years.\n  So what is being talked about is this calamitous idea that we are \ngoing to give all this money--this horrible thing--back to the people \nwho overpaid it. And at the same time, many are standing up saying: \nLook, we need this money to spend on all this. We need it here. Of \ncourse, the American public doesn't need it. You have more money than \nyou need back home.\n  As someone who is raising four children, and one due in a month and a \nhalf, I can tell you that raising a family is very expensive. I am not \ntoo sure anybody would, if you think about it, mind having a couple \nextra hundred dollars to be able to do some things to help them and \ntheir family.\n  That is what we are talking about. It is not a huge tax cut. I wish \nit were. I wish we could reduce taxes more, give more surplus back. I \nwish we could cut Government spending, pare down the growth of this \nGovernment. But we are not even talking about that. We are talking \nabout letting Government continue to increase its spending, letting the \nentitlement programs continue to flourish, and just giving a little bit \nof what is overpaid back.\n  I am excited about this particular package. There are lots of goods \nthings in this package--reductions in rates, the marriage penalty tax \nrelief, and one particular provision I want to speak about for a minute \nor two is the American Community Renewal Act.\n  The American Community Renewal Act was not in the bill that passed in \nthe Senate. I entered into a colloquy with Senator Roth, and he agreed \nhe would look at what was included in the House package. He did. And \nincluded in this bill out of conference is a bill that does not just \nprovide tax relief, which is what we talked about, but a provision that \nhelps those people in poor inner-city and rural communities who are not \nbeing lifted by the rising tide of this economy with incentives, such \nas the zero capital gains tax within these renewal communities.\n  One hundred of them would be designated. Twenty percent of them at \nleast would have to be in rural areas, with a zero capital gains rate \nto help businesses start in those communities; to provide help for home \nownership; expensing of businesses would be increased; wage credits; \nreal powerful incentives for employment opportunities to happen within \nthese communities, housing opportunities to happen within these \ncommunities, to see a real transformation, using, again, the private \nsector, not public-sector programs, not the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, but, in fact, private sector incentives for private \nsector development and home ownership, which is the real key to success \nin America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the chairman for including that in the bill \ntoday.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in a few hours we are going to cast a very important \nvote to return tax overpayments to working Americans. The passage of \nthe conference report of the Taxpayer Reform Act will signal a clear \nvictory for all Americans. I commend the Senate Republican leadership \nand especially Chairman Roth for their strong commitment to major tax \nrelief in this Congress.\n  We promised to return to American families the non-Social Security \ntax overcharges they paid to the Government, and today we are going to \nfulfill that solemn promise. We can now proudly declare that: promises \nmade are promises kept.\n  The proposed tax relief significantly reduces taxes for millions of \nAmerican families and individuals and immediately eases working \nAmericans' tax burden and allows them to keep a little more of their \nown money, again, for their own family's priorities.\n  The American people have every reason to celebrate this victory \nbecause they are the winners in this debate on tax cuts.\n  This tax relief is a victory for all Americans, particularly the \nmiddle-class, who will receive a $800 billion tax refund over the next \n10 years.\n  It is a victory for millions of Minnesotans because each family in my \nstate of Minnesota is expected to receive $8,000 in tax relief over 10 \nyears.\n  It is a victory for the 22 million American couples who will no \nlonger be penalized by the marriage penalty tax, because we completely \neliminate this unfair tax.\n  It is a victory for millions of farmers and small business owners \nbecause this tax relief enables them to pass their hard-earned legacies \nto their children without being subject to the cruel death tax.\n  It is a victory for millions of self-employed and uninsured because \nhealth care is made more affordable to them with full tax benefits.\n  It is a victory for millions of baby-boomers because the pension \nreform allows them to set aside more money for their retirement.\n  It is a victory for millions of entrepreneurs and investors because \nthe capital gains tax is reduced to stimulate the economy.\n  It is also a victory for millions of parents, students, teachers, and \nworkers because higher and better education will be available and \naffordable with a variety of tax benefits included in this package.\n  By any standard, the working men and women of this country are the \nwinners, not Washington.\n  Moreover, in my judgment, this tax relief plan is a highly sensible, \nresponsible and prudent one. It reflects American values and is based \non sound tax and fiscal policy. It comes at the right time for working \nAmericans.\n  We must recall that Americans have long been overtaxed, and millions \nof middle-class families cannot even make ends meet due to the growing \ntax burden. They are desperately in need of the largest tax relief \npossible.\n  The budget surplus comes directly from income tax increases. These \noverpaid taxes are taken from American workers and they have every \nright to get it all back.\n  This tax relief takes only a small portion of the total budget \nsurplus. In fact, only 23 cents of every dollar of the budget surplus \ngoes for tax relief.\n  After providing this 23 cent tax relief, we have reserved enough \nbudget surplus to protect Social Security and to reform Medicare, \nincluding prescription drug coverage for needy seniors. We further \nreduce the national debt and reserve funding for essential federal \nprograms.\n  Contrary to Mr. Clinton's rhetoric that tax relief will cause \nrecession, cutting taxes will keep our economy strong, will create \njobs, increase savings and productivity, forestall a recession and \nproduce more tax revenues. Somehow, he believes that if Americans spend \nthe money, it is bad, but if it is left here for Washington to spend, \nit is good. History has proved again and again that tax cuts work. It \nwill prove this tax relief is a sound one as well.\n  I am also pleased that this tax relief does not come at the expense \nof seniors. We have locked in every penny of the $1.9 trillion Social \nSecurity surplus over the next 10 years, not for government programs, \nnot for tax cuts, but\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\nexclusively to protect all Americans' retirement.\n  We have been working hard to reform Medicare to ensure it will be \nthere for seniors. Prescription drug coverage for the needy will be \npart of our commitment to seniors to protect their Medicare benefits. \nHad the White House and Democrats cooperated with us, we could have \nfixed Medicare by now. The President discounted his own commission on \nMedicare reform.\n  In any event, we will continue our effort to preserve Medicare as \nChairman Roth reveals his Medicare bill in the near future.\n  We have reduced the national debt and will continue to dramatically \nreduce it. Debt held by the public will decrease to $0.9 trillion by \n2009. The interest payment to service the debt will drop from $229 \nbillion in 1999 to $71 billion in 2009. We will eliminate the entire \ndebt held by the public by 2012.\n  As I indicated before, we have not ignored spending needs to focus on \ntax cuts as has been charged. We not only have funded all the functions \nof the government, but also significantly increased funding for our \nbudget priorities, such as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture \nand others.\n  In fact, we set aside over $505 billion in non-Social Security \nsurplus to meet these needs. This proves we can provide $792 billion in \ntax relief while not ignoring other important priorities.\n  This major tax relief does not come at the expense of seniors, \nfarmers, women, children or any other deserving group.\n  On the contrary, it benefits all Americans and keeps our economy \nstrong. And most importantly, this tax relief will give every working \nAmerican more freedom to decide what's best for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks by citing President Reagan \nwho once said: ``Every major tax cut in this century has strengthened \nthe economy, generated renewed productivity, and ended up yielding new \nrevenues for the government by creating new investment, new jobs and \nmore commerce among our people.''\n  President Reagan was right. This tax relief will do the same.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have done our job, and it is up to President \nClinton to decide if he wants to give back the tax overpayments to \nAmerican families or spend them to expand the government.\n  In Buffalo, NY, earlier this year, the President said: If we give the \nmoney back to the American people, what if they don't spend it right? \nIn other words, the President looked down his nose at working Americans \nand said they are too dumb to spend their money right. They are smart \nenough to earn it, not smart enough to spend it. I hope the President \nwill trust the American people and make the right decision.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Financial Freedom Act \nof 1999. This bill represents the third prong in our plan to restore \nfinancial security to America's families. Along with saving Social \nSecurity and reducing the national debt, the Financial Freedom Act of \n1999 marks another significant chapter in our continuing effort to \nbring stability to our national budget and financial discipline to \nCongress.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nfor his unwavering determination to provide greater financial freedom \nto America's families. Let there be no doubt about what we are debating \ntoday. We are debating whether we should return part of the overpayment \nby the taxpayers to the taxpayers, true overpayment. As an accountant, \nI am particularly concerned with that. We need to return the \noverpayment to the people who made the overpayment.\n  Or should we keep it in Washington to fund President Clinton's new \nbureaucracies and unproven Government programs? I am not talking about \nfunding adequately the ones we have. I am talking about brand new ones \nthat will require continuing additional funds. The choice is between \ntax relief and new spending, plain and simple.\n  I, for one, believe it is time to reward the ingenuity and hard work \nof our taxpayers by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. \nThe Financial Freedom Act provides tax relief over the next 10 years \nwith cutoffs if the surplus doesn't materialize. By phasing those tax \ncuts in over 10 years, this demonstration assures the American people \nthat the money dedicated to Social Security will only be used for \nSocial Security. Moreover, by making the majority of the broad-based \nacross-the-board tax reduction contingent on reducing the national \ndebt, this bill makes a real commitment to reducing the Federal debt \nand forces Congress to live within its means.\n  This legislation not only reduces the overall tax burden but reduces \nall the marginal income tax rates, beginning with the lowest rate and \nincreasing the ceiling on the new 14-percent bracket. This plan will \nreduce much of the damage imposed by President Clinton's mammoth tax \nhike of 1993 and by the bracket creep that millions of Americans have \nexperienced as a result of job and wage growth over the past 10 years. \nThis broad-based reduction, which is the backbone of the act, would \nprovide tax relief for all taxpayers. Let me repeat that: Anyone who \nnow pays Federal income tax will see their bill go down as a result of \nthe 1-percent marginal rate decrease in each and every marginal tax \nrate.\n  Moreover, this tax cut is especially aimed at the middle class. By \nincreasing the income limits of the new 14-percent bracket by $2,000 \nfor single filers, millions of Americans will see their tax bill \nreduced by $400 per year by this provision alone.\n  In addition to reducing all the marginal rates for taxpayers, the \nFinancial Freedom Act eliminates one of the most egregious effects of \nour current Tax Code--the marriage penalty. We have heard a lot of talk \nabout supporting the fundamental institution of marriage. This bill \nallows us to put our money where our mouths are by doubling the \nstandard deduction and doubling the income limits of the new 14-percent \ntax bracket, bringing our tax policy in line with the rhetoric. If you \nare serious about helping the financial needs of millions of married \ncouples across the country, you will support this legislation.\n\n  It also reforms our Tax Code and our tax policy by eliminating the \ninfamous death tax. We encourage savings and thrift, and we provide \nmuch-needed relief for millions of ranchers, farmers, and small \nbusinessmen around the country, people who at the time of death will \nhave to end their family business. As a small businessman who worked \nwith my wife and three children selling shoes to our neighbors and \nfriends in several Wyoming towns, I know firsthand how difficult the \nchoices can be when you have to make that kind of a decision. The \ncurrent tax on death punishes countless small businesses and farm and \nranch families.\n  I congratulate, again, the people who have put together this, the \ncooperation there has been between the House and the Senate, the \noutstanding work of providing a balanced picture of tax relief to the \nAmerican people while assuring that we can save Social Security, help \nMedicare, and pay down the national debt.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee for giving us tax relief for the hard-working American \nfamily.\n  We have heard a lot of debate in this Chamber in the last few hours, \nbut it comes down to a very simple issue, and that is whether we are \nfor giving the people who earn the money the right to decide how to \nspend it. It comes down to one basic issue. We are for tax cuts, and I \nthink the question is, Is the President for tax cuts? He campaigned \nsaying he was for tax cuts for middle-income people, but the President \nhas not supported tax cuts yet.\n  In fact, the major area of tax policy that the President gave us was \nthe largest increase in the history of America. We are trying to cut \nback on those tax increases because we have a surplus and because we \nbelieve that the surplus should be shared with the people who gave it \nto us in the first place.\n  A lot has been said about Social Security and whether we are going to \nmaintain the stability of Social Security. The answer is emphatically, \nwe are; $2 trillion will come in over the next 10 years in Social \nSecurity surplus. The Republican plan that is before us today totally \nkeeps that $2 trillion for Social Security stability.\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\n  The other $1 trillion in surplus over the next 10 years is in income \ntax surplus, withholding surplus, people's hard-earned money that they \nhave sent to Washington in too great a quantity. It is that $1 trillion \nthat we are talking about. We are talking about giving 25 cents per \ndollar of that trillion back to the people who earn it, and we think \nthat is not only fair; it is required.\n  I worked very hard with Senator Ashcroft and Senator Brownback to \neliminate the marriage tax penalty. This bill does it. We double the \nstandard deduction so that people will not have a penalty because they \nget married. And, most of all, the people who need it the most are \ngoing to have total elimination of the tax on marriage. That is the \nschoolteacher and the nurse who get married and all of a sudden are in \na double bracket, from 15 percent to 28 percent. One earns $25,000, the \nother earns $33,000, and together they go into the 28-percent bracket \ntoday. This bill eliminates that from the Tax Code forever, period--\ngone.\n  The President has said he is going to veto that tax relief, and I \ndon't understand it.\n  Let me talk about what it does for women. Of course, the marriage \npenalty tax hurts women. But we also know that women live longer and \nthey have smaller pensions. They have smaller pensions because women go \nin and out of the workplace, and they lose the ability to have that \ngrowth in geometric proportions in their pensions. That has been an \ninequity for women in our country. We eliminate that in this bill, or \nat least we try. We help by allowing women over 50 who come back into \nthe workplace to be able to set aside 50 percent more in their pensions \nto start catching up. So where most people--all of us--have a $10,000 \nlimit on a 401(k), a woman over 50 who comes back into the workforce \nafter raising her children will be able to have a $15,000 set-aside in \nher 401(k). We also give help on IRAs.\n  It is very important to a woman who is going to live longer to have \nequal pension rights because she is more likely to have children, raise \nher children, maybe through the 1st grade or maybe through the 12th \ngrade. We want to make sure we equalize that and recognize it. We have \ndone that. Yet the President says he is going to veto this bill.\n  We have tax credits in this bill for those who would take care of \ntheir elderly parents, or an elderly relative, because we know one of \nthe hardest things families face is how to take care of an elderly \nrelative who doesn't want to go into a nursing home. Families would \nlike to keep them. Sometimes they don't even want to do that, but long-\nterm care is so expensive that they can't afford it. So we have credits \nfor long-term care insurance, and we have credits for those who would \ncare for their elderly parents.\n  So this bill lowers capital gains, lowers the death tax; it gives a \nbenefit to everyone. The working people of this country deserve it. I \nhope the Senate will pass it. I hope the President will sign it and \nmake good on all of our pledges to give the working people of this \ncountry relief.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the Senator from \nDelaware, for his excellent work on crafting this compromise package \nand putting it together. I think it is a substantial bill of support \nfor the American public. We need to give this money back to the \nAmerican public for overpaying their taxes.\n  I rise in strong support of the conference report being considered \ntoday. This important bill provides broad-based tax relief to America's \nfamilies and returns their tax overpayment to them in the form of a tax \nreduction. It is important that Congress return this money to the \nAmerican people and allow them to do with it what they see fit.\n  I am particularly pleased to join in this effort on the elimination \nof the marriage penalty. The Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, has \nled this effort, along with Senator Ashcroft. This bill does important \nwork on eliminating the marriage penalty tax and reducing that \npernicious impact on our society. The American people need to get this \nrebate. I think we can do more and better with it than the Government \ncan.\n  The conference report before us takes important steps, as I stated, \ntoward eliminating the marriage penalty. It doubles the standard \ndeduction, as well as widening the tax brackets, which does much to \nalleviate that terrible impact that the marriage penalty has on \nAmerica's families. It impacts nearly 21 million American couples in \nthis country.\n  Doubling the standard deduction helps families. Our families \ncertainly need help. I am, therefore, pleased that the conferees kept \nthis provision, and I am hopeful that the President will sign the \nconference report and provide America's families with this important \ntax relief which they clearly deserve and clearly need.\n\n  Congress has drafted a tax bill. Now it will be up to the President. \nThis session, Congress utilized its opportunity to provide for \ncomprehensive tax relief. It has done that. Now the President must make \nuse of this unique opportunity to help eliminate the marriage penalty.\n  It affects so many couples in our country--21 million--by forcing \nthem to pay, on average, an additional $1,400 in taxes a year. The \nGovernment should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to erode \nthe foundation of our society.\n  We should support the sacred institution and the sacred bonds of \nmarriage. Marriage in America certainly is in enough trouble the way it \nis, and it doesn't need to be penalized by the Government. According to \na recent report out of Rutgers University, marriage is already in a \nstate of decline. From 1960 to 1996, the annual number of marriages per \n1,000 adult women declined by almost 43 percent.\n  Now, when marriage as an institution breaks down, children do suffer. \nThe past few decades have seen a huge increase in out-of-wedlock births \nand divorce, the combination of which has substantially had an overall \nimpact on the well-being of our children in many ways. It has affected \nevery family in this country. People struggle, and they try to help to \nsupport the family and the children as much as they can. But this \ninstitution of marriage has had great difficulty. In my own family, \nthere has been difficulty as well. The Government should not tax \nmarriage and further penalize it. There is a clear maxim of Government \nthat if you want less of something, tax it; if you want more of \nsomething, subsidize it. Well, we don't want less of marriage. We \nshould not tax it.\n  Study after study has shown that children do best when they can grow \nup in a stable home environment, with two loving, caring parents who \nare committed to each other through marriage. Newlyweds face enough \nchallenges without paying punitive damages in the form of a marriage \ntax. The last thing the Government should do is penalize the \ninstitution that is foundational in this civil society.\n  This year we change that. The new budget estimates, from both the \nOffice of Management and Budget and CBO, show higher-than-expected \nsurplus revenue, even after accounting for Social Security. Of course, \nfor some, this is no surprise. We have known all along that growth does \nwork. It helps and it works. Of course, the surging surplus is as a \nresult of nonpayroll tax receipts. It is really a tax overpayment to \nthe Government in personal income and capital gains tax. We must give \nthe American people the growth rebate they deserve and return the \noverpayment. I believe we can, and must, start--and start now--to rid \nthe American people of the marriage tax penalty. I look forward to \nworking with the Chairman, as well as other colleagues, to make sure we \nget this job done.\n  In closing, this is a day we should celebrate. We are able to do \nsomething that sends a strong signal of support to families across this \ncountry, which is critically important to do. Yes, this has an impact \noverall, but I think it is a very positive impact to send that sort of \nsignal to our struggling young families across this country. I think we \nclearly should do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the pleasure to yield 15 minutes \nto the distinguished Senator Lautenberg, my neighbor and friend from \nNew Jersey, followed by 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask whether or not the Senator from South Dakota \nwould like to go first.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I say to the Senator that I am certainly prepared to go \nat this time. But I would accommodate my friend.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest that he go first.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I reverse my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank my friend from New Jersey.\n  Our Nation deserves a thoughtful tax and budget plan from Congress \nthat places an emphasis on paying down our existing accumulated \nnational debt, while protecting Social Security and Medicare, and \ninvesting in key domestic priorities and providing targeted tax relief \nfor middle-class and working families.\n  On the marriage penalty, for instance, most families in America get a \nmarriage tax bonus, not a penalty. But for those who are penalized, we \ncan address that in the Democratic plan while approaching this in a \nbalanced fashion. But, sadly, the radical tax cut bill being considered \nby congressional Republicans could be described as simply ``foolish,'' \nwere it not so seriously dangerous to the future prosperity and \nsecurity of every American family.\n  There are obvious reasons why even leading Republican economists so \nvigorously are condemning this irresponsible bill, and why it has \nbecome the butt of so much ridicule.\n  First, the bill assumes that a $964 billion surplus over that needed \nfor Social Security will absolutely materialize over the coming decades \nwhile our budget estimators in the past haven't even been able to \nestimate the economic growth over a year much less over 10 years. \nCommon sense tells us that we should be careful about committing to use \nmoney that we do not yet have and may never have.\n  Second, this plan fails to use even a cent of the supposed $1 \ntrillion surplus above Social Security to help pay down the $3.7 \ntrillion public debt that our Nation currently owes. Paying down our \ndebts would do more to keep the American economy growing than any other \nsingle thing the Government could do.\n  Third, in order to find room for a $792 billion tax cut, we would \nhave to not only pay down the accumulated debt but we would have to cut \ndefense buying power by 17 percent and domestic programs, meaning law \nenforcement, VA, health, education, school construction, medical \nresearch, national parks, and so on by 23 percent over the coming 10 \nyears. If we decline to cut defense, under this plan we then would have \nto cut these domestic initiatives by an outrageous 38 percent. What is \neven worse is that this tax bill is cynically constructed so that the \ndrain on the Treasury will explode and triple in cost during the second \ndecade after passage.\n\n  Fourth, economic experts all over the country tell us that this tax \npackage would cause interest rates to go up. At the current time, the \nFederal Reserve is raising interest rates and warning us that putting \none foot on the gas and one foot on the brake is not a sensible \neconomic policy for our country.\n  The small tax cut that most Americans would receive would be negated \nthrough higher costs for financing everything from a house, to a car, \nto college education, to business expansion, and farming and ranching \noperations. If this bill becomes law, our middle-class families will \nwind up with fewer and not more dollars in their pockets.\n  Fifth, this bill does absolutely nothing to prolong the life of \nMedicare much less provide for drug coverage payment reform that \nhospitals and clinics and medical institutions all over our country are \nin dire need of securing.\n  Specifically, this legislation outrageously provides an average \n$22,500 tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. But a \ntypical American family--a family in my State of South Dakota with an \nincome of $38,000--would get a couple of bucks a week while paying \nhigher interest costs for everything they buy.\n  Wouldn't it make more sense to use a large portion of any surplus \nthat actually materializes to pay down the accumulated national debt \nand then provide for targeted tax relief for middle-class and working \nfamilies, protect Social Security and Medicare, and make some key \ninvestments in education, in the environment, infrastructure, and the \nthings that we need to continue the economic growth in America?\n  I yield the remainder of time that I may have to my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I obviously oppose this Republican tax \nbill. I am going to explain why in a minute.\n  But I would like to start off by using an expression that we heard \nkind of invented around here, and that is: There they go again. There \nthey go again. Or: There you go again.\n  The party that claims that its mission is fiscal responsibility has, \nonce again, resorted to tax cuts to establish its role in fiscal \nmanagement.\n  I find it shocking. I must tell you that we suddenly wanted to \ndistribute a tax cut, which everybody likes to do. Make no mistake \nabout it. I heard the President this morning say: After we finish \nsecuring Social Security and securing some extra longevity for \nMedicare, then we ought to distribute some tax cuts to people.\n  But if you ask anybody who has a mortgage--and most people I know \nhave one--whether they would like to get rid of the mortgage before \nthey do anything else, if they had a choice, they would take the \nmortgage relief. I will tell you that. They would say: Look, that is \nthe one thing that bedevils us, and especially if the mortgage lives on \nbeyond their existence on Earth, and it passes on to their children and \ntheir grandchildren. They would say: Look, let's get rid of that \nmortgage.\n  That is what we are talking about. We are all mortgagees in common \nwhen it comes to the national debt. We owe it. My kids owe it. My \ngrandchildren will owe it if we don't get rid of that debt.\n  What is proposed by the Democrats is that we pay down the debt, that \nwe have a target of 15 years to get rid of all the public debt. It \nwould be unheard of in contemporary terms, and maybe in historical \nterms as well, because I don't think there is any country in the world \nthat has any advancement that would find itself without significant \ndebt outside the government. But that is what is being proposed.\n\n  Here we are. We want to give a tax break. And it works like this: The \ntop 1 percent of wage earners who average $800,000-plus a year would \nget a $45,000 tax cut--just under $46,000. The person who works hard \nand struggles to keep their family intact, who struggles to keep \nopportunity available for their children's education and training and \nearns $38,000 a year, is going to get about 40 cents a day in tax \nrelief. This fellow who earns over $800,000 is going to get a $45,000 \ntax break.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side say, well, they pay most \nof it; why shouldn't they get most of it? Why? Because what difference \ndoes it make in the life of someone earning $800,000 and some a year \nwhether they get a $45,000 tax cut? I am not saying they shouldn't get \nanything, but it sure doesn't compare with the impact that it has when \nyou take $157 and you give it to someone earning $38,000. It doesn't do \nmuch for them at all.\n  It permits this guy to buy a new boat, maybe even to make a \ndownpayment on a second home. But to the other people who are \nstruggling, often two-wage earners in the family, struggling to manage \nthe future, it is impossible if you make $38,000 a year and you have a \ncouple of kids.\n  The Republican plan is now stripped down to its bare essentials. It \nsays to raid Social Security if we must to give this tax cut, and don't \npay any attention to Medicare, while people all over this country worry \nabout their health care. Over 40 million of them have no health \ninsurance at all. We are talking about Medicare and the sensitivity of \nappropriate health care for people who are in their advanced years.\n  Our Republican friends are saying: Don't worry about Medicare. Maybe \nwe will find a way to take care of it one day. Or Social Security: \nWell, if it expires--I guess that is what they are saying--we will have \nto deal with it.\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\n  Just think. With all of this robust economy and the surpluses that we \nhave, the Republican tax plan says this: That in a mere 6 years we will \nbe dipping into the Social Security surplus--6 years. With all the \npromises about the $2 trillion that is going to go into Social Security \nbecause it is earned there, it will start to be decimated within 6 \nyears under the Republican tax plan.\n  I hope the message that goes out of here is that we are two different \nphilosophies on how we ought to treat our treasure trough because we \nhave been smart but we also have been lucky. We are lucky that we live \nin a country that is as rich in resources and talent and opportunity as \nis America. But, at the same time, it took a lot of work to plan for \nthis. It took President Clinton's leadership when he arrived in office. \nDeficits were $290 billion a year--much of that attributed to the \nleadership of President Reagan who made a decision, in all due respect, \nthat tax cuts were the most important thing in the world and cut taxes \nall over the place while he borrowed from the public to finance it. \nWhat was the result? Inflation out of sight, and a lot of joblessness \nas well. We don't want to do that again. We should have learned. We are \nsmart enough to have learned it the first time we saw it.\n\n  What will happen now? Beginning 6 years hence in 2005, Social \nSecurity starts to decline at a time when a lot of baby boomers arrive \nat retirement age. It could force inflation upon us and cost more for \nborrowing. Whether for a house mortgage, an automobile, appliance, \npeople would be paying more.\n  One of the most astounding things I find, all Members hover around \nAlan Greenspan because he has been so clever in the way he has managed \nhis share of the economic policy in this country. We listen to every \nword. I know him well. He used to be on the board of my company when I \nwas chairman of the company. We would listen carefully to his advice \nbecause it was so profound, so deep, so insightful. The Republican \nmessage is, ignore what Alan Greenspan says about the timing not being \nright; forget that he has warned Members in the Budget Committee--and I \nam the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee--that tax cuts are not \nthe best way to go. He said rather than having an outright spending \nbinge, maybe tax cuts, the best thing to do is pay down the debt.\n  The message rings loud and clear. I am shocked that the wise heads \nwho exist on the other side of this aisle don't understand that the \nrisk they are taking is our economy at large. When we look at the \nprojections and we hear what the Republicans are using to finance this \ntax cut--almost $800 billion direct in higher costs as a result of the \ninterest on the remaining debt--it just doesn't make economic sense. It \nis not fair to our citizens to see the guys at the top, the people at \nthe top who make all the money, get these incredible bonuses in tax \ncuts while the person who struggles to keep food on the table and a \nroof over their head gets a measly 40 cents a day in their tax cut.\n  What will happen? What will happen is, tax cuts will come along if \nthings go as they are, unless the President has the courage to step up \nand say, no, the American people don't want this; that is not their \npreference. Everybody wants to pay less in tax, but they want a stable \nsociety, a stable economy. They don't want their kids saddled with \nobligations in the future.\n  This tax cut will also mean we will cut deeply into programs. We will \ncut education by 40 percent. Will we cut veterans' programs? The \nveterans now are screaming in pain because they are not being taken \ncare of as they should be or as we promised they would be when they \nwere recruited.\n  Cut the FBI by 40 percent? Thank goodness we have trained FBI people. \nIt is hard enough to recruit. Now we are talking of cutting 40 percent \nwhile we still have a significant crime problem in our country, despite \nprosperity? I don't think so.\n  Will they cut border guards? Are we going to try to hold back the \ntide of illegal immigration, with fewer people to do it? That is what \nthe result will be.\n  The truth of the matter is, they are talking about a surplus that is \nlargely imaginary. It is forecasting; it is anticipated; it is hoped \nfor. That, enacted into legislation, will make an enormous difference. \nOnce the tax cut plan is in place, that is mandatory. However, the \nsurpluses are hoped for, anticipated.\n  We have to alert the public what is going on. It will be a tax cut \nthat will be talked about as a Republican accomplishment. I make a \nprediction--and I wish we could look inside everybody's thinking--that \nthe Republicans know very well that this tax cut cannot go through, but \nwhat they want to do is have a speaking platform. They want politics, \nnot policy. They want everybody to believe they are the only ones who \nare thinking about the average working person. The fact is, they are \nthinking about themselves because they know the President is committed \nto veto this. They know the economy could not stand this kind of a cut.\n\n  Imagine cutting those programs and saying to the American people: We \nhave to take 40 percent from various programs, and we will not do a \nthing to extend the solvency of Social Security, not do a thing about \nMedicare; when it dries up, it dries up, friends, in 2015. If you are \nat an age when Medicare will be important to you, don't count on it. \nYou had better save your money because you will have to take care of \nyourself on that score.\n  In Medicare, the cuts would exceed $10 billion a year. Medicare cuts \nare squeezing many hospitals and other health care providers.\n  In sum, the game is over. We will be voting at a later time today. We \nhave the disadvantage of being in the minority. It is not my preferred \nposition, but the facts are there. The President is our last hope \nbecause the Republicans have decided that no matter what, they are \ngoing to give a tax break. No matter what the advice is, no matter what \nthe inequity is, no matter what programs are cut, no matter what we do \nto veterans' care, no matter what we do to Head Start, no matter what \nwe do to education generally, it doesn't matter.\n  They say a tax cut is the most important thing on our agenda. The \nnumbers are there, and the votes are there. We will lose this one. I \nbelieve it is possible some of our Republican friends will see the \nlight and say, this is no time to do a roughly $800 billion tax cut, \nbut it is time to continue to pay down our debt, improve our financial \ncondition, and help preserve Medicare and Social Security for future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nJersey on a forceful argument.\n  I now have the pleasure to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota and 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am happy to allow the Senator from \nConnecticut to go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Connecticut \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  I rise to oppose this conference report and the $800 billion tax cut \nit contains. I do not rise reflexively. In fact, my reflex, similar to \nmost of my colleagues, is to support tax cuts, not to oppose them.\n  I was proud just 2 years ago to be a lead cosponsor, for instance, of \nthe cut in the capital gains tax and to support so many of the \ninitiatives of the chairman of the Finance Committee in encouraging \nsavings. However, I am going to oppose this tax cut as I would tax cuts \nat any time when they were not needed to help our economy, not \njustified by the availability of money to support the tax cut. These \nare similar arguments I made against the reconciliation bill, this tax \ncut, when it was before the Senate last week.\n  It reappears as a conference report. It is essentially the same. The \nchairs have been shuffled on this Titanic, but the fact remains that \nthis big luxury liner of a tax cut is headed for an iceberg. It may \nwell take the American economy down with it. The iceberg here is the \ncold, hard reality that there is no surplus to pay for the cut that \nthis enacts. In fact, this Congress, in an act of legislative \nschizophrenia, is on one side saying there is a surplus, beginning with \nnext year, that justifies this tax cut; on the other side, through \nfictional emergency appropriations, through double counting, through \noverspending, is spending more than the surplus projected for next \nyear. So that\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\nthe reality is that ``there is no there there.'' There is no surplus \nthere to pay for this tax cut.\n\n  My colleagues cite the Congressional Budget Office saying there will \nbe, for instance, a $14 billion surplus next year and almost $1 \ntrillion over the 10 years. But, as has been said on the floor, CBO, \nafter making those surplus projections, also issued a report which \nmakes very clear that they are based on Congress exercising self-\ncontrol, the kind of self-control over spending we are showing each day \nof this session we are unable to exercise.\n  If you take the $1 trillion surplus the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated and then simply assume that Congresses over the next 10 years \nspends only the amount of money to operate our Government that we are \nspending this year, in 1999, adjusted only for inflation--real \ndollars--then that projected surplus of $1 trillion suddenly becomes \n$46 billion. What does it require to hold the $1 trillion surplus? Cuts \nin spending that we all know are untenable. They are not going to \nhappen. This Congress, and no Congress over the next decade, would \nenact them.\n  I am privileged to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I \nthink in that capacity I have learned some about the needs of our \nnational security and our military, our defense. To achieve the $1 \ntrillion surplus and live within the caps that currently exist would \nrequire cuts in defense spending over the next decade of approximately \n$200 billion. We cannot fulfill our constitutional responsibility to \nprovide for the common defense of the United States of America over the \nnext decade with $200 billion in cuts.\n  I have too much confidence in my colleagues who serve today, as well \nas those who will serve over the next decade, to believe we would ever \nso jeopardize our security. It is just another way of saying the \nsurplus projections are not real, and therefore enacting a tax cut \nwhich will not be backed up by available revenue will take America back \ndown the road to a deficit before we hardly have had a chance to even \nappreciate the possibilities of a surplus.\n  Let us remember also a $1 trillion surplus estimate is based not only \non a capacity in Congress to cut spending that we have clearly shown \nalready in this session we do not possess because it is based on a \nprojection of continued 2.4-percent growth in our economy over the next \ndecade, extending what is already the longest peacetime growth in an \neconomy in our history. Just look at the news in the last week or two \nand consider the probability that we will continue to grow over this \nnext 10 years, unimpeded by the world and events in the world. The \nvalue of the dollar has weakened in recent weeks, creating great alarm \nin other industrialized democracies, particularly in Europe and Japan, \nour close allies, for fear of what that will do to their economies, and \nalso for fear of what that will do to the foreign dollars that are \ncurrently invested in our economy that may be withdrawn and the \nconsequences that would have for our economy.\n  Have you been following the stock market in recent days and watching \nthe extraordinary gyrations in the American market which show \nunderlying unease? Do we want to put into that situation a large tax \ncut, a tax cut of this immense size that will further threaten \ninflation and instability in our economy? Why? Why take the risk? \nFiscal responsibility helped to bring our economy to the point it is \ntoday: An unprecedented combination of high growth, low unemployment, \nlow inflation. Why risk it all for a tax cut that is not needed to \nstimulate the economy and not demanded by the people of the United \nStates of America?\n\n  I think we have to be conscious of how our fiscal actions affect the \nvery global economy which helps to give us our strength. We are the \nonly G-7 country running a budget surplus today. We are the only \nleading industrial economy that is positioned to deal with the global \ndemographic challenge of retiring baby boomers, if we discipline \nourselves. As Asia and South America struggle through economic \ndifficulties, we must remember that any sign of economic instability \nhere could trigger an economic crisis there that will come back to bite \nus. We must have a strong economy. We have one now. Why jeopardize it? \nWhy encumber it with debt? Why not save this money, pay down the debt, \nstore it up to weather any economic crisis that may come our way?\n  There are times when I think of the famous Biblical story where \nJoseph advised Pharaoh in good times to put some away because good \ntimes would not last forever. I think we are in such a time now so we \ndare not let the cows and corn absorb themselves, as occurred in \nJoseph's dream.\n  The result, I fear, is by passing a major tax cut, one paid by an \nimaginary surplus, we would incur sizable debts for years to come. \nBesides the effects on the financial markets and on our economy, we \nwould leave little or no money available for building the solvency of \nMedicare and Social Security and thus raise the specter of a major tax \nincrease down the line when we will least be able to afford it to \ncompensate for our profligacy now.\n  Finally, as has been said, I think anybody who has been following \nwhat Chairman Greenspan has been saying does not have to pick at the \ntea leaves. It has been very clear. If we cut taxes to this size now, \nthe Federal Reserve will increase interest rates soon after. That will \nhelp to depress the economy and also hit average working Americans \nliterally where they live, driving up the cost of their mortgages, \ntheir car payments, their credit card bills, and student loans to the \npoint it would dwarf any tax benefit they might receive from this \nconference report.\n  I present as evidence an analysis done for Business Week magazine by \nRegional Financial Associates of West Chester, PA, which says that \nwiping out the debt, the national debt, by 2014 would raise the \neconomy's growth rate by more than one-quarter of 1 percent at the end \nof the 15 years, and that real annual household income would grow by \n$1,500. That is more than three times, this study shows, what a tax cut \nof this size would boost the GDP and household income. A tax cut such \nas the one passed in the House, according to this study, would raise \nhousehold income by $400; whereas paying down the debt would raise \nhousehold income by $1,500.\n  So I will vote against the conference report and say when the \nPresident vetoes this bill he will not just be making another smart \npartisan political move in a political chess game; he will be saving \nthe American economy from real damage.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come and visit on the proposal \non the floor briefly. I was trying to think of a word to describe all \nof this, and I was thinking of a story I had heard about Daniel Boone, \nwho was a great Kentucky backwoodsman.\n  He was most at home in the backwoods and known for his long hunts, \ntraipsing through the backwoods of Kentucky without a compass. He was \nasked once if he had ever been lost. Daniel Boone said: No, I can't say \nI was ever lost, but I was bewildered once for 3 days.\n  I thought of that term ``bewildered.'' I cannot think of anything \nthat better describes my reaction to conservatives bringing a plan to \nthe floor of the Senate that is so unconservative and so risky for this \ncountry. It is enough to bewilder the entire country, to see people who \nsay they are conservatives decide that it is not their intent to help \npay down the national debt during good economic times, it is not their \nintent to try to conduct the business we need to conduct to deal with \nthe big challenges of Social Security and Medicare and the demographic \ntime bombs that exist in those programs, it is not their intent to do \nthat. Their intent is to package up a nearly $800 billion tax cut \nbefore we have had the first dollar of surplus and say for the next 10 \nyears they are going to have this sort of riverboat gamble with this \nfiscal policy.\n  Let's talk just for a bit about where we are and then where we have \nbeen.\n  What is happening in this country? First of all, the country has an \neconomy that is the envy of the world. Unemployment is down, inflation \nis down, home ownership is up, personal income is up, the welfare rolls \nare down, crime is down, economic growth is up, and the budget deficit \nis about gone.\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\n  Go back about 8 years. What was happening in this country then? A \n$290 billion annual deficit that was continuing to rise and economists \npredicted they would see these deficits rise forever into the future. \nWe had a Dow Jones Industrial Average that had barely reached 3,000. We \nhad a sluggish, anemic economy; job growth, 1988 to 1992 was one of the \nworst 4-year periods in history; unemployment rates, 7.1 percent \nannually from 1981 to 1992; median family income fell by $1,800 in a 4-\nyear period; real wages were falling; welfare rolls were increasing.\n  Have things improved in this country? You bet they have improved in \nthis country. They have improved because we passed a new fiscal policy, \npassed a plan in the form of legislation in 1993. Some of our \ncolleagues predicted it would throw this country into kind of a train \nwreck and ruin the economy. The economy was in big trouble back then. \nIt is much improved now. We all understand that.\n  In fact, today's newspaper is really interesting. A tiny little \narticle on page 5 says:\n\n       Treasury plans to buy back debt.\n\n  My Lord, that ought to be on the front page with 3-inch headlines:\n\n       Treasury plans to buy back debt.\n\n  This country has $5.7 trillion in debt, and when we started with this \nplan we had a $290 billion deficit in that year alone, and it was \nexpected to continue to grow. Now we have a balanced budget, and the \nTreasury is beginning to buy back debt.\n  If we have surpluses that economists say they can see well into the \nfuture, what do we do? During tough economic times, it seems to me, a \ncountry always borrows money. How about during good economic times? \nDoes a country pay it back? Does this country say, in giving that rare \ngift to the young people in this country: We will reduce the Federal \ndebt; we ran it up during tough times, but in good times when we have a \nsurplus, we will reduce the Federal debt? No, that is not what the \nmajority party says. The majority party says: Here are our choices. Big \ntax cuts, most of it going to the upper-income folks; nothing for \nMedicare extension; nothing for education and other key investments; \nnothing for Social Security solvency; nothing for debt reduction. They \nsay big tax cuts.\n  How big are the tax cuts? Here are the pie charts. The top 1 percent \nof income earners in this country get a $46,000 tax cut, and the bottom \n20 percent get $24. Is that surprising? No. It is the same tired, \nchronic problem that always is brought to us in the Senate when the \nmajority party writes a tax bill.\n\n  This is a bar graph. You can barely see the bottom 60 percent. They \nonly get $138; the top 1 percent, $46,000.\n  How about this Social Security issue? This plan also raids the Social \nSecurity program after the first 5 years. That is a plain fact.\n  What are our choices? The enduring truth of this country's existence \nfor a number of decades has been two things: One, a cold war with the \nSoviet Union; and, two, a budget deficit that seemed always to grow \nworse. For four or five decades, that was the enduring truth that was \noverhanging all of our choices. Now the Soviet Union does not exist, \nthe cold war is over, the budget deficits are gone, and everything has \nchanged.\n  Economists predict surpluses well into the future, and I said before \nthese are economists who cannot remember their home phone numbers or \naddresses and they are telling us what is going to happen 3 years, 5 \nyears, 10 years into the future. God bless them, maybe they are right, \nmaybe not. Forty of the forty-five leading economists the year prior to \nthe last recession predicted it would be a year of economic growth. So \neconomists do not always hit the mark. Economics, as you know, is \npsychology pumped with a little helium, an advanced degree, and then \nthey give us projections. Our friends on the other side say just \nprojections, that is enough, just projections alone will compel us to \npass a bill that will take $800 billion and put it in the form of tax \ncuts, the substantial majority of which will go to the wealthiest \nAmericans, and they will decide to take that gamble with the American \neconomy.\n  It is their right. They have the votes. We do not weigh them here, we \ncount them. And when you count up the votes, they win. But it is a \nrisky riverboat gamble for this country's economy. Those who have been \ngiving us the most advice about this plan of theirs and how wonderful \nit is for our country are the very same people who were so \nfundamentally wrong 8 years ago.\n  Now they say: We have a new plan. I say: What about your old one? It \nseems to me what we ought to do is make rational, thoughtful choices. \nYes, there is room for a tax cut if we get the surpluses that the \neconomists predict.\n  The first choice, it seems to me, ought to be, during good economic \ntimes you pay down part of the Federal debt. That is the best gift we \ncould give the children of this country, and that would also stimulate \nlower interest rates and more economic growth.\n  The second choice for us to decide as a country is, we are going to \nconfront a demographic time bomb in Medicare and Social Security, and \nwe must confront it; let's use some of these surpluses to do that.\n  Third, let's also make sure our investments that make this a better \ncountry and better place in which to live are provided for. Yes, \neducation, health care. Does anybody really believe it is going to help \nthis country to have massive cuts in a program such as WIC, the \ninvestment we make in low-income pregnant women and children? Does \nanybody think massive cuts in those kinds of programs or massive cuts \nin Pell grants for poor students to go to college are going to help \nthis country? I don't think so. That is where this plan leads us.\n  Our choices, in my judgment, are use this projected surplus when it \nexists to make a real dent in this country's debt and, second, let's \nhave some targeted tax cuts, but after we have committed ourselves to \nextend the solvency of Social Security and extend the solvency of \nMedicare. Then let's make sure those programs that invest in human \npotential really do work; those programs in education and health care \nthat make this a better country, let's make sure those programs are \nprovided for as well.\n  To develop a plan that implicitly assumes--and, yes, it does, no \nmatter how much they decry that is not part of what they are doing--\nthat implicitly assumes you are going to have 20-, 30-, and up to 40-\npercent cuts in programs that we know in this country work, that \nstrengthen this country and improve this country and invest in the \nlives of people in this country in a very positive way, makes no sense \nat all.\n\n  My colleagues have used charts to describe this tax proposal. There \nis, it seems to me, no chart that is better than this chart, which is \nwhere we were and where we are going. I hope we will decide to vote \nagainst this tax cut and have a more sensible fiscal policy as we go \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have been called many things, some not \nalways so flattering or nice, but I have never been called \nunconservative because I thought we ought not to let Government spend \nworking people's money rather than giving it back to them.\n  There have been a lot of issues raised, and I want to go through and \nanswer each and every one of them. Let me start with the rhetoric of \nour dear Democrat colleagues about, let's pay down this debt; don't \ngive this money back to working people; we don't know what they are \ngoing to do with it; they might waste it; they might use it in an \nunwise way. Let Government keep it and we will pay down the debt, our \nDemocrat colleagues say. But the problem with that rhetoric is it does \nnot comport with the facts. Our problem is what they are doing speaks \nso loudly on this issue that we cannot hear their words.\n\n  I have here a chart. I know this chart is hard to read because my \nmama saw it on television and could not read it. But believe me, I can \nread it, and I am going to read it to you.\n  Both sides tend to claim we are right about figures. But to make \nGovernment work, we have a nonpartisan organization called the \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\nBudget Office that is made up of experts, accountants, economists, that \nbasically serve as a reality check on both Democrats and Republicans.\n  They just completed what they call their Mid-Session Review, where in \nthe middle of the year they looked at the President's budget, which our \nDemocrat colleagues are supporting, and they looked at our budget \nresolution, which included our $792 billion; and they reported to the \nCongress and the American people about these two competing programs and \nwhat they would mean in terms of the Government budget.\n  If you listened to our Democrat colleagues, they are trying to tell \nyou it is a bad idea for us to give back roughly 25 cents out of every \ndollar of the projected surplus to working people. They say: Let us pay \ndown debt.\n  But when the Congressional Budget Office looked at the President's \nbudget, they found that the President is proposing, over the next 10 \nyears, in his budget, to spend $1.033 trillion on increases for 81 \nGovernment programs. They found that the President proposes spending \n$1.033 trillion on 81 programs as an alternative to our tax cut, and \nsince our tax cut under the Republican budget is $792 billion, we \nactually pay off $219 billion more in debt than the President does. \nThey talk about this money being used to pay down debt, but the \nPresident not only spends every penny of the non-Social Security \nsurplus, he has to plunder the Social Security trust fund in 3 of the \n10 years just to pay for all of his new spending.\n  So when you hear one of our Democrat colleagues say: Oh, it is a \nterrible idea to give working people back roughly 25 cents out of every \ndollar of the surplus because wouldn't it be better to use it to buy \ndown debt? Please remember that the budget they support, written by \nPresident Clinton, spends every penny of the non-Social Security \nsurplus, plus roughly $29 billion. So while they say: Let us buy down \ndebt. Their program is to spend every penny of that money on increasing \n81 government programs.\n  The reason this is so important that people understand is, this is \nnot a debate between buying down debt and tax cuts. In fact, as the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has shown, after you look at \nall the spending the President wants to do, he would buy down debt \n$1.959 trillion. Our budget, with this tax cut, would buy down debt \n$2.178 trillion, or $219 billion more.\n  The debate is not between buying down debt--in fact, we pay off more \ndebt than the Democrats do. The debate is between spending the money on \nthese 81 Government programs versus letting Americans keep more of what \nthey earn.\n  If we were going to have a totally honest debate, it would be our \nDemocrat colleagues standing up and talking about these 81 Government \nprograms and the $1 trillion they would spend, and asking working \nAmericans tonight to listen to what they say; listen to our tax cut; \nand then sit down around their kitchen table and ask themselves a \nquestion: Can Government in Washington, with President Clinton's \nprograms, spend this money to help our family more than we could if we \ngot to keep the money to spend on our own family? Can they do a better \njob spending our money than we can?\n  Obviously, that is a very different debate. Our colleagues do not \nwant to have that debate. But their budget would spend every penny of \nthe non-Social Security surplus.\n  So when people are saying: Don't give this tax cut. Let us buy down \ndebt, their budget spends every penny of this money, plus plundering \nsome of the Social Security trust fund.\n\n  So the debate is about whether we let the American people have the \nmoney and save it or spend it or invest it or whether they want to let \nGovernment spend it.\n  Our colleague said: Let's put some money away in case the good times \ndon't last. Who is better to put money away in case the good times \ndon't last? Working people, with their own money, or Government? When \nis the last time anybody remembers the Government putting money away \nfor a rainy day?\n  I don't remember it. We are already $21 billion over the spending \ntotals that the President and the Congress agreed to. We are not \nputting any money away here in Washington.\n  Yesterday, we had the adoption of a farm bill that spent another $7.4 \nbillion, taking every penny of it right out of the surplus. So this \nmoney is being spent, is the first point, and that is the debate.\n  The second point is, some of our colleagues have said: Well, boy, \nthis is a huge tax cut, and we don't need this tax cut.\n  And so I have two sets of figures I want to ask you to look at. The \nfirst is very interesting to me. These are the 7 years in American \nhistory where the tax burden on the American people has been at its \nhighest level. One of my staffers, clever as he is, summed this up by \nsaying, the ``Causes of Record Taxes: War and Clinton.'' Because if you \nlook at the record tax burdens in American history, out of the six \nhighest, four of them are Clinton years, and two of them are World War \nII--Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt--when defense was 38 percent of \nthe economy and 37 percent of the economy. Now it is less than 3 \npercent.\n  The only other year where we have had a tax burden even approaching \nthe one we have now was the year Ronald Reagan became President, and we \nwere debating cutting taxes across the board by 25 percent.\n  Our colleagues say: Well, it was just a terrible thing to do. We \nshould have never cut taxes when Ronald Reagan was President.\n  A couple making $50,000 a year, had we not had the Roth-Kemp tax cut, \nwould have been paying $12,626 a year now in income taxes instead of \npaying $6,242. Our Democrat colleagues think that would be great. We \nthought it was a bad idea. So in the Reagan budget we cut taxes. The \neconomy started to grow. We rebuilt defense. We won the cold war. We \ntore down the Berlin Wall. A lot of good things happened.\n  But this is the most telling chart of all. You hear all this stuff \nabout: Oh, this is a huge tax cut, and many of the writers and many of \nthe columnists are beginning to pick this up. But nobody goes back and \nlooks at the facts.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be glad to yield when I get through if I have time.\n  Now here are the facts. If you take revenues over the next 10 years \nthat are projected, our tax cut is less than 3.5 percent. In other \nwords, our tax cut cuts taxes, in terms of projected revenue, by under \n3.5 percent. That is this huge tax cut we are talking about.\n  But this chart is really telling. The day Bill Clinton became \nPresident, before we raised taxes--or President Clinton raised taxes--\nmany of our colleagues have pointed out that not one Republican voted \nfor that tax increase; and I am proud to say that is true--before he \nraised taxes in 1993, the Government was taking 17.8 cents out of every \ndollar earned by every American in Federal taxes.\n  Today the Federal Government is taking 20.6 cents out of every dollar \nearned by every American in Federal taxes. That is the highest \npeacetime level of government taxes in American history, the second \nhighest tax burden, second only to 1944 in American history. If we took \nthe whole $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus--and I note that we \nare taking less than $800 billion--if we took all of it and cut taxes, \nwe would still be taking, when the full tax cut is in effect 10 years \nfrom now, 18.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American in \nFederal taxes.\n  Why is that important? It is important because what is being called a \nhuge tax cut actually leaves taxes substantially above where they were \nthe day Bill Clinton became President. So what is being called a huge, \nirresponsible, riverboat gamble--I was thinking Senator Breaux might \nwant to defend riverboat gambling--what is being called a huge gamble, \nwe are simply talking about giving back some of this huge tax increase. \nBy the way, the President said later, at a fund-raiser, that he raised \ntaxes too much in 1993. Our tax cut would still leave the tax burden \nsubstantially above where it was when Bill Clinton became President.\n  Let me address the issue very briefly about rich people getting this \ntax cut. You need to understand when our Democrat colleagues speak that \nthey have a code. The code is, every tax increase is on rich people; \nevery tax cut is for rich people. So you don't ever want to cut taxes \nbecause it helps rich people.\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\n You always want to raise them because it hurts rich people. You are \nnot for rich people.\n  The problem is, when that argument was made on the President's tax \nincrease in 1993, they taxed gasoline, and gasoline is bought by both \nthe rich and the poor. They taxed Social Security benefits on incomes \nof $25,000 or more. That is hardly what we call rich.\n  When we debated this issue when it first came to the Senate, one of \nour colleagues got up and said: The Roth tax bill gives 60 percent of \nthe tax cut to the top 25 percent of income earners in America. Can you \nimagine that this tax cut gives 60 percent of the benefits to the top \n25 percent of income earners? But nobody bothered to point out that the \ntop 25 percent of income earners pay 81.3 percent of the taxes. The \ntruth is that the Roth tax cut, in terms of the rate cut, actually \nmakes taxes more progressive, even though it reduces everybody's taxes. \nIt reduces lower-income people's taxes more.\n  Actually, I wanted it to be cut across the board. You have heard many \npeople say: Some 30 percent of Americans under this tax cut get no tax \ncut. Can you imagine a tax cut where almost 30 percent of the people \nget no income tax cut? That sounds crazy until you realize that roughly \n30 percent of Americans pay no income taxes. Most taxpayers don't get \nfood stamps. They don't get TANF. They don't get Medicaid because they \nare not poor. Those programs are not for them.\n  Tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you don't pay taxes, you don't get a \ntax cut. It is not because we don't love you. It is not because there \nis something wrong with you. It is just that tax cuts are for \ntaxpayers. So we are cutting income taxes. If you don't pay income \ntaxes, you don't get a tax cut. Remember that when you hear all this \nbusiness about rich people and poor people.\n  Quite frankly, I think we do our country an injustice when we keep \ntrying to pit people against each other based on their income. The \nplain truth is, if we could calculate this out, the Roth tax cut, the \nparts of it that we have enough data on in this short period of time to \nlook at, it probably makes the tax code a little more progressive than \nit is. I don't think we ought to be doing that. I don't have any \nproblem in saying, if you don't pay any taxes, you don't get a tax cut. \nIf you pay a lot of taxes, you get a lot of tax cut.\n  If we had a 10-percent across-the-board cut--unfortunately, we don't \nquite get that; I am proud of what we got--but if Senator Rockefeller \nmakes 10 times as much money as I do, he would get 10 times as big a \ntax cut. Some people get upset about that, but I don't get upset about \nit.\n\n  Alan Greenspan has become, his utterances at least, almost like a \nbible. Everybody quotes him to make their point. Generally the people \nquote him to make points that are 180 degrees out of sync. If you \nlisten to the quotes by many of our Democrat colleagues, you would \nbelieve that Alan Greenspan has said: Never, ever, ever, under any \ncircumstance, should we give anybody a tax cut. The reality is, what \nAlan Greenspan has said is very clear. His first preference would be to \nnot spend any of the surplus and to not give any of it back in taxes. \nBut Alan Greenspan says:\n\n       If you find that as a consequence of those surpluses they \n     tend to be spent, then I would be more in the camp of cutting \n     taxes, because the least desirable outcome is using those \n     surpluses for expanded outlays.\n\n  I submit that is exactly where we find ourselves when we look at the \nfact that we are spending the surplus as quickly as we can spend it, \nand the President has proposed spending $1 trillion of it over the next \n10 years.\n  The final point I will make, before summing up, is that several of my \ncolleagues have been joshing me--and boy, it is legitimate. When I was \nin economics, I never made predictions that would either prove true or \nfalse within 100 years. And then I didn't worry about it.\n  It is true that when President Clinton submitted his economic \nprogram, as we debated it in those first 2 years, I said some awfully \nunkind things about it--not things you couldn't print in the paper, but \nthey weren't generous. I suggested that if it was adopted, we would \nhave a recession.\n  Our colleagues have said: Well, look at the wonderful economy we \nhave.\n  In my final, major points, I will, as Paul Harvey, give you the rest \nof the story. To listen to our colleagues today, they would have you \nbelieve that all of the Clinton program was just a tax increase. But \nthere were two other parts of it. If we are going to be fair to my \nquote, we need to be fair in saying there were two other parts of the \nClinton program in those first 2 years. It certainly did raise taxes. I \ncertainly was against it, and I still believe the economy would be \nbetter off if we had not done it. But the other two parts our Democrat \ncolleagues want to forget. The first was a major spending program that \nspent $17 billion in the first year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The second part of the program that everybody doesn't talk \nabout is a proposal to spend $17 billion to ``stimulate the economy.'' \nOur colleague from Oklahoma remembers it because we discovered, in one \nof the happiest discoveries in recent political history, that when you \nlooked at that program, it was going to spend money on programs off a \nlist submitted by communities, and on that list was an Alpine slide in \nPuerto Rico and an ice-skating warming hut in Connecticut. We had \nendless good times about that and, in the end, while we had a \nRepublican minority and a Democrat majority, we actually filibustered \nand killed the $17 billion of spending.\n\n  I don't have my copy of the Clinton health care plan here, and that \nis probably good because if I picked it up, I might get a hernia. The \nthird part of the program was for the Government to take over one-\neighth of the economy by having one giant HMO--I think it was called a \nhealth care purchasing collective, or something--and all the doctors \nwould work for the Government and the Government would run the health \ncare system. So if we are going to be fair in quoting my statement, \nlet's remember that the plan had three parts; we killed two of the \nthree.\n  The final thing--and I probably ought not do this, but we are getting \nready to go on recess, so why not. ``Bill Clinton balanced the budget \nand made everything wonderful.'' We have all heard that. We heard it \nright before I got up to speak. But I have in my hand President \nClinton's budget for fiscal year 1996. This was the budget that the new \nRepublican Congress got in January of 1995. I do remember this. One of \nmy staff provided me with these unkind remarks, when I said in 1993, \nregarding this Clinton health care bill, ``If we pass it, we will be \nhunting Democrats down with dogs all over America.'' Well, we didn't \npass it, but we did elect the first Republican majority in both Houses \nof Congress since 1952.\n  In any case, to finish my point, when this new Republican Congress \ngot here, this was the budget the President had sent them. This budget, \nright on page 2, projected a deficit of roughly $200 billion through \nthe year 2000. The new Republican majority took this budget and threw \nit into the trash can, and we adopted a new budget.\n  On this chart, here is the Clinton deficit projected in 1996. This is \nwhat we achieved with the Republican majority. Now, did we really do \nall that? No. Did Clinton do all that? No. The plain truth is that we \nhad basically a stalemate, and we stopped virtually all new spending. \nIn fact, with all this talk about the gloom and doom, we were able to \ncontrol spending a little bit. The economy took off and we balanced the \nFederal budget.\n  So let me sum up by simply saying this. I want to congratulate our \nchairman, who has put together a tax bill that is as good a tax bill as \nyou can write in the Senate and get 51 people to vote for. I want to \ncongratulate him for his leadership. If you trust the American people \nand their ability to spend their own money better than the Government, \nvote for this tax cut. If you believe the Government can spend it \nbetter and will make America richer, freer, and happier by spending it, \nrather than letting them have it, then you ought to vote against it. \nThat is the choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I point out that 80 percent of non-retired American \nadults pay more in Social Security taxes than income taxes. That is a \npoint we are not dealing with much.\n  I have the honor and privilege to yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York and also \nthe distinguished chairman of the full committee, the Senator from \nDelaware. They are both distinguished gentlemen.\n  I just make a note that when we use the term ``distinguished \ngentleman,'' we use it sometimes lackadaisically in the Senate. In this \ncase, I think it is important for us to note that there are probably no \ntwo finer gentlemen in this body today than the Senator from Delaware, \nthe chairman of the committee, and the Senator from New York, the \nranking member of our committee. They are gentlemen in the sense of how \nthey have had to conduct the affairs of bringing this conference report \nand this tax bill to the American public. Although they have had \ndifferences in what they thought the ultimate product should look like, \nboth of these two distinguished Senators have conducted themselves in \nthe finest sense of being a gentleman, and they have worked together in \na fashion that I think has kept our committee together. I congratulate \nthem for that.\n\n  Let me say a couple of words about where we are. Unfortunately, the \ndebate we are hearing on the floor today is about something that is not \ngoing to happen. We are spending all of this time talking about \nsomething that is not going to become law; it is not going to occur \nbecause none of this will, in fact, become legislation. It will only be \nsomething about which we have talked. Many colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle are talking about how bad the provisions are in the \nconference report, and many colleagues on that side of the aisle are \ntalking about how wonderful the provisions in the bill are.\n  The bottom line is we are talking about something that is not going \nto happen because it is very clear to everybody in America, and \neverybody in Washington knows, that when this bill gets down to the \nPresident in this form, it is going to be vetoed. The veto will not be \noverridden.\n  All of this exercise today, while I am sure it is important to make \nour political points, is not talking about what is going to benefit the \npeople of our country. As a result of where we are, there will be no \nreduction in the marriage penalty. It is not going to be fixed. It is \nnot going to be addressed by this product. There will be no reduction \nof income rates from 15 percent to 14 percent. That is not going to \nbecome law. There is not going to be any increase in the standard \ndeduction for hard-working Americans. The standard deduction is not \ngoing to go up. The marriage penalty is not going to go down. Estate \ntaxes are not going to be repealed. Estate taxes are not going to be \nreduced. It will be the same after this bill is disposed of. Child care \ncredits are not going to go up. Health care credits for people who \ndon't have health care will not be assisted because all of the things \nwe have in these various pieces of legislation that we tried to get \ninto a package that could be signed will, in fact, not be signed into \nlaw.\n  In many ways, this is an exercise in futility--in the sense that we \nknow it will never become law. This debate, however, I think is still \nimportant. It is important to point out some of the things that are in \nthe bill, which I find sort of interesting. I know my colleagues have \nlooked at this list. It is a list of all of the things that are in the \nbill that are going to be sunsetted. We have more sunsets in this bill \nthan they had in the movie ``South Pacific.'' The broad-based tax \nrelief is going to be sunsetted. The marriage penalty will be \nsunsetted. The AMT relief, the capital gains reduction, and the \nindividual retirement accounts, which Senator Roth has worked so hard \non, will be sunsetted. Assistance for distressed communities will be \nsunsetted. There is a sunset on every page. It is enough to put us to \nsleep. The problem is that all of these things we have are not going to \nbecome law.\n  But I think the debate we have is important because I always remain \noptimistic. I guess when I lose my optimism, I will lose my interest in \nserving in this esteemed body; and I haven't reached that point yet. I \nthink it is important to have this debate. It is unfortunate that we \nonly have 10 hours. It is unfortunate that we had 20 hours for 100 \nSenators to debate a major reform in the Tax Code of this country. I \nthink we have to recognize that the system in which we bring tax bills \nto the Senate floor for open debate needs to go back to that old system \nwhere we have open debate on something as important as tax policy. We \nused to do it and produce good bills. The distinguished ranking member \nand the chairman remembers those days. We need to go back to the \nprocess whereby we have open and complete debate on tax laws in this \ncountry.\n  The final point I will make is that I hope sometime when we come \nback--after we have had the veto ceremony and the response to the veto \nceremony, and everybody has gotten it off their chests, we can come \nback in September, as the chairman has said, and address the real issue \nof Medicare, try to look at what amount of money we really need in \nMedicare. We have a plug number in the Democratic bill of $320 billion. \nWe don't need that much. I don't think we can spend $320 billion more \nin Medicare and make it any better than it is today. But we can reform \nit; we can figure out how much money we do need because we do need more \nmoney.\n  We can figure out how to craft a program that brings Medicare into \nthe 21st century. It was a great program in 1965. This is approaching \nthe 21st century, and the model of 1965 does not fit what we need to do \nfor the 21st century. We need to reform it and figure out how much \nmoney we need for a good, solid prescription drug program, particularly \none with catastrophic protection, and try to combine that legislation \nwith a realistic tax bill.\n  I recommend that we also consider doing something on Social \nSecurity--certainly a lockbox, a temporary protection, but we need real \nreform for that program as well. We need to look at the private sector \nto help increase the return on Social Security investments from what we \nhave right now as part of any real reform effort.\n  I hope that sometime late in September we will have an opportunity to \nlook at trying to combine the business recommendations from all of our \nMembers on Social Security reform and on true Medicare reform, and \nfigure out what we actually need to put into a tax bill that would give \nreal relief to all of these things we are sunsetting right and left, \nand come up with something that helps people who need the greatest \nhelp.\n  I voted for this bill in the Finance Committee to keep the process \ngoing forward. I voted for it when it passed the Senate the first time \nto keep the process going forward. Unfortunately, at this stage the \nprocess has now gone backwards. What we have before the Senate is more \nreflective of the House-passed bill, which I think does not really \ndirect the limited tax help to those who need it the most.\n  It is interesting to note that, with all the trigger mechanisms, it \nlooks like a shooting gallery as far as all the triggers that have to \ngo into effect before the tax bill goes into effect. Add the sunset \nprovisions with the trigger mechanisms, and I doubt that anybody in \nthis body can tell you what the real tax benefits are going to be for \nthe American people. Is it going to be $800 billion, or $545 billion, \nwhich is sort of pretty close to what a centrist group recommended of \n$500 billion. I suggest that we have, at best, a mishmash of differing \nrecommendations and viewpoints about what the tax bill ought to look \nlike.\n  I am not sure, with all the sunsets and everything else we have in \nhere, that anybody can really describe exactly what we are presenting \nto the American public other than a political issue. We are going to \nhave a great political debate on this from both sides of the aisle. We \nare going to criticize everything coming from our opponents from both \nperspectives, but we are going to ultimately be talking about what we \ndidn't do. We are going to be talking about failure, and we are going \nto talk about whose fault it is that we didn't accomplish anything. \nThat is really unfortunate.\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\n  I happen to think the American people would much prefer for us to \nhave a debate on success: You did it. We did it. No. You did it. But at \nleast we would be talking about success. We would be talking about \nsomething we did instead of debating failure and whose fault it was \nthat we weren't able to come together.\n  We have a divided government. The President is a Democrat. He is \ngoing to be there until the next election. And who knows what after \nthat?\n  I conclude by saying that I congratulate our two leaders. They did a \nterrific job. I greatly respect them for it. Hopefully, we can come \nback and do it later in a better fashion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I hope we have listened carefully to \nwhat the Senator from Louisiana has said. He is generous and \noptimistic, and it might just turn out to be true.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. Let me \nthank him for the tremendous work he has done in the last several \nmonths to produce a tax package that is here on the floor.\n  Let me turn to my colleague from Louisiana first. I wish the \nPresident would follow that Senator's leadership, for if he had \nfollowed his leadership, we would have a Medicare package and be \nworking on it right now. But the President chose to politicize Medicare \nand to walk away from his Democratic colleagues whom he placed onto the \nCommission to do the work that they did so well in a bipartisan way.\n  And we are here today without a fix for Medicare because the \nPresident did not awaken to the responsibility he had in that regard \nand the opportunity that the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska had helped create in the Medicare Commission. I wish the \nPresident had awakened, but he chose not to.\n  We are here today debating a tax relief bill for the American people, \na relief bill that, in my opinion, is responsible, reasonable. In all \nfairness, given the total picture of our budget and our projected \nrevenues, it is, in fact, modest tax relief.\n  Some would be surprised by that statement on the modest size of this \ntax relief package if they were to listen to the rhetoric from the \nother side of the aisle. But that is the truth. It is responsible tax \nrelief, within the responsible budget plan which we passed earlier this \nyear.\n  Under this plan, we use three-fourths of the total budget surplus to \npay down the public debt by nearly one-half over 10 years and \ncompletely protect the Social Security system. For the first time in \nthe history of our Government, our budget commits us to reserving all \nof future Social Security surpluses and all future Social Security \nrevenues exclusively for Social Security beneficiaries. That is a first \nfor all of us; it is an important and responsible first.\n  If we continue to hold the line on new spending, that discipline plus \nsome of the leftover surplus funds, also will allow us to accommodate \nprudent Medicare reforms, meet emergencies, and address additional \npriorities that we may face, also all within that three-fourths of the \nsurplus that we are setting aside.\n  This tax relief bill draws on the remaining one-fourth of the total \nsurplus. This is hardly not reckless, like some have said. It is \nresponsible, reasonable, and modest to take just one-fourth of the \ntotal surplus and return it to the American people.\n  These facts seem to go unrecognized on the other side of the aisle. \nAfter we safeguard Social Security, meet the true and real \nresponsibilities of Government, account for Medicare and other \npriorities, what we do in this bill is say to those whom we have \novercharged, those who have overpaid their income taxes, we are going \nto refund to you a little of your own money.\n  Too many in Government and the press seem to miss this fundamental \nquestion: Who earns the money in the first place? Whose money is it? I \nam always fascinated by the debate on taxes when the other side seems \nto think that nearly everything the working person owns is the \nGovernment's. And if we are providing tax relief, somehow in our \ngenerosity, we are turning to them and smiling, and saying: We are \ngoing to give you back just a little.\n  Are we, to quote some on the other side, ``spending'' this money on a \ntax cut? Are we giving it back? No. We are saying it belongs to the \nworker who earned it, and that he or she should be able to keep a \nlittle more of the fruits of his or her own labors.\n  What we are suggesting is that we don't take so much in the first \nplace--that we have enough right now to fund Government in a \nresponsible way, and we ought to recognize that it is the working \nperson out there we are taking it from, and we ought to return the \novercharge.\n  This tax relief is phased in, meaning future Congresses will have \nplenty of time to react if the economic conditions of our country \nchange. That is also part of the argument why this bill is responsible.\n\n  The bill represents only a 3.5-percent tax cut. That is modest, \nespecially for the most heavily taxed generation in American history.\n  Some of the future tax relief won't even kick in unless the national \ndebt is in fact being reduced. I think that is responsible. Yet we hear \nthe mantra again of, pay down the debt, pay down the debt.\n  If you would read the facts of this tax relief bill we have put \ntogether, and the budget it implements, we are paying down a very \nsubstantial part of the debt--more than one-half of it. In fact, we \nalready have paid down $142 billion in the public debt in the last 2 \nyears.\n  Under our budget, and on top of this tax relief, we will pay down \nover $200 billion in debt more than the President's budget called for, \neven though he is one of those out there talking about debt reduction \nat this moment.\n  Let me make you a deal, Mr. President. You say you are going to veto \nthe tax cut. Well, if you veto the tax cut, why don't you bring to us a \nlockbox proposal that puts all of the surplus in a lockbox to pay down \nthe debt? A lockbox that makes a binding guarantee that not one cent of \nthe surplus will go to new spending. You are not about to do that, Mr. \nPresident. But if you would, I would support you in it because debt \nreduction is important. It would help the economy of this country.\n  But one has to wonder if the President just flat isn't speaking with \nall of the truth that he ought to be. Look at his budget this year--tax \nincreases and new spending. In fact, his own budget this year calls for \nspending the entire non-Social Security surplus, and then raiding the \nSocial Security trust funds for some more new spending. I am sorry, Mr. \nPresident. What you say and what you do don't come together--they don't \nadd up. What you say about new spending in your budget doesn't match \nwhat you say about debt reduction when you oppose this tax relief.\n  I don't think I would have to eat my hat on that kind of a promise to \nthe President--that I would be willing to support him if he would take \nall of the surplus and put it in a fund to pay down the debt, because \nthat is just not about to happen.\n  No, the real issue here is not tax relief versus paying down the \ndebt.\n  The real issue is tax relief versus spending. We all know that. We \nwere spending money yesterday. Frankly, I was helping spend some of it. \nThat spending used some of the surplus and is going to relieve the \ncurrent crisis circumstance in producing agriculture today across this \ncountry. I supported that agriculture appropriations bill because our \nfarm families are facing an emergency. But I also know if we leave all \nthe taxpayers' money in Washington, DC, all the surplus, it will get \nspent, and not just on emergencies. If we send it back to the people \nwho earned it and own it, then it won't get spent by government. At \nleast then, we would have to go back to the people and ask them for the \nright to spend more, by changing the tax structure to increase future \nrevenues.\n  Who believes if Government takes in $3 trillion in surplus revenue \nover the next 10 years, that Government won't spend it? We know they \nwill spend it.\n  The National Taxpayers Union Foundation does a little thing called \n``Bill Tally.'' They tally up all of the new bills introduced by \nMembers of Congress every year and what those new bills will represent \nin new and increased government spending. Mr.\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\nPresident, 84 of 100 Senators--that means Democrat and Republican \nalike--last year introduced new legislation that would lead to an \nadditional $28 billion in spending per year, on average. Not over the \nnext 10 years but in one alone--Democrat and Republican alike. New \nideas, new bills, new spending. It is the habit of Government. Of \ncourse, we know that. That represents about a $232 increase in spending \nfrom every American taxpayer that is already on the wish list of most \nof the Senate.\n  I hope and believe we can resist the temptation to spend the three-\nfourths of the surplus we reserve to pay down the debt, save Social \nSecurity, and reserve some for other future priorities. That is what we \nought to be doing with it. That is what we promised in the \nCongressional budget we passed earlier this year. Yet, the temptation \nwill be there to spend the remaining one-forth, and part of that three-\nfourths, as well.\n  The choice is very simple. The debate today is about bigger \nGovernment versus bigger household budgets--private citizen household \nbudgets. I hope helping those American household budgets is what this \nSenate ultimately will support. I hope over the course of August we can \nconvince this President that he really ought to be more on the side of \nthe American taxpayer than on the side of ever-bigger Government.\n  This tax relief bill is fair. Yes, it is fair. I know we have heard \nthe debate about tax cuts only going to the rich. The Senator from \nTexas did a marvelous job a few moments ago talking about how the folks \non the other side of the aisle think it only goes to the rich. I am \namazed and, frankly, frustrated that every time we talk tax relief, \nimmediately Democrats run to the microphones and say it is for the \nrich, the rich are going to get the benefit of a tax relief proposal.\n  That just ``ain't'' so in this bill. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate deserves a lot of credit for focusing this bill \nright on middle America, right at husbands and wives, working and \ntrying to raise a family out there in the market place, wage-earners \nwho are paying the bulk of these taxes.\n  Every American who pays income taxes will receive some benefit from \nthis bill. The middle class Americans who pay most of the income taxes \nwill get, by far, most of the income tax reduction. That is the way it \nought to be.\n  What we are actually doing in this proposal is making the tax code a \nlittle more progressive. Middle-income taxpayers will receive \nproportionately more relief, for the taxes they pay, than upper-income \ntaxpayers. But everyone who pays income taxes gets income tax relief.\n  This bill is fair because it shows compassion for the most heavily \ntaxed generation in American history.\n  Several of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about that \ntax burden. But I am amazed my Democrat friends and colleagues don't \nseem to recognize it. Surely they do. In fact, somehow, they actually \nare allowing their President to propose more taxes, which he did in his \nbudget proposal this year.\n  That heavy tax burden has hurt people. It has robbed a whole \ngeneration of the opportunity to plan their retirement. It has forced \nfamilies into adding a second and third income, rather than spending \ntime taking care of children or elderly parents. It has robbed \nAmericans of a major part of their freedom.\n  Today's baby boomer family is paying, on average, 50 percent more in \ntaxes at all levels, as a portion of income, then their parents did \nwhen they were raising their families.\n  Only one year in history, 1944, at the height of the largest war in \nthe history of the world, requiring incredible financial sacrifice, saw \nthe federal government take in taxes a larger share of the national \nincome than we are now paying.\n  This tax relief bill will help real people with real needs. There are \ntwo ways we can help people: We can create bigger government, with more \nbureaucrats, with more programs and red tape, regulating more behavior, \nand hope we produce some more government checks for some beneficiaries. \nOr we can let Americans keep a little more of their own money and meet \ntheir needs without Uncle Sam as the middle man. We can provide broad-\nbased tax relief. We can provide targeted tax relief and incentives for \nfolks to use for specific, beneficial purposes.\n  If we really care about people, we care about helping them in the \nmost direct, most effective way possible.\n  Here's some of how we do that in this tax relief bill:\n  Marriage penalty relief: It just isn't fair to force two individuals \nto pay hundreds of dollars more in taxes simply because they get \nmarried.\n  Death tax relief: It just isn't fair that working families sometimes \nhave to sell part or all of the family farm or the family business just \nto pay taxes. I've seen family farms carved up because of the death \ntax. The other side would have us believe that this is a debate about \nthe so-called ``estates'' of rich people. It's not.\n  Help for families with children:\n  It would allow more parents to afford child care, both because it \nincreases and expands the child care tax credit.\n  It allows more modest- and middle-income families to make full use of \nthe child tax credit we enacted in the 1997 Tax Relief Act.\n  It expands the tax exclusion for foster care payments.\n  Help for individuals and families with education:\n  It would make education more affordable and available to individuals \nand families.\n  It includes tax-free, qualified tuition plans; extends the employer-\nprovided tuition assistance; makes our 1997 education tax credits more \nfully available to modest- and middle-income families, by taking it out \nof the Alternative Minimum Tax calculations; and includes the \nCoverdell-Torricelli education savings account.\n  Help with health care, long-term care, and eldercare:\n  It increases the affordability of prescription drug insurance; health \ninsurance for those who aren't covered by a corporate plan; long-term \ninsurance, both for those who must pay for their own and those with \ncafeteria plans.\n  Farmers, small businesses, and workers will benefit from making the \nself-paid health insurance deduction 100 percent deductible.\n  Help for farm families: America's farm families are in a period of \neconomic crisis today.\n  It provides for increased expensing, to $30,000; create FARRM \nAccounts--Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts; and protect income \naveraging from the Alternative Minimum Tax.\n  Help for folks who need retirement security: It includes expanded \nIRAs, 401(k) plans, and other provisions too numerous to mention, that \nespecially will benefit folks over age 50.\n  Help for disadvantaged individuals seeking work: The Work Opportunity \ntax credit is reinstated.\n  Help for charities and charitable giving: 70 percent of taxpayers \nreceive no recognition of charitable giving--because they don't itemize \ntheir deductions. This bill would reward and encourage those middle-\nclass taxpayers who benefit their community, help the less fortunate, \nand promote the social good, with an above-the-line deduction for \ncharitable donations.\n  This bill is needed by the American people.\n  When the facts are known, I am confident they will send one message \nback to Washington, DC: Please Mr. President, sign this bill into law. \nLet us keep one-fourth of the surplus for our families, our communities \nand our future financial security, instead of confiscating it for more \nbig government.\n  I conclude by saying this is a fair tax proposal. In all fairness, \ncompared with the total size of the Federal budget and the Federal \ngovernment tax burden, it is modest. I close by once again recognizing \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee for the tremendous work he has \ndone to build that balance and fairness into this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the great pleasure to yield 10 \nminutes to my good friend and colleague on the Finance Committee, the \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I very much thank my good friend from New York.\n  In a couple of years when the Senator is no longer here, we will miss \nhim very much. I know of no Senator more provocative, in the best sense \nof the term, in forcing Members to think. That is something which too \noften is in short commodity on the floor of the Senate. I very much \nthank my friend.\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\n  This is a strange debate. I heard earlier my good friend from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, say he is bewildered. I myself have referred to \nthis debate as surreal. My friend from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, \nasked: What are we talking about? Why are we here?\n  Those are apt comments in many ways.\n  One, because we know this bill will be vetoed. We know this tax cut \nthat has been proposed is not going to happen. Yet both those who favor \nthe tax cut and those who favor a veto are trying to score political \npoints with the American people. There are a lot of games being played \naround here. I don't think that is any news to the American people. \nThey know what is going on. They are pretty smart.\n  It is similar to President Lincoln saying you can fool some of the \npeople some of the time but you can't fool all the people all the time.\n  The American people are smarter than the Congress thinks they are.\n  Let me go through some of the reasons. First, the assumptions behind \nthis big tax cut are unrealistic and we all know they are unrealistic. \nI daresay that many on the other side of the aisle would agree \nprivately with our public statements on this side of the aisle that the \nassumptions are unrealistic. There is no way in the world the Congress \nwill jeopardize national defense by cutting national defense a couple \nhundred billion over the next decade. There is no way in the world the \nCongress is going to hurt veterans by dramatically cutting veterans' \nbenefits. There is no way in the world the Congress is going to cut \neducation and do all that is assumed behind this tax cut. Yet virtually \nthe entire projected surplus we are spending in this bill is based upon \nexactly these things happening. That is one reason this is a surreal, \nunrealistic, illusionary, and strange debate. It is not based upon \nfacts.\n  As others have pointed out, much more persuasively than I, the \nnumbers of this tax cut as proposed do not add up. There is no way in \nthe world we will be able to cut taxes $800 billion, pay the additional \ninterest on the debt, and provide for a modicum of services that people \nneed. Some have suggested--and nobody has disputed this number--that \nthis tax cut will require about a $600 billion cut in spending over the \nnext 10 years. It is unrealistic. It is not right. It is wrong to \nattempt to fool the American people that these levels of cuts are good \nfor the country.\n  Beyond that, this bill is based upon such ephemeral, illusionary \nprojections, it baffles me that anybody could stand on the floor and \nsay it is necessarily going to happen--that we will have a $1 trillion \nbudget surplus from tax revenues over the next 10 years. Past \nprojections have been so far off the mark that it is foolish to assume \nthis projection will be accurate.\n  On average, our projections are about 13 percent off the mark over 5 \nyears. This is a 10-year projection. I point out that CBO, the agency \non which we base our projections, stated in January of this year they \nwere off $200 billion when they came up with their midcourse review in \nJuly of this year. The projections were $200 billion off over a period \nof just 6 months. Who knows how far off a 10 year projection could be? \nIf we are honest with ourselves, we know most people are concerned that \nthe economy is now overheated, rather than underheated, and therefore \nthe projections will probably fall off and we will have much less of a \nbudget surplus than we assume.\n  I point this out because it defies common sense that we lock in law \ntax cuts far out in the future based on these very flimsy assumptions. \nWhy are we doing that?  Most people wouldn't do that. Most people, \nputting their family budgets together, wouldn't do that. Certainly no \nbusiness would do that. No business would assume that its revenues 10 \nyears out were going to be absolutely a certain amount and therefore \nthey are going to spend all this money today. You just cannot make that \nassumption. You have to be prudent.\n\n  I talked to the CEO of a major company just last week. I asked him \nhow their company makes projections.\n  He said: We cannot. We try to make a 5-year projection, but we are \nalways way off. The best we can do is we put together a 5-year plan and \ntry to anticipate what the future is going to be like, but we are \nconstantly modifying it because times are changing so quickly.\n  I think that probably makes sense. That is what we should be doing. \nWe should not lock in tax cuts so far out. Rather, if we think tax cuts \nmake some sense, they should be modest, to leave room for corrections \nif we have made a mistake.\n  Times do change very much. So, again, I say this bill is reckless. It \nis based on an illusion. It is just not prudent. I say to the American \npeople, I hope you understand how imprudent all this is.\n  I must also make another point, and this point saddens me. We are in \nthis strange, surreal situation, in part because there is so much \npartisanship in this body as well as in the other body. When I first \ncame to the Senate about 20 years ago, I must say there was much less \npartisanship then than there is now. It is just too partisan now.\n  By that I mean the other side of the aisle is totally controlling and \nsecretive in what they are doing. They have put together their tax bill \non their own; behind closed doors. No Democratic Senators were allowed. \nThe same with the conference report; behind closed doors, on their own, \nwith no Democratic Senator allowed.\n  Not too many years ago when the Democrats were in the majority, both \nsides were included in drafting bills, both Republicans and Democrats. \nI think that is what the American people want. They want us to work \ntogether. They really do not care whether we are Republicans or \nDemocrats; they really care that all 100 of us sit down, do the best we \ncan, and recognize this is a democracy with different States, and \ndifferent people who have different points of view, but achieve some \nrough justice and rough common sense.\n  I think there is a reason for the secrecy. There is a reason for the \nclosed doors; that is, they can do things they know are not right, \nthings that could not stand the light of day. If the doors were open \nand if both sides of the aisle were included, we would not have such \nphony budget projections. By ``phony'' I mean in the last couple of \nweeks, the other side directed CBO to come up with some new numbers \nbased upon their own new assumptions to fit the conclusions they \nwanted.\n  What was the conclusion they wanted? The conclusion they wanted was \nto show we could cut taxes by $800 billion and still come up with $400 \nbillion or $500 billion in spending revenue.\n  CBO said, ``No, you cannot do that,'' before. So the other side said, \n``Just change some assumptions around so you can reach that \nconclusion.'' That is what they did. They did it privately. In fact, \nthey distributed that chart on their side. They didn't even distribute \nit on this side because they knew, if we looked at it, we could \nprobably find out how erroneous it was, how fallacious it was. We \nfinally did.\n  I very much lament the secrecy and partisanship which is producing \nthis product. I guess what bothers me most is, when I ran for the \nSenate and I think when most of us sought this office and were \nprivileged enough to get elected, we came here because we wanted to \naddress the major, big problems facing this country. We are not doing \nthat. We are poised to move into the next century, the next millennium. \nWho are we as Americans? What do we want? What is our role in the \nworld?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend.\n  Who are we? How much do we want to spend on defense? What is our role \nin the Far East? Who are we as a country? What about countries like \nBosnia and Yugoslavia? How much should we spend there? What is our role \nthere? What is the proper role of Government? Not the false debate that \nis set up here--turn the money back or don't turn the money back. That \nis a vacuous, vacant, insipid argument. It is so simple-minded. That \nargument avoids asking the real questions. Questions like what is the \nproper level of government, what taxes should be collected from where, \nhow and when should we stimulate the private sector? Let's have a real \nhonest debate on policy, not a phony debate on politics.\n  This has been a phony debate on politics, this last week, on this tax \nbill. It\n\n[[Page S10322]]\n\nhas not been an honest debate on public policy, on what is right, on \nwhat the right levels of spending should be. It is not based upon the \nsame set of numbers, the same facts. Everybody comes up with his own \ncharts, his own different facts.\n  You know the old saying: Liars figure and figures lie. We cannot even \nagree on the same baseline. We can't agree on the same facts. By \ndefinition, we are just talking past each other. I guess that is what \nbothers me most and that is why I think this whole debate is most \nunreal and why it is sad. It is, in a large sense, not only a waste of \ntime because we are not addressing the points that should be addressed, \nbut it is a disservice to the American people.\n  I very much hope in the next month, in September and next year, the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle will work harder to put politics \naside and the Senators themselves will work hard to put politics aside. \nI know that might sound like a political statement, but it is what I \nbelieve. In every ounce of my body, I believe it because that is why we \nare here and that is what we should be doing.\n  I very much hope after the President vetoes this bill, either there \nis no bill so we can start all over again, or we can come together in \nsome appropriate way so we can get down to the real issues that face \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we now have a sense of why the Senator \nfrom Montana is an appreciated treasure in this body.\n  Now I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President I thank the distinguished ranking member. I \nshare the affection and feeling expressed by the Senator from Montana, \nabout how much we will miss the remarkable insightfulness and \nstewardship of the Senator from New York.\n  Let me also associate myself with his praise of the Senator from \nMontana. That was a very thoughtful and very honest statement about \nwhat has happened in the Senate. I haven't been here quite as long as \nthe Senator from Montana. I have been here 15 years. But I have never \nseen this body as polarized, as personalized, and as partisan as it is \nat this moment. I think it is very dangerous. It is dangerous for the \ncountry; divisive and difficult for the institution itself. I find it \nvery hard, frankly, to understand.\n  I guess I can understand it in macro terms. I find it hard to \nunderstand in the context of why we all run for the Senate and what we \nare in politics to try to achieve. There is something more than just \nwinning elections. There are some people around here who do not believe \nthat, but I am convinced the American people believe that. Indeed, I \nthink an adherence to that notion is what has made us different from \nother countries, and the best moments of the Senate have been when we \nhave tried to adhere to that notion.\n  This is not a bill. This is not a tax bill. This is a political \nstatement, a raw, fundamental, basic political statement. The statement \nis essentially one that seeks to say: Democrats want to spend money. \nRepublicans want to give you back your money. That is the political \nstatement. But it is not real when you look underneath it because the \nRepublicans will join in September and October in spending the money \nbecause none of them are going to go back and tell the citizens of \ntheir State they are going to cut veterans hospitals, they are going to \ncut the Coast Guard, they are going to cut the FBI, and a host of other \nprograms. None of them are going to do that. They are positioning \nthemselves to say to their electorate: Gee, Clinton made me do it, but \nI wanted to give you back your money, even though the money wasn't \nthere to give back.\n\n  It is one of the great posturings and one of the great frauds of \nrecent time from the very people who brought you Gramm-Rudman that fell \non its face, the very people who built the great deficits of the early \n1980s when they adopted the Stockman philosophy of how to create crisis \nin Government and undo Government itself, the very people who predicted \nin 1993 that if we passed the 1993 Deficit Reduction Act there would be \neconomic chaos, unemployment lines, massive economic failure.\n  The results are, here we are today with the best economy we have ever \nhad in this country, with unemployment at record low rates, with the \nstock market at high rates, with the greatest sustained period of \ngrowth, and the very same people who brought you those three great \nfailures are now trying to sell this snake oil to the American people.\n  Let's look at it as a political statement. That is what it is. It is \na political statement. It is a political statement in which they are \nprepared to take the House tax bill that was worse than the Senate bill \nand bring most of it back so that their political statement is: 60 \npercent of American taxpayers get 14 percent of the tax break that \nwon't happen. On the other hand, their political belief is that the top \n10 percent of income earners in America ought to get 47.6 percent of \nthe benefits of their tax statement that won't happen. So they can run \naround and say: Gee, we tried to service those who service us the best \nin the process of campaign financing. But the reality is, it is just a \npolitical statement.\n  The conference report remarkably delays the Senate's marriage penalty \ntax relief for earned-income tax recipients. I cannot tell you how many \ntimes we heard people on the other side of the aisle saying: Oh, my \nGod, marriage is being destroyed in America; we have a disincentive for \nmarriage, particularly among the poor in this country.\n  We heard it all through the welfare debate. We heard it from the \nRepublicans year after year. Many of us say we ought to get rid of the \nmarriage penalty. We voted to get rid of the marriage penalty, but they \ncome back and delay for working people the capacity to get rid of the \nmarriage penalty. In exchange for delaying getting rid of the marriage \npenalty, what do they think is more important?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can I have a couple minutes?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course, 2 minutes because we are running down on \ntime.\n  Mr. KERRY. They eliminate the alternative minimum tax that guarantees \nthat the wealthiest of Americans will pay some kind of tax. So they \ntrade off: Don't give the marriage penalty to the working poor, but \ngive the wealthiest of Americans an exemption from the alternative \nminimum tax that guarantees fairness.\n  That is not all they do. They wipe away the tax relief for child \ncare. They dropped the Senate provision. They provide additional \ncapital gains tax relief for investors, but they provide no tax relief \nto the people who pay most of their taxes through the payroll tax in \nAmerica, which is the vast majority of Americans.\n  There are many other egregious transfers to the wealthy at the \nexpense of the average American. So let's take this as the political \nstatement it is. It is a political statement that makes clear the \npriorities of their party, and it makes clear that they are prepared to \neven risk the high-technology boom we have been through, because when \nyou give a tax cut of this level without sufficient money to pay for it \nat a time when the economy is doing well, as Alan Greenspan and \ncountless Nobel laureates and economists have said: You are going to \nreduce capital formation and increase interest rate costs and, in \neffect, may even reverse some of the plus side that has given us this \noption.\n  It is a political statement that I think ultimately will come back to \nhaunt them because Americans know better. There is no American in this \ncountry who does not appreciate the vast commitment we have had to \nchildren, to education, to higher education, to technology creation, \ntransfers, to a host of things which make this country what it is: a \nbetter country and, in fact, an extraordinary country measured against \nall the other nations of the world in today's economy. I do not think \nwe should put it at risk, and I hope colleagues will join in rejecting \nthis political statement and in rejecting this irresponsible direction \nthey seem prepared to adopt.\n  I thank my friend for the time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor a forceful and needed statement. It was not easy to hear. It is \ntrue.\n\n[[Page S10323]]\n\n  I am happy to yield 5 minutes to my friend from Virginia, known in \nthe Finance Committee as ``commandant.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nranking member of the Finance Committee, the Senator from New York, and \nmentor to us all. His presence, at the end of this Congress, will be \nmissed in ways I do not think any of us fully appreciate.\n  First of all, I want to fully agree with the comments made by the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from Massachusetts. I will try not \nto repeat those comments. My particular frustration in dealing with the \nbill before us today is that we are considering this huge tax cut, one \nwhich would normally be designed to stimulate the economy, and yet no \neconomist I am aware of has suggested that such a stimulus is needed at \nthis particular moment.\n  In fact, what is truly needed is not being done. This bill does \nnothing to address the two most pressing structural systemic problems, \nSocial Security and Medicare. Instead of trying to bring about some \nresponsible changes to the Social Security system and the Medicare \nsystem, we are taking a projected surplus we hope will occur, but may \nor may not occur, and spend it in a way that provides a stimulus to \nthose who least need a stimulus at this particular time. Indeed, it is \nvery hard to find someone who represents the group who will be most \nbenefited by this bill who is actually asking at this time that we \nprovide them with a huge tax cut or an economic stimulus. We just do \nnot need it.\n  If we are going to enact a tax cut, it is my view that it should be \nin some targeted areas we know we are going to have to take care of \nanyhow. For example, we should have a permanent extension of the R \ntax credit, not cutting it back. Instead, we go through the same \ncharade we go through each year, which makes it difficult for those who \nmust make decisions about investing in research and development to make \nthe kinds of decisions they need to make. The bill also fails to target \ntax credits for investment in information technology training, which is \nso clearly the cutting edge of our economy today. We are not making \nthose investments in this bill.\n  What we are doing is making a huge tax cut available to those who are \ndisproportionately in the middle- and upper-income brackets in this \ncountry, and not providing the basic investment in infrastructure.\n  My personal preference is to not have a tax bill at this point. If we \ncannot do better than the one we have, I would rather have nothing, \nnotwithstanding some of the good things upon which both sides agree, \nand simply begin to pay down the debt. We are in such a hurry, however, \nto deliver the good news that we are going to give money back to you \nthat ought to be yours in the first place, even if we are only going to \ngive you $4 billion of it back in the year 2000. Even though it is only \n$4 billion, those who support this bill are attempting to take credit \nfor full $792 billion, the lion's share of which will not be until the \nend of the next decade. This bill is going to lock in statutorily those \nchanges which will make it very difficult for those who serve in \nsucceeding Congresses and succeeding administrations to make the \ncorrections they may well be called upon to make.\n  I am certain we will hear a scream from those on the other side of \nthe aisle if we even think about what could be scored in any way, \nshape, or form as a tax increase, even though it would only be \ncorrecting a tax cut that most people who have common sense and have \nsome sense of fiscal responsibility view as a mistake today.\n  I will not extend the debate. I will only observe that even though I \ndisagreed with the original proposal, there were a small number from \nthis side of the aisle who were willing to go along in the hope that \nsome sort of compromise could be reached. And we took a bad bill and \nmade it worse, and drove off the Democrats who were prepared to \nparticipate in a bipartisan solution.\n  So it does go to what the Senator from Massachusetts just suggested. \nIt is a political bill. It is regrettable because we have an \nopportunity, for the first time in a long time, to do something really \nfiscally responsible in terms of the kinds of obligations that we have \nin this body and the other body, in concert with the White House at the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I regret we are in a situation that we cannot act in a fiscally \nresponsible manner and address the true pressing needs, such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, instead of what we are doing.\n  I know the time has expired.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose this particular measure, \nand to work eventually with those on the other side of the aisle to \ncome up with a constructive, fiscally responsible measure to meet our \nlegitimate needs.\n  With that, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York, as well \nas praise, although I am not in agreement with, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Delaware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it would appear that the force of the \nargument on this side of the aisle has silenced our friends on the \nother side, in which case I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just a few moments we are going to be \ncasting an extremely important vote that will in many ways have a \ndramatic impact on the economy of this country.\n  I had the opportunity to be here in 1981 when we had a Republican \nproposal on a tax program. At that time there were 12 of us who voted \nin opposition to that program. But it passed, and we saw our Federal \ndebt grow from $400 billion to close to $4 trillion over the period of \nthe next years because of the economic forces that were put in place by \nthat tax program.\n  It had a very dramatic impact, particularly in terms of the \nallocations of wealth and the distribution of wealth here in the United \nStates. Those that had resources benefited enormously, but for the \ngreat majority of the Americans, they had to work longer and harder \njust to hold on.\n  Then in 1993, the Democrats passed a very important tax measure. The \nimplications of that tax program, which took some belt tightening, so \nto speak, had a very dramatic impact in terms of our economy. That \npolicy, more than any other single action we have seen, has had a more \npositive impact on our economy than any other action that has been \ntaken by the Government. The point is that a tax bill of this magnitude \nhas enormous impact on our economy as well as in relation to the issues \nof distribution. We now have before us, in 1999, a third rather \ndramatic proposal.\n  Mr. President, very few decisions we make in Congress will have more \nimpact on the long-term economic well-being of our nation than how we \nallocate the projected surplus. By our vote today, we are setting \npriorities that will determine whether the American economy is on firm \nground or dangerously shifting sand as we enter the 21st century. This \nvote will determine whether we have the financial capacity to meet our \nresponsibilities to future generations, and whether we have fairly \nshared the economic benefits of our current prosperity. Sadly, the \nlegislation before us today fails all of these tests. We should vote to \nreject it.\n  A tax cut of the enormous magnitude proposed by our Republican \ncolleagues would reverse the sound fiscal management which has created \nthe inflation-free economic growth of recent years. That is the clear \nview of the two principal architects of our current prosperity--Robert \nRubin and Alan Greenspan. Devoting the entire on-budget surplus to tax \ncuts will deprive us of the funds essential to preserving Medicare and \nSocial Security for future generations of retirees. It will force harsh \ncuts in education, in medical research, and in other vital domestic \npriorities. This tax cut jeopardizes our financial future--and it also \ndismally\n\n[[Page S10324]]\n\nflunks the test of fairness. When fully implemented, the Republican \nplan would give 80% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 20% of the \npopulation. The richest 1%--those earning over $300,000 a year--would \nreceive tax breaks as high as $46,000 a year, while working men and \nwomen would receive an average of only $138 a year--less than 40 cents \na day.\n  Republicans claim that the ten year surplus is three trillion dollars \nand that they are setting two-thirds of it aside for Social Security, \nand only spending one-third on tax cuts. That explanation is grossly \nmisleading. The two trillion dollars they say they are giving to Social \nSecurity already belongs to Social Security. It consists of payroll tax \ndollars expressly raised for the purpose of paying future Social \nSecurity benefits. Clearly, these dollars are insufficient to achieve \nour goal of protecting Social Security for future generations. Yet, \nRepublicans are not providing a single new dollar to strengthen Social \nSecurity. They are not extending the life of the Trust Fund for even \none day. It is a mockery to characterize those payroll tax dollars as \npart of the surplus.\n  That leaves the $964 billion on-budget surplus as the only funds \nwhich are available to address all of the nation's unmet needs over the \nnext ten years. Republicans propose to use that entire amount to fund \ntheir tax cut scheme. Since CBO projections assume that all surplus \ndollars are devoted to debt reduction, the $964 billion figure includes \nover $140 billion in debt service savings. The amount which is \navailable to be spent--either to address public needs or to cut taxes--\nis only slightly above $800 billion. As a result, the $792 billion \nRepublican tax cut will consume the entire surplus. It will inevitably \nusher in a new era of deficits--just as the baby boom generation is \nreaching retirement age.\n  Most Americans understand the word ``surplus'' to mean dollars \nremaining after all financial obligations have been met. If that common \nsense definition is applied to the federal budget, the surplus would be \nfar smaller than $964 billion.\n  We have existing obligations which should be our first \nresponsibility. We have an obligation to preserve Medicare for future \ngenerations of retirees, and to modernize Medicare benefits to include \nprescription drug assistance. The Republican budget does not provide \none additional dollar to met these Medicare needs.\n  The American people clearly believe that strengthening Social \nSecurity and Medicare should be our highest priority for using the \nsurplus. By margins of more than two to one, they view preserving \nSocial Security and Medicare as more important than cutting taxes.\n  We should use the surplus to meet these existing responsibilities \nfirst, in order to fulfill the promise of a retirement with both \nfinancial security and health security. If we do nothing, Medicare will \nbecome insolvent by 2015. The surplus gives us a unique opportunity to \npreserve Medicare, without reducing medical care, or raising premiums \nfor senior citizens, or raising the retirement age. The Republican tax \ncut would take the opportunity away. It would leave nothing for \nMedicare. In fact, this legislation will actually force additional cuts \nover the next five years. Under existing budget rules, which \nRepublicans have refused to modify, the enactment of this tax bill will \nforce a sequester of Medicare funds.\n  Senate Democrats have a realistic alternative. We have proposed to \nuse one-third of the surplus--$290 billion over the next ten years--to \nstrength Medicare and to assist senior citizens with the cost of \nprescription drugs. The Administration's 15 year budget plan provides \nan additional $500 billion for Medicare between 2010 and 2014. \nEnactment of the Republican tax cut would make this $800 billion \ntransfer to Medicare impossible. If we squander the entire surplus on \ntax breaks, there will be no money left to keep our commitment to the \nnation's elderly.\n  Unless we use a portion of the surplus to strengthen Medicare, senior \ncitizens will be confronted with nearly a trillion dollars in health \ncare cuts and skyrocketing premiums. We know who the people are who \nwill carry this enormous burden. The typical Medicare beneficiary is a \nwidow, seventy-six years old, with an annual income of $10,000. She has \none or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet \nthe Republican budget would force deep cuts in her Medicare benefits in \norder to pay for this exorbitant tax out\n  The Republican tax cut, if enacted, will also make it impossible for \nus to assist Medicare recipients with the high cost of prescription \ndrugs. That is one of the choices each of us will make when we vote on \nthis bill.\n  The cost of prescription drugs eats up a disproportionately large \nshare of the typical elderly household's income. Too many seniors today \nmust choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to \nstay healthy or to treat their illnesses. Too many seniors take half \nthe pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed \nprescriptions--because they cannot afford the high cost to prescription \ndrugs. Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense costs to \nMedicare--because they are not receiving the drugs they need. \nPharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of medical \nmiracles--but senior citizens are being denied access to the full \nbenefit of these new drug therapies. Remedying these inequities should \nbe our priority. Instead, with these enormous GOP tax breaks, we are \nignoring the basic needs of the elderly.\n\n  The Republicans claim that their tax bill provides a prescription \ndrug benefit for the elderly--but it is a meaningless provision which \nfew if any seniors will ever be able to use. The provision is \ncontingent on a whole series of other legislative actions that may not \noccur. Thus, it may never take effect. Even if it takes effect, it \nprovides an above the line tax deduction for private insurance premiums \nwhich can only be used by the small percentage of more affluent senior \ncitizens who itemize deductions. The vast majority of elderly taxpayers \nwill never be able to use this provision.\n  The projected surplus also assumes drastic cuts in a wide range of \nexisting programs over the next decade--cuts in domestic programs such \nas education, medical research and environmental cleanup; and even cuts \nin national defense. We have an obligation to adequately fund these \nprograms. If existing programs grow at the rate of inflation over the \nnext decade--and no new programs are created and no existing programs \nare expanded--the surplus would be reduced by $584 billion. That is the \namount it will cost to merely continue funding current discretionary \nprograms at their inflation-adjusted level.\n  In other words, the Republican tax breaks for the wealthy would \nnecessitate more than a twenty percent across the board cut in \ndiscretionary spending--in both domestic programs and national \ndefense--by the end of the next decade. If defense is funded at the \nAdministration's proposed level--and it is highly unlikely that the \nRepublican Congress will do less--domestic spending would have to be \ncut 38% by 2009. No one can reasonably argue that cuts that deep should \nbe made, or will be made.\n  We know what cuts of this magnitude would mean in human terms by the \nend of the decade. We know who will be hurt.\n  375,000 fewer children will receive a Head Start.\n  6.5 million fewer children will participate in Title I education \nprograms for disadvantaged students.\n  14,000 fewer biomedical research grants will be available from the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  1,431,000 fewer veterans will receive VA medical care.\n  These are losses that the American people will not be willing to \naccept.\n  The Democratic alternative would restore $290 billion for such \ndomestic priorities, substantially reducing the size of the proposed \ncuts. A significant reduction would still be required over the decade. \nOne thing is clear--even with a bare bones budget, we cannot afford a \ntax cut of the magnitude the Republicans are proposing.\n  Our Republican colleagues claim that these enormous tax cuts will \nhave no impact on Social Security, because they are not using payroll \ntax revenues. On the contrary, the fact that the Republican budget \ncommits every last dollar of the on-budget surplus to tax cuts does \nimperil Social Security.\n  Revenue estimates projected ten years into the future are notoriously\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\nunreliable. As the Director of the Congressional Budget Office candidly \nacknowledged: ``Ten year budget projections are highly uncertain.'' \nDespite this warning, the Republicans tax cut leaves no margin for \nerror. If we commit the entire surplus to tax cuts and the full surplus \ndoes not materialize, or if we have unbudgeted emergency expenses, \nSocial Security revenues will be required to cover the shortfall.\n  The vote which we cast today--the choices which we make--will say a \ngreat deal about our values. We should use the surplus as an \nopportunity to help those in need--senior citizens living on small \nfixed incomes, children who need educational opportunities, millions of \nmen and women whose lives may well depend on medical research and \naccess to quality health care. We should not use the surplus to further \nenrich those who are already the most affluent. The issue is a question \nof fundamental values and fundamental fairness.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans returned from the Senate-House Conference \nwith a substantially more regressive bill than the one the Senate \npassed last week. The current bill contains a costly reduction in \ncapital gains tax rates which was not in the Senate bill. The current \nbill completely eliminates the estate tax, providing enormous new tax \nbreaks to the richest few. It also provides more than twice as much in \ntax cuts for multinational corporations as the Senate bill did. Yet, \nthe permanent extension of the research and development tax credit--the \nprovision which would do the most to help many of those businesses \nwhose innovations have created jobs and fueled our prosperity--was not \nincluded in this legislation. Instead, only a brief extension of the \ncredit was provided. How extraordinarily shortsighted. In order to plan \nthis research efficiently, the companies need to know what the rules \nwill be in future years. The permanent extension of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit is the type of tax cut we should be passing. \nUnfortunately it is not before us.\n  Democrats believes in tax cuts which are affordable and fairly \ndistributed. The Democratic alternative, which I support, would provide \n$290 billion in tax relief over the next decade. That is an amount the \nnation can afford without endangering the economic progress we have \nmade and without ignoring our responsibilities to Medicare, to Social \nSecurity, to education, and to other vital programs. We oppose the $792 \nbillion Republican tax bill because it would poison our prosperity and \nlead to a crippling rise in interest rates. We oppose the Republican \nbill because it would consume the entire surplus, and distribute the \noverwhelming majority of it to those who already have the most.\n  That is not the way the American people want to spend their surplus. \nI urge my colleagues to reject the bill. The American people deserve \nbetter than this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I say to my friend from Massachusetts that the \nOffice of Management and Budget has computed exactly what those \nsequesters would be, and they are horrendous.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman and \nhis committee for the work they have done on this bill.\n  I rise to encourage my colleagues to vote yes when this vote is \ntaken. I have had the privilege of sitting in that Chair, Mr. \nPresident, for a good part of this debate and have seen, with very \nclear eyes, two different philosophies on the floor of the Senate. One \nis a philosophy that says that Government spends money better than \npeople can. That philosophy would grow Government. The other philosophy \nsays we trust people; we don't trust Government as much. That \nphilosophy, which trusts people, says let's grow families. Let's trust \nthem to spend it for their needs because they can do it better than we \ncan imagine it here inside the beltway.\n  As I look at this plan that has been produced by our Finance \nCommittee, and through this conference process, my conditions for \nvoting for this have been met. I see both sides allocating the same \namount to Social Security. I see both sides allocating the same amount \nto Medicare, save that we do not expand Medicare, but we dedicate a \ngreat deal of money to Medicare.\n  I see both sides making the same commitment to debt reduction. In \nfact, this Republican proposal conditions the tax cuts upon the actual \nrealization of the surpluses. So people that say we are spending the \nsurplus or spending it without it actually being realized, we will not \ndo that. We will not spend it in the sense of tax cuts if, in fact, \nthese surpluses are not realized.\n  So the question really becomes, Who is going to spend the surplus? \nOur friends on the other side would do it to grow this Government. We, \non this side, would spend it to grow families because we trust people \nmore than we trust Government to spend it wisely.\n  I tell you, as I look at the things that are provided in this tax \npackage, I like what I see. When I look at reducing estate taxes, I say \nyes because, as a philosophical matter, I do not believe that it is the \nGovernment's business to tell you and me how we allocate our estates \nwhen we die. It is about redistribution of economics, which is what \nthey are proposing, which is the law. I don't think that is the \nGovernment's role. I think we should trust people to distribute their \nmoney as they see fit.\n\n  I look at the marriage penalty reduction. I don't think there should \nbe a bias in our Tax Code against people marrying. I think it is \nterribly unfair when you have two working spouses, one has a high \nincome, and the other may have a lower income; one is a corporate \nexecutive, the other is a schoolteacher; but the schoolteacher, the one \nwith the lower income, gets taxed at the higher rate. What is fair \nabout that? That is wrong. That is a bias against marriage that we \nshould eradicate. If President Clinton wants to veto that, I will let \nhim justify it.\n  I look at the reduction of capital gains taxes, and I wonder, \nfrankly, why we are taxing this capital twice. We should not be taxing \nit. We should be reinvesting it.\n  That brings me to an important point. I am extremely frustrated every \ntime I hear President Clinton or any other politician take credit for \ncreating jobs. You and I, as politicians, as public servants, do not \ncreate jobs, unless we own the stock or unless we buy a bond, unless we \ninvest in the free enterprise system that allows labor to go to work. \nWhen you hear President Clinton or any other politician claim they have \ncreated jobs, the predicate of that claim is that we are a centrally \nplanned economy. And we are not. We are a free market republic.\n  I think if my party has any contribution to make to this country, it \nis to make sure we do not become a socialistic, democratic welfare \nstate, because if we become that, we will suffer the kinds of economic \nconsequences that, frankly, our friends in Europe and Asia are \nsuffering, which is little or no growth, high inflation, high interest \nrates, enormous unemployment rolls. That is the kind of system I don't \nwant to be part of creating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If I may have 1 final minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 1 more minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I think that is what is at stake. What kind of \nan America do we want? Whom do we trust? Are we the party of government \nor are we the party of the people?\n  It is a question of whom you trust. It is a question of how you spend \nthe money. When it comes to the essential programs, our programs are \nthe same. When it comes to spending, we spend it differently. One does \nit for government; the other does it for families.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have been on and off the floor all day. We have been \nat this for about 6 hours. I suspect most everything has been said, but \nwe all, of course, haven't said it.\n  I rise in support of what we are attempting--for the idea that we can \ndo the things that are essential for the Federal Government to do and \nat the same time return substantial amounts of money to the people who \nown money, the taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\n  I have been amazed at all the discussion that has gone on. We are \ntalking about a fairly simple thing--tax relief. Yet I hear from the \nother side of the aisle how damaging that is to the economy. That is \nhard to imagine, isn't it, that returning money to people who have paid \nit in is going to damage the economy.\n  We have tax relief based on our best estimate, provided by those who \ndo professional estimating, that we will have a $3 trillion surplus \nover the next 10 years. Will it happen? Who knows. No one can guarantee \nit. But that is the way you have to plan any enterprise, by the best \nestimates you can make. We find ourselves now, of course, paying the \nhighest taxes as a percentage of gross national product of any time \nsince World War II. Surprising, isn't it, in this large of an economy. \nIt certainly means one thing; that is, that the Government continues to \ngrow.\n  I think it is interesting to see the polls. When they ask, what is \nyour highest priority? Do you like Social Security? Do you like \nMedicare? Do you like tax reduction? Tax reduction generally is the \nthird one. That is not the point. We are setting aside Social Security \nbefore we do tax reduction. We are sustaining enough money to take care \nof Medicare. So that is not the choice.\n\n  The better poll would be: What do you do after you have taken care of \nSocial Security? What do you do when you have taken care of Medicare? \nShould you return the money? I think so.\n  I saw somebody use an example of the simplest way to look at it, \nsuggesting that you have three dollar bills in your hands, each \nrepresenting $1 trillion. You say: I am going to set aside two of these \ndollars to do something with Social Security because that is where the \nsurplus comes from. I am going to spend part of the third one for \nMedicare and the other costs that will be there. And about two-thirds \nof the last one we are going to give back to the people who sent it in \nbecause it is an overpayment of taxes. It is a fairly simple thing.\n  We have, of course, in this case, as we do in many, a pretty strong \ndifference of philosophy. We have on that side of the aisle people who \nprefer more government, more spending, more taxes. That is the \nphilosophy. I understand that. I don't happen to agree with it.\n  Our party, on the other hand, is one that says we ought to slim down \nthe Federal Government; we ought to move more and more government \ntowards the States and the counties, leave more and more money in the \nhands of the people. That is the philosophy, a difference of \nphilosophy. That is so often the basis of our disagreement on many \nthings. I understand that. It is perfectly legitimate. But if you want \nmore government, that is fine. If you want the Government to spend more \nmoney, that is fine. That is a philosophy, one that has, through the \nyears, been on that side of the aisle. It is not really a surprise.\n  People say, of course, how is it going to affect me? Well, it affects \nus in very real ways:\n  Estate taxes: I have a lot of people who farm and ranch in Wyoming \nwho are very concerned about that. Capital gains taxes: More and more \npeople are investing their money. The capital gains tax needs to be \nchanged. Insurance deductions for health insurance, that people pay \ntheir own premiums, to be deducted, that is a reasonable thing to do. \nThe marriage penalty, we have talked about that--a very reasonable \nthing to do.\n  So we often get lost in the details when we say, as taxpayers, what \ndoes this do for us? I think it does a great deal for us. I think we \nshould move forward. I am sorry we don't have agreement with the \ngentleman at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, but that ought not \nto keep us from doing what we think is right, and that is the thing we \nought to do.\n  I urge that my associates do the right thing.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the American people want us to save Social \nSecurity. They want us to fix Medicare. They want us to give them more \ncontrol over their children's education. They want us to cut back the \nsize of the bloated Federal bureaucracy and pay down the debt. Those \nare the clearly stated priorities of the people we represent, those \nwhose interests we are pledged to protect.\n  The Congress has tried to do something about the impending insolvency \nof the Social Security system, but we have been blocked by the \nPresident's disingenuous statements about the kind of lockbox \nlegislation he could support. The President rejected the \nrecommendations of the bipartisan commission that was created to \nprovide a basis for preventing the bankruptcy of Medicare. The \nPresident has put politics ahead of the needs of the people, but, \nunfortunately, so have we.\n  The American people want, need, and deserve tax relief. They want us \nto reform and simplify our overly burdensome 44,000-page Tax Code that \nunfairly benefits special interests and overtaxes American families.\n  Yet, here we are debating the merits, or not, of an $800 billion tax \nrelief bill that we know for a fact the President will veto.\n  Mr. President, let's be honest and acknowledge what's going on here. \nThis bill is going nowhere. When it comes back to the Congress after \nthe President's vetoes it, we should be prepared to set aside pure \npolitics, and instead focus on producing results that benefit the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, there are some very good provisions in this bill that \nhelp American taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money. But most \nof these very important tax provisions for average Americans are put \noff for the future, while many of the perks for big business and \nspecial interests take effect immediately. This bill delays meaningful \ntax relief for the average taxpayer until 2001 or later, yet it \ncomplicates the tax system with a raft of new and renewed exemptions, \nexceptions, and carve-outs for special interests that go into effect \nimmediately.\n  Just under $6 billion of the entire $792 billion in tax relief in \nthis bill is effective next year. Just 77 of the 180 provisions in this \nbill provide any tax relief at all in the year 2000. More than 80 \npercent of the tax cuts are delayed until 2005 or later. And after \nphasing in the most important provisions over a 10-year period, the \nwhole tax cut package sunsets after 2009, when we would presumably \nrevert to the burdensome and overly complex tax system with which we \nare struggling today.\n  I firmly believe we should repeal, once and for all, the disgraceful \ntax penalty that punishes couples who want to get married. This bill \ndoes provide relief from the onerous marriage penalty, but these \nimportant provisions do not even begin to take effect until 2001 and \nthen they are phased in over a period of four or five years.\n  Income tax rate reductions don't start to phase in until 2001, and \nthen only the lowest bracket sees a half-percent rate cut, while other \nrate cuts are delayed until 2005. In fact, according to an informal \nestimate I was given, an American family making $65,000 per year would \nget just $47 in tax cuts based on the income tax rate reductions in \nthis bill in 2002.\n  We should also slash the death tax that prevents a father or a mother \nfrom leaving the hard-earned fruits of their labor to their children. \nThere is absolutely no relief from the onerous death taxes in 2000. \nEstate tax reductions would be phased-in over a 9-year period until \ncompletely eliminated in 2009, but then this entire tax cut package \nwould terminate and the death tax would be fully reinstated.\n  At the same time, poultry farmers get an immediate tax break, \ntotaling $30 million over 10 years, to convert chicken manure into \nelectricity. Small seaplane operators don't have to collect tickets \ntaxes, starting immediately, giving them a break of $11 million. \nManufacturers of fishing tackle boxes get an immediate excise tax \nbreak, so that they can more competitively price their tackle boxes to \ncompete with the tool box industry. And the people who make and sell \narrows for hunting fish and game get an immediate cut in their taxes.\n  Why are we giving a big break to chicken farmers when American \nfamilies get not a dime in tax relief? Why don't people flying on \nseaplanes have to pay ticket taxes like people flying on other commuter \nplanes? What compelling reason is there to give fishing tackle box \nmanufacturers a tax break,\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\nwhile family-owned businesses get no relief from the confiscatory death \ntaxes for quite some time?\n  Many of the other provisions in this bill that provide tax relief for \neducation, health care, and other issues important to American families \nare implemented gradually or simply delayed for several years. \nLikewise, some of the provisions that benefit small businesses and tax-\nexempt organizations do not take effect for a number of years. Yet most \nof the provisions that give even more tax breaks to the oil and gas \nindustry, financial services companies, high tech industry, insurance \ncompanies, and defense industry take effect early. The priorities in \nthis bill are seriously skewed in the wrong direction.\n  In addition, this bill does nothing to fundamentally reform our \nunfair and overly complex tax code. For years, and this bill is no \nexception, we have compounded the tax code's complexity and put tax \nloopholes for special interests ahead of tax relief for working \nfamilies. The result is a tax code that is a bewildering 44,000 page \ncatalogue of favors for a privileged few and a chamber of horrors for \nthe rest of America--except perhaps the accountants and lawyers.\n  The special interest set-asides and carve-outs in this bill merely \nexacerbate the complexity of the tax code. This bill adds new \nloopholes, new schemes, new ideas to keep lawyers and accountants busy.\n  It is not right to pay back special interests ahead of American \nfamilies. It is not fair to give more tax incentives and exemptions and \ncuts to big business, when individual taxpayers get no relief.\n  If this bill had any chance of becoming law, perhaps it would have \nbeen prioritized somewhat differently.\n  Mr. President, this tax bill is based on the premise that we will \nhave nearly $3 trillion in the federal budget surplus over the next 10 \nyears. Let's look at the priorities for those surplus funds.\n  Our first priority must be to lock up the Social Security Trust Funds \nto prevent Presidential or Congressional raids on workers' retirement \nfunds to pay for so-called ``emergency'' spending or new big government \nprograms. Most Americans don't share the view that dubious pork-barrel \nprojects, such as millions of dollars in assistance to reindeer \nranchers and maple sugar producers, should be treated as emergencies to \nbe paid for with Social Security, but that is exactly what Congress did \nearlier this year.\n  That leaves nearly $1 trillion in non-Social Security revenue \nsurpluses. I believe a healthy portion of the projected non-Social \nSecurity surplus should be returned to the American people in the form \nof tax cuts. I also believe we have a responsibility to balance the \nneed for tax relief with other pressing national priorities.\n  After locking up the Social Security surpluses, I would dedicate 62 \npercent of the remaining $1 trillion in non-Social Security surplus \nrevenues, or about $620 billion, to shore up the Social Security Trust \nFunds, extending the solvency of the Social Security system until at \nleast the middle of the next century. The President promised to save \nSocial Security, but he failed to include this proposal anywhere in his \nbudget submission. In fact, he has since proposed or supported spending \nbillions of dollars from the surplus on other government programs, \ndepleting the funds needed to ensure retirement benefits are paid as \npromised.\n  I would also reserve 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to \nprotect the Medicare system, and use 5 percent to begin paying down our \n$5.6 trillion national debt.\n  With the remaining $230 billion in surplus revenues, plus about $300 \nbillion raised by closing inequitable corporate tax loopholes and \nending unnecessary spending subsidies, I believe we could provide \nmeaningful tax relief that benefits Americans and fuels the economy.\n  The bill before the Senate includes provisions that are similar to \nsome of the proposals I would include in such a plan, which are \ntargeted toward lower- and middle-income Americans, family farmers, \nsmall businessmen and women, and families.\n  I believe we should expand the 15% tax bracket to allow 17 million \nAmericans to pay taxes at the lowest rate, and this bill reflects a \nsimilar focus. The bill also increases the income threshold for tax-\ndeferred contributions to IRAs, although delayed, and very gradually \nincreases  the amount that employees can contribute each year to \nemployer-sponsored retirement plans. We should make these increases \neffective immediately to encourage more Americans to save now for their \nretirement. And this bill takes several steps to provide meaningful tax \nrelief for American families by at least starting to eliminate the \nonerous marriage penalty and provide relief from confiscatory estate \ntaxes.\n\n  What the bill before the Senate does not do is provide much-needed \nincentives for saving. Restoring to every American the tax exemption \nfor the first $200 in interest and dividend income would go a long way \ntoward reversing the abysmal savings rate in this country.\n  Most important, the bill does not eliminate immediately the Social \nSecurity earnings test. This tax unfairly penalizes senior citizens who \nchoose to, or in many cases, have to work by taking away $1 of their \nSocial Security benefits for every $3 they earn. There is no \njustifiable reason to force seniors with decades of knowledge and \nexpertise out of the workforce by imposing such a punitive tax. And in \nour modern society, when many seniors have to work to survive, we \nshould not keep this Depression-era relic in law.\n  This is the kind of package that I believe could form the basis of a \ntax cut bill that properly balances national priorities and provides \nfair tax relief to average Americans and their families without further \ncomplicating our tax code. It would be a better step in the right \ndirection toward economically sound and equitable tax relief and \nprovide incentives to undertake real reform of our tax system.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act \nbecause I believe it reflects a commitment to provide relief from a \nsystem that taxes your salary, your investments, your property, your \nexpenses, your marriage, and your death. We must send a message to the \nAmerican people and to the President that we must repeal the onerous \nmarriage penalty and estate taxes that burden America's families.\n  This bill is not acceptable to me. Special interests get the biggest \nbreaks, and they get them right away. All the American families get are \nthe leftovers. My problem with this bill is not with the size of the \ntax cuts, but who benefits.\n  However, its passage and subsequent veto represent our only hope for \nmeaningful tax relief for those working families who need it most. If \nthis bill were to die today, so would the possibility of achieving \nmeaningful tax relief this year. By passing this bill and forcing the \nPresident to address tax issues, I believe we hold open the possibility \nof entering into negotiations between the Administration and the \nCongress to provide meaningful tax relief for the benefit of all \nAmericans.\n  The sad reality is that this bill will not give a single American \nfamily even one extra dollar in their pockets, because it will be \nvetoed as soon as it arrives at the White House. But after this bill is \nvetoed by the President, our responsibility to the people we represent \nmust be to work to address their priorities. We must save Social \nSecurity, fix the Medicare system, and return to the people more \ncontrol over their lives and the lives of their children and families.\n  At the same time, we can start to work on crafting a meaningful tax \nrelief bill that truly benefits the American people--a tax bill that \neven President Clinton could not refuse to sign into law. That is what \nthe American people want and need.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to my \nlearned friend from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and my good friend from \nNew York.\n  This bill before us is unfair and it is unwise. It is unwise because \nthe projected surplus that the bill uses for the tax cut is based on \nour abiding by spending limits that have already been breached and \nwhich would require huge cuts that we cannot make and should not make \nin veterans' programs, education programs, criminal law enforcement, \nand other important programs for the people of this Nation.\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\n  If the surplus to this extent materializes, in fact we should then \nreduce the national debt that has been built up, particularly over the \nlast 20 years. That would be the greatest gift of all that we could \nmake for the American people, the reduction of that debt, because that \nwould be a reduction in the interest rates which people pay on their \nmortgages and cars and credit cards, and that would truly be a \ncontribution to the well-being of our constituents.\n  The American people also sense that the tax program before us is \nunfair and not just unwise; they know--this has not apparently been \ncontested--that 40 percent goes to the upper 1 percent of our people. \nThe highest income 1 percent get over 40 percent of the tax benefits in \nthis bill. More than 80 percent of the tax benefits in this bill go to \nthe upper 20 percent of our people.\n  It is, in fact, true that we are dealing with the people's money. It \nhas frequently been said here that what we are talking about is whether \nor not to give back to at least some of the people their own money. It \nis true. This money--this surplus--belongs to the American people. But \nthe economy belongs to the American people as well. The Social Security \nsystem belongs to the American people as well. The Medicare system \nbelongs to the American people as well. The Head Start program belongs \nto the American people. Veteran hospitals belong to the American \npeople.\n  It is important that we consider what to do with a projected \nsurplus--that we deal with this surplus as what it is, the people's \nmoney, but look at all of what we do here as hopefully carrying out the \npeople's business.\n  This bill takes us down the wrong road--the road back toward the \ndeficit ditch that we are finally beginning to climb out of. It has \ntaken us fewer years than expected. But, nonetheless, it has taken us \nabout 6 years to get out of the ditch which we got ourselves into, \nparticularly during the decade of the 1980s.\n  Now that we are finally out of that ditch, we should stay out of that \nditch. We should use any real surplus--not projected surplus but any \nreal surplus--to protect Social Security and Medicare, and have a \nprescription program, and to do what is vitally necessary to invest in \nour people, particularly through their education, but then to pay down \nthat national debt and to give back to the people what they truly want, \nwhich is a sound economy on a long-term basis and low interest rates on \na long-term basis. That is what would be guaranteed if, in fact, we \napply any real surplus beyond Social Security and Medicare prescription \nneeds, beyond the investment in education, if we take that surplus, if \nit is real, and pay down the national debt.\n  Instead, this bill takes us down a different road, a road which will \ndeliver a huge tax cut mainly for those among us who need it the least \nand who are, for the most part, not even asking us for it. This bill \nrepresents an imprudent and unfair step, and we should not take it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I say to my friend from Michigan \nthat, as he well knows, we are in the second year of a budget surplus, \nthe first such sequence since the 1950s. Let's not spoil it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my friend, the chairman.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, I want to talk for 10 minutes about \nwhy this is a good deal for the American people and why it is high time \nwe set in motion a series of tax cuts which will give them back the \nmoney they are paying into the Government that we don't need.\n  First of all, everybody talks about the fact that tax reduction comes \nin over a decade, and it comes in 1 year at a time. Almost everybody \nwho is critical of that says at the same time they want to save Social \nSecurity.\n  The truth of the matter is there is $3.3 trillion in accumulated \nsurpluses over the next decade. In order to make sure you are \nprotecting Social Security, each and every year of that 10 years, a \nsubstantial portion of that money belongs to the Social Security trust \nfund. So you can't have tax cuts that use up the Social Security trust \nfund. Anybody who says we are is ignoring the facts.\n  The reason we have to have a phased in tax cut is because we are \nsaving every single penny that belongs to Social Security for Social \nSecurity. Then we come along and say, let's have a tax cut, and let's \nphase it in each and every year.\n  People can come to the floor and be critical of how slow it is and \nhow long it takes to get the marriage tax penalty totally eliminated. \nBut the truth of the matter is when you pass this tax bill tonight, and \nif the President were to sign it, you have put into law a change in the \nTax Code which will get rid of the marriage tax penalty and many of the \nother onerous provisions in this law. Still, after you have done that, \neven though some of our best money crunchers in America have it wrong, \nthere is $505 billion--not zero, as some people have said, $505 \nbillion--off a freeze which you can spend where you want over the next \ndecade, be it for defense, be it for discretionary programs such as \neducation, or you can use $90 billion to $100 billion of it, or as much \nas you want, to make sure you fix Medicare, if that is your goal.\n  So for starters, there are so many people out there with wrong \nnumbers and attacks on this proposal, who have the wrong facts, that I \nmerely want to answer that part. We take care of Social Security \nregardless of what the President of the United States says. There is \nmoney in this budget for Medicare reform, if you choose to do it. There \nis money in this budget plan to pay for defense and to pay for \neducation, and other high priority items, and to take care of the needs \nof this country.\n  What we set out to do was to say we shouldn't keep more than we need, \nand we shouldn't set billions of dollars around in places up here in \nthe National Government assuming that one way or another it will be \nthere when it is time to give a tax cut.\n  I submit that if you believe that you really do believe in the tooth \nfairy because, as a matter of fact, if you set that much money around \nup here and it is not used, it will be spent.\n  We ask the question: Do you want to use this surplus to grow the \npocketbooks of Americans, or do you want to increase their savings \naccounts, or would you like to spend it? That is the issue before us \ntoday. It is a blessing that we have this surplus.\n  First, we should set aside enough for Social Security. We have done \nthat. The bill then provides for our taxpayers to get some relief. It \npreserves and expands the child care credit. It protects various \neducation credits, foster care tax credit, the alternative minimum \ntax--a fancy name. But what it means is that the way the Tax Code is \nwritten today, we give average Americans, middle-income Americans, \ncredits and the like in the Tax Code. Then we take it away under the \nalternative minimum tax--like we give you a benefit and we take it \naway. We call it an alternative minimum tax, as if you are so rich you \nshouldn't get these credits.\n  Do you know that if we do not pass this tax bill, 7 out of 10 \nAmerican taxpayers will lose some of their credits to the AMT by the \nyear 2008, just about the time that we wiped out the AMT?\n  Please, Mr. President, sign this bill. The bill provides tax relief \nfor health care, long-term care, and has small business incentives. It \nis a bill that is good for farmers, for working men and women, and \nfamilies. Overall, it is a very good bill.\n  I also say, Mr. President, please sign this bill. The final tax plan \nis an excellent tax plan that moves toward slower, flatter, and simpler \ntax and moves toward taxing income that is consumed, not income that is \nsaved, earned, and invested.\n  On the business side, it moves closer to allowing business to deduct \nthe cost of investments in the year they are made, thereby making them \nmore competitive.\n  This bill overall moves toward tax equity so everyone will get a \nbreak for health care regardless of where they work--a big company, \nsmall company, or a ma-and-pa one-stop shop. People who need health \ncoverage say: Mr. President, please sign this bill.\n\n[[Page S10329]]\n\n  The bill focuses on generational equity. There are child care credits \nand long-term credits for the elderly. The President asks, be sure to \ntake care of our senior citizens. We have taken care of them. Senior \ncitizens, we are taking care of your children and your grandchildren \nwho are interested in being helped because they pay more taxes than \nthey should. On behalf of the seniors in the country, and their \ndaughters, sons, and grandchildren, Mr. President, sign this bill.\n  The bill takes the best part of the House and Senate bill and \nattempts to make it law. Broad-based tax reduction is fair. It cuts the \ntax rate in the lowest bracket first. Lowering of the 15-percent \nbracket happens before any other brackets are lowered. This sequencing \nrecognizes that 98 million Americans are the people most urgently in \nneed of a tax cut. Lowering the 15 percent to 14 percent is a 7-percent \ncut. Widening the lower bracket does two important things: It returns \nmillions of Americans to the lowest brackets, fighting back ``bracket \ncreep.'' In my own State of New Mexico, 151,000 New Mexicans will be \nreturned to the lowest bracket; another 83,000 will see taxes cut.\n  Talking about the marriage penalty for a minute, which everybody has \nspoken to--I won't be as eloquent as some--it is absolutely \npreposterous that the United States of America would punish by way of \ntaxation a man and a woman who are married and both working, as opposed \nto a man and woman who are single. The marriage penalty is the wrong \nthing for America today. It was the wrong thing when we passed it. We \nought to get rid of it.\n  In behalf of millions of married couples who are begging Congress to \nbe fair with them and get rid of this penalty on their marriage, please \nsign this tax bill.\n  Because of the progressive rate structure in our tax code, Americans \nin the 28, 31, 36, and 39.6 tax brackets will all see their taxes cut.\n  The marriage penalty relief in this bill is overdue and well done. \nThere is roughly $117 billion in marriage penalty relief. Fully fifty \npercent of the bills resources go to a broad-based and marriage-penalty \ntax relief.\n  The bill also phases in a doubling of the standard deduction to \nfinally eliminate the marriage penalty. In addition to lowering federal \nincome taxes by eliminating the marriage penalty for 567,170 New Mexico \nfamilies, it will also save New Mexicans $72.4 million in New Mexico \nincome taxes as well! Getting married would no longer be a taxable \nevent.\n  The bill increases the child care credit. It increases the credit for \nfamilies with AGI incomes under $30,000. By 2006, the credit will be 40 \npercent. This means that 29,042 New Mexican families will get more help \nwith their child care expenses and this is a real helping hand because \nchild care can cost as much as $3,133 to $5,200 a year per child. These \n29,042 families with child care expenses say, ``Mr. President, please \nsign this bill.''\n  This bill improves tax treatment for education 7 ways. The 331,815 \npublic school students in New Mexico would be benefitted if this bill \nwere to become law, so I say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.''\n  This bill provides a deduction for prescription drug insurance, \nprovides an extra exemption for the caretaker of elderly and infirm \nparents and grandparents, and provides a deduction for long term care \ninsurance.\n  43 percent of all Americans will need long term care at some point in \ntheir lives and 25 percent of all families are caring for an elderly \nrelative today. It is an emotional and financial commitment. The long \nterm care deduction can help make it less of a financial burden. For \nthe 19 million Americans expected to need long term care, I say, ``Mr. \nPresident, please, please sign this bill.''\n  This bill cuts taxes by $43.9 billion by providing tax relief to \nfamilies facing health care costs.\n  The bill expands the deduction for health insurance so that everyone \nis treated the same regardless of whether they work for a big \ncorporation with a fancy health insurance benefit plan, or whether they \nwork for a small business that does not provided health insurance. This \nprovision could help 43 million uninsured plus the 10.2 million who \nhave access to health insurance but decline to participate because of \nthe cost and it should help the 1.4 million children of self-employed \nwho lack health insurance.\n\n  In New Mexico this provision could have a big impact and make a big \ndifference. We have 340,000 uninsured New Mexicans who belong to \nfamilies where some in the family works.\n  On behalf of all these people with no health insurance or with \nunaffordable health insurance, I ask, ``Mr. President, please sign this \nbill.''\n  I have talked about why this bill is good for the American family. \nBut there are two provisions that are good for the economy.\n  Lowering the capital gains rate is the best economic policy and I am \npleased that this bill lowers the top rate to 18 percent. I am also \npleased that the bill increases expensing from $19,000 to $30,000.\n  This bill also phases in a reduction of rates and then repeals the \nestate tax. The estate tax is perceived as one of the most confiscatory \ntaxes of all time and it is one that disrupts small business and farms. \nI am pleased that the bill gets rid of the death tax. Dying should not \nbe a taxable event.\n  For all of the constituents who have written me about the unfairness \nof the death tax I say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.''\n  The bill increases the amount that can be contributed for all IRAs. \nIt is phased in so that eventually $5,000 a year could be contributed. \nThe bill also increases eligibility for those who can participate in \nRoth IRAs and includes ``catch-up'' contribution limits for people aged \n50 and over.\n  For the 15 million people who would be helped by these retirement \nsecurity provisions, I say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.''\n  The bill also does some things that really need doing. First it \nextends the R credit for five years. It also includes some \ndesperately needed tax relief for the oil and gas industry.\n  I am very pleased with this bill. It is fair, it is the right thing \nto do and it should be done before the money get spent on more \ngovernment.\n  I close today by saying I have been working on budgets for a long \ntime. I have heard criticisms of budgets that we produced, and we have \ncriticized budgets that the opposite side produced.\n  The criticism of this tax cut, phased in over 10 years, is beyond \nanything I could ever have imagined. With surpluses of this size, for \nthe White House and those who oppose it to be inventing numbers and \naccusations that are totally unfounded is something I never expected. \nAs a matter of fact, there is even concern about the moderate economic \nassumptions in this budget. We grew at 6 percent the year before last, \n4\\1/2\\ percent last year, over 2 percent this year, and we plan the \nnext decade to grow at 2 to 2.3 percent, a very modest growth. We even \nplan two recessions in there, and we still get these surpluses.\n  Frankly, I think they are fair projections. At least they are fair \nenough to make sure we don't risk them being spent. All we are saying \nis, over the next decade set this much aside, just don't collect it. We \nare not going to cut taxes. We are just not going to collect it. It \nwill stay with the American people. It is going to be phased in.\n  Fellow Americans, it will take a while for some of them, but maybe we \nshould ask the question for the other side and the White House who are \ncritical that it takes too long for them to come in, When will their \ntaxes come in? When will their tax reductions come? Perhaps never.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. On behalf of the distinguished Republican chairman and \nmanager of the bill, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding me that \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the vote on our tax relief bill is nothing less than a \nvote of confidence, reaffirmation of our belief in the wisdom of the \nAmerican people and of our faith in the capitalist system. It all boils \ndown to one basic, fundamental question: who has first claim on the \nincome of Americans--does it belong to the government or to the \nindividual families who create the income through the sweat of their \nbrows and the genius of their (brains?)\n  The President and the vast majority of our friends on the other side \nof the aisle act like the money belongs to the\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\ngovernment. They reject our tax relief bill as ``too big,'' as if \ntaxpayers earn income at the sufferance of the government. Under this \nview, Uncle Sam does not live under a budget he sets the budget for \nevery American family, which must be content with the table scraps \nafter the enormous appetite for spending in Washington has been \nsatiated.\n  Two and one-quarter centuries ago, the rejection of this arrogant, \ngovernment-comes-first theory of taxation was the impetus for the \nfounding of our Nation. Our political forefathers would not stand for \nthe notion that Americans were mere pawns of a distant court, which \ncould raid their purses and pocketbooks at any whim. America was \nfounded not on concepts that divide peoples, such as race, or \ngeography, but on the American Idea that brings us all together: the \ninalienable right to liberty.\n  From our Nation's very conception, this idea has served as a beacon \nfor people of all creeds and colors seeking refuge from he heavy hand \nof meddlesome government. In America, the government serves the people, \nand must necessarily trust the people to do what is right by and for \nthemselves. The government should not try to do it all. We provide a \nsafety net for the least fortunate, those who cannot help themselves, \nbut everyone else is trusted with the responsibility of providing for \ntheir own financial security.\n  And by all accounts, this combination of liberty for our citizens and \nrestraint on the part of the public sector has, in fact, succeeded. By \nthe end of the 19th Century, America was in the forefront of the \nIndustrial Revolution. By the mid-20th Century, despite the MIRE of a \nworldwide depression, the United States was able to mobilize its \nindustries and its men to rout one own of the twin evils of tyranny in \nthe Second World War. And by the close of this Century, we succeeded in \ndefeating the other Soviet Communism, by the force of our will, the \ncommitment of a strong Commander-in-Chief, Ronald Reagan, and the power \nof our competing idea of liberty. Our Nation is President Reagan's \nshining city on a hill, the economic envy of the world and the \ndestination of all who yearn for freedom.\n\n  But this President and his supporters in the Congress just don't get \nit. The tax burden on our citizens is at an all time, peacetime high--\n20.6 percent of the economy. Meanwhile, the federal government will be \novercharging the taxpayers by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. A Nation that trusted its people, that protected their liberty, \nwould not flinch from the right thing to do: cut taxes so that our \nfamilies can enjoy the fruits of their labors, instead of greedy \nWashington programs. This tax bill does just that, leaving $792 billion \nin the hands of the people to whom it belongs.\n  This tax cut is a measured, balanced response to the surpluses that \nwill be flowing into the capital. It leaves 75% of the surpluses to be \nused to retire debt, and finance important priorities like Medicare and \nnational defense. Every penny in the Social Security trust fund is left \nin a lockbox to be used to shore up the retirement security of our \ncitizens. And the tax cuts are phased in over time, so the bulk of the \ncuts are in the last 3 years of the coming decade, when surpluses would \notherwise skyrocket and tempt a government spending spree.\n  But voices are raised in opposition to the tax cut. It is said that \nthe government cannot afford a tax cut of this size. But that is \nexactly backwards: our taxpayers cannot afford to continue to shoulder \na record-high tax burden. Back in 1993, without the vote of a single \nRepublican member of Congress, President Clinton pushed through a tax \nincrease totaling $241 billion over 5 years. The rationale for this tax \nincrease was the need to reduce our budget deficit. Well, the budget \ndeficit is gone and we now have surpluses as far as the eye can see. \nThe on-budget, non-Social Security surpluses will exceed $1 trillion \nover the next decade. We propose to let the American people keep $792 \nbillion of these overpayments. Is that too much?\n  Not when you consider that the 5-year tax cut of $156 billion pales \nin comparison to the Clinton tax hike, imposed on what was then a much \nsmaller economy. According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, the \n1993 Clinton tax increases will take some $900 billion from the \nAmerican people over the next decade. Our tax cut of $792 billion does \nnot even offset the lingering ill effects of that tax hike. Are we \nbeing too generous? Or have the taxpayers been too generous for too \nlong?\n\n  It is hard to find fault with the specifics of our tax cut package. \nIs it right that we should double-tax business investments, so our \ninnovators lack the resources for research and development? Is it wrong \nto extend the R tax credit, to liberate our scientists and engineers? \nIs it right that people should pay higher taxes just because they are \nmarried? Do we want people to build their own nest eggs for retirement \nsecurity, or do we want to force everyone to rely exclusively on the \nSocial Security system?\n  This tax relief package helps everyone. We make health and long-term \ncare insurance fully deductible, and allow a dependent deduction for \nelderly family members. Education is more affordable through enhanced \nsavings vehicles--IRAs and pre-paid tuition plans. Tax rates are \nlowered across-the-board. We eliminate the marriage penalty for \ntaxpayers in the lowest tax bracket and repeal the Alternative Minimum \nTax for individuals.\n  Most significant is what this tax relief does for our future. As we \nenter the 21st Century, America needs a tax policy that will \nfacilitate, not smother, innovation and new technology. Our tax relief \nbill improves the environment for pioneers in new products and \nservices. The R tax credit is extended for 5 years--the longest \nextension ever, so business can count on it. The R credit will \ncontinue to fuel innovation in new technologies, leading to health and \nsafety breakthroughs, and enriching our quality of life.\n  Capital gains tax rates are also cut to their lowest levels in 58 \nyears. Lower taxes on capital gains will help our entrepreneurs find \nthe seed capital they need to launch new businesses, create new jobs \nand provide new products and services. And capital gains are indexed, \neliminating the tax on phantom gains due to inflation--ending the \ngovernment raid on the savings of long-term investors, particularly \nretirees.\n  We also eliminate the most unfair tax of all, the estate and gift \ntax. No longer will business owners be discouraged from reinvesting \ntheir hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax \nis hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55 percent of the \nincreased value of the business. By eliminating the death tax, cutting \nthe capital gains tax, and expanding IRAs, some of the largest barriers \nto capital formation are pulled down, and the result should be a rising \ntide of investment that carries our economy through the coming Century \nof Knowledge.\n\n  I want to commend Chairman Roth, and all of the conferees, for \nproducing a balanced, thorough, and fair tax cut that benefits all \ntaxpayers. High taxes are an infringement on the liberty of our \nfamilies, who should not be struggling to make ends meet while their \nFederal servants hoard the wealth our families have created. When the \nquestion comes down to whether we trust the Federal Government or the \nfamily to use money wisely, I choose the family every time. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same, to side with the people, not the \nbureaucracy, and vote for the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Conference Report \nof the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 contains tow amendments I authored \nto extend the same tax benefits that farmers have to fishermen. The \noriginal version of the Taxpayers Refund Act of 1999 included \nprovisions to create farm and ranch risk management (FARRM) accounts to \nhelp farmers and ranchers through down times and to coordinate income \naveraging with the alternative minimum tax. The FARRM accounts would be \nused to let farmers and ranchers set aside up to 20 percent of their \nincome on a tax deferred basis. The money could be held for up to five \nyears, then it would have to be withdrawn and taxed at that time. \nInterest would be taxed in the year that it is earned.\n  Encouraging farmers and ranchers to set some money aside for \ndownturns in\n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\ntheir markets makes sense. However, I felt this provision should have \nbeen expanded to include fishermen and I offered an amendment that \nwould do just that.\n  I also authored an amendment to expand income averaging to include \nfishermen and to coordinate averaged income with the AMT I am proud to \nsay that both measures had broad bi-partisan support, and I want to \nthank those who cosponsored my amendments.\n  Allowing fishermen to elect income averaging and coordinating that \nelection with the AMT is important to the overall issue of tax fairness \nunder the tax code. Under my amendment, a fishermen electing to average \nhis or her income would owe AMT only to the extent he or she would have \nowed alternative minimum tax had averaging not been elected.\n  In previous years Congress has responded to fishing disasters with \nFederal assistance under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. We do the same for \nfarmers when crop disasters occur. Allowing fishermen, like farmers, to \nestablish risk management accounts, is a responsible way to let them \nhelp themselves and preserve the proud self-reliance that marks their \nindustry.\n  Fishermen are the farmers of the sea. Fishermen and farmers share \nseasonal cyclical harvest levels and fishermen should not be left \nbehind in the tax code because of this. While these amendments are \nmodest steps toward equal treatment for our fishermen, they are an \nimportant part of ensuring the long-term sustainability of our fishing \nindustry.\n  In addition to the provisions in this bill for America's fishermen, \nI, along with my colleague, Senator Murkowski, included a measure to \nallow Eskimo whaling captains to deduct up to $7,500 dollars of their \nexpenses incurred during whaling hunts. This provision allows whaling \ncaptains to continue the tradition of sharing whale meat with Alaska \nvillages.\n  It is the custom that the captain of a whale hunt make all provisions \nfor the meals, wages and equipment costs associated with the hunt. In \nreturn, the captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuk, a consumable \npart of a whale. The captain is then required, by tradition, to donate \na substantial portion of the whale to his village. This provision will \nallow the captains to deduct for the costs involved since they do not \nrecoup the actual costs from their share of the whale meat. This \nprovision is important to the heritage and traditions of the Alaskan \nEskimos, and I am pleased that it was included in this bill.\n\n  This tax refund plan is just that--a tax refund for every tax paying \nAmerican. Every American would see a reduction in their Federal income \ntaxes in the form of a refund. When you are overcharged for an item in \na store, you march back in and demand the difference between the actual \nprice and the amount you were charged. The American taxpayers cannot \nmarch up the front steps of the Treasury demanding a refund of their \noverpayments to Uncle Sam. We in Congress must do that for them.\n  Some would not like to see this measure pass because they feel it \ndoes not reduce our national debt. However, this bill contains \nprovisions to ensure that the goal of debt reduction is met. The debt \ntriggers included in this package would halt any future refund measures \nunder this bill until our debt reduction goals are achieved. This is a \ngood balance because it allows us to send money back to the American \npeople while reducing our debt load. Under this bill, one cannot happen \nwithout the other.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this meausre and I thank the \nleadership of chairman Roth and the members of the Finance Committee in \norganizing and authoring this sweeping tax refund bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to express disappointment in the \nway this tax legislation takes a piecemeal approach toward electricity \nissues. It deals with only one of the three major provisions that need \nrevision if this industry is going to meet the requirements of all \ncitizens and ratepayers in an era of emerging competition.\n  The electricity industry is in transition. Wholesale competition \nbetween utilities and suppliers is becoming a vibrant and competitive \nmarket, although there is still work to be done to make this market \nwork more effectively. Consumers have benefited from lower prices and \nincreased supply although the benefits have been invisible to many \nretail consumers. And nearly half of the states have moved to develop \ntheir retail electricity markets to give more consumers the chance to \nshop for their power provider.\n  But the federal tax provisions that affect this industry were written \nfor a monopoly era. This has the real effect of keeping many utilities \nfrom participating in competitive markets due to the penalties they \nwould incur solely because of outdated tax provisions. If these \nutilities are somehow forced to respond to competition without the \nneeded changes, rates would rise only because of laws written for a \ntime before competition was imagined.\n  This bill addresses only one of these tax problems, the taxation of \nnuclear plant decommissioning funds. This benefits the investor-owned \nutilities interested in buying or selling nuclear plants. Two other \nareas need to be addressed to prevent other consumers from being \npenalized: the private use restrictions on municipal and public power \nsystems, and the restrictions on electric cooperatives when costs or \nrevenues are incurred during the transition to more extensive \ncompetition.\n  In my state we have a healthy mix of suppliers of electricity: \ninvestor-owned utilities, cooperatives, municipalities and public \nutility districts. These three major sectors of the industry should \nhave their tax problems addressed at the same time.\n  I hope Chairman Roth and Chairman Murkowski will keep their \ncommitment to hold a hearing in the tax-writing committee in September, \nwith an eye toward resolving these tax issues as expeditiously as \npossible.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we approach final passage of the \nreconciliation conference report, I would like to put what we are about \nto do in proper perspective. Although some have characterized this \nprocess as politics as usual or political posturing, I do not see it \nthat way. What the House has done, and the Senate is about to do, is \nserious business, not a political game.\n  We are about to vote on legislation that affects this nation's \neconomic and fiscal health and well-being. It will affect the live of \nmillions of Americans for decades to come. The stakes could not be \nhigher.\n  And when you boil away all the rhetoric heard during this debate, \nwhat you really have is a tale of two paradigms. The Republican plan is \nan old and familiar one. Republicans would take us back to 1981 and the \nfailed economic policies of that era. These policies can best be \ncharacterized as wishful thinking that led to a fiscal disaster.\n  The Democratic position is that we should follow the model Democrats \nput in place in 1993 and continue to pursue to this day. Our plan \nturned record deficits into record surpluses and halted the \nskyrocketing growth of federal debt. At the same time, we have \nexperienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. \nThe Democratic plan is one of fiscal responsibility and economic \nprosperity.\n  In addition to giving us the strongest economy in a generation, the \npolitically difficult vote cast by Democrats nearly 9 years ago \nprovided something else. It provided this Congress with an historic \nopportunity--sustained economic health and the possibility of actual \nbudget surpluses.\n  The question facing this Congress at this time is, which road will we \ntake--the fiscally responsible path or the fiscally dangerous one? Will \nwe opt to build on our success or put our nation's fiscal health at \nrisk yet again?\n  As I have listened to many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, I am struck by how familiar many of their arguments sound. I am \nhearing some of the same dangerous rhetoric and false rosy scenarios \nthat I heard last decade.\n  And as I look at their bill, I see many of the same special interests \ndisproportionately benefitting from their actions. Make no mistake \nabout it. When it comes to irresponsible tax cuts tilted to the \nwealthy, the Senate bill was bad, and the conference bill is much \nworse. Let me cite a few examples.\n  Under the terms of the bill before us, the bottom 60 percent of \ntaxpayers would receive an average tax cut of just $138. That's about \n25 cents a day, not even enough for a cup of coffee. At the same time, \nRepublicans feel it is appropriate to provide the top 1 percent of \ntaxpayers, people with incomes over $300,000, an average tax cut of \nover\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\n$46,000. A cup of coffee for most, $46,000 for a few.\n  To further highlight the skewed nature of this cut, people earning \nover $300,000 would receive more than 40 percent of the $792 billion in \ntax relief provided by this bill. Meanwhile, people making between \n$38,000 and $62,000, the heart of this country's middle class, would \nreceive 10 percent of the tax cuts in this bill. Once again, much for a \nfew, and little for many. It's hard to see how anyone could \ncharacterize this as fair.\n  While providing these huge tax cuts for a few, the Republicans opt to \nset aside nothing for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In order to generate the surpluses necessary to pay for their \nmonstrous tax breaks, Republicans require drastic cuts in education, \nveterans' health, defense and agriculture. If our military were funded \nat the level requested by the President, the Republican budget would \nforce across-the-board domestic discretionary cuts of 38 percent below \ntheir level today. If defense were fully funded and Republicans \nfollowed the plan laid out by Chairman Domenici, these cuts would grow \nto 50 percent.\n  A final consequence of Republican recklessness is that they would \nforce $90 billion in cuts to Medicare, student loans, veterans' \nbenefits and many other programs on top of cuts I just described. The \nbudget rules are clear on this. If tax cuts are not budget-neutral, the \nlaw requires across-the-board cuts in many mandatory programs. The \nRepublican plan would require $32 billion in Medicare cuts over the \nnext 5 years. And starting in 2002, the Republican plan would eliminate \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation, crop insurance, child support \nenforcement, and veterans' education benefits.\n  As I said earlier, we have this historic opportunity, and this is how \nthe majority responds. They fail on at least three counts. First, \nRepublicans would set out on an irresponsible fiscal policy. As history \nhas painfully proven, their tax cuts would inevitably lead to bigger \ndeficits and more debt.\n  Second, they are pursuing an irresponsible national policy. Their tax \ncuts would explode just as baby boomers retire, eating up scarce \nresources that will be needed if the government is to keep its \ncommitments on Medicare and Social Security.\n  Third, as Republicans have known from the outset, engaging in this \nreckless and risky course will only produce one outcome--a Presidential \nveto. The President has been clear: he will veto this bill. And I am \nconfident that the vote on final passage will show equally clearly that \nthis veto will be sustained.\n  Instead of wasting Congress's and the American people's time with \nthis vainglorious pursuit, we should be working together on a fiscally \nresponsible plan that protects the entire Social Security surplus, \nstrengthens and modernizes Medicare by extending its solvency and \nproviding a prescription drug benefit, pays down the debt, provides \ntargeted tax relief for working Americans, and invests some of the non-\nSocial Security surplus in critical priorities such as defense, \neducation, veterans' health, and agriculture.\n  The size of the projected surpluses are sufficient to permit all of \nthis. Yet, the Republicans insist on pursuing a course that neglects \nall but the tax cuts and is certain to produce a veto.\n  We have seen this course before. On juvenile justice, on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, on gun control, on their overall budget plan, \nand on this bill. Time and again the Republican Congress has opted to \nfollow a path outlined by ideological extremists. A path that focuses \nattention on special interests instead of the nation's interests. A \npath that wastes precious time and fails the American people when it \ncomes to truly addressing their concerns.\n  When we return from the August recess, this Congress will have about \n30 working days until our target adjournment date in October. I hope \nthat when we come back in September, we can focus our limited time on \nthe people's business. I ask that my colleagues reject this bill today, \nand begin that process immediately.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act \ncontains many provisions which I support, as well as some which I would \nnot vote for if considered on their own merits.\n  Let me just highlight some of the more commendable provisions in the \nbill which I hope will be included in any final tax legislation the \nPresident may sign:\n  I am pleased the bill includes reforms to the Alternative Minimum Tax \n(AMT). This tax was never intended to apply to families, nor to be \ntriggered by the number of exemptions they might claim.\n  In the health care area, this bill includes some important changes. \nFirst, it provides a health insurance deduction to individuals whose \nemployers provide no subsidy, regardless of whether or not the \nindividual itemizes. In addition to this deduction, the bill includes a \nsimilar deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance that \nwill help aging Americans pay for the care they need.\n  This bill includes a number of provisions which would strengthen \nretirement security, both by encouraging more private savings and by \nreforming and simplifying our pension laws. These reforms would \neliminate many of the administrative burdens which discourage \nbusinesses from offering their employees pensions, and would also \nprovide for higher contribution limits.\n  The bill includes a repeal of the 4.3 cent per gallon diesel fuel \nexcise tax which railroads (including Amtrak) and inland barge \noperators have been required to pay toward deficit reduction. This \nchange would enable these modes of transportation to compete more \neffectively by reducing their costs.\n  By making the Dependent Care Tax Credit available to more families, \nthis bill would help to make child care affordable for more families. \nIn addition, the bill includes a provision to extend the adoption tax \ncredit and to strengthen the credit for the adoption of special needs \nchildren.\n  The bill proposes to extend the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, a \nprogram I have long championed, which encourages employers to hire and \ntrain disadvantaged and unskilled workers.\n  The marriage penalty relief provisions in the bill are aimed at \nmoderate income families and those eligible for the Earned Income Tax \nCredit.\n  The bill also includes provisions which will improve the \ndeductibility of student loan interest, and which will help families \nsave for college.\n  The bill includes an expansion in the conservation easement rules to \nencourage more Americans to donate land for the preservation of open \nspaces.\n  The bill also contains a deduction to encourage the restoration of \nhistoric residential properties. I would have preferred that the \ncredit, as included in the Senate bill, had prevailed rather than the \ndeduction, but this is a good start.\n  Importantly, some of the income tax rate reductions contained in the \nbill are made contingent upon progress toward debt retirement. Failing \nsuch progress, up to $200 billion of tax cuts would not take place.\n  While I will vote for this measure to keep the process moving toward \nan expected presidential veto and final budget negotiations with the \nWhite House, I would much prefer a smaller bill, such as the $500 \nbillion bipartisan compromise plan which I--along with Senators Breaux, \nJeffords and Kerrey--pressed during Finance Committee and floor \ndeliberations on the tax bill.\n  Because of the uncertainty of projecting budget surpluses over a ten-\nyear period, and given all of the other priorities we face, I am simply \nnot comfortable with an $800 billion tax cut. In my judgment, cutting \ntaxes is only one of several important priorities toward which our \nbudget surplus should be directed. Others include reducing the national \ndebt; modernizing Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit; \nstrengthening Social Security for the long-term; and, ensuring adequate \nfunding on an annual basis for important discretionary programs.\n  Clearly, there are provisions I had trouble with.\n  The bill includes a provision to encourage the establishment of \nIndividual Education Savings Accounts to subsidize the cost of private \nschool tuition for children in grades K-12.\n  This bill would redirect revenues from the Leaking Underground \nStorage Tank Fund to the Superfund program. As Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I strongly opposed inclusion of \nthis provision.\n\n[[Page S10333]]\n\n  Reducing the capital gains tax rate from 20 to 18 percent for \nindividuals, as this bill proposes, seems unnecessary because this rate \nreduction was scheduled to happen in the near future.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I am hopeful that negotiations between \nCongress and the Administration will begin in earnest after the \nPresident vetoes this bill in September. In my judgment, in addition to \nproviding needed tax relief, those negotiations should also produce \nother critical benefits, including provisions to reduce our national \ndebt, strengthen Medicare, and to fund discretionary programs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to regrettably oppose \nthe conference report to the Year 2000 Budget Reconciliation \nlegislation.\n  With this conference report, the majority has succeeded in making a \nbad bill worse. Rather than using this conference to come together and \nattempt to develop a reasonable package, all of the objectionable \nfeatures of the Senate-passed bill have been exaggerated, rather than \nmoderated.\n  First, the conference report further skews the benefits of its tax \ncuts towards those who need them least, and away from working families. \nWe now have before us a conference report that includes a 1 percent \nacross-the-board tax cut for all income tax brackets. We are led to \nbelieve that this provision is the center-piece of a package that \nconstitutes broad-based tax relief. However, upon closer inspection, \nthis clearly is not the case. Under this proposal, the bottom 60 \npercent of taxpayers receive only 7.5 percent of the total tax cut \nbenefits, while the top 10 percent of income earners receive nearly 70 \npercent of the bill's tax cut benefits. Mr. President, I would not \nconsider this broad-based tax relief.\n  Perhaps the clearest example of how this conference report heaps its \ntax cut largesse on those who least need it is that it spends nearly 60 \nbillion dollars for the complete repeal of the estate tax. Again, the \ninclusion of full repeal of the estate tax within this conference \nreport is a clear indication that its proponents do not wish to direct \ntheir tax cuts toward hard-working families who need and deserve a \nbreak. I believe in estate tax relief for farmers and small businesses \nof modest means where it is necessary and appropriate. However, the \nbeneficiaries of this provision are overwhelmingly not of modest means. \nThey are the very, very affluent leaving estates worth millions of \ndollars. Mr. President, I fail to see how this specific tax cut helps \nthe average family struggling to find affordable child care or to meet \nrising college tuition costs.\n  Secondly, this conference report fails to meet critical domestic and \nmilitary priorities upon which our nation's long-range prosperity and \nsecurity depend. In order to accommodate the costs of a $792 tax cut, \nextensive cuts of nearly $511 billion will be necessary in domestic \nspending. If defense is funded at the President's request, cuts to \ndomestic spending would reach almost 38 percent. As a result, over \n430,000 children would lose Head Start services, 1.4 million veterans \nwould be denied much needed medical services from VA hospitals, and \nalmost 1.5 million low-income people would lose HUD rental subsidies, \nforcing many into homelessness.\n  Perhaps the clearest example of the conference report's failure in \nthis regard is what the conferees have done to child care. Senator \nJeffords and I offered an amendment to provide an additional $10 \nbillion over the next 10 years to the existing Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant--almost doubling the children that would be \nserved. It passed the Senate by voice vote. So it was surprising, not \nto mention disappointing, that this provision was summarily eliminated \nin conference. I intend to continue to work to see that Congress honors \nthe commitment it made in the Budget Resolution to significantly expand \nfunding for quality child care this year and in the years to come.\n  Third, the conference report, like the Senate-passed bill, continues \nto pose an increased risk to our current economic prosperity. Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House and Senate \nBanking Committees just days ago, urging caution about implementing a \n$792 billion tax cut at a time when the economy is performing so well. \nChairman Greenspan stated that it would be better to hold off on an \nimmediate tax cut because it is apparent that the current surpluses are \ndoing a great deal of good to the economy. Moreover, he warned that \nCongress must also be prepared to cut spending significantly should the \nsurpluses, upon which the tax cuts are based, not materialize. It is \nironic to me that so many of our colleagues, who otherwise have had \nhigh and vocal praise for Chairman Greenspan's economic leadership, can \nso readily ignore his clear and repeated warnings about the \nconsequences of their unrealistic and irresponsible tax plan.\n  I have also noted with particular interest the comments of the \nesteemed Majority Leader in this week's newspapers where he has stated \nthat an acceptable alternative to the Republican tax plan would be to \n``put the money in place so that the debt can be retired.'' This \nsentiment has also been echoed by the House Majority Leader. These are \nstunning admissions of the flawed nature of the conference agreement \nbefore the Senate today.\n  Their ``all-or-nothing'' statements reasonably raise the question of \nhow committed the majority is to this tax cut plan. Perhaps they are \nmore committed to having a political issue than to giving working \nfamilies a reasonable tax cut while also meeting our responsibilities \nto preserve and strengthen Medicare, Social Security, defense, and \neducation. I fear that the Senate has been engaged in a fruitless \npolitical exercise.\n  Mr. President, I worry that the majority has again squandered a \nunique opportunity to first maintain our current economic prosperity \nand then to address the legitimate needs of working families in this \ncountry. This legislation neglects to make much-needed investments in \nSocial Security and Medicare, debt reduction, and critical defense and \ndomestic priorities. The President has promised repeatedly to veto this \nlegislation. We should have no doubt about his resolve to do so. Then I \nhope that congressional leaders will get serious about working in a \nbipartisan fashion to craft a reconciliation bill that is sensible and \nresponsible. We have worked too hard in this decade to rectify the \nwretched budgetary excess of the last decade. Now is the time for \nprudence and caution.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, here we are again, debating a conference \nreport on a ten year, $800 billion tax cut.\n  This tax cut works on the assumption of a budget surplus that has not \nbeen realized yet--a surplus that is generated in no small part by \nalready unattainable budget caps which will lead to a significant, 23% \nto 38% reduction in essential programs, including Pell Grants, special \neducation, community policing, and drug enforcement.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island, my constituents stand to lose $15.9 \nmillion in Title I education funding and $11 million in Special \nEducation funding. In addition, more than 17,000 Rhode Island students \nwould be denied Pell Grants, and more than 2,000 children would be cut \nfrom Head Start programs. At a time when one in five children lives in \npoverty, can we really bear cuts of this magnitude?\n  At a time when we are asking the government to respond quicker and \nperform better, particularly with respect to domestic and international \ncrises, we are considering legislation that trades away the essential \nservices that the American people count on in exchange for speculative \ntax cuts whose benefit will be fleeting.\n  This legislation is also a threat to the future of Medicare. Indeed, \nat the point that Medicare teeters at the brink of insolvency in the \nnext ten to twenty years, the cost of this tax cut could balloon to $2 \ntrillion.\n  We know that we must take steps as soon as possible to shore up \nMedicare and Social Security. A responsible use of the surplus would be \nto make a reasonable allowance for essential programs, address the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and pay down the \nfederal debt. Then, we should consider a targeted reductions for \nAmerica's working families.\n  Of course, everyone realizes that we cannot continue to live under \nthe spending caps. In May, a group of eight House Republicans wrote the \nPresident, stating, ``A rational compromise is needed to adjust the \ncaps and maintain them for future years at achievable levels.'' If the \nmost ardent architects of the caps are now having second\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\nthoughts, there is little reason to expect they can be observed in the \nfuture.\n  But, we are already breaking the caps with ``emergency'' \nappropriations--appropriations that do not count against the caps.\n  What is an ``emergency'' appropriation exactly? Apparently, it is \nanything the Majority wants it to be. Just the other day, the House \npassed legislation designating part of the funding for the 2000 Census \nan ``emergency''. As conservative columnist George Will noted, we have \nknown about next year's Census since 1790. How could it be an \n``emergency''? Mr. President, since the end of fiscal year 1998, \nCongress has approved approximately $35 billion in ``emergency'' \nspending. One wonders how many other ``emergencies'' like the decennial \ncensus are looming.\n  Beyond the massive cuts to essential domestic initiatives, this tax \nbill depends on the performance of the economy. But, Mr. President, \nafter the longest peacetime economic expansion in history, can we \ncontinue to count on a robust economy for another year, for another \nfive years, for another ten years? The bill before us depends on this \nsort of gamble.\n  Ironically, this tax cut could be just the thing that stalls our \neconomic growth. Recently, fifty economists, including 6 Nobel \nLaureates, wrote that this tax bill will stimulate the economy at \nprecisely the wrong time.\n  Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, usually a strong \nsupporter of tax cuts, has taken a cautionary view toward these tax \nreductions. The New York Times reported of his testimony on the Hill \nlast week.\n\n       The subject [of tax cuts] came up several times, and Mr. \n     Greenspan's message was stern: Don't do it. ``I'm saying hold \n     off for a while,'' Mr. Greenspan said . . . ``And I'm saying \n     that because the timing is not right.''\n       Mr. Greenspan urged Congress to pay down the debt and delay \n     any tax cut until the economy begins to turn down. ``The \n     business cycle is not dead,'' he warned, telling lawmakers \n     that whenever an economic slowdown hits, ``a significant tax \n     cut'' may be needed to ward off recession.\n\n  In all respects, this legislation lacks proportionality. Fortunately, \nthis bill, even if it passes the Senate and is sent on to the \nPresident, will be vetoed. It is regrettable that we have wasted so \nmuch time on this bill, when, instead, we could have focused on truly \nimportant issues like preserving Social Security and Medicare. Now that \nthe political play has been made, I hope that we can return to \nsubstantive work on issues that really matter to the American people.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are considering a bill to return a \nportion of the surplus that is projected to be $2.9 trillion over the \nnext ten years. This bill represents a balanced package that takes into \naccount the problems as well as sharing in the good times. The bill \nwill provide fiscally responsible tax relief over the next ten years \nwhile reducing the public debt and still save the $1.9 trillion Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  Many of my colleagues have argued that $792 billion in tax cuts is \ntoo much--that we should save this money for Medicare and other \nspending. I strongly disagree. It is important that we not forget those \nwho are responsible for the surplus--hard-working, over-paying \ntaxpayers. After all, what is a surplus--it is excess revenues over the \namount needed to fund government operations.\n  The $2.9 trillion surplus is large enough to balance our priorities. \nThis Conference Report shows that we can provide meaningful tax cuts, \nprovide for Medicare reform, and reserve the Social Security surplus.\n  I also marvel at how much we have recently heard from my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle about debt reduction. I never knew the \ndepth of their convictions on this, particularly since they fought the \nbalanced budget amendment so hard. The balanced budget amendment would \nhave once and for all imposed spending restraints on Congress. The \nmajority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argued \nvigorously against such constitutional restraints, implying that they \nwanted unlimited access to the government checkbook.\n  In my view, if we have a surplus, and we do not have a tax cut, the \ntemptation of Congress to spend that surplus will be too great. I made \nthis point many times during debate on the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, and I will make it again. If we have a surplus, \nthis money will burn a hole in Congress' pocket.\n  This conference report provides tax cuts for everyone by cutting tax \nrates 1% across-the-board. This may not sound like much, but it \nrepresents real tax cuts for each and every taxpayer. In addition, \ncouples filing married returns will see their marriage penalty \neliminated. It is sending the wrong signal to American taxpayers when a \ncouple in Utah faces a higher tax bill when they marry than they do as \nsingles. The bill also helps our families struggling to finance a \nquality education for themselves and their children.\n  The bill also addresses the need for enhanced retirement security. It \nmakes IRAs more widely available and improves retirement systems to \nincrease access, simplify the rules, increase portability and provide \nsmall business incentives.\n  We have all heard about the challenge that providing adequate health \ncare that is facing American families. This bill provides meaningful \nhelp for those who are struggling with the costs of insurance.\n  This bill also contains provisions that would help keep economic \ngrowth strong. There is a package of international tax relief that \nprovides simplification and helps American companies which have \noperations overseas remain competitive and continue to grow. The \nexpiring tax credits are extended.\n  I am disappointed that the research and experimentation tax credit \nwas not made permanent. I still believe that our American research \nengine would be helped significantly by relieving the uncertainty that \na sunsetted credit imposes. Nevertheless, the 5-year extension in this \nbill is a step in the right direction. I hope that we can revisit this \nissue in the future and provide for a permanent tax credit for research \nand experimentation.\n  This conference report contains some important improvements over the \nSenate bill. I am particularly heartened to see the full repeal of the \nestate tax and capital gains tax relief as part of this bill.\n  The ``death tax'' is unfair and inefficient. For every dollar that we \ncollect, roughly 65 cents is spent complying and collecting this tax. \nThis is the wrong way to use up our resources.\n  This bill also accelerates the capital gains tax rate cuts we passed \nin 1997. In addition, it will shorten the required holding period of \nassets from 5 years to 1. This will provide significant simplification \nfor those taxpayers struggling to determine which capital gains rate \napplies and how long they have held their assets. This is true \nsimplification and real relief. And, let's make no mistake: these tax \nchanges will benefit more Americans than just the wealthy. These estate \ntax and capital gains tax provisions will benefit every American who \nowns a home, business, or family farm. It will benefit the increasing \nnumber of Americans who are investors in mutual funds and other \nsecurities.\n  It is easy for us to get lost in the debate over numbers and how we \nshould spend the surplus. However, we must keep in mind who sent us the \nrevenue that created the surplus. We are talking about families \nstruggling to make ends meet, provide an educations for their children, \nor save for their retirement. They are the family funning the corner \ngrocery store or landscaping business. They are bus drivers, day care \nproviders, carpenters, and students.\n  This conference report is a balanced tax cut package that provides \nrelief for middle class taxpayers. It gives American families a well-\ndeserved tax break, simplifies the tax code, and provides pro-growth \nincentives to help keep the economy strong and growing. This $792 \nbillion bill is the biggest tax cut since the Ronald Reagan presidency. \nYet, it still represents a rebate of only one-quarter of the surplus \ndollars that the federal government has collected. I hope that the \nPresident can agree that we owe the American taxpayers that much and \nsign this legislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong favor of the \nConference agreement that will provide every single American a well \ndeserved refund of the taxes they are now overpaying as the government \nruns a surplus.\n  I especially want to commend Chairman Roth for the extraordinary work\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\nhe did in what must be record time to produce this Conference report. \nMy colleagues should recollect that barely 6 days ago today that the \ntax bill was adopted on the floor of Senate.\n  And now we are here with a completed conference report. The work of \nthe Chairman, Finance Committee staff and the Joint Tax Committee staff \nis to be applauded. They all labored long hours and the result is a \nbill that I am proud to support.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the total budget \nsurplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion. Nearly a trillion \ndollars ($996 billion) of that surplus ($996 billion) comes from \noverpayments of income and estate taxes.\n  What this tax bill does is return barely 25 percent of the surplus \ntax payments and return that money to the American taxpayer. All of the \n$1.9 trillion Social Security surplus will be used solely for \npreserving Social Security. And, as a result of this bill, we have more \nthan $200 billion available for saving Medicare and paying down part of \nthe debt.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, President Clinton reiterated that he will \nveto this bill because he believes the tax refund is too large.\n  The fact is that what the President wants to do is not provide a tax \nrefund to the American public, but instead he wants to use the surplus \nto finance $1 trillion in new federal spending. And despite his claim \nthat he wants to cut taxes by $300 billion, CBO scored the President's \nbudget as actually raising taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  In other words, at a time when we are running real surpluses in the \nhundreds of billions, the President comes along and wants to impose \neven higher taxes on the American people so he can finance more big \ngovernment.\n  The bill before us should not be vetoed because it provides a tax \nrefund to every single American who pays taxes. The lion's share of the \ntax cut--nearly $400 billion--results from cutting the 15 percent rate \nto 14 percent and the near elimination of the marriage penalty.\n  Is that what President Clinton objects to--reducing the tax rate paid \nby the lowest income taxpayers? Or does the President object to \nelimination of the marriage penalty? That must be the case Mr. \nPresident, because if the President had his way and we cut taxes by \n$300 billion, we could not eliminate the marriage penalty; we could not \ncut the rate paid by the lowest income earners.\n  The bill also provides rate relief for all bracket taxpayers over the \nnext 10 years. A modest 1 percent reduction in all tax rates is surely \nsomething we can afford with a trillion dollar surplus. I find it hard \nto believe that the President would object to such a modest change.\n  The conference report also contains the Senate provisions that up the \nlimit on contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to \n$5,000. Moreover, it retains the provision in our bill that allows \nincreased contributions by people over 50.\n  In recent months, we have seen that the American savings rate is \nactually a negative number. These incentives could well serve to \nincrease our savings rate. Is that what President Clinton objects to--\nenhancing retirement savings incentives?\n  Or does the President object to the health care provisions in this \nbill. Health care changes that bring a much needed level of equity to \nthe tax code?\n  Allowing the self employed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of \nhealth insurance finally brings small business to parity with large \ncorporations.\n  And for the first time in our history, employees who pay for more \nthan half of their own health insurance will be able to take an above-\nthe-line deduction for those costs.\n  I thought the President was so concerned about the uninsured? Why \nwould he veto a tax bill that finally provides health equity to \nemployees and small business owners?\n  The conference report will also serve to continue the flow of money \ninto equity markets by cutting the capital gains rate to 18 percent for \nall transactions that took place after January 1, 1999. I believe the \ncapital gains rates should be even lower, but with the resources at \nhand this is an appropriate change.\n  One of the most important changes in the conference report is the \nphase out and ultimately, in 2009 the elimination of the estate tax. \nThis onerous tax punishes the hard work of many Americans and the death \nof this tax is long overdue. Confiscatory estate tax rates of 55 \npercent should, if this bill becomes law, finally be a relic of \nhistory.\n  This conference report will be sent to the President when we return \nin September. He has one month to reconsider his reckless veto threat. \nThe American people deserve a tax refund. This conference report \nprovides very modest and long overdue relief. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and I ask the President to reconsider his veto \nthreat.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Congress went on a tax cut binge in the \n1980s and left the bill for our children. Now that we have surpluses, \nwe have a chance and an obligation to pay off that debt. The last thing \nCongress should be doing right now is to put our strong economy at risk \nby passing a tax scheme as risky as the Republican plan.\n  Some of my fellow colleagues in Congress have gone off again on a \nbinge of irresponsible tax cutting that puts our strong economy in \njeopardy. Projections of budget surpluses in the future have gone \nstraight to their heads--as if projected budget surpluses were like \nhard cider. It is time for my colleagues in the House and Senate to \nsplash some cold budget reality on their faces and return to their \neconomic senses.\n  A sound economy rests on a solid foundation of balanced revenue and \nspending policies. For the past seven years, the President and Congress \nhave build this solid foundation by reducing the deficit and \nrestraining spending. Just as we Vermonters restrained spending and put \nVermont's state budget in the black, Yankee thrift was alive and well \nin Washington, as it is in Vermont.\n  President Clinton inherited a deficit of $290 billion in 1992 and his \nadministration and Congress have steadily cut it down. For the first \ntime since 1969, we now have a balanced budget.\n  I am proud to have voted for the 1993 deficit reduction package, \nwhich was a tough vote around here, and has brought the deficit down. I \nam also proud to have voted for the 1997 balanced budget and tax cut \npackage--tax cuts that were fully paid for by offsetting spending cuts. \nThese balanced policies have kept interest rates down and employment \nup. In fact, over the past seven years, this deficit reduction has \nproduced $189 billion in interest savings on the national debt, or \nroughly $2,700 in savings for every American family.\n  Republicans and Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of the \ncredit for getting the nation's fiscal house in order. The important \nthing is to keep our budget in balance well into the 21st century and \nkeep our economy growing.\n  That dose of Yankee fiscal discipline has paid off for Vermonters. \nSince 1993: Vermont's unemployment rate has been cut in half, from 5.8% \nto 2.9%; 20,000 new jobs have been created; Vermonter's average income \nhas increased 25 percent; crime in Vermont has dropped by 15 percent; \nand the stock market has soared by 300 percent.\n  Instead of keeping on this path of prosperity, the huge tax cut bill \nthat Congress just passed veers from our successful fiscal discipline. \nIt cuts taxes by $792 billion and pays for these sweeping cuts out of \nprojected budget surpluses over the next 10 years. These surpluses are \nnot real. They are just projections. What happens if we suffer a \nrecession in three years or a depression seven years from now? These \ntax cuts are paid for by Monopoly money.\n  But fooling with our strong economy is not a game. Passing risky tax \ncuts based on wishful thinking will have real consequences for \nVermonters. It is estimated that paying for these huge tax cuts would: \nforce more than 13,000 Vermont veterans to lose health care benefits; \nprevent any Medicare reform and new prescription drug coverage for \nsenior Vermonters; drop 3,699 Vermonters from the WIC program; close \noff 2,116 Vermont students from Pell grants to help make college more \naffordable; and serve 11,127 fewer school lunches to Vermont children.\n  Instead of this fiscal folly, I believe Congress should follow three \nbasic principles to continue our strong economy and provide targeted \ntax relief.\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\nFirst, we must continue to keep our fiscal house in order and pay down \nthe national debt. The national public debt stands at $3.6 trillion--\nthat is a lot of zeros. Like someone who had finally paid off his or \nher credit card balance but still has a home mortgage, the federal \ngovernment has finally balanced its annual budget, but we still have a \nnational debt to pay down. Indeed, the Federal government pays almost \n$1 billion in interest every working day on this national debt.\n  It makes a lot more sense to pay off the national debt as our first \npriority, because nothing would do more to keep the economy strong. \nPaying down our national debt will keep interest rates low. Consumers \ngain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, credit card \ncharges with low interest rates. And small business owners can invest, \nexpand and create jobs with low interest rates.\n  Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, recently testified \nbefore Congress that: ``I would prefer that we keep the surplus in \nplace and reduce the public debt.'' I agree with Mr. Greenspan and I \nbelieve most Vermonters do too.\n  Second, we should put aside some of the surplus in a rainy day fund \nfor Medicare and Social Security reforms. Just as we set aside extra \nrevenue in a rainy day fund in Vermont, Congress should do the same on \na national level. We all know that Congress must reform Social Security \nand Medicare for the future costs of the baby boom generation. This \nrainy day fund should also permit Medicare to cover prescription drug \ncoverage for our seniors.\n  One of the toughest and most important challenges that we face--right \nnow--is to make sure that Social Security and Medicare will continue to \nbe there for those who retire decades from now. The number of Social \nSecurity beneficiaries will rise by 37 percent from now until 2015, and \nMedicare runs into problems even earlier than that. Protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare will not be easy, but these projected surpluses \nmake it easier to keep both programs strong for future generations.\n  Third, tax cuts should be fair and targeted to help all Vermonters, \nnot just the wealthy. According to a Treasury Department analysis, the \nSenate-passed tax plan provides 67 percent of its tax breaks to the \nwealthiest 20 percent of Americans--those making more than $81,000 a \nyear--while the poorest 60 percent of families would reap only 12 \npercent of the Senate-passed tax cuts. That is not fair.\n  This conference report is even more tilted in favor of the wealthy. \nAccording to an analysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice, the top 10 \npercent of taxpayers would receive 69 percent of the benefits under \nthis bill while the bottom 60 percent would receive only 7.5 percent of \nthe benefits from the conference agreement. That means the average tax \ncut would be $138 for the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers while the top \none percent of taxpayers would receive a tax break of $46,389. Again, \nthat is not fair.\n  Tax cuts that are targeted-- such as eliminating the marriage tax \npenalty, permitting the self-employed a full tax deduction for their \nhealth insurance and estate tax relief for family farmers and small \nbusiness owners--also don't break the bank. I supported a more \nresponsible alternative package of $290 billion in targeted tax cuts \nthat would still leave room in the budget for Congress to make key \ninvestments in veterans, education and crime-fighting programs. I \nbelieve this targeted approach is far more prudent than the Republican \ntax cut plan.\n  The enormous budget surplus that the Senate leadership claims is \navailable to pay for nearly $800 billion in tax cuts is achieved only \nby unrealistic economic assumptions and deep cuts in programs that will \nnever be attained. That is why I cosponsored an amendment filed by \nSenator Rockefeller that assumes there will only be a $100 billion \nsurplus over the next ten years. This projected surplus is consistent \nwith estimates by the Concord Coalition, Center for Budget and Policy \nPriorities, former CBO director Robert Reischauer and the Citizens for \nTax Justice. The Rockefeller-Reed-Leahy amendment is a prudent and \nfiscally responsible approach that balances tax relief with reducing \nour debt and maintaining obligations to existing programs such as NIH \nresearch, veterans health, Head Start and the environment.\n  I call upon President Clinton to follow through on his pledge to veto \nthis irresponsible tax scheme. He should send Congress back to the \ndrawing board to do it right. And the next time, Congress should apply \na stout measure of Yankee thrift.\n\n\n                         explanation of absence\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, due to the wedding of my oldest \ndaughter, Michelle Crapo, I will be unable to participate in the debate \nand vote on the Conference Report for H.R. 2488, the Taxpayer Refund \nand Relief Act of 1999. Had I been present, I would have cast my vote \nin favor of the measure.\n  The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 is good news for America \nand will give individual income taxpayers the long-overdue tax relief \nthey deserve. I am most pleased by the one percent across-the-board \nincome tax cut for all individual tax rates and the marriage penalty \nrelief provisions contained in the report. These provisions alone will \ngo a long way towards reducing the tax burdens of the average Idaho \nfamily.\n  I am also encouraged to see that the Conference Report eliminates the \nestate tax, provides alternative minimum tax relief, increases the \nannual contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and \neducation savings accounts, and reduces individual capital gains tax \nrates.\n  The Conference Report for the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 \nis good for income taxpayers, the economy, and the nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the report.\n\n\n                              section 1317\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I will be glad to answer the distinguished \nSenator's question.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the conference report for The Taxpayer \nRefund and Relief Act of 1999 states that section 1317 of the Senate \namendment regarding prohibited allocation of stock in an S corporation \nESOP was not included in the conference agreement. Is that report \nlanguage correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, that report language is not correct. The \nconference agreement adopted section 1317 of the Senate amendment \nwithout modification.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman for \nthis clarification.\n\n\n    Tax Treatment of Commissions Paid to Enroll Cellular Telephone \n                               Customers\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, \nthe assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, and I would like to \nengage Chairman Roth in a brief colloquy on an issue that several \nmembers of the Finance Committee have become involved in over the past \nseveral months.\n  I refer to the fact that in some cases the IRS has taken what I \nbelieve is an unreasonable and unrealistic position regarding the tax \naccounting of sales commissions paid by providers of commercial mobile \ntelephone service for enrolling customers. In the cases I refer to, IRS \nhas contended that these costs should be capitalized and amortized over \nthe average customer life, rather than deducted.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I have been very concerned about this issue, as well. It \nseems to me that commissions paid by cellular telephone companies are \nlike any other marketing expenses incurred by telephone companies--or \nany other companies--and are deductible under current tax law.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to lend by voice to the positions expressed by \nboth Senator Murkowski and Senator Breaux. It does not make sense to me \nthat sales commission/costs can be anything but deductible.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This issue is not addressed in the pending tax bill \nbecause the Treasury Department has indicated to the Finance Committee \nthat it is in the process of reviewing the IRS's position. We have been \nassured by Treasury officials that they plan to resolve the issue this \nyear.\n  The Treasury apparently agrees that the IRS may have gone too far.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The IRS position would be difficult or impossible to \nadminister. The position will lead to years of litigation, as companies \nand the IRS battle out whether commissions should be capitalized or \ndeducted.\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\nThat will drain resources from both sides for no productive reason.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We would like to ask Chairman Roth for his views on \nhow this issue can be resolved expeditiously and efficiently.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree that this is an issue of concern to Finance \nCommittee members. The cellular telephone industry is a high-growth, \njob-creating, industry. It is clear to any observer that the industry \nis frenetically competitive. Companies incur substantial marketing \nexpenses, including sales commission, to attempt to sign up new \ncustomers and to entice customers to move from other carriers.\n  I have little doubt that the IRS's position requiring companies to \ncapitalize the sales commissions may lead to years of litigation. The \nTreasury Department has made the decision to review the IRS's position. \nThe agency included the issue in its 1999 Priority Guidance Plan and \nhas advised the Committee that they plan to deal with the issue this \nyear.\n  I strongly support the quick resolution of this issue by the Treasury \nDepartment. Sales commissions are a basic cost of doing business for \ncellular telephone companies, and I believe that the Treasury should be \nable to reach a sensible resolution of this issue.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I very much appreciate the chairman's thoughts and \nlook forward to working with him and the Treasury to see this issue \ndealt with.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I also appreciate the chairman's views on this. We are \nconfident that the Treasury can resolve this issue satisfactorily, and \nwe will be following events at the Treasury closely.\n  Mr. NICKLES: I thank the chairman for sharing his views on this \nimportant issue. I hope it can be expeditiously resolved.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this bill is a reckless tax plan. As a way \nto summarize my opposition, the following are my top ten reasons I \noppose this bill.\n  One, it is unfair to the middle class and the working poor. The \naverage tax cut for a person who makes $30,000 per year is $311, \ncompared to a tax cut of almost $46,000 for someone who makes more than \n$800,000 per year.\n  Two, it threatens low interest rates. Alan Greenspan testified before \nthe Senate Banking Committee last week--and I quote--``It's precisely \nthat imprecision and the uncertainty that is involved which has led me \nto conclude that we probably would be better off holding off on a tax \ncut immediately, largely because of the fact that it is apparent that \nthe surpluses are doing a great deal of positive good to the economy in \nterms of long-term interest rates.'' If interest rates go up just one \npercentage point on a $100,000 mortgage, the increased monthly cost is \n$70--in essence a tax increase on every homeowner.\n  Three, there is not a dime in it for Medicare. As the Baby Boom \ngeneration begins retiring in 10 years, the Medicare situation will get \nlarger, not smaller. This plan, by ignoring the issue, just compounds \nthe problem we all know is coming.\n  Four, there is nothing in it for debt reduction. Because the \nDemocratic plan saves Medicare, it has the added benefit of reducing \nthe debt. We have a historic opportunity to ensure that our children \nwill not be saddled with huge interest costs, which currently total \nover $600 million a day.\n  Five, it contains special-interest goodies, such as repealing an \nexcise tax for a few companies that make tackle boxes and providing a \n$4 billion tax break on foreign oil and gas income.\n  Six, it will require huge and unsustainable cuts in discretionary \nspending. Because the Republicans are assuming a freeze on \ndiscretionary spending at fiscal year 1999 levels--something they will \nviolate in the next few months--the reality is that this plan would \nforce cuts of an enormous size in education, law enforcement, \nenvironmental protection, and the military. This is completely \nunrealistic given inflation and the needs we have as a country.\n  Seven, it relies on long-term surplus projections, which is very \nrisky. Any businessman will tell you that even projecting out five \nyears is unreliable at best. This bill tries to predict the economy \nover the next 10 years.\n  Eight, it ties our hands in the event of a recession. The country is \nin a tremendous economic rebound, and we do not need a broad-based \neconomic stimulus. But if we go into a recessionary period, that is \nwhen a tax cut would be needed--to help us get out of the recession. \nThis plan precludes that option.\n  Nine, it risks going back to the dark days of dramatic deficits. We \nhave finally balanced the annual budget after 30 long years of red ink, \nand this plan turns right around and goes back to those times.\n  Ten, it is totally partisan. The Republican leadership rejected \ncompromising with Democrats--and no Democrats were even in the room \nwhen this plan was put together. That is no way to write important \nlegislation that affects every American.\n  I urge the President to fulfill his promise to veto this dangerous \nlegislation, which jeopardizes the most remarkable economic recovery in \nhistory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, who will be our last speaker.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask at the end of 4\\1/2\\ minutes I \nbe notified the time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in life you can extend your hand, but \nto make any real progress someone has to grasp it. For these several \nweeks, many of us have worked to try to find some reasonable middle \nground in the cause of reducing taxes on the American people. It was a \nworthwhile effort. I believe, indeed, taxes on middle-income Americans \nare too high and it is the American people who worked hard and paid \ntheir taxes who have produced this extraordinary American surplus. They \ndeserve a dividend for the American economic performance.\n  But a tax reduction is not all the American people deserve. They also \ndeserve to know their children are getting educated in quality schools \nwith good teachers. I am for tax reduction, but I want a tax reduction \nthat allows teachers to reduce class size and the rebuilding of \ncrumbling American schools. I am firmly committed that tax reductions \nfor the middle class are required and should be enacted by this \nCongress. But I also believe the American people must have a health \ncare system that provides for prescription drugs through Medicare for \nelderly Americans.\n  My point is simply we are at a time when the Nation can both afford \nand requires multiple objectives. In the bipartisan tax reduction plan \nof $500 billion, Senator Breaux, Senator Kerrey, and I, working with \nour Republican colleagues, fashioned a plan where we believed we could \nreduce taxes on savings to encourage the American people to invest in \nthe new economy by reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes on \nmodest investments and by eliminating taxes on interest on modest \nsavings accounts so all Americans save for their own future \nfor security for their own families.\n\n  In our plan we expanded by 4 million families the number of people \nfrom the 28-percent tax bracket to the 15-percent tax bracket because \nthis Government has no right to tax at 28 percent the modest incomes of \nfamilies who earn $50,000, $60,000, and $70,000, raising one and two \nchildren. Indeed, at this point in our history it is something we can \nafford--to allow people to keep that money for their own needs.\n  Perhaps it was always going to be so, but that bipartisan tax plan \nwas not enacted. But I am not a man who is discouraged easily. When the \nbipartisan plan was introduced, we described it as the October plan \nbecause there are tax plans that are presented because they have \npolitical value and communicate a political message, and there are tax \nplans enacted because they can be attained and they change the law. \nThis was never going to be a brief process and perhaps it was never \ngoing to consist of a single phase. Tonight, the first phase is \nconcluded. A message is being sent to the President and to the American \npeople by both political parties. The Democratic Party is committing \nitself to middle-class tax relief after protecting Social Security and \nallowing for national objectives of Medicare and education.\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I believe that is still a worthwhile objective and I join with my \nparty in doing so. It is, however, my hope that we can accelerate this \nprocess. This bill can be passed tonight, the President can exercise \nhis judgment, and we can return.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent if the conference agreement \npasses, the bill be enrolled within 5 days and sent the following day \nto the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I regret that will mean the process \nwill have to continue longer than otherwise required. I hope we can \nreturn in the fall and pass a reasonable tax cut that accommodates \nother national objectives on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask there be printed in the Record a \nstatement ``Sequester Impact of Tax Bill,'' prepared today by the \nOffice of Management and Budget. I will read two sentences:\n\n       Beginning in 2002, Medicare would be cut by 4 percent each \n     year. * * *\n       In 2002, the $28 billion cut in mandatory savings resulting \n     from a sequester would still be $6 billion less than the cost \n     of the tax bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Sequester Impact of Tax Bill\n\n       If the Conference Agreement on the Republican Tax bill were \n     to be enacted in its present form, it would result in a \n     sequester of mandatory programs in each year beginning in \n     2000. Mandatory spending would be cut by $2.4 billion in \n     2000. Beginning in 2002, Medicare would be cut by 4% each \n     year. Mandatory programs subject to a full sequester would be \n     eliminated, including CCC, child support enforcement, social \n     services block grants, immigration support, crop insurance, \n     mineral leasing payments and veterans education and \n     readjustment benefits.\n       The costs of the tax bill in 2002 and subsequent years \n     exceed the savings that could be achieved by a sequester of \n     mandatory programs. In 2002, the $28 billion cut in mandatory \n     savings resulting from a sequester would still be $6 billion \n     less than the costs of the tax bill.\n\n\n                                medicare\n\n       Medicare spending would be cut by $2 billion in FY 2000 and \n     by $9.2 billion or 4% in FY 2002. Medicare payments to all \n     providers (e.g., hospitals, physicians, home health agencies, \n     skilled nursing facilities) would be reduced proportionally \n     by the sequester.\n       Any reduction in current Medicare spending will increase \n     the pressure to ``undo'' the BBA and increase Medicare \n     spending. It also will make it difficult to garner support \n     for the reforms included in the President's Medicare reform \n     plan, which includes important new initiatives (e.g., the \n     prescription drug benefit) as well as justifiable reductions \n     in spending.\n\n\n                     veterans readjustment benefits\n\n       The Readjustment Benefits account provides education \n     benefits and training to more than 450,000 veterans, \n     reservists, and dependents through the Montgomery GI Bill and \n     the Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Programs.\n       The elimination of Readjustment Benefits in FY 2002 would \n     mean that these veterans, reservists, and dependents would \n     lose entitlement to the education and training programs many \n     were promised (and paid into) when they enlisted. Programs \n     like the GI Bill are the most potent recruitment and \n     retention tools the military services have. Further, service \n     members transitioning to civilian life would no longer be \n     afforded re-training through college programs, work-study, or \n     on-the-job training.\n       If eliminated, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling \n     program, which helps 50,000 disabled veterans overcome \n     employment handicaps sustained on active duty, would no \n     longer assist veterans in finding jobs and becoming \n     productive members of society again.\n\n\n                  ccc farm programs and crop insurance\n\n       The Senate has just passed a bill that provides over $7 \n     billion in FY 2000 emergency assistance to the Nation's \n     farmers and ranchers, to help them through these times of \n     nationwide low commodity prices and regional droughts that \n     are withering crops and livestock. Simultaneously, this bill \n     would cut assistance to farmers funded through the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation, through a small FY 2000 sequester, at a \n     time when many farmers are hurting.\n       The effect on farm programs in the outyears starting in FY \n     2002 would be catastrophic, and cause thousands of farmers \n     and ranchers to go out of business. Farm income and price \n     support programs would be devastated, and if today's \n     commodity prices were to continue into the outyears, the \n     ``family farm'' would become a historic relic. In addition, \n     with U.S. agriculture heavily dependent on exports, such an \n     outyear sequester would end USDA's export credit programs \n     that guarantee billions of dollars of farm exports a year.\n       Starting in FY 2002, the Agriculture Department's crop \n     insurance program would shut down, and without insurance most \n     farmers and ranchers could not secure the financing from \n     banks needed to operate their farms and ranches.\n\n\n                             student loans\n\n       Guaranteed and Direct Student Loan Program borrowers would \n     have their origination fees increased by one-half of a \n     percentage point beginning in 2000.\n       The average student loan borrower would pay an additional \n     $28 in origination fees. A graduate student taking out the \n     maximum $18,500 loan would pay an additional $93 in fees. A \n     college junior or senior taking out the maximum $10,500 loan \n     would pay an additional $53 in fees.\n       Over 5.5 million beneficiaries would be affected.\n\n\n                       child support enforcement\n\n       New Federal funding for Child Support Enforcement would be \n     eliminated beginning in 2002 and many States would no longer \n     be able to continue this critical program. In FY 1998 this \n     program collected $14.3 billion on behalf of children and \n     families, and helped many low-income families move from \n     welfare to work.\n\n\n                  social services block grants (ssbg)\n\n       Beginning in FY 2002, SSBO would be eliminated. SSBG \n     provides funding to States to support a wide range of \n     programs including child protection and child welfare, child \n     care, as well as services focused on the needs of the elderly \n     and handicapped. The inherent flexibility of this grant \n     permits States to best target funds to meet the specific \n     needs in their communities.\n\n\n                          immigration support\n\n       Mandatory funding for immigration programs pays for the \n     costs administering laws related to admission, exclusion, \n     deportation and naturalization of aliens. These costs are \n     funded principally from fees paid by aliens. Sequestering \n     this entire amount in FY 2002 and subsequent years would \n     bring the immigration services program to a halt, leaving \n     millions of legal aliens stranded in the immigration process \n     and stopping all new immigration actions. This untenable \n     situation would have the further effect of stopping all new \n     fee revenue collections, thereby increasing overall mandatory \n     spending.\n\n\n                      mineral leasing act payments\n\n       The impact of a 100-percent outyear sequester starting in \n     FY 2002 on Mineral Act Leasing payments would be devastating \n     to many States. Under current law, these payments are made by \n     the Interior Department to States as a percentage of Federal \n     receipts received from the leasing and development of mineral \n     resources (oil, gas, coal,) on Federal lands in those States. \n     Most of the payments are made to the western States and to \n     Alaska. The States, in turn, generally use these payments to \n     help finance local elementary and secondary schools. Some of \n     the lowest-income States would have outyear funding to \n     schools substantially reduced as a result of such a large \n     sequester.\n\n                                           PAYGO SEQUESTER CALCULATION\n                                          [Dollar amounts in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              2000       2001       2002       2003       2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPAYGO Net Deficit Increase...............................      2,388        245     34,531     51,935     61,700\nExcess above total PAYGO sequester baseline..............          0          0      6,332     23,410     32,193\n                                                          ------------------------------------------------------\n      Sequester amount (constrained to baseline).........      2,388        245     28,199     28,525     29,507\n                                                          ======================================================\nProgrammatic Sequester Amounts:\n    Special rules:\n        ASI..............................................         24         38         39         40         41\n        GSL and Foster Care..............................        180        191        203        215        228\n    Medicare.............................................      1,981         15      9,247      9,993     10,567\n    All other (across-the-board sequester):\n        CCC..............................................         76          0      5,047      4,309      4,327\n        Child Support Enforcement........................         12          0      3,148      3,381      3,649\n        Social Services Block Grants.....................         22          0      1,441      1,435      1,435\n        Immigration Support..............................         14          0      1,319      1,319      1,319\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\n \n        Crop Insurance...................................         14          0      1,642      1,708      1,786\n        Mineral leasing Act payments.....................          6          0        630        644        656\n        Veterans Educ & Readj.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield back such time as remains.\n  Mr. President, would you believe there is one more Republican \nspeaker?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would believe that statement.\n\n\n     the taxpayer refund & relief act of 1999--thanks to the staff\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tonight we are passing a fantastic piece of \nlegislation. The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 will return \n$792 billion of tax overpayments to American taxpayers over the next 10 \nyears. It will cut income tax rates for all Americans. It contains \ndramatic cuts in the marriage penalty. It cuts capital gains tax rates \nand indexes capital gains for inflation. It eliminates death taxes. It \nexpands retirement opportunities, educational opportunities, and health \ncare choices. This, Mr. President, is a superb bill, and I am proud to \nhave been a part of the process that developed it.\n  I want to thank the following staff for their dedication, \nintelligence, long hours, and commitment to Republican principles. The \nmost important of these are Chairman Bill Roth's staff. Chairman Roth \nprovided the leadership, and these people did all the hard work to back \nthem up. From Senator Roth's Committee on Finance, I want to thank \nFrank Polk, Joan Woodward, Mark Prater, Brig Pari, Tom Roesser, Bill \nSweetnam, Jeff Kupfer, Ed McClellan, Tara Bradshaw, Ginny Flynn, Connie \nFoster, and Myrtle Agent. They are the tax counsels and policy experts \nwho help us understand the intricacies of tax policy and legislation. \nWe rely upon them every day for advice, and we have leaned on them for \nsupport during the past month. They are professional, patient, \nintelligent, and dedicated. I also want to thank John Duncan and Bill \nNixon from Senator Roth's staff for their leadership.\n  One person in particular deserves special mention. Mark Prater, \nChairman Bill Roth's chief tax counsel, was the principal Senate staff \narchitect of this bill. Mark is an enormously valuable resource to the \nentire U.S. Senate. Mark's knowledge of tax policy and the tax code are \nunsurpassed. His dedication to good tax policy is unmatched. While we \nall worked hard to craft this legislation, Mark has given his days, \nnights, and weekends to this bill for several months. And his patience, \nprofessionalism, and easygoing demeanor make it a pleasure to work with \nhim. I know that I speak for all of my colleagues, and for their staff, \nwhen I say thank you to Mark Prater for his work on this bill.\n  I want to thank all of the Joint Tax Committee staff for their \nexcellent, professional staff work. Under the leadership of Lindy \nPaull, and two of her deputies, Rick Grafmeyer and Mary Schmitt, the \nJoint Tax staff did an incredible job turning around legislative \nlanguage and scoring faster than we thought possible. They said we \ncouldn't conference two $792 billion bills in less than a week. Thanks \nto the leadership of Bill Roth and Bill Archer, and to the lightning \nspeed of the Joint Tax staff, we proved them wrong.\n  The staff for the Republican members of the Finance Committee also \ndeserve special recognition: Kathleen Black from Senator Chafee's \nstaff, Kolan Davis from Senator Grassley's staff, Judy Hill from \nSenator Hatch's staff, Alexander Polinsky from Senator Murkowski's \nstaff, Hazen Marshall from Senator Nickles' staff, Ginger Gregory and \nKeith Hennessey from my staff, Dick Ribbentrop, Steve McMillin, and \nMike Solon from Senator Gramm's staff, Jeff Fox and Ken Connolly from \nSenator Jeffords' staff, Vic Wolski and Shelly Hymes from Senator \nMack's staff, and Rachel Jones and Libby Wood from Senator Thompson's \nstaff.\n  Much of this debate centered on questions that are normally \nconsidered in a budget resolution, rather than a reconciliation bill. \nSo I also want to thank Senator Domenici's excellent Budget Committee \nstaff, who, as always, did top-notch work. In particular, I want to \nhighlight the efforts of Bill Hoagland, Cheri Reidy, Beth Felder, Jim \nCapretta, Amy Smith, Sandra Wiseman, and Andrew Siracuse. And we can't \nforget the Budget Committee ``masters of spin,'' Bob Stevenson and Amy \nCall.\n  I offer my profound thanks to all of these dedicated Senate staff. \nWithout their hard work, we would not be enjoying today's success.\n  I believe then Senator Specter will be the final speaker.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my view, the underlying issues on the \nconference report on the tax cut bill present a close question. There \nis much to be said for the basic proposition of returning a portion of \nthe surplus to the taxpayers so that they, instead of Congress, can \ndecide where to spend the money.\n  The competing view is that the projected surplus over a 10-year \nperiod is highly speculative and that great care must be exercised to \nbe sure Social Security and Medicare are solvent. The projected surplus \nalso requires adherence to caps or limitations on spending which both \nthe Congress and the President now admit to be unrealistic. The \nprojected surplus also does not take into consideration emergencies, \nsuch as the multibillion-dollar Agriculture appropriations bill which \npassed the Senate last night.\n  In addition, there is substantial merit to using any surplus to pay \ndown the national debt, thus reducing the $293 billion in annual \ninterest charges on the $5.6 trillion debt. On balance, on a close \nquestion, I believe the Nation's interest will be best served by \nrejecting the $792 billion tax cut, leaving open the possibility at a \nlater time of a more modest $500 billion tax cut as proposed by a group \nof centrists.\n  In reality, the vote on the conference report may well be meaningless \nin light of the President's repeated statements that he will veto the \nbill. This bill is probably just another step in the complex \nnegotiations involving pending appropriations bills, including mine as \nmy capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education.\n  I voted against the tax bill when it was before the Senate last week, \nand I am opposed to the tax bill tonight. At the urging of the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, I have agreed to consider a live pair with my \ncolleague, Senator Mike Crapo, who is in Idaho for his daughter's \nwedding. As of early this morning when I talked to Senator Crapo, there \nwere no commercial flights which would return him to Washington in time \nto vote. If he returned by charter aircraft, he would miss his \ndaughter's wedding ceremony and disrupt the family's wedding \ncelebration.\n  I have decided to agree to that live pair, which means that during \nthe rollcall, if it is necessary, if it turns out Senator Crapo's vote \nis indispensable, I will say that if Senator Crapo were here, he would \nvote aye for the bill and I would vote nay against the bill. His absent \naye vote would be paired then with my nay vote which would not be cast.\n  I am concerned, candidly, that this live pair being inside the \nbeltway would be widely misunderstood, but I believe it is preferable \nto compelling Senator Crapo's return to Washington\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nor to have the will of the Senate exclude the vote of Senator Crapo who \ncould not be here unless he returned by charter jet and missed his \ndaughter's wedding.\n  As I say, I voted against this bill last week, and I am opposed to it \ntoday. I intend to vote no unless the live pair with Senator Crapo is \nindispensable for the reasons I have just outlined.\n  I thank the Chairman and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as remains. I think \nit is 2 minutes.\n  As I said this morning, the fundamental question before Congress \nthese past few weeks, as we have debated the Taxpayer Refund Act of \n1999, is quite simple: Is it right for Washington to take from the \ntaxpayer more money than is necessary to run Government?\n  The issue of tax relief isn't anymore complicated than that, and the \noutcome of the conference between the Senate and the House makes it \nclear that Government is not automatically entitled to the surplus that \nis, in large part, due to the hard work, thrift, and risk taking of the \nAmerican people. Individuals and families are due a refund. That is \nexactly what we do with this legislation. We give the people a refund, \nand we do it in a way that is fair, broad based, and empowering.\n  Mr. President, I am ready to yield back the remainder of time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe we have yielded back the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will \nresume the Interior appropriations bill for consideration of \namendments. However, no further votes will occur this evening. If votes \nare ordered, those votes will be postponed to occur on Wednesday, \nSeptember 8. I hope Senators who have\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\namendments to the Interior appropriations bill will stay after the vote \nand further debate the amendments. I see that the manager of the bill \nis here.\n  Because of the agreement we reached and because of the good work that \nhas been done, even though we haven't completed Interior, we are now \ngoing to have a finite list from which to work. In view of that, there \nwill not be a session tomorrow. The next votes will be on Wednesday, \nSeptember 8. I urge Senators to be here on the 8th because there will \nbe votes, perhaps on the bankruptcy bill, or amendments to Interior. \nMembers should expect votes on that Wednesday. In addition, there will \nbe the cloture vote on Thursday.\n  I particularly thank the manager of the Tax Relief Act, Senator Roth, \nwho did an excellent job, and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, and \na lot of the dedicated staff who put in long hours to make it possible. \nI appreciate the cooperation of all of our Senators to get this work \ndone so we can have this period to go home and work our States during \nAugust.

Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is to recognize the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Robb.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is the Interior bill the subject?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Interior bill is the pending business.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in discussions with the manager of the bill, the \nmajority leader, and the Democratic leader, and understanding that the \nmatter that I was going to raise would require fairly extensive debate \nand then a vote, thus delaying the departure of Members for the August \nrecess--and remembering how fond Members have been of not bothering \nMembers of this body when they were the last obstacle between leaving \non the August recess and making one last vote--I have agreed with the \ndistinguished manager of the bill, the Senator from Washington, not to \noffer the amendment. He has agreed to recognize me first when the bill \nis next before the Senate.\n  With that in mind, and knowing that many of our colleagues are, as I \nspeak, heading for the airports, I will not offer the amendment I had \nplanned to offer this evening. I will offer it when we next take up the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I had expected that we would have a vote on a point of order with \nrespect to the section of the bill to which he refers tonight. He \nprefers, as is his right, to introduce a motion to strike this \nparticular provision. That is, of course, a debatable motion and a \nmotion that would be debated with some seriousness.\n  The majority leader has said the floor is available to debate \namendments tonight with the exception of the Senator from Virginia.\n  I don't see anyone here who I believe really wants to introduce and \ndebate an amendment tonight. We will leave a resolution or any recorded \nvote until Wednesday, September 8.\n  One Senator, Mr. Smith from Oregon, I know, wishes to debate the \nSenator from Virginia. If we can find him in the next 5 minutes or so, \nso that there could be a real debate, then I would be delighted to have \nthe Senator from Virginia introduce his amendment. But I think we ought \nto have someone on both sides here in order to do it.\n  In the meantime, for a few minutes at least, we are searching around \nto see if there are any agreed-upon amendments that I can simply \nintroduce and have offered and passed.\n  I also notice the presence of the Senator from Wyoming who waited \npatiently this morning with the Senator from Florida for a debate on a \nparticular amendment which might possibly end up being determined by a \nvoice vote.\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming whether his partner from Florida is \navailable this evening.\n  Mr. ENZI. We are checking.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a \nquorum while we see whether or not in the next few minutes we can \ngather people together for at least one debate on one amendment before \nwe adjourn for the recess.\n  With that, for the moment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for S. 1292, \nthe Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY 2000.\n  As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the full \nAppropriations Committee, I appreciate the difficult task before the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Minority to balance the diverse \npriorities funded in this bill--from our public lands, to major Indian \nprograms and agencies, energy conservation and research, and the \nSmithsonian and federal arts agencies. They have done a masterful job \nmeeting important program needs within existing spending caps.\n  The pending bill provides $14.0 billion in new budget authority and \n$9.15 billion in new outlays to fund Department of Interior agencies, \nincluding the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nthe U.S. Geological Survey, and the Minerals Management Service, and \nthe U.S. Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, the fossil energy \nand energy conservation programs of the Department of Energy, the \nSmithsonian, and federal arts and humanities agencies.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $14.0 billion in budget \nauthority and $14.3 billion in outlays for FY 2000. The Senate \nSubcommittee is $1 million in both budget authority and outlays below \nits revised 302(b) allocation. The bill is $35 million in BA above, and \n$104 million in outlays below, the bill recently passed by the House. \nThe bill is $1.1 billion in BA and $0.7 billion in outlays below the \nPresident's budget request in large measure because the President's \noffsets to increased discretionary spending are not within the \njurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I commend the Subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member for bringing \nthis important measure to the floor within the 302(b) allocation. I \nurge the adoption of the bill, and I ask unanimous consent that the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the document was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  S. 1292, INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 2000 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 General\n                                 purpose    Crime  Mandatory     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority...........     13,922   ......         59     13,981\n  Outlays....................     14,250   ......         83     14,333\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...........     13,923   ......         59     13,982\n  Outlays....................     14,251   ......         83     14,334\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority...........     13,800   ......         59     13,859\n  Outlays....................     13,994   ......         59     14,053\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority...........     15,046   ......         59     15,105\n  Outlays....................     14,992   ......         83     15,075\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...........     13,887   ......         59     13,946\n  Outlays....................     14,354   ......         83     14,437\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n             TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...........

Our power plants--the turbines, boilers and pollution \ncontrols that supply the electricity that powers our economy--are only \nas effective and reliable as the materials we use to build them.\n   Mr. Chairman, you and the Committee have done an admirable job in \nfashioning a budget that points this Nation toward new technologies for \ngenerating electricity in the 21st Century. The Committee's proposal \nsupports a new concept for power generation called ``Vision 21.'' This \n``Vision 21'' initiative excites our imagination over the possibility \nof a pollution-free power plant. But the success of ``Vision 21''--or, \nfor that matter, any advances in tomorrow's energy technologies--will \ndepend on the development of stronger, more durable, and more reliable \nmaterials.\n  Your support, Mr. Chairman, has been critical in ensuring that \nfunding for materials research and development is included in this \nbill. Should the Department of Energy reassess its funding needs and \npriorities in order to move this research effort forward, would you \ngive consideration to a request from the Department to redirect a \nportion of its funding to further this effort?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nhis endorsement of this aspect of energy research. As the Senator \nmentioned, we have included a modest increase in materials research in \nthe fossil energy budget for this bill above the enacted level. I am \naware of the excellent research being done in the Senator's home \nstate--at the Federal Energy Technology Center--as well as in other \nEnergy Department laboratories. It is the intent of the Committee to \ncontinue to work with the Department of Energy to seek opportunities to \nenhance and strengthen this important area of research in balance with \nthe other high-priority research. In this regard, the Committee would \ncertainly give careful consideration to such a reprogramming request of \nthe Department of Energy.\n\n\n                   Glen Echo Park construction funds\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise with my colleague from the State of Maryland to \nengage the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the funds included \nin the Senate bill for Glen Echo Park, a unit of the George Washington \nParkway in Maryland.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to join with the Senior Senator from \nWest Virginia in a colloquy with the esteemed members of the Senate \ndelegation from Maryland regarding Glen Echo.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chairman. Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, \nis it the intent of the Appropriations Committee that the funds \nprovided in the bill for Glen Echo Park in the construction account of \nthe National Park Service be used for rehabilitation and replacement of \nfacilities at Glen Echo Park?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the Chairman.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, is it also the intent \nof the Appropriations Committee that the funds provided for Glen Echo \nPark in the construction account of the National Park Service represent \nthe first phase of an estimate $18 million restoration effort, whose \ntotal costs will be shared equally by the National Park Service, the \nState of Maryland and Montgomery County?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes it is.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the Chairman.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member.\n\n\n               operational expenses at our national parks\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a project that \nthe Senate has been working on for over two decades, the Congaree Swamp \nNational Monument. When this National Monument was established in 1976, \nits purpose was to educate present and future generations. Mr. \nPresident, through the leadership of the Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, we have come a long way. In \nFY'98, funding was provided to build and pave a new entrance road and \nwith FY'99 funds, the park's first visitor facility, a 10,300 sq. ft. \neducation and administration facility is near completion. The total \nestimated cost for these two projects was $5.814 million. Through a \npartnership with the National Guard, Richland County, and a local non-\nprofit organization these projects will be built for a total cost of \n$2.16 million. That is a savings of $3.65 million to the American tax \npayer.\n  Now that a new administration facility is close to being completed, \nwe face the difficult task of providing adequate staffing levels at the \nCongaree National Monument. Increased staffing levels are needed at \nthis monument to ensure safety and to provide education to the \nincreasing number of park visitors. While I know earmarking operational \nfunds for specific park sites is not the best course of action, I do \nwant to bring to light the problem that this National Monument will be \nfacing in the near future. In 1996, an on-site operations review by \nseven Atlantic Coast Cluster Superintendents concluded that ``the \n[park's] staffing level is inadequate to provide minimum resource \nprotection and visitor services''. The report continued with the \nstatement that ``the park staff, with considerable support from an \nexcellent volunteer cadre, is doing a valiant job of operating the park \nto the best of their ability, but lack the same breadth of resources \nand facilities in other National Park Service sites. * * * '' More than \n300-school group program requests were denied last year because of the \nlack of staff. A large percentage of park visitors leave without \nlearning the significance of the park due to the lack of programs. The \nshortage of staff will become even more critical with completion of the \nnew infrastructure and increased visitation.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am well aware of the shortfall when it comes to \noperation expenses, not only at the Congaree Swamp National Monument, \nbut at many National Park Service sites. When crafting the FY 2000 \nInterior Appropriations bill, we took staffing needs and operation \nexpenses into account and provided $1,355,176,000, which is an increase \nof $69,572,000 over the fiscal year 1999 enacted level.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. With an additional $69.5 million, is there any funding \nprovided that would help the Congaree Swamp National Monument in its \nattempt to address the need for additional staff?\n  Mr. GORTON. While the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nalluded to the problem of earmarking specific operational expenses \nearlier, I will say that of the total amount provided, $27,035,000 is \nfor a park operations initiative focused on parks with critical health \nand safety deficiencies, inadequate resources protection capabilities \nand shortfalls in visitor services.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Congress Swamp National Monument is deemed to \nhave critical health and safety deficiencies, inadequate resources \nprotection capabilities or shortfalls in visitor services, can a \nportion of this $27 million be used to hire additional staff?\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand that the National Park Service has already \ntargeted these funds for specific park sites.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. Chairman, I also understand the frustration that arises \nwhen National Park Service sites are under staffed. In fact, a number \nof National Park Service sites in West Virginia have unmet operational \nand staffing needs. I can assure the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina that if the National Park Service deems the Congress Swamp \nNational Monument to be in need of additional staff to carry out its \nstated mission the Committee would give careful consideration to \nproviding additional funds in the future to increase staffing levels at \nthis site. It is important that visitors to all our National Park sites \ncome away with the education and appreciation that these sites deserve.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank both the Chairman and Ranking Member for \neverything they have done in support of\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\nour National Parks. I also want the National Park Service to work with \nthe Congress Swamp National Monument, as well as other park sites, to \nmake sure that they are adequately staffed to carry out their stated \nmissions.\n\n\n                        forest service research\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I rise with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee \nfrom Wisconsin and Vermont to engage the Chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, the Senior Senator from Washington, in a \ncolloquy regarding Forest Service research and the intent of the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with the \nRanking Member of the Interior Subcommittee and with the distinguished \nSenators from Wisconsin and Vermont who also serve on that Subcommittee \nto provide further guidance and clarification as to the Committee \ndirection included in the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill \nand accompanying report.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. Chairman, S. 1292, a bill making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2000, and for other purposes, includes a net reduction of \n$10,000,000 below the fiscal year 1999 enacted level (from $197,444,000 \nto $187,444,000). Is this the total decrease included in the bill for \nthis program?\n  Mr. GORTON. While the overall reduction is $10,000,000, within the \ntotal funding level the Committee has provided increases above the \nfiscal year 1999 level of (1) $1,130,000 for the harvesting and wood \nutilization laboratory in Sitka, Alaska, (2) $2,000,000 for forest \ninventory and analysis, (3) $500,000 for hardwood research and \ndevelopment at Purdue University, (4) $600,000 for the development of \nthe National Center for Landscape Fire Analysis at the University of \nMontana, and (5) $700,000 for the CROP program. Therefore, other \nactivities of the Forest Service research are to be reduced by a total \nof $14,930,000 below the enacted level.\n  Mr. BYRD. What guidance has the Committee provided the Forest Service \nwith respect to how the Forest Service should reduce its other research \nactivities by $14,930,000?\n  Mr. GORTON. The report accompanying S. 1292, Senate Report 106-99, \nstresses the concern of the Committee that the research program of the \nForest Service has lost its focus on its primary mission--forest health \nand productivity--and directs the Forest Service to reduce those areas \nnot directly related to enhancing forest and rangeland productivity. \nThere are existing research programs outside the agency that have \ngreater expertise and objectivity than the Forest Service; especially \nbeyond the disciplines of forest health and productivity.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am concerned that without further elaboration on this \nmatter the Forest Service may misinterpret the Committee's intent and \ntake reductions that are not in keeping with the expectations of the \nCommittee. It would be useful to expand upon the guidance provided in \nthe report in order to avoid any misunderstandings as to the will of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Your point is well taken, and I welcome the opportunity \nto provide additional information. The expectations of the Committee \nare that the Forest Service will not provide any increased funding for \nactivities not expressly stated as increases in Senate Report 106-99. \nIn other words, the Committee has not provided any increased funding \nfor the climate change technology initiative or for global climate \nresearch. Nor has the Committee provided any increased funding in this \naccount for Forest Service research on invasive species, fire science, \nwatershed science, inventory and monitoring, or recreation, wilderness \nand social science. The Committee also has denied any increases for \nfish and wildlife habitat research programs, for the application of \nmathematical programming and computer simulation tools in national \nforest planning, and for forest health monitoring research.\n  Beyond disallowing any of these increases, the Committee expects \nreductions in research funding to be targeted in those research areas \nthat are not directly related to its core mission of forest health and \nproductivity. In addition to social science and recreation research, \nwhich are well outside the expertise and core mission of the Forest \nService, research not directly related to forest health and \nproductivity includes, but is not limited to, research on wildlife, \nfish, water, and air sciences; global climate change and wilderness \nresearch. Beyond these research areas, other funding projects that the \nCommittee feels are appropriate for reductions include the \nadministrative costs of the Washington office (funded at $11.261 \nmillion in fiscal year 1999) and support for so-called ``national \ncommitments'' (funded at $5.744 million in fiscal year 1999).\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chairman for explaining the expectations of the \nCommittee regarding forest service research. Based on this \nclarification, is it the Committee's intent that the Forest Service \nwill maintain funding at the fiscal year 1999 level for projects NE-\n4557 (Disturbance, Ecology and Management of Oak-Dominated Forests), \nNE-4751 (Forest Engineering Research--Systems Analysis to Evaluate \nAlternative Harvesting Strategies), NE-4353 (Sustainable Forest \nEcosystems in the Central Appalachians), NE-4701 (Efficient Use of the \nNorthern Forest Resources), NE-4803 (Economics of Eastern Forest Use), \nand NE-4805 (Enhancing the Performance and Competitiveness of the U.S. \nHardwood Industry)? All of these projects are in West Virginia and \ncontribute directly to forest health and productivity.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, it is the intent of the Committee that these \nprojects be funded for fiscal year 2000 at their fiscal year 1999 \nfunding levels.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In that same vein, is it the Committee's intent that the \nForest Service will maintain funding at the fiscal year 1999 level for \nproject NE-4103 (The Role of Environmental Stress on Tree Growth and \nDevelopment)? This project is conducted at Burlington, Vermont, and \nprovides information directly related to forest health and \nproductivity.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, it is the intent of the Committee that this project \nbe funded for fiscal year 2000 at its fiscal year 1999 funding level.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the distinguished Senators \nfrom Washington and West Virginia have brought up the issue of Forest \nService research. As they have noted, there is some significant \nresearch being conducted by the Forest Service, vital to forest health \nmanagement and forest productivity that the Committee supports. Am I \ncorrect in my understanding that it was the Committee's intention in \nits discussion of Forest Service research in the Committee's report to \nmaintain for fiscal year 2000 the forest products utilization research \nand supporting research activities conducted at the Forest Products Lab \nin Madison, Wisconsin, at the fiscal year 1999 funding level?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Wisconsin is correct.\n  Mr. KOHL. Cutting these research programs would dramatically decrease \nthe Nation's ability to conserve scarce forest resources. It would \neliminate work on major research issues in western softwood forests and \nin eastern hardwoods. Forest products research defrays forest \nmanagement costs, increases fiber availability to meet the Nation's \nneed for wood and fiber, speeds the acceptance of new and more \nefficient utilization technologies, and enhances the development of \ntechnologies that will restore economic vitality to forest-dependent \ncommunities. Curbing forest product research would also eliminate \ntechnical expertise on wood use, particularly in the area of housing.\n  Mr. GORTON. I want to thank Senator Kohl for highlighting the vital \nwork of the Forest Products Lab and reiterate the Committee's support \nfor its research program.\n\n\n                national park service concession review\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As the Senator from Washington is aware, the National \nPark Service is responsible for the management of much of the land \nalong the Georgetown waterfront in the District of Columbia. As a \nregular visitor to this area, I have been disappointed with the \ncondition and appearance of much of the land under the management of \nthe National Park Service, particularly the area surrounding Thompson's \nboathouse, the boathouse itself, and the nearby lands that are\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\ncurrently used for boat storage. These lands are adjacent to the \nconfluence of Rock Creek and Potomac River, making their care and \nmaintenance critical to the protection of the watershed.\n  I understand that upkeep and maintenance of the boathouse is the \nresponsibility of the concessioner that manages the boathouse. Does the \nChairman of the Subcommittee feel that it would be appropriate for the \nNational Park Service to review the concession contract for the \nboathouse, and the performance of the concessioner under that contract, \nto determine whether the concessioner should be compelled to make a \ngreater effort to maintain and rehabilitate the boathouse and \nappurtenant lands?\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree that such a review would be appropriate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Chairman also agree that, to the extent \nappropriate in meeting its responsibilities and obligations, the \nNational Park Service should review the maintenance and rehabilitation \nneeds for this area and strongly consider allocating additional \nresources to make any needed improvements?\n  Mr. GORTON. In the past several years, the Committee has provided the \nService with a substantial amount of additional funds of repair and \nrehabilitation of park facilities and properties. I agree that it would \nbe appropriate for the Service to consider allocating a portion of \nthese resources for the purposes noted by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee.\n\n\n                  maggie walker national historic site\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I like to take a few moments to express my \nconcern about funding for the Maggie Walker National Historic Site in \nRichmond. While construction funding was included in the budget \nsubmitted by the National Park Service, funding was not included in the \nInterior appropriations bill before us today. I want to make sure that \nthe managers of this legislation are aware of just how important the \nMaggie Walker project is to both the Richmond community and to our \nnation. I would also like to urge them to provide this funding.\n  Maggie Walker, who lived in Richmond from her birth in 1867 until her \ndeath in 1934, epitomized triumph in the face of adversity. In an era \nthat glorified male achievement, and in a part of the nation that did \nnot encourage African American leadership, she stood out as a very \nsuccessful member of society despite the fact that she was both female \nand African American.\n  Ms. Walker both succeeded within the system and pushed for change. \nShe established a newspaper. She organized a student strike to protest \nunequal graduation ceremonies. She founded a bank and was the first \nwoman in the nation to serve as president of a bank. She was also \nactively involved in founding the Richmond chapter of the NAACP, and \nthroughout her life, Maggie Walker championed humanitarian causes.\n  The Maggie Walker National Historic Site in Richmond is comprised of \nthe Walker home, and several adjacent support buildings. The Walker \nresidence itself was built in 1883 and purchased by the Walker family \nin 1904. The residence served as Ms. Walker's home untile the year of \nher death. The Walker family sold the home to the National Park Service \nin 1979. Furnishings throughout the home are original family pieces.\n  The National Park Service budget request is necessary to literally \nprotect the site from destruction, as well as for safety and historic \npreservation. Funding will support a fire suppression system for the \nmain Walker home, and will restore the exteriors of the adjacent \nsupport buildings. These structures will be used for interpretive and \neducation facilities, and for museum storage.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join my colleague in this effort. Mr. President, the \nconstruction funding request by the National Park Service budget would \nhelp protect and expand the facility to provide a better legacy for our \nchildren. Educational programs for all children, especially the \nchildren of Virginia, will serve as a living reminder of the prejudice \nthat took place in our country at the turn of the century, and Maggie \nWalker's life will provide a strong role model for present and future \ngenerations seeking to overcome adversity.\n  Maggie Walker urged women to work together to advance their place in \nsociety. She said, ``If our women want to avoid the traps and snares of \nlife, they must band themselves together, organize, acknowledge \nleadership, * * * and work * * * for themselves.'' Maggie Walker also \nstressed the empowerment of minorities in the business field. She \nrecognized the ``need of a savings bank, chartered, officered, and run \nby the men and women of this [community] * * * Let us have a bank that \nwill take the nickels and turn them into dollars.'' The Maggie Walker \nHouse symbolizes the persistence of an individual in the face of \nprejudice. For citizens in Richmond, the life of Ms. Walker, and her \nNational Historic Site, are a daily inspiration.\n  I hope the construction money allotted to the Maggie Walker National \nHistorical Site in the National Park budget and approved by the \nPresident will be provided. I thank my colleagues for considering this \nmatter, and I'd appreciate hearing the managers' views on this project.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree with the Senators from Virginia that the life of \nMaggie Walker is indeed an inspiration. While we're facing tough \nfunding constraints and did our best to meet National Park Service \nneeds in the State of Virginia. I will work with the senior senator \nfrom West Virginia to see what can be done for the Historic Site.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with the Senator from Washington that this project \nis important, and I will do what I can to the extent that funds become \navailable.\n\n\n               virginia beach minerals management service\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, and I would like to bring to the Managers' attention a serious \nconcern involving the City of Virginia Beach and the Minerals \nManagement Service of the Department of Interior. In my view, the city \nhas been unfairly treated, and I hope we can rectify this matter during \nconference negotiations on the Interior Appropriations Bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I support the view of my colleague. We wish to briefly \nreview the issue for the Managers and explain why we believe that an \ninjustice has been done to the City of Virginia Beach.\n  For past 25 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction \nwith the City, has been working to complete the Sandbridge Beach \nErosion Control and Hurricane Protection Project, one of the region's \nhighest priorities. Early in 1998, several Nor'easters struck the east \ncoast and literally demolished Sandbridge Beach, which is a very \nimportant barrier island that provides protection for the Back Bay \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Forty homes were lost to the storms, and more \nthan 300,000 cubic yards of protective beach sand were washed away. As \na result, there was an immediate, critical need to replenish the beach. \nAlthough the Corps has the responsibility of annual renourishment of \nSandbridge, as it is a federally-authorized project, the City advanced \nthe money to replenish the beach because it was in a state of \nemergency.\n  I wish to emphasize that point. Instead of waiting for the Congress \nto appropriate the funds to the Corps, the City spent $8.1 million of \nits own money for the Sandbridge Beach Renourishment, which is an \noption Congress allowed the City under the Water Resources Development \nAct.\n  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) became involved when the Corps \nselected a location to mine the sand for Virginia Beach. The location \nselected, the bottom of the ocean three miles off the coast, is an area \nlegally designated as the ``outer continental shelf.'' Pursuant to the \n1994 amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OSC), the MMS \nnegotiates agreements for the right to extract minerals from the outer \ncontinental shelf. Under this authority, the MMS made a decision, which \nwe believe to be both unfair and poor policy, to charge the City of \nVirginia Beach for the sand mined.\n  The MMS has the authority to change its decision, and I believe this \nwould be the right thing to do. First, with respect to the discretion \nof the MMS, the MMS's own Proposed Policy and Guidelines state that:\n  The new law provides that the Secretary may assess a fee. This \naffords discretion not to assess a fee on a case-specific basis.\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. So it's clear that the MMS could have opted not to charge \nthe City of Virginia Beach?\n  Mr. ROBB. That's right. More important, we believe that not charging \nthe city would have been the best policy decision. First, the sand paid \nfor by the city protected federal land. MMS guidelines state that \n``when OCS sand is used for protection of Federally-owned land (e.g. \nfor military bases, national parks, and refuges), a fee would not be \nassessed.'' That is the case in this instance.\n  Sandbridge beach is crucial to protecting the Back Bay National \nWildlife Refuge, which is federally owned. The fragile beach acts as a \nbarrier island as the fresh water/brackish environment is three feet \nlower than the ocean adjacent to Sandbridge. If this beach is not \nmaintained, an inlet could form, changing the ecology to a salt water \nestuary causing great harm to the Refuge and also disrupting one of the \npotable water sources for the City of Chesapeake. Additionally, the \nproject is directly adjacent to the Dam Neck Fleet Combat Training \nCenter. The beach at this Center was recently renourished with an \n850,000 cubic year nourishment project. Sandbridge acts as a feeder \nbeach for the Dam Neck area and also provides protection to the flank \nof the training Center. In short, the City of Virginia Beach used its \nown funds to protect federal property. Compensation is only fair.\n  I'd like to add that fair compensation is something the City of \nVirginia Beach had assumed in good faith would be forthcoming. The City \nacted in an emergency to protect the beach. This beach is a \nCongressionally-authorized project and is being constructed by the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers led the city to believe that it would be \ncompensated. In fact, the Corps has already used approximately 2 \nmillion of its federal dollars to design the project, is acting as \nconstruction manager, and considered this renourishment to be the first \nphase of this project authorized by Congress in the 1992 Water \nResources Development Act.\n  In addition, the City of Virginia Beach was assessed a free by the \nMMS for mining the sand used to construct the federal project at \nSandbridge solely because the City, not the federal government, fronted \nthe cost of the construction.\n  Mr. GORTON. What is the regulation the MMS used to assess this fee?\n  Senator WARNER. There is only a guidance document, which was drafted \nin October 1997 by the MMS under the title ``Proposed Policy and \nGuidelines on Fees for Outer Continental Shelf Resources Used in Shore \nProtection and Restoration Projects''. There have been no further rules \npromulgated since that time, and the City of Virginia Beach is the \nfirst public body and only public body to be assessed this fee \nsubsequent to the issues of the ``Proposed Policy''.\n  Mr. GORTON. My understanding is that the purpose for establishing \nfees for mineral extraction from the outer continental shelf was to \nassure that the citizens were compensated for allowing the use of \npublic resources by profit-seeking endeavors.\n  Mr. ROBB. My colleague is correct. But I wish to stress that this \ncase was not a profit-seeking endeavor, but an emergency situation to \nreplace sand on a federally-authorized beach that was washed away \nduring a severe storm.\n  Mr. BYRD. Are there any instances of the MMS waiving the fee?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, there are. The MMS waived the fee for two other \nrequests for use of OCS sand for shore protection projects sponsored by \nthe corps. One was in Duval County, FL, and the other in Myrtle Beach, \nSC. For these two cases, the MMS ruled that project-related activities \nhad progressed to the point that an ``assessment of a fee for the OCS \nsand resources could have delayed or prevented project construction''. \nThe MMS therefore determined that waiving the fee would be in the best \ninterest of the public in those two cases. In the case of Sandbridge \nBeach, we believe that it was in the best interest of the public for \nthe MMS to waive the fee as it not only is a Congressionally authorized \nproject, but it also protects a federally owned wildlife refuge, the \nBack Bay National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. GORTON. What was the nature of the fee assessed to the City by \nthe MMS?\n  Mr. ROBB. The City of Virginia Beach was assessed a fee of $0.18 per \ncubic yard, and they were forced to enter into a lease agreement with \nMMS before being allowed to obtain critical sand for the emergency \nbeach erosion project. The money paid in MMS fees, which totaled \n$198,000, would have allowed the City to place an additional 40,000 \ncubic yards of sand on this badly eroded beach.\n  In conclusion, we hope our colleagues agree that the MMS should have \nutilized their option to waive the fee for sand replenishment in this \nemergency situation, and as a result, the City should be reimbursed for \nprotection Sandbridge Beach. Not only did the MMS assess a fee on a \nfederally-authorized project which protects federal land, but they took \nadvantage of the City during an emergency situation. Under the time \nconstraints the City had no other alternative to find sand elsewhere, \nand was forced to pay the fee. It is for these reasons that my \ncolleague and I believe that the MMS has an obligation to reimburse the \nCity of Virginia Beach for this incorrectly assessed fee.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am sympathetic to our colleague' request. I am also \naware that language authorizing repayment of the fee charged to the \nCity of Virginia Beach is included in this year's Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. We are facing very tough funding constraints this \nyear, but if the senior Senator from West Virginia agrees, we'll work \ntogether to help the city if possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am also sympathetic to the request, and I will support \nthat effort.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Washington and the Senator from \nWest Virginia. Senator Warner and I want to reemphasize that this is a \nsituation of basic fairness, and action is needed to correct an \ninjustice imposed by the federal government. We ask that if funds \nbecome available during the House-Senate Conference, that the Managers \nprovide $198,000 to reimburse the City of Virginia Beach. We thank our \ncolleagues.\n\n\n                           cumberland island\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I rise to engage the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding Cumberland \nIsland National Seashore, which is located just off the coast of \nGeorgia. As Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd are aware, the Congress \nrecently provided funding for an important land acquisition for \nCumberland Island, which will ensure the protection of lands on \nCumberland Island for generations to come. In conjunction with this \nland acquisition, I worked with the National Park Service, residents of \nthe island, and members of the historic and environmental communities \nto reach a unanimous agreement on the management of Cumberland Island \nNational Seashore. The agreement provides a framework for the proper \nmanagement of the cultural and wilderness resources on the island. I \nstrongly supported the development of this agreement and am committed \nto ensuring that this agreement is followed regarding the management of \nCumberland Island National Seashore. Do the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee share my strong support for \nthe implementation of the agreement?\n  Mr. GORTON. I was pleased that the Georgia delegation, the \nAdministration and a variety of local interests were able to reach \nagreement with regard to the preservation of lands and historic \nproperties on Cumberland Island, and am pleased that we were able to \nprovide a considerable amount of funds to implement the first phase of \nthe agreement. Your leadership has been instrumental in this matter, \nand I appreciate your efforts to provide for the lands and management \nof the Cumberland Island National Seashore. I look forward to working \nwith you to the extent additional funds are necessary to implement the \nagreement, recognizing the difficult fiscal limitations under which the \nCommittee must operate.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the Chairman and would support Congressional \nefforts to provide additional compliance actions regarding the \nagreement, if necessary. Your involvement in Cumberland Island has been \ncritical in protecting and preserving these precious resources in a \nmanner that balances National and local interests.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senators for their support and kind words.\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\n        vermont agency of transportation electric vehicle lease\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Subcommittee on Interior, \nand particularly Chairman Gorton, for his excellent work on the FY 2000 \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. I would especially \nlike to thank the Chairman for encouraging the Department of Energy to \nconsider the Vermont Agency of Transportation electric vehicle lease \nproposal. I would just like to clarify that the committee's \nrecommendation refers to a request for $400,000 from the Vermont Agency \nof Transportation to develop an electric vehicle program, including the \npurchase and demonstration of electric vehicles, the creation of \ncharging stations, reports documenting vehicle use, and the collection \nof experiential data, for the State of Vermont and its municipalities.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his kind remarks. \nWithin available funds, the Committee encourages the Department of \nEnergy to provide funding for the Vermont Agency of Transportation \nVehicle Lease Program.\n\n\n                ponca tribe of nebraska user population\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am concerned the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska \nfunding for health services is not adequate to provide these services \nto tribal members. As the Chairman may know, the Ponca Tribe was \nterminated in 1962 and restored as a federally recognized Tribe in \n1990. At the time of restoration, the Tribe's user population was \nestimated at 654 and was allocated a $1.2 million budget.\n  In January 1998, the Ponca Tribe established the Ponca Health and \nWellness Center in Omaha, Nebraska. This clinic provides quality \nmedical, dental, pharmaceutical, and community outreach health services \nto members of all federally recognized Tribes. As a result of this new \nclinic, the user population has increased to over 2000 users without a \nbudget increase to address the larger population. Does the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington agree this problem must be \naddressed?\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand the concerns of the Senator from Nebraska \nregarding the need for resources to address the increase in user \npopulation for the Ponca Tribe Health and Wellness Center. It is \nimportant the Ponca and other Tribes be able to continue providing \nquality health services for its members. I believe the IHS should \nexamine this issue and identify ways to help the Ponca and other \nTribes, which have experienced unusual increases in user populations.\n  Mr. KERREY. Clearly, the Ponca Tribe needs resources in order to meet \nthe health needs of an increased user population. It is my hope the \nIndian Health Service (IHS) will address this unusual increase with its \nresources. I encourage the IHS to provide increased funding to any \nTribe that has experienced an increase in the user population of 50 \npercent or more over fiscal years 1996-99 to the extent possible within \nexisting resources.\n\n\n          mari sandoz cultural center $450,000 funding request\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wish to ask the distinguished floor \nmanager a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly. I am happy to respond to my colleague from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I realize that this year, you and Ranking Member Byrd are \nfacing a challenging appropriations season with tight budgetary \nconstraints. I appreciate your hard work and all that you have done. \nHowever, I wanted to bring to your attention a very important project \nfor the State of Nebraska, especially the western part of the state, \nthe Mari Sandoz Cultural Center at Chadron State College in Chadron, \nNebraska. Mari Sandoz wrote extensively about the Great Plains--about \nfur traders and homesteaders, about cattlemen and grangers; about the \nCheyenne and Oglala Sioux. She captured in her writings a special time \nand place. Chadron State College and the Mari Sandoz Society are \ndeveloping a cultural center to preserve, protect and exhibit a \ncollection that is associated with Mari Sandoz's life and work. I had \nhoped that we would be able to find $450,000 to assist with this \nproject.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware of the Senator's interest in this project and \nits importance to Nebraska's history and heritage. We were unable to \ninclude funding for one of the accounts where this project might be \nsupported. However, I will work with the Senator to see if we can \nidentify funds for this project in the future.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chairman for his assistance. I appreciate the \nconsideration of this important project, and I know the people of \nNebraska, especially western Nebraska, will also be more appreciative.\n\n\n             forest service reconstruction and maintenance\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I rise to engage the Chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, the Senator from Washington, Senator \nGorton, in a colloquy on an item in the Forest Service budget which \nneeds some clarification. The fiscal year 2000 budget justification \nsubmitted by the administration included $300,000 for planning and \ndesign of a new facility at the Forest Products Lab in Madison, WI, to \naccommodate a move of the Forest Service's regional office from \nMilwaukee to Madison. However, on April 15, 1999, during a hearing in \nthe Appropriations Committee on the Forest Service budget Mike Dombeck, \nthe Chief of the Forest Service, reiterated what the Forest Service has \ntold me in the past: The Forest Service has withdrawn the proposal to \nmove its Milwaukee office. The idea of moving the regional office from \nMilwaukee first came up in response to concerns about the rent in \nMilwaukee. Since then General Services Administration (GSA) has \nindicated that by fiscal year 2000, the rent in Milwaukee will be \nreduced by 18 percent, eliminating the need for the move.\n  During the Appropriations Committee's markup, we inadvertently \nincluded $300,000 for the proposed move in the Forest Service's \nreconstruction and maintenance budget. Since the Forest Service and GSA \nhave confirmed that the move will not and should not go forward, the \nCommittee is directing the Forest Service to use the $300,000 in this \naccount at the Forest Products Lab to expand the planned heat, \nventilation and air conditioning work already scheduled to occur at the \nlab. The funding should be used to replace air conditioning equipment \nfor buildings 33 and 34. The current equipment is more than 30 years \nold and is in poor condition, lacking automated controls so overtime \nstaffing is needed to operate the equipment on weekends. Replacement of \nthe air conditioning chillers in these buildings will be more energy \nefficient and will reduce overtime costs.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator from Wisconsin raising this \nissue. Leaving the regional office in Milwaukee will save the Forest \nService $4.5 million slated for future years spending to build a new \nfacility in Madison. The Committee agrees that using the $300,000 in \nthe fiscal year 2000 budget to improve the HVAC systems at the Forest \nProducts Lab is a far better use of these funds.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senator from Washington's courtesy and \nlook forward to working with him in conference to ensure that this \nmoney is spent as the Committee intended.\n\n\n              grand staircase-escalante national monument\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there are several provisions in this bill \nthat result directly from the establishment of the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument. First, we have identified $300,000 within \nthe amount allocated for the monument planning and decision making \nprocess. In FY 1999, $500,000 was provided to the two counties, and we \nanticipate that there will be funds available from the fee \ndemonstration program that could return them to the FY 99 level.\n  Additionally, we provided $100,000 to implement the ``Garfield-Kane \nCounty Partnership Action Plan.'' This action plan is the result of a \nprocess that began last year to help the counties and communities that \nhave been most impacted by the monument designation. This is not a \nwelfare program; this is to help them with reorganization leading to \neconomic self-sufficiency. The Department of Interior, to its credit, \nhas supported this effort and provided funds for a conference that was \nheld in Kane County earlier this year. The conference was mediated by \nthe Sonoran Institute. The conference report is the basis for the \nfunding.\n  The regional entities have formed a planning commission, the \nPartnership\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nTask Force, and are talking with the Utah Five County Association of \nGovernments (AOG) to establish a new and independent entity within that \norganization, which will provide administrative support and \norganization. Direction will come from a board composed of elected \ncounty and city officials from Kane and Garfield Counties and from \nportions of the Arizona Counties (Coconino and Mohave), which are north \nand west of the Colorado River. This also includes the Kaibab Paiute \nIndian Reservation.\n  It is my understanding that the BLM will fund the Partnership Task \nForce through the Five County AOG and will cooperate in developing \nrecommendations for the partnership action plan and specific programs. \nI would ask the Chairman if it is his expectation that the agency will \nperiodically report on the progress being made?\n  Mr. GORTON. It is, indeed, my expectation that the Department will \nwork with the organization in getting started and will provide a \nprogress report after ninety days, and a full report at the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman for his support.\n\n\n                     everglades funding assurances\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Florida, \nMr. Graham, to address briefly the issue of Everglades restoration and \nland acquisition funding. We had joined with the President in \nrequesting slightly more than $100 million for land acquisition in \nEverglades National Park, state assistance grants, infrastructure \ninvestment, and modified water deliveries to the Park and Florida Bay. \nThis funding is critical to keep the restoration effort on budget, on \nschedule, and consistent with the Congress' commitment in 1997 to fully \nfund Everglades restoration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, following on the comments of my colleague \nfrom Florida, the Committee did not see fit to appropriate the full \namount of these requested funds due to several concerns outlined in the \nCommittee's report. First, the report addressed the $40 million in \nunobligated balances at the Department of Interior that have already \nbeen appropriated by Congress for the Everglades restoration effort. \nFurther, the Committee echoed concerns raised in a recent GAO report \nregarding a more expedient dispute resolution mechanism and an \nintegrated strategic plan. I would ask the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee if this--in general--reflects the concerns of the \nSubcommittee as outlined in the report?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct, I also note that the Subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation was more than $1.1 billion below the Presidents \nrequest, which compelled the Subcommittee to provide lower funding \nlevels for land acquisition in order to protect core operating \nprograms.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the reservations of the Subcommittee are \nvalid ones and my colleague from Florida and I are willing to be \nhelpful however we can in addressing these concerns. I would say to the \nChairman that we are making progress on these issues. The Department of \nthe Interior tells me it is working closely with the State of Florida \nto remove the barriers to allocating the unobligated land acquisition \nand restoration balances. The Department assures these funds will be \nobligated by the end of this fiscal year.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, let me follow on by saying the Department \nfurther assures us they are making good progress on the concerns raised \nby the GAO report and echoed by the Committee. In fact, on July 1 of \nthis year, the administration released the Everglades Restudy--which is \nan extremely detailed 20-year plan for restoring the Everglades--to the \nCongress.\n  Mr. MACK. I would ask the Chairman of the Subcommittee if he would be \nwilling--given the movement toward resolving his concerns since release \nof the Committee's report--if he would be willing to work with us in \nConference to increase the overall Everglades funding from the levels \ncurrently in the bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friends from Florida for their comments. \nClearly the Everglades restoration effort is an important national \npriority. I can anticipate that funding for these accounts will likely \nbe discussed further during the Conference with the House. I can assure \nmy friends that I will take a close look at actions taken by the \nDepartment in response to the Committee's concerns and will work to \nensure the funding levels are adequate to keep the restoration effort \non track for the next fiscal year.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague for his response and assurances on \nthis important issue. I would also like to mention briefly the funding \nlevel for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. It is my \nunderstanding the Task Force's funding has been kept steady at $800,000 \nsince it was statutorily authorized in 1996. I want to bring this \nmatter to the Chairman's attention because of the restraints this low \nfunding ceiling is placing on the Task Force's ability to carry out its \nmission in South Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would continue by adding that the Task Force is the \nentity responsible of implementing the recommendations of the Committee \nwith respect to the dispute resolution mechanism and the strategic \nplan. Further, cost of living adjustments are forcing staff layoffs and \nseriously eroding the Task Force's ability to do its job. I would ask \nthe Chairman to consider increasing the Task Force's budget to the \nrequested $1.3 million during the Conference with the House.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friends from Florida for bringing this matter \nto my attention. I will take a look at the funding levels for the Task \nForce as we proceed to Conference.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my friend from Washington and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           trout brook valley\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few remarks on an \namendment I have at the desk. The amendment, which I intend to \nwithdraw, would provide a $2 million increase in funding for the Parks \nService Account. This money would be used to help a dedicated coalition \nof Connecticut citizens, conservation groups, and local and state \ngovernment acquire 668 acres in the Trout Brook Valley.\n  The Trout Brook Valley, like much of the remaining open space in \nConnecticut, is currently under threat of development and the Aspetuck \nLand Trust is trying to save it. They are not asking the Federal \nGovernment to foot the entire bill in the effort to preserve this \ncountryside for the enjoyment of future generations. Far from it, the \nlocally-led effort to save Trout Brook Valley is convinced that they \ncan and will raise $10.5 million of the $12.5 million dollars that the \nproperty will cost. My amendment would have provided Federal matching \nfunds equal to less than one-sixth of the total cost of acquiring this \nland for conservation.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the current Interior Appropriations \nbill allocates no funding to the stateside portion of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. The Trout Brook Valley project represents an \nexcellent example of why we need to appropriate adequate resources for \nstateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which \ntragically has gone unfunded since 1995. I am encouraged to learn, \nhowever, that an agreement to appropriate funds to the stateside LWCF \naccount is currently under discussion. Am I correct in that \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct. I point out that this project is not \nauthorized as a federal acquisition project. In addition, stateside \nLand and Water Conservation Fund projects are determined at the State \nlevel, so if funds for state grants are included in the bill, it still \nwill not be possible to secure dedicated funding for this project.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I understand that, and respectfully withdraw my \namendment.\n\n\n    land acquisition and state assistance for national park service\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to engage the \ndistinguished chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, on \na matter relating to the Land Acquisition and State Assistance account \nfor the National Park Service.\n  I was pleased to see that the Committee chose to provide funding for \nthe Ice Age National Scenic Trail in this account. One of eight \nNational Scenic Trails in the United States, the Ice Age Trail meanders \nthrough 31 Wisconsin counties, generally following the terminal \nmoraine. As I noted in my request to the Subcommittee, the depth of \ncommitment to the Ice Age Trail in the state of Wisconsin is \nimpressive. Many volunteers, local governments,\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\nand private organizations have contributed to the development of the \ntrail. The state of Wisconsin has also provided essential matching \nfunds to the trail's many partners. One of the most compelling aspects \nof this request for funding was the commitment from the State of \nWisconsin to match the federal funding we are providing for Ice Age \nTrail land acquisition.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. The Committee notes the \ncommitment of partners like the state of Wisconsin to provide matching \nfunds for the establishment of our national trails when we make our \ndeterminations for funding. The Committee urges partners to honor their \ncommitments as the prospects for future appropriations may be looked \nupon more favorably.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Washington for his remarks.\n\n\n                   weatherization assistance program\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise in the hope that the Chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, the gentleman from Alaska, will engage in \na colloquy with myself, Senator Jeffords and the Chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, the gentleman from Washington, on \nthe Weatherization Assistance Program provision in the bill passed by \nthe other body.\n  Mr. Chairman, as you are aware, the other body passed its version of \nthe FY 2000 Interior appropriations legislation on July 14. That bill \nincluded a provision mandating States to provide a 25 percent state \ncost share, or state match, in order to receive their FY 2000 \nWeatherization Assistance grants.\n  Despite the potential ramifications of implementing a State match, no \nhearings have been held, and no input has been solicited from the \nStates to determine if cost sharing is realistic or necessary for this \nprogram.\n  As many Senators are aware, state legislatures across the country \nsimply cannot meet this deadline with such short notice. In fact, some \nlegislatures are about to adjourn and will not meet again for another \nyear or even two.\n  Currently, the only data we have regarding the impact of the proposed \nState match comes from an informal survey undertaken this month by the \nNational Association of State Community Services Programs; it indicates \nthat 25 states definitely cannot provide matching funds in FY 2000; \nanother five large states are uncertain whether they can meet the \nrequirement, and less than ten States currently provide state-\nappropriated funds to Weatherization and would be able to comply \nimmediately.\n  It seems to me that consideration of such a fundamental change in the \ndistribution of state Weatherization Assistance grants falls squarely \nunder the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee. Wouldn't the \nChairman agree?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is certainly true. The Committee currently has no \nanalysis of the need for such a cost share nor of the state-by-state or \nnational impact of such a requirement.\n  Although the State of Alaska has established a state ``Trust Fund'' \nto contribute a significant amount to the State's Weatherization \nefforts, it would be imperative that we ascertain the ability of other \nStates to undertake such commitments before deciding on a change that \ncould bring an end to Weatherization services throughout the nation.\n  Of course, a federal program that can leverage non-federal funds and \nattract other partners always has a stronger case for appropriations. \nIs the Senator from New Mexico informed as to whether any states have \nmany such resources in their Weatherization program?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am told that, nationally, Weatherization leverages \nabout a 50 percent add-on from non-federal sources--but there is no \nstudy of this and it probably varies widely among states. In fact, the \nsame informal state survey I just mentioned reported that many of the \nstates have private partnerships between the utilities and the local \ncommunity action Weatherization programs, brokered in many instances by \nthe Weatherization programs, and that these partnerships are growing as \nutility restructuring moves forward. Many building owners in low-income \ncommunities also chip in for these services.\n  Further, I am told many states have excellent coordination among the \nfederal low-income energy and the low-income housing and community \ndevelopment programs. However, the fact is that most of the states \nreviewed the terms of the match in the House bill and said they don't \nbelieve these public-private efforts would qualify under that \nterminology.\n  I believe we would really have to look into any requirement that \ndidn't encourage private investment in these local programs; I hope the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy Committee would concur in opposing \nthe inclusion of language authorizing a State match for Weatherization \nin the Interior appropriations bill or Conference Report.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, the Weatherization Assistance Program is \nan investment. Its success is unparalleled--as a way to upgrade \nhousing, increase energy efficiency, and assist low-income Americans.\n  Weatherization enables very low-income people--including families \nwith children, older Americans, and individuals with disabilities--to \nexperience savings of 30 percent on their energy bills. For every \nfederal dollar invested in this program, $2.40 in energy, health, \nsafety, housing, and other measured benefits are achieved.\n  The mandate that States provide a 25 percent state cost share \ncontained in the bill passed by the other body may endanger states' use \nof this program. This provision causes great concern to me and other \nSenators of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I co-chair \nwith Senator Moynihan. Such a fundamental change in the distribution of \nstate Weatherization Assistance grants falls squarely under the \njurisdiction of the authorizing committee.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly agree that if we're going to make any \nmajor changes to the program, we need to do so in a way that encourages \nmore private investment and that we had better make sure we consult \nwith the Governors and utilities and get it right.\n  I would certainly oppose making such fundamental changes in the \npending bill. I hope the floor managers can give us assurance that the \nSenate Conferees will convey our concerns to their House counterparts \nand reject this language in Conference. I would like to ask the \nChairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee if the Senate \nconferees on this legislation will keep in mind the concerns of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee in mind and move to strike the \nHouse language?\n  Mr. GORTON. As the distinguished Chairman is aware, the bill before \nus does not include any language requiring a state match. I will \ncertainly keep the objections of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition in mind as we move \nto conference.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                           marbled murrelets\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year, we enacted the Intestate 90 \nLand Exchange Act authorizing a large land exchange in Washington \nbetween Plum Creek Timber Company and the Forest Service. The land \nexchange was scheduled under the Act to be closed on July 19. Just \nprior to closure, however, Plum Creek discovered Marbled Murrelets on \ntwo sections of Forest Service land scheduled under the Act to be \ntransferred to Plum Creek.\n  The discovery of Marbled Murrelets occurred after the appraisal was \ncompleted and signed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Plum Creek and \nthe Forest Service agree the two sections of land containing murrelets \nshould remain in federal ownership. The legislation, however, did not \ncontemplate or provide for the deletion of these lands or for the need \nto adjust the appraisal after it had been approved by the Secretary. We \nare working with the Forest Service and Plum Creek on a solution to \nthis problem.\n  The land exchange is vital because it substantially resolves a \ndecades old conflict created by the checkerboard ownership pattern in \ncentral Washington. It places into public ownership thousands of acres \nof mature timber and essential wildlife habitat, dozens of miles of \nstreams and riparian corridors and some of the most popular \nrecreational lands in Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague in his remarks about \nthe Plum Creek exchange. We worked very hard last year to enact this \nexchange. I also share a concern about the implications of the \ndiscovery or marbled\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\nmurrelets on the lands scheduled to be exchanged to Plum Creek. I agree \nthese lands should be left in federal ownership. I would like to ask \nSenator Gorton does one senator understand legislation is needed to \nallow the Forest Service to keep the two sections in question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. The Forest Service and Plum Creek have been working \non an amendment that would allow these two sections to be dropped from \nthe exchange and for the appraisal to be adjusted accordingly. It is my \nintention to continue to work with the Forest Service and Plum Creek to \ndraft an amendment to include in the conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with you, the Forest Service, Plum Creek, and other interested \nparties as the legislation is developed.\n\n\n                        THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, \nthe Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Interior \nAppropriations for their hard work. As they both know, last year I \nsponsored the authorizing legislation for the National Underground \nRailroad Network to Freedom. This new law directs the National Park \nService to review hundreds of Underground Railroad sites in Ohio and \naround the country, identify the most notable locations, and produce \nand disseminate appropriate educational materials. I believe the \nhistory of the Underground Railroad is a part of the American story \nthat we should be proud of. Last year, the Chairman and Ranking Member \nworked with me to fully fund the program in Fiscal Year 1999. I made a \nsimilar request this year. I would like to ask for clarification of \nsome language contained in the Committee Report. Specifically, the \nCommittee provided $1,245,891,000 to the National Park Service for park \nmanagement. Is it the Chairman's intent that this figure includes \n$500,000 for the implementation of the National Underground Railroad \nNetwork to Freedom?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleague from Ohio. The Senator is correct. \nThe funding for National Park Service park management will fully fund \nthe implementation of the National Underground Railroad Network to \nFreedom.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate the clarification from my colleague from \nWashington and thank him and Senator Byrd for their continued support \nfor this program.\n\n\n    benjamin franklin national memorial disabled access improvements\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe need for the federal government to share in the cost of much-needed \ndisabled access improvements at the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial \nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As my colleagues may know, this National \nMemorial was designated as a National Park Service Affiliated Area by \nPublic law 92-551.\n  The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial is located in the rotunda of \nThe Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \nThe Memorial Hall was opened in 1938 and features a 20-foot high marble \nstatue of Ben Franklin sculpted by James Earle Fraser, as well as many \nof Franklin's original possessions.\n   Mr. President, I was very appreciative earlier this year when the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, \njoined me in a visit to The Franklin Institute to see first-hand the \nneed for disabled access improvements in the National Memorial Hall. I \nbelieve that he saw for himself that the 1938 design of the facility \ndoes not lend itself to easy access for anyone in a wheelchair or with \nother disabilities. The legacy of Benjamin Franklin is one that should \nbe treasured and understood by all Americans, which is why I salute the \nFranklin Institute for embarking on a major capital development \ncampaign to pay for, among other things, some of the costs associated \nwith these renovations.\n  To date, the Institute has spent over $6 million of its own funds in \nthe ongoing maintenance of the Memorial Hall. Since Congress bestowed \nnational memorial status on this facility, and since it is important to \nensure that all Americans, regardless of physical ability, can benefit \nfrom learning more about Benjamin Franklin, I want to encourage \nChairman Gorton to continue working with me to providing funding for \nthis purpose. I am advised that in Fiscal Year 2000, $1 million in \nfederal funds would be a significant first step toward meeting the \nanticipated $6 million cost of rehabilitating and updating the National \nMemorial and its exhibits.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, for his comments. He has truly shown leadership with \nrespect to the funding needs of the Benjamin Franklin National \nMemorial, and I was pleased to participate in a tour of this facility \nwhen I visited Philadelphia this Spring.\n  I commend The Franklin Institute for seeking nonfederal sources of \nfunding to defray a substantial portion of the anticipated costs of the \nimprovements. As my colleagues are aware, we face tight budget \nconstraints in this legislation. I will continue working with my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania in the coming weeks, however, in an effort \nto identify sources of funding that may be available and appropriate \nfor this purpose.\n\n\n                rehabilitation of thaddeus stevens hall\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have also sought recognition to \nexpress my support for a project of historical, academic, and economic \nimportance at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. I believe \nthat this project is a perfect candidate for funding under the Save \nAmerica's Treasures grant program.\n  Stevens Hall, named for prominent Gettysburg citizen Thaddeus \nStevens, was the fourth major building erected on the campus of \nGettysburg College, in 1867. The building currently serves as a \ndormitory for undergraduate students. Renovation of the structure is \nnecessary to preserve the building's exterior and modernize the \nelectrical and fire prevention systems.\n  Gettysburg College plans to restore and rehabilitate Thaddeus Stevens \nHall and transform the building into a center for the study of history \nand the Civil War era. Stevens Hall will eventually house the College's \nCivil War Institute. Located adjacent to Eisenhower House and just \nblocks from the Gettysburg National Military Park, this project will \nnot only restore a distinguished example of 19th century architecture, \nbut will attract students of the Civil War nationwide. The College has \nalready committed substantial resources to this important project, \nsecuring $2.5 million in private funding for preservation work.\n  I understand that the committee did not include funding for the Save \nAmerica's Treasures program; however, federal funding is crucial to the \ntimely completion of restoration work on this historical structure. I \nurge the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, to continue to \nwork with me to identify appropriate federal funding for this important \npreservation initiative.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his comments, \nand I look forward to continuing to work with him on this request. I am \nwell aware of the importance he places on this project, and more \nbroadly, on his involvement in Gettysburg. I will work with my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania to fund the restoration and rehabilitation of \nThaddeus Stevens Hall.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1576\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment to H.R. 2466, \nthe FY 2000 Interior Appropriations bill, to authorize the Disabled \nVeterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial on Federal \nland in the District of Columbia to honor all disabled American \nveterans. This legislation is not controversial, costs nothing, and \ndeserves immediate consideration and passage.\n  As a Nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to all Americans who have \nworn their country's uniform in the defense of her core ideals and \ninterests. We honor their service with holidays, like Veterans Day and \nMemorial Day, and with memorials, including the Vietnam Wall and the \nIwo Jima Memorial. But nowhere in Washington can be found a material \ntribute to those veterans whose physical or psychological well-being \nwas forever lost to a sniper's bullet, a landmine, a mortar round, or \nthe pure terror of modern warfare.\n  To these individuals, we owe a measure of devotion beyond that \naccorded those who served honorably but without permanent damage to \nlimb or spirit. For these individuals, a memorial in Washington, D.C. \nwould stand as testament to the sum of their sacrifices, and\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nas proof that the country they served values their contribution to its \ncause.\n  We cannot restore the health of those Americans who incurred a \ndisability as a result of their military service. It is within our \npower, however, to authorize a memorial that would clearly signal the \nNation's gratitude to all whose disabilities serve as a living reminder \nof the toll war takes on its victims.\n  Under the terms of this legislation, the Disabled Veterans' LIFE \nMemorial Foundation would be solely responsible for raising the \nnecessary funding. Our amendment explicitly requires that no Federal \nfunds be used to pay any expense for the memorial's establishment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Daschle, Coverdell, \nCleland, and Kerrey in support of this legislation. America's disabled \nveterans, of whom Senator Cleland himself is one of our most \ndistinguished, deserve a lasting tribute to their sacrifice. They \nhonored us with their service; let us honor them with our support \ntoday.\n\n\n                           ITM SYNGAS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, The \nChairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for adding \n$1.4 million to the Department of Energy's competitively awarded, cost-\nshared ITM Syngas program, specifically the ``Engineering Development \nof Ceramic Membrane Reactor Systems for Converting Natural Gas to \nHydrogen and Synthesis Gas for Liquid Transportation Fuels'' project. \nThis important high-risk, high-impact gas-to-liquids research and \ndevelopment project will convert domestic remote and off-shore natural \ngas to synthesis gas, resulting in lower cost production and cleaner \nalternative fuels. This program also promises to create new markets for \nU.S. domestic resources and extend the useful life of the Alaskan North \nSlope oil fields and the trans-Alaskan pipeline system.\n  The ITM Syngas research and development effort is a complex, high \nrisk undertaking by the Department of Energy and its industry, national \nlaboratory and university partners. As with any complex technological \nundertaking, the Department of Energy and its ITM Syngas team have had \nto increase the scope of the initial phase of the program and add a \nuniversity partner to ensure the project's long-term success.\n  This $1.4 million is in addition to the budget request for fiscal \nyear 2000 of $2.5 million that is in the Fossil Energy, Gas, Emerging \nProcessing Technology Applications and the Energy Supply, Hydrogen \nResearch program. The total DOE funding for the ITM Syngas program in \nfiscal year 2000 is $3.9 million.\n  The addition of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2000 will allow \napproximately $600,000 to be allocated to the first phase of this \nproject to fund activities that could not have been anticipated when \nthe program commenced last year. The remaining $800,000 will allow the \nsecond phase of the ITM Syngas to be accelerated, allowing future costs \nto be avoided.\n  This program brings together the Department of Energy, U.S. \nindustry--large and small--our national laboratories and research \nuniversities. Again, I want to thank the Senator from Washington for \nhis efforts to ensure that from the earliest phases of this important \nresearch and development effort, ITM Syngas is a success.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there do not seem to be any amendments to \nthe bill that are ripe for debate and for disposition at this point.\n  Did the Senator from Virginia have any further comments?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for his \noffer. Given the absence of other Senators who I know want to debate \nthis particular issue, I look forward to resuming that debate when the \nSenate returns to session on September 8.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I don't think there is any further \nbusiness in connection with the interior appropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10351-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a moment to \nalert my fellow Senators and others about an important development this \nevening which I think we categorize as another piece of good news, in \naddition to the adoption of the conference report on the tax reform \njust concluded by the Senate.\n  Even though the conference report is in the process of being signed \nand has not yet been filed, I think I can advise my colleagues that \nlater on this evening the House and Senate Armed Services Committees \nwill have concluded their conference report, including the important \nrevisions of the Department of Energy which follow generally along the \nlines of the so-called Rudman report recommendations and the amendment \nthat Senators Murkowski and Domenici and I filed earlier in this \nsession to reorganize the Department of Energy.\n  The House and Senate had both passed versions of that reform of the \nDepartment of Energy. The matter was concluded today in the House-\nSenate conference report of the Armed Services bill, and that is the \nvehicle by which the reorganization of the Department of Energy will \noccur.\n  Just to recapitulate a little bit about how this came about, if you \nwill recall, as a result of the espionage that resulted in the Chinese \nreceiving significant secrets about nuclear weapons of the United \nStates and the possibility that some of that information had come out \nof our National Laboratories, there was a great deal of study of the \nsecurity at our National Labs and in the weapons program generally of \nthe Department.\n  The President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the so-\ncalled PFIAB, headed by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued a report, \nreally a scathing indictment of the Department of Energy, its past \nsecurity policies or lack of security, and its inability to reorganize \nitself notwithstanding Secretary Richardson's efforts to begin to \nreorganize the Department. What it said was the Department of Energy \nwas incapable of reorganizing itself. They reiterated a long list of \nthings which the Department had failed to do, which it had failed to \nput into place, and described the whole situation at the Department as \nsuch that it was impossible to expect them to be able to do this on \ntheir own.\n  Therefore, the Rudman commission recommended strongly the Congress do \nthis reorganization by legislation. That is when Senators Domenici, \nMurkowski and I reoriented our amendment to follow closely the Rudman \ncommission recommendations and introduced that as an amendment before \nthis body.\n  It was originally introduced to the Armed Services bill. It was later \nput on the Intelligence bill instead. But the Armed Services Committee \ntook the amendment and has worked it now in the conference committee, \nas I said. As a result of their agreement tonight, there will be a \nreorganization of the Department, assuming the President signs the \nDefense authorization bill, which I am sure he would want to do.\n  Reorganization was agreed to in principle by Secretary Richardson, \nalthough there were many things he wanted to change in the detail of \nit. But what it will do in a nutshell is to establish within the \nDepartment of Energy a semiautonomous agency that will have the \naccountability and the responsibility for managing our nuclear weapons \nand complex including the National Laboratories. It will be headed by a \nspecific person, an Under Secretary, who will be responsible to the \nSecretary directly and to a Deputy Secretary if the Secretary so \ndesires.\n  While, of course, the Secretary of Energy remains in general control \nof all of his Department, including the semiautonomous agency, on a \nday-to-day basis it is anticipated this agency will be operated by the \nUnder Secretary, who is responsible for its functions. It will involve \nsecurity, intelligence, counterintelligence, all of the different \nweapons, the Navy nuclear program and the other things at the \nlaboratory that relate to our nuclear weapons. To a large extent it \nwill remove the influences of other parts of the Department\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\nof Energy over the nuclear weapons program.\n  One of the things the Rudman commission found was that there were too \nmany people with their fingers in the pie; that the laboratories and \nthe weapons program people were having to get too many sign-offs from \ntoo many other people around the Department to work efficiently and \neffectively. The input of the field offices made it very difficult to \nknow who was responsible, and it was hard to find out in some cases who \nyou even had to get sign-offs from in order to get anything done. They \nsaid, in effect, it was no wonder the left hand didn't know what the \nright hand was doing and that is why they recommended a very clear \nchain of command, a very clear line of authority with accountability \nand responsibility with one person at the top and a bunch of people \nanswerable to him and only him--as well as the Secretary, of course.\n  The net result of that should be we will have a much tighter \norganization run much more efficiently. We will not have the influences \nof these other disparate people within the Department. Security can be \ncarefully monitored and controlled and, in fact, maintained and in some \ncases even established. Therefore, the security of the nuclear weapons \nprogram generally and the laboratory specifically can be enhanced and \nwe will not have the kind of espionage problems we have had in the \npast.\n\n  That is a summary of the problem, the recommendation of the Rudman \nreport, the recommendations Senators Domenici, Murkowski, and I \nintroduced, and the action of the House-Senate Armed Services Committee \ntoday in approving this particular plan.\n  I thank some people specifically involved in developing this. In \naddition, of course, to Senator Domenici, who was the primary mover \nbehind this idea, and Senator Rudman and the members of his panel; \nSenator Murkowski added a great deal as did Senator Shelby, the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Warner, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee in the House.\n  Specifically, I thank Senator Warner for his patience for working \nwith a lot of people who had different ideas about what ought to be \ndone, bringing this to a near successful conclusion, from my point of \nview, and which will enable us to move forward very quickly with this \nreorganization.\n  There are also some special staff people who, as always, make these \nthings happen. In the Senate, the staffs of Senators Domenici and \nMurkowski; Alex Flint, Howard Useem, and John Rood did a great deal of \nwork on this and should be complimented. Two Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, who were very active in making this work, Congressman \nDuncan Hunter and Congressman Mac Thornberry were really the key movers \nand shakers on this.\n  So as we get ready to leave here this evening, I think it is \nimportant for us to acknowledge the work of these people and the \nleadership of Senator Warner and the conclusion which I hope can soon \nbe announced, as the successful completion of the conference, at least \nin this one important area, making a great stride toward ensuring the \nsecurity of our weapons programs and our National Laboratories.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished \ncolleague, together with Senators Domenici and Murkowski and their \nrespective staffs. Indeed, the staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the House Armed Services Committee all collaborated to \ntry to make this a constructive, constitutional, and balanced approach.\n  But if I could ask the Senator a question, so those persons who have \nnot had the opportunity to follow as closely as he the progress of this \nlegislation, does the Senator think the product created by the House-\nSenate conference represents a piece of legislation that is stronger, \nin terms of creating this concept of a separate entity within the DOD, \nthan was the bill passed by the Senate at 93-1?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think it is. I think the Senate passed a \ngood bill almost unanimously. The House of Representatives had a \nsomewhat different approach. I am sure they considered it an even \nstronger bill. As the chairman knows better than any of us, compromise \nis required in that kind of situation. I think each body moved somewhat \ntoward the other. So inevitably I think the product, as good as it was \nout of the Senate, is even strengthened by some of the ideas that came \nout of the House of Representatives.\n  I might ask the chairman a question, if I could.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. One of the things that animated us in the Senate was the \nneed to get on with this project, get the Department reorganized, and \nto begin dealing quickly with these security problems so we did not \nhave any more problems. Reorganization of a Department, obviously, will \ntake a lot of work and some time. Of course, time will be required to \nappoint the various officials who will be running it.\n\n  But I ask the chairman this, just to get his ideas. There are \ndifferent dates by which things are required to be done under the \nlegislation. What is our intent with respect to moving this legislation \nforward and accomplishing its objectives as soon as is possible?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to use an old naval phrase, ``with all \ndeliberate speed.''\n  I know the Senator's concern about the insertion of a date in March \nwith regard to the final achievement by, presumably, the current \nSecretary; if Secretary Richardson will carry this through. Certain \nsections, however, of this legislation are quite clear that he should \nstart the day after the President, hopefully, affixes his signature to \nthis piece of legislation.\n  It is a phasing process. We looked at the date of March, and it \nshould not, in my judgment, be interpreted as any lack of resolve by \nthe Congress. To the contrary, it is a recognition that a major \nreorganization of this proportion will require a period of time within \nwhich to achieve it.\n  The opposite side of the argument of those who say we should not have \nhad that date would be, if you did not put in a recognition that it \nwould take time, then presumably 1 week after the President affixes his \nsignature, we could haul the Secretary of Energy up here and say: You \nhaven't achieved this in 1 week's time, 2 week's time or 30 days' time.\n  We had to strike a balance. I know that has been of great concern to \nmy distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may add, I know the chairman and I share the same view \nthat ``all deliberate speed'' means we need to get about it as soon as \nwe can. I ask the chairman this: Is that more to be considered as a \ndeadline for having achieved this rather than a time to begin? Time to \nbegin, of course, when the President affixes his signature.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, certainly it is to be viewed the time \nwithin which to be completed. Given the certain constructive steps the \ncurrent Secretary, Secretary Richardson, has taken, I presume he will \nhave achieved the reorganization in a time shorter than that. But I \nmust say to my colleague, you cannot satisfy everybody.\n  This is my 21st year on the Armed Services Committee, and as we file \ntonight the signatures of those members of the respective committees, \nHouse and Senate, who have approved the conference report, it is my \nunderstanding that no Democrat member of the Armed Services Committee \nin the Senate will be signatory. That comes as a personal \ndisappointment to me as chairman in my first year.\n  I met with the committee this afternoon. There was representation of \nprobably seven or eight members on the Democrat side. The ranking \nmember let me know beforehand of his concern, and I understood him \nthroughout. We tried as best we could to work with the minority on our \ncommittee on this issue, as we do all issues. It is a matter of deep \nregret that we were not able to reconcile the differences that \napparently were very significant between the Democrat approach to this \nand the Republican majority approach.\n  I will accept the consequences. I am the captain of this ship now, \nand I accept full accountability. I do note, however, that my \nunderstanding is, as of this hour, most, if not all, the Democrat \nMembers of the House have signed, of course, the identical conference \nreport.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may interrupt for one other comment, I thank the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee for\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\nhis courtesies in allowing three Senators who are not members of the \ncommittee--Senators Domenici, Murkowski, and myself--to be \nsignificantly involved in discussing this and proposing suggestions and \npassing on suggestions that came from the other body. That is a good \nexample of how people in different committees--in my case, the \nIntelligence Committee--working across jurisdictional lines can help \nshape the legislation. I personally appreciate that very much.\n  I will add this with respect to our friends on the other side of the \naisle. I do not know if I can assign a percentage to it, but it still \nseems to me that about 90 percent of this bill is the Senate bill we \npassed. I do not know of a single concept that deviates from the \nconcepts within the Senate bill, even though some of the language is \ndifferent.\n\n  I think we protected the Senate legislative concepts very well, and I \nhope that in the end our Democratic colleagues will continue to work \nwith us and certainly with Secretary Richardson to implement the \nlegislation.\n  I know as we go forward there are going to be hearings in different \ncommittees. The chairman's committee will have primary jurisdiction, I \nunderstand, and we will be able to continue to work on this because \nsomething as significant as the reorganization of the Department is not \ngoing to be done in one fell swoop. It will have a lot of fits and \nstarts and oversight and ways of working together. I am sure with the \nchairman's leadership we will all be able to make this work in the way \nwe intend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, one last observation, if the Senator will \nremain for a moment, and that is, I think we should acknowledge in this \nRecord tonight the work of the Intelligence Committee, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, the Energy Committee, and the Armed Services \nCommittee. There were four committees that worked diligently.\n  Our distinguished majority leader would have periodic meetings of the \nchairmen, and others such as yourself, who had an interest. Senator \nDomenici attended all of those meetings. On this side of the aisle, \nfrom our top leadership down through the committee chairmen and others, \nwe worked together as a team to address this national, if not \ninternational, crisis of the leakage of information from these \nmagnificent laboratories. Our national security is absolutely dependent \non their work product and the security of that work product today and \ntomorrow and for the indefinite future.\n  I thank all chairmen. They had a number of hearings. My estimate is \nthat we in the Senate, among the four committees, must have had 25 \nhearings on this subject.\n  Mr. KYL. May I add one more thing? I know it sounds like a \nrecapitulation, but when the Senator mentioned Senator Domenici and the \nfine work our National Laboratories do, I was moved to think about how \nmany times during these negotiations Senator Domenici, who represents \ntwo of those laboratories, Sandia and Los Alamos, made absolutely sure \nthat the work of those laboratories was well understood by everyone and \nappreciated by everyone. He was very zealous in assuring that nothing \nin the legislation would ever detract from their operation or their \nsuccess, that they could reach out and engage in new missions, that \nthey would be protected in terms of environmental protection and \nfunding.\n  He was a zealous advocate for those laboratories and all the great \nwork they can do. His leadership in that regard is one of the reasons \nwe were able to achieve such a balanced piece of legislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I also observe, \nyes, but he was very objective about the seriousness of this problem. \nThroughout his deliberations, whether in Senator Lott's office or the \nhearings or in our consultations together, he was always very \nobjective, and he put national interests first at every step. So the \nSenator is correct.\n  I conclude with one sentence to my friend. I do not think if we \nrecalled William Shakespeare from the grave that this provision on \nreorganization could have been written on the Department of Energy to \nsatisfy everyone. That is the reason I have such deep regret about my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. Many times we consulted them \nright down to the word and the comma and the like. We just did the very \nbest we could, and I am proud of the work our committee did. I pay \ntribute to the respective staffs and my colleagues who worked on it.\n  We are fully accountable for the effectiveness, and we, as a \ncommittee, perhaps with other committees, will hold a hearing very \nearly next fall to determine the progress, assuming this is signed, \nwithin a period of, say, 2 months after the President's signature is \naffixed.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a few more comments regarding the \nconference of the House and the Senate. Quite apart from the DOE \nprovision, we are very pleased that we made major strides in this \nlegislation on behalf of the men and women of the U.S. military.\n  We have an authorized funding level of $288.8 billion, which is $8.3 \nbillion above the President's budget request. And that is in real \nterms. This is the first time in 13 years that there has been a real--I \nrepeat--real increase in the defense budget.\n  Our distinguished Presiding Officer is a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. He actively participated in structuring this piece \nof legislation. We have approved a 4.8-percent pay raise for military \npersonnel, reform of the military pay tables, and annual military pay \nraises 0.5 percent above the annual increases in the Employment Cost \nIndex.\n  We provide military members with a wider choice on their retirement \nsystem. We allowed both Active and Reserve component military personnel \nto participate in thrift savings. There is nothing more important. \nIndeed, the tax legislation just passed --always, certainly, on this \nside of the aisle we are trying to seek ways to increase savings in our \nUnited States. I am pleased now we give wider opportunity to the men \nand women of the Armed Forces.\n  Strategic forces: We authorize a net increase of $400 million for \nballistic missile defense, a program that finally has achieved \nrecognition under our distinguished colleague, Senator Cochran of \nMississippi, in passing here a week ago, the important legislation, \nwhich the President has now signed, to take another step forward in \nprotecting America against the likelihood that possibly some accidental \nfiring or limited attack could be launched against this country. We \nhave a long way to go, but through the leadership of Senator Cochran, \nand others, we have finally forged, I think, another, should we say, 10 \nyards on this lengthy ball field.\n  We authorize an increase of $212 million for the Patriot PAC-3 \nsystem, again missile defense.\n  Seapower authorized a $1 billion increase to the procurement budget \nrequest of $18 billion and a $251 million increase to the research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation budget request of $3.9 billion for \nthe Seapower Subcommittee under the chairmanship of Senator Snowe.\n  Very able work was done on behalf of Senator Snowe and the ranking \nmember, Senator Kennedy, for the Navy and the Marine Corps and a \nlimited number of Air Force programs under their jurisdiction.\n  We extended the multiyear procurement authority for the DDG-51 \nprocurement and authorized advance procurement and advance construction \nfor the LHD-8. We authorize construction of three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke \nclass destroyers, two LPD-17 San Antonio class amphibious ships, and \none ADC(X), the first of a class of auxiliary refrigeration and \nammunition supply ships.\n  We authorize advance procurement for 2 SSN-774 Virginia class attack \nsubmarines, and $750 million for the CVN-77, the last of the Nimitz \nclass aircraft carriers currently in planning. We will, however, go on \nwith another class of carriers, and that is the subject of research and \ndevelopment.\n  In the readiness, we increase funding for military readiness by $1.5 \nbillion. It provides for the protection of the military's access to \nessential frequency spectrum. That was a highly contested issue in our \nlegislation. The private sector had concerns that the Pentagon would \nabsorb a proportion of the spectrum beyond its needs. But in \nconsultation with Congressman Bliley, the\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\nchairman of the House committee with jurisdiction, Senator McCain, a \ndistinguished member of our committee, as well as chairman here of the \nCommerce Committee, we reached this compromise, which I hope all will \nfind satisfactory.\n\n  In the Airland area, we had an additional $1.5 billion for critical \nprocurement requirements and an additional $400 million for research \nand development activities above the President's request. We fully \nauthorized the development and procurement budget request for the F-22 \nRaptor.\n  It is with some regret that the House did not adequately fund that \nprogram, in my judgment. That is a subject that is actively before the \ntwo Appropriations Committees. But both the House and the Senate \nauthorizing committees fully funded that program.\n  Lastly, upon assuming the chairmanship of this committee from my \ndistinguished predecessor, Senator Thurmond, I decided to establish a \nnew subcommittee entitled ``Emerging Threats.'' That committee, under \nthe great leadership of Senator Roberts, moved out, and here are some \nof the initiatives taken by that subcommittee.\n  We authorize and fully fund 17 new National Guard Rapid Assessment \nand Initial Detection--commonly known as RAID--Teams to respond to \nterrorist attacks in the United States--12 more than the administration \nrequest.\n  It was my judgment, and Senator Roberts' and the members of the \ncommittee, that this is the greatest threat poised at the United States \ntoday--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, whether they \nbe biological, chemical, or possibly the incorporation of some crude \nweapon involving fissionable material. We have to move out on that. \nProgress was made by this new subcommittee.\n  Further, we required the department to establish specific budget \nreporting procedures for its Combating Terrorism Program. This will \ngive the program the focus and visibility it deserves while providing \nCongress with the information it requires to conduct thorough oversight \nof the department's efforts to combat the threat of terrorist attack \nboth inside and outside the United States.\n  We authorize $475 million for the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram to accelerate the disarmament of the former Soviet Union--now \nRussia--strategic offensive arms that always threaten the United \nStates. That was commonly referred to as the Nunn-Lugar program for a \nnumber of years.\n  We establish an Information Assurance Initiative to strengthen DOD's \ninformation assurance program and provide for an additional $150 \nmillion to the administration's request for information assurances \nprograms, projects, and activities.\n  In cyberspace today, with the rapid research and development--indeed, \nachievement--of many technical initiatives, the whole area of \ncyberspace is threatened by an ever-growing number of sources of \ninvasion and compromise, and indeed, disabling of the systems \nthemselves.\n  I thank my colleagues for indulging me to speak to this important \npiece of legislation which will be filed tonight in the House and, of \ncourse, automatically in the Senate.\n  I shall now inquire of our staff as to the desire of other Members to \nspeak, as well as the wrap up for the evening.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the Chair.)\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note the Senator from Kansas would \nlike to be recognized, but I ask if I could just make a few comments \nabout the remarks that Senator Warner has just made.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have been honored to join the Armed Services \nCommittee this year. Senator Warner just took over as its new chairman. \nSome said we did not do anything the first part of the year, but even \nbefore the impeachment hearings came, Senator Warner knew that we had a \ncrisis in our defense circumstances.\n  He has served as Secretary of the Navy. He loves this country, and he \nloves our men and women in uniform. He decided early that we had to \nsend a signal to reverse this 13-year trend of cutting our defense \nbudgets, and he did that with great leadership.\n  We have now a very healthy pay raise this year for our men and women, \na guaranteed pay raise in excess of the inflation rate for the next 5 \nyears for our men and women in the services.\n  We want to send them a message that we are concerned about the rapid \ndeployments that they are undergoing and the amount of time they spend \naway from their families. And we want to continue to monitor that.\n  I want to say how much I have enjoyed serving with the Senator. \nMembers of both parties respect him and enjoy working with him.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator very much for his kind comments. But \nthe Senator has brought to mind the fact that our majority leader, \nSenator Lott, made a decision to support our committee in putting \nthrough S. 4, I think the earliest bill in the Senate, which brought \nabout the pay raises and retirement adjustments, which, hopefully, will \nincrease our readiness by encouraging more young men and women to join \nthe Armed Forces--our recruiting having fallen off--and retaining the \nskilled personnel that we now have.\n  Also, it was the Joint Chiefs of Staff that on two occasions came \nbefore our committee--in September of last year and again in January of \nthis year--and unequivocally stated, in their best professional \njudgment, the need for additional dollars, and how best those funds \ncould be expended by the Congress, and putting particular emphasis on \nthe pay and allowances, which is always the top priority of the Chiefs \nfor their men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to say how much I respect our chairman. I \nbelieve this bill, this appropriations report, represents a commitment \nby our Nation to reverse the trend of decline. The chairman has \nsupported the President when he is right. He has been prepared to \noppose him when he is wrong. As to those who disagree with our firm \ncommitment, that I know the Senator in the chair supports, to reform \nour nuclear labs and to bring an end to this absolute disaster of \nsecurity that we have had, I am disappointed that they have not yet \ngotten the message that serious fundamental reform is needed. They say \nthose words, but when we come down with a good bill that does it, they \ndraw back and again have excuses. I hope we can work this out and the \nbill will pass.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have just \nbeen informed, much to my great pleasure, that two members of the \nminority, two Democrats on the Armed Services Committee, have now \ndecided to sign our conference report, and there is a likelihood of one \nor more additional ones. I depart the floor far more heartened than \nwhen I entered about 40 minutes ago.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman. I also appreciate his leadership \nand those who are signing this report. I think it is a good one.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I stated my support for my \ndistinguished colleague from Virginia who chairs the Armed Services \nCommittee. He did a wonderful job with that. This is such an important \ntopic, even though we tend to think of the world as a stable place \nwhere we don't have to worry about it. I am glad he is worried about it \nand is so focused on it.\n  That is what I would like to draw the body's attention to right now, \na situation that was reported this week in the reporting organizations \nof Reuters, the Associated Press, and the New York Times. This is a \nvery troubling situation. It is in a part of the world that has \nexperienced a great deal of trouble, but nonetheless, I want to point \nit out to this body.\n  On July 23, 22 bombs were reported dropped on two villages in Sudan--\nLainya and Kaaya--resulting in internal hemorrhaging, miscarriages, \nanimals dying among the villages. Several days later, after the bombs \nhad fallen on this one village, United Nations relief workers with \nWorld Food Programme visited the town of Lainya and\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\nimmediately fell ill with strange symptoms. They were consequently \nevacuated to Kampala, Uganda, for testing even as they continued to \nphysically suffer.\n  This, in turn, precipitated the beginning of a United Nations \ninvestigation into the use of chemical weapons, as reported this week \nby those three news organizations, chemical weapons that the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee was just noting, that the biggest \nthreat we are facing in the future is weapons of mass destruction. We \nare seeing here this week, reported in the newspaper, what has taken \nplace in the Sudan, the symptoms of chemical weapons being reported.\n\n  We can't at this time jump to conclusions that they were actually \nused, but the evidence points clearly to the use of chemical weapons by \nthe organization, by the government in Khartoum against its own \ncivilian population in the southern part of that country.\n  This is also a government in Khartoum that is sponsoring terrorists \naround the world, where Osama bin Laden stayed and was hosted by them \nup until 1997 in Khartoum. They are trying to expand in three adjacent \ncountries, saying we want to take our view of how the world should be \norganized into these countries and we are willing to do it by any \nmeans. We are even willing to use any means against our own people, \nagainst our own people.\n  They have killed in their own country 2 million people. They have \npushed out and dislocated an additional 4 million people. Last year \nalone, they forced into starvation 100,000 people by denying our food \naid to go where these people were located. They said: You cannot fly \nyour relief planes to feed these poor people. Now they continue to bomb \ntheir civilian population, even with, if the evidence this week is \nproved true, chemical weapons.\n  I think this is so horrifying. I wanted to draw the attention of the \nSenate to what has been reported by these three news organizations this \nweek and to call on the nation of Sudan to stop bombing its own \ncivilian population, to refuse to do that, to call upon the U.N. to, \nwith as much speed and haste as possible, conduct a full investigation \nof what has been reported this week as having happened to the civilian \npopulation, and call on U.S. authorities to investigate this as fully \nas we can to see what actually took place. If true, this is truly \nhorrifying, that weapons of mass destruction such as these chemical \nweapons would be used against their own civilian population. I think it \nis just absolutely unconscionable, virtually unbelievable.\n  This is also a government that continues to allow slavery to be \nconducted on in its country. There have actually been thousands of \npeople purchased back from their slave masters. As we approach the new \nmillennium, one would think that at least the institution of slavery \nwould be gone from the world. It is not. One would think the use of \nchemical weapons would be gone from the world today, but it is not.\n  These things must be investigated to the fullest extent, and if \nchemical weapons were, indeed, used, the Government of Sudan must be \nbrought in front of the international bodies, the international court \nof shame, and put in that pariah nation category. They currently, of \ncourse, are one of the seven terrorist nations in the entire world that \nthe U.S. Government lists as a terrorist nation. But the possible use \nof chemical weapons, as reported this week, takes this to an \nunbelievable level against its own population. That is why, even though \nthis is a late hour, I draw this to the attention of this body.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10355-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10355-S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO CARL BIERSACK, LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SENATE MAJORITY \n                                 LEADER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and bid \nfarewell to my loyal and trusted advisor, Carl Biersack. Carl is \nleaving my staff to enter into retirement after 27 years of Federal \nservice, including more than 9 years of outstanding service on my \nstaff.\n  It is difficult to pay adequate tribute to a man who has done so much \nfor me, for my staff, and for the State of Mississippi and the Nation. \nThose of you who know Carl know that he gives 110 percent of himself \nevery day, inspiring those around him to do the same.\n  He is the son of a career U.S. Army officer, Carl graduated from the \nVirginia Military Institute in 1971. He received his commission as a \nsecond lieutenant and served on active duty for over 7 years. So how \ndid I get so lucky, you ask, to add this VMI alumnus to my staff? Yes, \nVMI is where Sigma Nu was founded, but no, this is not the reason!\n  Mr. President, in 1988, the U.S. Army made Carl the recipient of the \nprestigious Pace Award. This award, which was named after a former \nSecretary of the Army, is given out annually to one civilian and one \nmember of the military who have demonstrated outstanding service on the \nArmy staff to their nation.\n  As if receiving the coveted Pace Award was not tribute enough, the \naward included an opportunity to study at Harvard for a year. Because \nof family considerations, Carl decided to forgo a move to Boston and \ninstead asked to spend a year as a Capitol Hill fellow. He thought he \nwould learn more useful skills here than at Harvard. He was right. The \nArmy agreed, and he was hired as a fellow in my personal office by my \nthen-Chief of Staff, John Lundy; former Legislative Director Sam \nAdcock; and Susan Butler, now Chief of Staff for Congressman Chip \nPickering.\n  That's right, Mr. President--I was Carl's second choice. Carl is \nquick to say he is an accidental staffer. Someone who did not aspire to \nwork on the Hill. I believe this was one of his strengths.\n  He brought the honor and integrity he learned at VMI, the discipline \nand dedication of his Army service, and the work ethic of a DOD civil \nservant to my office.\n  After his first year, I asked Carl to stay as a permanent member of \nmy staff. Fortunately for me and Mississippi, he did. Now, looking back \nat his nine years worth of accomplishments, I am amazed. In fact, I had \ngrown so accustomed to his daily presence, when asked, I said Carl \nworked for me for 13 years. Even people downtown think his tenure was \nabout 15 years. His presence and contributions cast a long shadow.\n  Carl has covered a broad range of issues during his tenure on the \nHill ranging from telecommunications to energy, from environment to \nfish, from oceans and roads to bridges and aviation. While Carl has \nnever sought the limelight, many of my colleagues recognize his vital \nrole in enacting important legislation. He was a fearless negotiator \nwho frequently found consensus through incremental changes. Often his \nwork was ratified by unanimous consent actions.\n  During Carl's tenure, he successfully shepherded roughly 25 public \nlaws through the legislative process: Many of these laws moved key \nindustries to competition, such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \nand the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. Some reformed the way the \nGovernment regulates and supports certain industries, such as the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995, the Maritime Security Act of 1996, and the \nAmtrak Reform Act of 1997.\n  Some will shape our Nation's high-tech economy, such as the Y2K Act \nand the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Others, such as the National Invasive \nSpecies Act of 1996, and the Accountable Pipeline Safety and \nPartnership Act of 1996, protect life, property, and the environment \nfrom harm.\n  Then there were bills, like TEA-21, which were vital to maintaining \nand improving our Nation's infrastructure. And let me not forget Carl's \nrole in facilitating Congress' basic responsibility: authorizing and \nappropriating funds for Executive departments and agencies.\n  Carl was able to accomplish so much as a Senate staff member because \nof his willingness to work out inclusive solutions to problems. His \nsuccess can also be attributed to his efforts to remain\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nan anonymous staffer who avoided the spotlight. He concentrated on \nresults, not personal credit.\n  Staff on both sides of the aisle were comfortable working with him. \nHe admitted his errors, said he didn't know when he was unsure, and was \ngenerous with his praise for others. He read the material provided by \nconstituents and advocates, returned phone calls, and was accessible. \nHe was the consummate staffer.\n  Both Senators and staff knew Carl would deal with their concerns \nfairly, honestly, and professionally. A deal was a deal. His word was \nrespected. This was true both on the Hill and downtown.\n  Carl was determined to learn all there was to know about Mississippi. \nHe made trips back to the state to visit our catfish farms, pulp and \npaper plants, national forests and universities. He saw small towns, \ncourthouse squares, topnotch telecommunications headquarters and \nmilitary bases. Carl knew that learning about the lives of \nMississippians was important to effectively represent the state and its \ncitizens.\n  Although Carl is from Virginia--often referring to himself as my \ntoken non-Mississippian--he was an ardent defender of Mississippi's \ninterests and people. Mississippians have grown to trust and respect \nCarl's devotion to ensuring that Mississippi's issues and concerns were \nrecognized and often included. His adamant support of my home state's \ninterests has not gone unnoticed by its citizens. Carl was named an \nhonorary citizen of Mississippi and he proudly displayed the \ncertificate.\n  For years, Carl willingly and voluntarily assumed the role of mentor \nto new staff members who needed help navigating the complex legislative \nworld. As Legislative Director, he challenged staff to achieve their \nfullest potential, take risks and learn from their mistakes. There is \nno doubt that his influence spurred the professional growth made by \nyoung, eager staffers, resulting in talented and enthusiastic team \nplayers. Carl was always willing to share the lessons he learned the \nhard way.\n  There is no overstating how Carl's selflessness has enhanced the \nprofessional and personal lives of the generations of staffers who were \nprivileged enough to work with Carl. He lived by the motto on his VMI \nclass ring--``honor above self.''\n  I know that I am losing a brilliant and effective legislative \ndirector, but others tell me that I am losing the man who is teacher, \nparent and sometimes counselor to those around him. I am quite sure \nthat the rest of my staff will miss him as much as I will.\n  Carl's memos and notes were always timely, informative, and accurate. \nThey were frequently entertaining, and sometimes caustic, but his daily \npaper trail ensured I had the necessary information to deal with the \nissues and events surrounding legislation. He was not afraid to tell \nbad news, but he always proposed solutions.\n  Carl was the king of metaphors. He used them to make a point, to \nnegotiate, and to educate. Still, he was eager to dig into issues and \nlegislation. His knowledge of bills was his credibility. I do not think \nI ever saw him without reading material.\n  Mr. President, it saddens me to see a man of Carl's caliber depart my \nstaff. He certainly leaves big shoes to fill. For Carl's talent, loyal \nservice and dedication to me and the state of Mississippi, I am very \ngrateful.\n  He is a man who was defined by his family. He always had his \npriorities straight and he never forgot his family as he fulfilled his \ncommitments to the Senate and Mississippi. His wife, Ann, and his \ndaughters, Katie, Sarah, Olivia, Allyson, and Rebecca, have reason to \nbe proud. I wish Carl Biersack good luck in all of his future endeavors \nand pray that God may continue to richly bless him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10356-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREINSTATEMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA STATE COLLEGE'S ORIGINAL 1980 LAND-GRANT \n                                 STATUS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, West Virginia State College in Institute, \nWest Virginia, was designated by Congress as one of the original 1890 \nland-grant schools under the Second Morrill Act. The college was the \nfirst 1890 land-grant school to be accredited and has been accredited \nlonger than any other public college or university in West Virginia.\n  West Virginia was one of six states to establish a new land-grant \ncollege under state control. West Virginia State College faithfully met \nits duties to the citizens of West Virginia as a land-grant college in \nan outstanding manner.\n  However, on October 23, 1956, the State Board of Education voted to \nsurrender the land-grant status of State College (effective July 1, \n1957). Historical data suggests that this action was taken in an effort \nto enhance State College's ability to accommodate veterans returning \nhome with GI benefits. In addition, the decision to surrender the land-\ngrant status preceded explicit funding by Congress for land-grant \ninstitutions.\n  For thirty-three years, West Virginia State College has sought to \nregain its land-grant status. On February 12, 1991, Governor Gaston \nCaperton signed a bill into law that provided redesignation authority \nfor land-grant status from the State of West Virginia. On March 28, \n1994, then U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy informed \nWest Virginia Governor Caperton that State College would receive a \npartial land-grant designation that would entitle the college to \n$50,000 annually under the Second Morrill Act.\n  It has become clear that funding is the issue that must be addressed \nto reinstate West Virginia State College's land-grant status. I \nauthored an amendment to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill \nthat will provide $2 million in additional funds for 1890 Institution \nentitlements to be used for base line funding for West Virginia State \nCollege. This amendment does not grant full 1890 land-grant funding \nprivileges to State College, but provides a $2 million entitlement. The \namendment does not cut into the current 1890 entitlement accounts. It \nadds additional funding with an offset from the National Research \nInitiative account.\n  My amendment provides fair treatment to West Virginia State College, \nan original 1890 land-grant school, and I thank my colleagues for \nsupporting this provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10356-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10356-S10357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMUNITY AND OPEN SPACES BONDS ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe community and Open Spaces Bonds Act (COSB). This bill provides \nassistance to our local communities in their continuous efforts to \nimprove the quality of life through flexible, zero-cost financing \noptions for protecting open spaces.\n  As the acreage of open space in this country continues to decline, we \nfind ourselves in a battle of time against widespread urban sprawl. The \nAmerican citizens have spoken out, demanding that this body take the \naction necessary to protect the remaining open spaces and outdoor \nrecreational opportunities that they have enjoyed since the founding of \nthis great nation. The America Farmland Trust estimates that we have \nbeen losing farmland at approximately 3,000 acres per day since 1970. \nThis growth is not only damaging to the agricultural industry, but all \nthose who wish to enjoy this nations natural bounties.\n  I believe it is our obligation to respond to and remedy this \nsituation. For this reason, I would like to thank my colleague Senator \nBaucus for taking the initiative in proposing legislation that provides \nincentives to those private land owning citizens who wish to protect \nour valuable open spaces. Our proposal makes available up to $1.9 \nbillion annually for five years in bonding authority to state, local, \nand tribal governments. This voluntary approach allows the local \ncommunity to lead the charge in projects that will improve the quality \nof life of its citizens, while the Federal government simply plays a \nsupporting role. I think that is the way to do it.\n  These community based projects will be supported through proceeds \nfrom the sales of the bonds. The issuers would repay the principal at \nthe end of 15 years, but the Federal government would pay the issuers' \ninterest or borrowing costs through the tax credit during that period. \nAs an incentive, the holder of the bond would get an annual tax credit \nequal to the corporate average AA bond rating, as posted by the \nTreasury, multiplied by the face amount of the bond.\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n  This bill will spur even greater innovation than we already see at \nthe local level in dealing with growth and urban sprawl issues. The \nflexibility of this proposal creates many opportunities in an often \nlimiting system to raise funding for land purchases. We simply want to \ngive communities a system that is entirely local driven, unlike that \ncurrently offered by the Federal government. The most dynamic aspect of \nthis bill is that it restores to local governments the power to \ninfluence the future of their communities.\n  The Community Open Space Bonds Act can help respond to the need to \nprotecting our beautiful lands and precious water supply, and I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to join in this fight against the raging \nwar of time. Action must be taken now, so that our children will enjoy \nthe natural wonders we have come to love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10357-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHOLD UP OF FINAL PASSAGE OF THE MISSING, EXPLOITED AND RUNAWAY CHILDREN \n                             PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I stand here today, we are hours away \nfrom beginning a month long recess and we have yet to reauthorize a \ncritically important piece of legislation that protects our nation's \nyouth. It has been over two months since both the House and Senate have \npassed S. 249, The Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection \nAct, and we have still not voted on final passage.\n  There is no good excuse for why the Senate has not passed and sent to \nthe President this noncontroversial piece of legislation. I had some \nminor concerns with the House amended version of S. 249, but after \nreceiving some clarification and assurances on these concerns, I \ndecided that these House add-on could be dealt with at later time and \nshould not keep this important piece of legislation from passing. I \nhave cleared the differences on our side of the aisle, but I am afraid \nI cannot say the same for my colleagues on the other side who continue \nto hold up final passage of this bill.\n  The Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 \nreauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and \nauthorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren. Both programs are critical to out nation's youth and to our \nnation's well-being.\n  In addition to providing shelter for children in need, the Runaway \nand Homeless Youth Act ensures that these children and their families \nhave access to important services, such as individual, family or group \ncounseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources \nto help these young people and their families get back on track. As the \nNational Network for Youth as stressed, the Act's programs ``provide \ncritical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the \ncountry.''\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provide \nextremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families \nfacing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the \nNational Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 \nmissing children. The National Center serves a critical role as a \nclearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and \nlaw enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and \nrestaurants which provides free services to parents in search of their \nchildren and have also developed extensive training programs.\n  S. 249 should be passed today. There is absolutely no reason to stall \non this legislation, but as we get down to the wire to begin August \nrecess, it looks like we will once again face another delay. We will \nreturn to our states and to our constituents who run these crucial \nprograms and we will be unable to tell them that we have protected the \nprograms that allow them to ensure children and families access to \ntheir services by reauthorizing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. I \nam frustrated once again at the inaction of the Republican majority on \nthis matter and believe that The Missing Exploited, and Runaway \nChildren Protection Act should be passed immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10357-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10357-S10358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INCREASING SATELLITE AND CABLE COMPETITION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 3 years ago, I started raising \nserious concerns about the need to increase competition between cable \nand satellite TV providers and the need to allow satellite dish owners \nto receive local network stations. I felt then, and I feel now, that \nthe best way to reduce the cable and satellite rate increases and to \nprotect satellite dish owners is to have satellite television compete \non a level playing field with cable.\n  I was thus very pleased when, finally, on May 20, the Senate passed a \nbill that I sponsored, without objection, which protects satellite dish \nowners and would offer them more television stations. I worked on this \nbill with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and \nseveral other Senators.\n  The bill would restore satellite TV service to those who lost it, and \nit would prevent thousands of additional cutoffs.\n  Also, over time, it would permit satellite carriers to offer many \nmore stations to home satellite dish owners. Unfortunately, even though \nthe Senate passed the bill on May 20, we have been unable to set up a \nConference with the other chamber. On June 8, the Senate approved the \nlist of Senators--the Conferees--to negotiate the final bill with the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The August recess is about to start. Thousands of Vermonters, and I \nam one of them, will continue to get minimal TV service because this \nbill was not able to be presented to the President for signature. I \nwant to assure Vermonters that I will continue to work to get this bill \nbefore the President.\n  I also have been meeting with satellite company officials \nrepresenting companies that will be able to offer a whole range of \nlocal stations, movie channels, sports, weather, history, PBS, \nsuperstations, and the like, to Vermonters via satellite. I want to \nmake sure that Vermonters will be offered the full range of TV service \nover satellite once we can negotiate the final bill.\n  I am in the same situation as many Vermonters. At my home in \nMiddlesex, Vermont, I only receive one local network channel clearly \nwith my rooftop antenna.\n  I was very worried three years ago that satellite dish owners would \nstart losing their ability to receive distant network signals. \nUnfortunately, my fears have come to pass. Many other Members of \nCongress have also been concerned about this issue.\n  The Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act, S. 247, which I sponsored \nwith the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, the \nChairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, the ranking member \nof our antitrust subcommittee, Senator Kohl, and the Majority Leader of \nthe Senate, Senator Lott, offered the way to promote head-to-head \ncompetition between cable and satellite providers--and lower rates and \nprovide more services for consumers.\n  In November of 1997, we held a full Committee hearing on satellite \nissues. I agreed with Chairman Hatch to work together on a bill to try \nto avoid needless cutoffs of satellite TV service while, at the same \ntime, working to protect the local affiliate broadcast system and \nincrease competition.\n  In March of last year we introduced a bill but were unable to get it \nto the President for signature. That version was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998. That bill, as with \nthe bill I am trying to get to the President's desk this year, was also \ndesigned to permit local TV signals, as opposed to distant out-of-state \nnetwork signals, to be offered to viewers via satellite; to increase \ncompetition between cable and satellite TV providers; to provide more \nPBS programming by also offering a national feed as well as local \nprogramming; and to reduce rates charged to consumers.\n  In the midst of all these legislative efforts, a federal district \ncourt judge in Florida found that PrimeTime 24 was offering distant CBS \nand Fox television signals to more than one million households in the \nU.S. in a manner inconsistent with its compulsory license that allows \nthem to offer distant network signals. This development further \ncomplicated the situation.\n  Under a preliminary injunction, the satellite service of CBS and Fox \nnetworks was to be terminated on October\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\n8, 1998 for thousands of households in Vermont and other states who had \nsigned up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed.\n  I was pleased that we worked together in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to avoid these immediate cutoffs of satellite TV service in \nVermont and other states. The parties agreed to request an extension \nwhich was granted until February 28, 1999. This extension was also \ndesigned to give the FCC time to address this problem faced by \nsatellite dish owners.\n  In December, I sent a comment to the FCC and criticized their \nproposals on how to define the ``white area''--the area not included in \neither the Grade A or Grade B signal intensity areas. My view was that \nthe FCC proposal would cut off households from receiving distant \nsignals based on ``unwarranted assumptions'' in a manner inconsistent \nwith the law and the clear intent of the Congress. I complained about \nentire towns in Vermont which were to be inappropriately cut off when \nno one could receive signals over the air.\n  The Florida district court filed a final order which also required \nthat households signed up for satellite service before March 11, 1997, \nbe subject to termination of CBS and Fox distant signals on April 30, \n1999, if they lived in areas where they are likely to receive a grade B \nintensity signal and are unable to get the local CBS or Fox affiliate \nto consent to receipt of the distant signal.\n  In the meantime, further Court and other developments have resulted \nin cutoffs of thousands of satellite dish owners. This situation is \nunacceptable, and I will continue to work to fix this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10358-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  END THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the news out of Kosovo concerning the \ncommission of atrocities against Serbs and Gypsies is deeply troubling.\n  According to a report released on Tuesday by Human Rights Watch ``for \nthe province's minorities, and especially the Serb and Roma (Gypsy) \npopulations, as well as some ethnic populations perceived as \ncollaborators or as political opponents of the Kosovo Liberation Army \n(KLA), these changes have brought fear, uncertainty, and in some cases \nviolence.'' The report adds that ``The intent behind many of the \nkillings and abductions that have occurred in the province since early \nJune appears to be the expulsion of Kosovo's Serb and Roma population \nrather than a desire for revenge alone.''\n  Mr. President, the massive atrocities committed against the ethnic \nAlbanian population of Kosovo pursuant to Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic \ncleansing policy have been appropriately condemned by the international \ncommunity. The United States and our NATO allies have invested a great \ndeal of resources and put their sons and daughters at risk to stop the \natrocities and to reverse the ethnic cleansing. But they did not do so \nto allow the former victims to commit atrocities against or seek to \nethnically cleanse the Serbs and Gypsies.\n  When I visited Kosovo in the first week of July along with Senators \nReed, Landrieu and Sessions, we met with Hashim Thaci, political leader \nof the KLA and Colonel Agim Ceku, the KLA military commander. We \ncondemned the violence being perpetrated against the Serbs and asked \nthem to speak out against the mistreatment of the Serbs. They stated to \nus they have publicly called for the Serbs to stay and for those who \nhave left to return provided they had not previously committed \natrocities.\n  Mr. President, words are important but deeds are more important. I \nrealize that the KLA is not a highly-disciplined organization and that \nthere are extremists within the KLA who do not answer to either Mr. \nThaci or Colonel Ceku. I also realize that not all those who are \npresently committing atrocities are members of the KLA. But Mr. Thaci \nand Colonel Ceku and other Albanian leaders must do more to bring an \nend to the cycle of violence in Kosovo.\n  According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 164,000 \nSerbs have left Kosovo during the seven weeks since Yugoslav and Serb \nforces withdrew and KFOR entered Kosovo, and the number continues to \nrise. The military troops of the NATO-led KFOR are not trained to be \npolicemen and the enforcement of day-to-day law and order is not and \nshould not be their mission. The United Nations has only deployed about \n400 civilian police to Kosovo. The deployment of the international \ncivilian police force to Kosovo must be accelerated. The cycle of \nviolence in Kosovo must stop.\n  I visited with the ethnic Albanian refugees in the camps in Macedonia \nand was sickened at their horrific stories of their mistreatment at the \nhands of the Serbs. I was a strong supporter of the NATO air campaign \nagainst Serbia and of the deployment of the NATO-led KFOR. I support \nthe reconstruction of Kosovo and the creation of an autonomous multi-\nethnic Kosovo. But none of us, no matter what position we took on other \nissues involved in NATO's action in Kosovo, can accept criminal acts \nagainst Serbs and Gypsies in Kosovo.\n  President Clinton and the leaders of our NATO allies won the support \nof their citizens for the NATO air campaign and subsequent peacekeeping \nmission in part because it was the humane thing to do. Americans and \nEuropeans alike were deeply upset at the plight of the ethnic Albanian \nrefugees. That support will dissipate if the cycle of violence in \nKosovo does not stop.\n  I call on NATO, the United Nations, the leaders of the ethnic \nAlbanian community in Kosovo, particularly Mr. Thaci and Colonel Ceku, \nand the law abiding citizens of Kosovo, to act and act now to show \ntheir rejection of lawlessness and violence. The cycle of violence must \nstop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10358-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PESTICIDES AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week, the Environmental Protection \nAgency announced the first major steps under the Food Quality \nProtection Act of 1996 to protect children from overexposure to two \nwidely used pesticides. Organophosphate chemicals, such as these two \npesticides, kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, \nthese chemicals have the same effect on humans, and children are \nespecially vulnerable because of their developing bodies and the high \nproportion of fruits and vegetables in their diets. Effective \nprotection against these two pesticides is an important step in \nimplementing the Act as Congress intended.\n  These steps by EPA to comply with the law are critical to ensure the \nhealth and safety of the nation's children. These actions are welcome, \nand EPA must continue to carry out its important mission to assess \ntolerance levels for pesticides that pose the highest risks to \nchildren. Much work remains to be done.\n  Timely and complete implementation of the Act is essential, but we \nneed to know more to assure that all children are protected from the \nharmful effects of pesticides. I have asked the General Accounting \nOffice to evaluate the technologies used to assess immune, \nreproductive, endocrine, and neurotoxic effects of pesticides on \nchildren. GAO will also report on current research on links between \npesticides and child health and disease. In particular, I have asked \nthe GAO to evaluate whether the Act is being implemented adequately to \nprotect the health and safety of the nation's children.\n  Our children are our greatest natural resource. The goal in passing \nthe Act was to set a strong public health standard to protect them, and \nEPA has a clear responsibility to implement the Act in accord with that \nstandard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10358-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10358-S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LET'S SEEK BALANCE IN REFUGEE FUNDING\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' \nattention to the plight of refugees in Africa. Just last week we have \nbeen reminded yet again of the disparity in the resources provided to \nassist those in need on the African continent compared to those in \nEurope. At a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on July 26, United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata outlined \nsome of the desperate problems facing the over 1.5 million refugees the \nagency currently counts in Africa. These problems are aggravated by a \nserious shortfall in international funding for UN refugee efforts. By \nsome accounts, only 60% of the UNHCR's $137\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nmillion budget for general programs for Africa has been funded to date. \nThe total UNHCR funding for all of Africa for 1999, including the \ngeneral program, special programs, and emergencies, is only $302 \nmillion. That compares to $520 million set aside just for special \nprograms and emergencies for the Former Yugoslavia.\n  The international response to the refugee crisis in Africa remains \nwoefully inadequate. The situation is made even worse by the disparity \nbetween the donations offered to assist European refugees and those \noffered to support African refugees. As Mrs. Ogata so succinctly noted \non July 26, ``Undeniably, proximity, strategic interest and \nextraordinary media focus have played a key role in determining the \nquality and level of response.'' While this may explain why Kosovo has \nreceived far greater refugee assistance than have the multiple crises \nin Africa, it can not justify that imbalance. The suffering of a family \ndriven from its home or a child wrenched from its family by war is no \nless because it happens in Africa, away from the media glare and the \nfamiliar sources of conflict in Europe.\n  While I understand that there are necessary limits to the resources \navailable for the millions of refugees in the world, I believe we \nshould render our precious contribution to humanitarian assistance in a \nfair and balanced manner. As I have said many times on this floor--why \nKosovo and not Sudan or Sierra Leone or Rwanda? To those who will cite \nour ``strategic'' interests in Europe, I respond that I believe our \n``moral'' interests are also critically important to this nation's \nstanding in the world.\n  I appreciate the State Department's announcement of an additional \nmid-year $11.7 million contribution to the UNHCR's general program, of \nwhich $6.6 million was designated for Africa. This is a good start, but \nit still falls far short of what Africa needs and what Europe gets. It \ndoes not please me to have to highlight the regional disparity in \nrefugee assistance. But I believe it is important for the Senate to be \non record in strong support of a fair and balanced effort to meet the \nneeds of refugees throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10359-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10359-S10361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWSUITS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was surprised by the three decisions of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States on June 23, 1999 which drastically reduced \nthe Constitutional power of Congress and even more surprised by the \nlack of reaction by Members of the House and Senate to this usurpation \nof Congressional authority. [College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid \n1999 U.S. LEXIS 4375, Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank 1999 U.S. \nLEXIS 4376 and Allen v. Maine, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4374.]\n  Even though ignored by the Congress, these decisions have been \nroundly criticized by the academicians. Stanford University historian \nJack Rakove, author of ``Original Meanings'', a Pulitzer Prize winning \naccount of the drafting of the Constitution, characterizes Justice \nKennedy's historical argument in Alden v. Maine as ``strained, even \nsilly''.\n  Professor Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan Law School, \nin commenting on Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board \nversus College Savings Bank, said:\n\n       ``The decision makes no sense'', asserting that it arises \n     from ``a bizzarre states' rights agenda that really has \n     nothing to do with intellectual property.''\n\n  Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe commented:\n\n       ``In the absence of even a textual hint in the \n     Constitution, the Court discerned from the constitutional \n     `either' that states are immune from individual lawsuits.'' \n     (These decisions are) ``scary''. ``They treat states' rights \n     in a truly exaggerated way, harking back to what the country \n     looked like before the civil war and, in many ways, even \n     before the adoption of the Constitution.''\n\n  In addition to treating the Congress with disdain, the five person \nmajority in all three cases demonstrated judicial activism and \nexhibited what can only be viewed as a political agenda in drastically \ndeparting from long-standing law. Former Solicitor General Walter \nDellinger described these cases as: ``one of the three or four major \nshifts in constitutionalism we've seen in two centuries.''\n  A commentary in The Economist on July 3, 1999 emphasized the Court's \nradical departure from existing law stating:\n\n       The Court's majority has embarked on a venture as detached \n     from any constitutional moorings as was the liberal Warren \n     Court of the 1960's in its most activity mood.\n\n  In its two opinions in College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid \nand Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank, the Court held that \nthe doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents states from being sued in \nFederal court for infringing intellectual property rights. In reaching \nthese decisions, the Court discussed and dismissed two laws passed by \nCongress for the specific purpose of subjecting the states to suits in \nFederal Court: the Patent Remedy Act and the Trademark Remedy \nClarification Act.\n  These decisions leave us with an absurd and untenable state of \naffairs. Through their state-owned universities and hospitals, states \nparticipate in the intellectual property marketplace as equals with \nprivate companies. The University of Florida, for example, owns more \nthan 200 patents. Furthermore, state entities such as universities are \nmajor consumers of intellectual property and often violate intellectual \nproperty laws when, for example, they copy textbooks without proper \nauthorization.\n\n  But now, Florida and all other states will enjoy an enormous \nadvantage over their private sector competitors--they will be immune \nfrom being sued for intellectual property infringement. Since patent \nand copyright infringement are exclusively Federal causes of action, \nand trademark infringement is largely Federal, the inability to sue in \nFederal court is, practically speaking, a bar to any redress at all.\n  The right of states to sovereign immunity from most Federal lawsuits \nis guaranteed in the Eleventh Amendment to the constitution, which \nprovides that:\n\n       The Judicial Power of the United States shall not be \n     construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced \n     or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of \n     another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign \n     state.\n\n  It has long been recognized, however, that this immunity from suit is \nnot absolute. As the Supreme Court noted in one of the Florida Prepaid \nopinions, the Court has recognized two circumstances in which an \nindividual may sue a state:\n\n       First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise \n     of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment--an \n     Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and \n     specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. \n     Secondly, a state may waive its sovereign immunity by \n     consenting to suite.--College Savings Bank versus Florida \n     Prepaid at 7.\n\n  Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment is contained in \nSection Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that ``The \nCongress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, \nthe provisions of this article.'' One of the provisions of the \nFourteenth Amendment, Section One, provides that no State shall, \n``deprive any person of . . . property . . . without due process of \nlaw.'' Accordingly, Congress has the power to pass laws to enforce the \nrights of citizens not to be deprived of their property--including \ntheir intellectual property--without due process of law.\n  Employing this power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, \nCongress passed the Patent Remedy Act and the Trademark Remedy \nClarification Act in 1992. As its preamble states, Congress passed the \nPatent Remedy Act to ``clarify that States . . . are subject to suit in \nFederal court by any person for infringement of patents and plant \nvariety protections.'' Congress passed the Trademark Remedy \nClarification Act to subject the States to suits brought under Sec. 43 \nof the Trademark Act of 1946 for false and misleading advertising.\n  In Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank, the Court held in a 5 \nto 4 opinion that Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign \nimmunity from patent infringement suits when it passed the Patent \nRemedy Act. In an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court \nreasoned that in order determine whether a Congressional enactment \nvalidly abrogates the States' sovereign immunity, two questions must be \nanswered, ``first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed its \nintent to abrogate the immunity . . . and second\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\nwhether Congress has acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power.''\n  The Court acknowledged that in enacting the Patent Remedy Act, \nCongress made its intention to abrogate the States' immunity \nunmistakably clear in the language of the statute. The Court then held, \nhowever, that Congress had not acted pursuant to a valid exercise of \npower when it passed the Patent Remedy Act. The Court wrote that \nCongress' enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment is \n``remedial'' in nature. Therefore, ``for Congress to invoke Section 5 \nit must identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's \nsubstantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to \nremedying or preventing such conduct.'' Florida Prepaid versus College \nSavings Bank at 20.\n  The court found that Congress failed to identify a pattern of patent \ninfringement by the States, let alone a pattern of constitutional \nviolations. The Court specifically noted that a deprivation of property \nwithout due process could occur only where the State provides \ninadequate remedies to injured patent owners. The Court then observed \nthat:\n\n       Congress, however, barely considered the availability of \n     state remedies for patent infringement and hence whether the \n     States' conduct might have amounted to a constitutional \n     violation under the Fourteenth Amendment * * *. Congress \n     itself said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state \n     remedies in the statute or in the Senate Report, and made \n     only a few fleeting references to state remedies in the House \n     Report, essentially repeating the testimony of the \n     witnesses.--Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank at \n     27-28.\n\n  Accordingly, the Court concluded that:\n\n       The legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy \n     Act does not respond to a history of widespread and \n     persisting deprivation of constitutional rights of the sort \n     Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic Section 5 \n     legislation. Instead, Congress appears to have enacted this \n     legislation in response to a handful of instances of state \n     patent infringement that do not necessarily violate the \n     Constitution.) Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank at \n     31-32.\n\n  Not only is the result of this opinion troubling--that states will \nenjoy immunity from suit--but so is the reasoning which supports this \nresult. Here we have a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court choosing to \nignore an act of Congress because he has concluded that Congress passed \nthe legislation with insufficient justification. In essence, the Chief \nJustice is telling us we did a poor job developing our record before \npassing the Patent Remedy Act. As we all know, however, many of us \nsupport legislation for reasons that don't make it into the written \nrecord. The record is an important, but imperfect, summary of or views. \nThis is why past Courts have been reluctant to dismiss Congressional \nmotives in this fashion.\n  In College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid, the Supreme Court \ndecided in a 5 to 4 opinion that Trademark Remedy Clarification Act \n(the ``TRCA'') was not a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. \nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, noted that Congress passed \nthe TRCA to remedy and prevent state deprivations of two types of \nproperty rights: (1) a right to be free from a business competitor's \nfalse advertising about its own product, and (2) a more generalized \nright to be secure in one's business interests. The Court contrasted \nthese rights with the hallmarks of a protected property interest, \nnamely the right to exclude others.\n  Justice Scalia reached the surprising conclusion that protection \nagainst false advertising secured by Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act \ndoes not implicate property rights protected by the due process clause \nso that Congress could not rely on its remedies under Section 5 of the \n14th Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity. If conducting a \nlegitimate business operation with protection from false advertising is \nnot a ``property right'', it is hard to conceive of what is business \nproperty. That Scalia rationale shows the extent to which the Court has \ngone to invalidate Congressional enactments.\n  The Court then discussed whether Florida's sovereign immunity, though \nnot abrogated, was voluntarily waived. Here, the Court expressly \noverruled its prior decision in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. 377 U.S. 184 \n(1964) and held that there was no voluntary waiver. In Parden, the \nCourt had created the doctrine of constructive waiver, which held that \na state could be found to have waived its immunity to suit by engaging \nin certain activities, such as voluntary participation in the conduct \nCongress has sought to regulate. Since Congress has sought to regulate \ninterstate commerce, then a state which participated in interstate \ncommerce by registering and licensing patents would be held to have \nvoluntarily waived its immunity to a patent infringement suit. By \noverruling Parden, however, the Court held that a voluntary waiver of \nsovereign immunity must be expressed. Florida made no such express \nwaiver of its sovereign immunity.\n  In other relatively recent cases, the Court has gone out of its way, \nalmost on a personal basis, to chastise and undercut Congress. The case \nof Sable v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989) provides a striking example of \nthis trend. In Sable, the Court struck down a ban on ``indecent'' \ninterstate telephone communications passed by Congress in 1988. In \nrejecting this provision, the Court focused on whether there were \nconstitutionally acceptable less restrictive means, short of a total \nban, to achieve its goal of protecting minors. The Court then declared, \nin unusually dismissive and critical language, that Congress had not \nsufficiently considered this issue:\n\n       * * * aside from conclusory statements during the debates \n     by proponents of the bill . . . that under the FCC \n     regulations minors could still have access to dial-a-porn \n     messages, the congressional record presented to us contains \n     no evidence as to how effective or ineffective the FCC's most \n     recent regulations were or might prove to be.\n       The bill that was enacted . . . was introduced on the \n     floor. . . . No Congressman or Senator purported to present a \n     considered judgement with respect to how often or to what \n     extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and have \n     access to dial-a-porn messages.\n\n  If a member of the Congress made a judgement, by what authority does \nthe Supreme Court superimpose its view that it wasn't a ``considered \njudgement''? A fair reading of the statements from the floor debate on \nthis issue undercuts the Court's disparaging characterization of this \ndebate. For example, Representative Tom Bliley of Virginia gave a \nrather detailed and persuasive discussion of how he concluded that a \nlegislative ban was necessary. Mr. Bliley noted that in 1983, Congress \nfirst passed legislation which required the FCC to report regulations \ndescribing methods by which dial-a-porn providers could screen out \nunderage callers. Mr. Bliley then walks us through the repeated failure \nof the FCC to pass regulations which could withstand judicial scrutiny. \nFinally, Mr. Bliley notes that:\n\n       . . . it has become clear that there was not a \n     technological solution that would adequately and effectively \n     protect our children from the effect of this material. We \n     looked for effective alternatives to a ban--there were none.\n\n  The Court repeats its critique of Congressional action in the case of \nReno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). Here the Court struck down the \nCommunications Decency Act, which prohibited transmission to minors of \n``indecent'' or ``patently offensive'' communications. In this opinion, \nthe Court again discusses whether less restrictive means were available \nand again concludes that Congress had not sufficiently addressed the \nissue. The opinion notes that:\n\n       The Communications Decency Act contains provisions that \n     were either added in executive committee after the hearings \n     [on the Telecom Act] were concluded or as amendments offered \n     during floor debate on the legislation. . . . No hearings \n     were held on the provisions that became the law.\n\n  The Court in Reno later notes that, ``The lack of legislative \nattention to the statute at issue in Sable suggests another parallel \nwith this case.''\n  Once again, if Congress passes a law, by what authority does the \nSupreme Court conclude that we did not devote sufficient legislative \nattention to the law? In the Reno opinion itself the Court noted that \nsome Members of the House of Representatives opposed the Communications \nDecency Act because they thought that less restrictive screening \ndevices would work. These members offered an amendment intended as a \nsubstitute for the Communications Decency Act, but instead saw their \nprovision accepted as an additional section of the Act. In light of \nthis record, how can the Court say that Congress did not consider less \nrestrictive means?\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\n  A recent trend in Supreme Court decisions, highlighted by these three \ncases, shows an activist court with a political agenda determined to \nrestructure political power in America away from Congress and to the \nstates. What is Congress to do? We could exercise greater care in the \nconfirmation process, but that is hardly the answer. Supreme Court \nnominees in Senate confirmation hearings routinely promise to respect \nCongressional authority and not to make new law. Once on the Court, \nmany of the justices ignore those commitments.\n  The decision in Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank leaves a \nslight opening for Congress to legislate again under Article 5 of the \n14th Amendment to narrowly tailor a legislative approach to satisfy the \nCourt. Given the intensity of the Court's agenda and its inventive and \nextreme rationales for declaring Congressional actions \nunconstitutional, it is highly doubtful that anything the Congress does \nwill satisfy the Court in its current campaign.\n  Congress may have to initiate a constitutional amendment to re-\nestablish its legitimate authority. Before these three cases, it was \nunthinkable that Congress' authority over trademarks, patents and \ncopyrights would have been undercut by a doctrine of state sovereign \nimmunity. How could that be in the face of the provisions of Article 1, \nSection 8 granting the Congress express authority over trademarks, \npatents and copyrights by its enumerated power:\n\n       To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by \n     securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \n     exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\n\n  These important issues merit immediate and extensive consideration by \nthe Congress. Perhaps a constitutional amendment is the only way to \nreinstate the balance between the authority of the Congress and the \nusurpation by the Supreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10361-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL \n                         SECURITY AND MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with the announcement of his proposal to \nmodernize and strengthen Medicare, President Clinton has demonstrated \nthat we can achieve needed Medicare reform without compromising our \nclear commitment to the fundamental principles of that basic and highly \nsuccessful program. Our goal is to preserve and strengthen Medicare, so \nthat it effectively meets the needs of all senior citizens in the years \nahead, as it has done so well for the past thirty-four years.\n  Above all, we must reject any proposals that undermine the ability of \nsenior citizens to obtain the health care they need, or that attempt to \ntransform Medicare into a voucher program, as the Medicare Commission's \nrecommendations and other premium support plans do. Such proposals are \nrisky schemes. They abandon Medicare's successful social insurance \ncompact, and current guarantee of a defined benefit. Premium support \nproposals could price conventional Medicare out of reach and force \nsenior citizens to join HMOs. They threaten to compromise the quality \nof care and reduce access to care. That is unacceptable to senior \ncitizens, and it should be unacceptable to members of Congress.\n  There are a number of hard-working organizations dedicated to the \nwell-being of senior citizens.

Mr. President, last night, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives passed the conference report to H.R. 1664, the bill \ncontaining the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas \nGuaranteed Loan programs, by a vote of 246 yeas to 176 nays. H.R. 1664 \nwas passed by the Senate on June 18, 1999.\n  The steel and oil and gas loan guarantee programs will provide \nqualified U.S. steel producers and small oil and gas producers with \naccess to a $1.5 billion GATT-legal, revolving loan guarantee fund to \nback loans through the private market. A board of the highest caliber--\nconsisting of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System, who will serve as the Chair, the Secretary of Commerce, \nand the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission--will \noversee the programs. These distinguished board members will ensure \ncareful analysis of the guarantee award process, including actions \nneeded by U.S. steel mills and oil and gas producers to secure a \nfinancial recovery along with a reasonable prospect for repayment of \nthe federally guaranteed loans. The loan guarantee programs are written \nto provide the board members with the flexibility necessary to offer \nthe maximum benefit to U.S. steel and oil and gas businesses and the \nmaximum protection to the taxpayers.\n  The passage of H.R. 1664 is a vital measure for both the U.S. steel \nindustry and the oil and gas industry, and it was a personal pleasure \nfor me to work with the fine Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, on \nthis important legislation. I authored the steel loan guarantee \nprovisions, while my good friend Senator Domenici authored the \nprovisions for oil and gas. After several long nights, some tough \nnegotiations, and countless consultations, H.R. 1664, a bill that \njoined our two programs, will deliver critical assistance to hard \nworking Americans. H.R. 1664 is, indeed, a ``buy American bill.'' But, \nmore importantly, the passage of H.R. 1664 is a vote of confidence for \nAmerican workers and American families.\n  Passage of H.R. 1664 is an important statement by this Congress in \nsupport of the men and women in the U.S. steel industry. These workers \nhave played by the global trade rules only to find themselves cheated \nby our trading partners who ignore the rules in order to maximize their \nown profits. Illegal steel trade has created exceedingly difficult \nfinanical circumstances for the U.S. steel industry, and the U.S. steel \nindustry deserves the benefits provided under H.R. 1664. Those benefits \nsimply will provide essential loan guarantees to address the cash flow \nemergency created by the historic surge of cheap and illegal steel. \nThey are vital to the future viability of many, many steel jobs.\n  The historic level of illegally dumped imported steel is a national \ncrisis. The record levels of these foreign imports have caused over \n10,000 thousand U.S. steelworkers to experience layoffs, short work \nweeks, and reduced pay. American steel companies have suffered from \nreduced shipments, significant drops in orders, price depression, lower \nprofits, and worse. Already, at least six U.S. steel manufacturers have \nfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections, jeopardizing employees, \nfamilies, and entire communities. This steel loan guarantee program can \nhelp to prevent further bankruptcies, and provide vitally important \nsupport for the survival of small- and medium-sized steel \nmanufacturers.\n  Steel communities are proud of their role throughout this nation's \nhistory. Through the work of men and women in places like Weirton, West \nVirginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the backbone of this nation was \nforged. Steel has always been a driving force in the growth and \nprosperity of our nation.\n  I applaud the action by this Congress in passing H.R. 1664. It was \nthe right thing to do. I urge the President to quickly sign the bill \ninto law. These loan guarantee programs will operate through the \nprivate market to help sustain good-paying jobs, support our national \nsecurity, and save taxpayers millions of dollars from lost tax revenues \nand increased public assistance payments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, in both the steel \nand the oil and gas loan guarantee programs, the legislation provides \nthat loan guarantees may be issued upon application of the prospective \nborrower\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n(section 101(g) for the Steel Loan Guarantee Program and section 201 \n(f) for the Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program). Ordinarily, the \napplicant for a loan guarantee is the prospective lender. Am I correct \nin assuming that that would be the case under these programs, and that \nthe true intent of the language in the legislation is that the \nprospective lender is the applicant?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, the Senator from New Mexico is correct in that \nassumption. It will be the lender that obtains the direct benefits of a \nloan guarantee, and it is the prospective lender that will be required \nto submit necessary application materials for the guaranty. The \nprospective borrower will, of course, also have to submit information \nand other material as part of the application for a loan guarantee, but \nunder each program it is the lender with whom the Loan Guarantee Board \nwill have its legal relationship. Therefore, it is the prospective \nlender that will be required to apply for assistance under these \nprograms.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is possible that under each of these programs there \nmay be many, many eligible firms--more under the Oil and Gas Loan \nGuarantee Program, but potentially a high number under the Steel Loan \nGuarantee Program, as well--particularly as there is no ``floor'' or \nminimum amount of loan that may be guaranteed. Would the Loan Guarantee \nBoards have the discretion to establish priorities and criteria for the \nconsideration of applications and award of guarantees, so that projects \ncould be considered in an orderly manner, and there could be a proper \nmix of loan risks, to maximize the effectiveness of the programs within \nthe amount appropriated for program costs?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Loan Guarantee Boards would absolutely have that \ndiscretion. The clear intent of this legislation is to effectuate the \nguarantee of up to $1.5 billion of loans under the two programs. There \nis no requirement for first-come, first-served among applicants. The \nBoards may impose additional reasonable requirements for participation \nin the programs. It is, indeed, our intent to look to the judgment and \nexpertise of the administering agencies, the experience and competence \nof professional advisors, and the wisdom and common sense of the Loan \nGuarantee Boards themselves to make these programs run effectively. It \nis not our intent to hamstring the Boards in determining their \npriorities and procedures; rather, we expect the Boards to implement \nthese programs as to ensure the fulfillment of the Congressional \npurpose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note that the legislation requires the Loan Guarantee \nBoards to establish procedures, rules and regulations, but appropriates \nmoney to the Department of Commerce to administer the programs. Am I \ncorrect in assuming that this is because the Boards themselves are not \nexpected to actually administer the programs, but only to adopt rules \nand procedures, and approve guarantees and amendments? And am I correct \nin further assuming that, subject to the direction of the Loan \nGuarantee Boards, the Department of Commerce is expected to prepare \nproposed rules and procedures for the Boards' consideration; on behalf \nof the Boards, publish regulations in the Federal Register; process \napplications for guarantees; and undertake the day-to-day \nadministration of the programs?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, those are correct assumptions. While the Boards will \nhave the ultimate decision-making responsibilities, and will take the \nactions directed by the legislation, as a practical matter they are not \nexpected to handle the day-to-day work of administering loan guarantee \nprograms. That will be handled through the Department of Commerce, \nusing its own staff, contracting for the consultants and other \nservices, or through agreements with another agency or agencies.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Many qualified steel companies are currently in \nbankruptcy, or have existing debt with covenants in those investments \nthat provide for seniority for such existing debentures. In determining \nloan security, is it not the intent of this legislation to give the \nBoard the discretion to use its professional judgment to determine the \nnature, kind, quality and amount of security required for a loan \nguarantee?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct. The Board has the flexibility to use a \ncombination of factors, including prospective earning power, in \ndetermining loan security terms and conditions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note that the legislation in section 101 (j), \nappropriates $5 million to the Department of Commerce, for necessary \nexpenses to administer the Steel Loan Guarantee Program. Similarly, in \nsection 201 (i), $2.5 million is appropriated to the Department for \nnecessary expenses to administer the Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee \nProgram. In each case, the legislation provides that the appropriation, \n``may be transferred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Trade \nDevelopment of the International Trade Administration.'' The operative \nword here is ``may.'' Do I correctly assume that the Secretary of \nCommerce has the discretion to determine where funds provided for under \nthese programs can be most effectively administered?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. That is an accurate assumption. The Secretary is authorized \nunder the legislation to assign administration of the programs as he \nsees fit, to accomplish their effective administration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask whether the full faith and credit of the United \nStates will stand behind the guarantees to be executed by the Loan \nGuarantee Boards. This is of course an important matter for prospective \nlenders, determining perhaps at what interest rates a guaranteed loan \nwould be made, or indeed whether a loan would be made at all. Am I \ncorrect in my assumption that although the bill does not specifically \nsay so in so many words, the full faith and credit of the United States \nwill in fact stand behind the loan guarantees?\n  Mr. BYRD. My good friend from New Mexico is correct. Under this \nlegislation, the full faith and credit of the United States will, in \nfact, stand behind each loan guarantee executed by the Loan Guarantee \nBoard, the same as if the legislation specifically said so. Lenders may \nparticipate in this program with confidence, and should therefore offer \nthe borrowers the very best terms--including low interest--on the \nguaranteed loans.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is indeed important legislation, but I ask whether \nregulations promulgated to implement the legislation would be a ``major \nrule'' as that term is used in the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. \n804). Generally, any rule that has a $100 million effect on the economy \nin a single year is considered to be a major rule, and cannot go into \neffect until 60 days after the rule is submitted to Congress for review \nand possible disapproval. But, if the loan guarantee regulations are \nconsidered a major rule, delaying their effect would appear to be \ninconsistent with the language and intent of the legislation. Once \nregulations promulgated under this legislation are written, cleared by \nOMB, filed with Congress, and published in the Federal Register, I \nassume they would go into effect right away. Is this correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that assumption is accurate. Any rule issued to \nimplement this program could be considered a ``major rule'' under the \nCongressional Review Act, and subject to the delayed effective date. \nHowever, the legislation itself recognizes the urgency of the programs: \nsection 101(l) provides that the Steel Loan Guarantee Board ``shall \nissue such final procedures, rules, and regulations as may be necessary \nto carry out this section not later than 60 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act.'' Identical language appears for the Oil and Gas \nLoan Guarantee Board, in section 201(k). Due to this urgency, we expect \nthe Administration to apply the provisions of the Congressional Review \nAct which allow even a major rule to go into effect without delay, \nconsistent with the public interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10362-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10362-S10363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DARLINGTON MOTOR SPEEDWAY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, nestled in the flat, hot tobacco country \nof South Carolina's Pee Dee region is an egg-shaped track that is one \nof the most revered spots in all of auto racing, the ``Darlington \nRaceway''. As anyone even remotely familiar with NASCAR can tell you, \nfor 50 years this September, the Darlington Raceway has not only been \nhome to the most exciting race in motor sports, the\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\n``Southern 500'', it has also earned the ominous and accurate nickname \nas the track ``too tough to tame''.\n  For five decades, people from around the world have traveled to this \notherwise quiet city in order to be spectators in this contest of \ndriving and mechanical skill. The atmosphere is festive, with the \ninfield and stands packed to capacity with racing enthusiasts who are \nwilling to brave the cruel heat, stifling humidity, and unforgiving sun \nin order to see which driver is able to prove that his mettle is equal \nto the asphalt and curves that make-up this 1.36 mile track. In 1950, \nthe year of the first race, 25,000 people turned out as spectators, \nthis year, there will be more than 100,000 race fans at Darlington, and \nmillions more around the globe will follow the action on radio or \ntelevision. That is a testament to both the popularity of NASCAR and \nthe respect that the Darlington Raceway has among drivers and race \nfans.\n  To those who have never made it to Darlington, it might be hard to \nunderstand the attraction of this sport, but for those of us who have \nwitnessed this race up close, there is no question why people love to \ngo to this track. There is something truly awe inspiring about standing \nclose to one of the turns at Darlington and watching stock cars \nengineered and built to the ultimate standards roll past as they race \nto be the first to finish the 500 grueling miles that must be completed \nin order to win the ``Southern 500''. These cars rumble past at well \nover 100 miles-per-hour with only inches between bumpers, and as they \ngo through one of the four turns of the track, the earth literally \nshakes under one's feet and the air is thick with the deafening roar of \nengines and the fumes of high performance fuel. It takes individuals of \ntremendous mechanical skill to put one of these vehicles on the track, \nand other men of incredible determination, skill, and grit to compete \nin these races. One cannot help but come away amazed at the abilities \nof these drivers and crews, or at the challenge the Darlington Raceway \npresents to these individuals.\n  In 1950, I was serving in my final year as Governor of the State of \nSouth Carolina, and on September 1st of that year, I had the distinct \nhonor and privilege of cutting the ribbon that opened the Darlington \nMotor Speedway. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be able \nto celebrate the golden anniversary of the opening of the Speedway in \nperson, but regrettably my schedule does not permit me to be in \nDarlington early next month. Instead, I have chosen to take to the \nSenate Floor to salute the vision of Harold Brasington, the man who \nbuilt the Darlington Speedway. I also want to salute Jim Hunter, \nPresident of Darlington Raceway; Bill France, Jr., the President and \nCEO of International Speedway Corporation, as well as the President of \nNASCAR; and most importantly, to express my greetings and well wishes \nto all the drivers, crews, and fans who will descend there on September \n5, 1999 to see who will tame this track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10363-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10363-S10366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE FEDERAL RESEARCH INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nstrong support for S. 296, the Federal Research Investment Act, which \nwas introduced earlier this year by Senator Frist and Senator \nRockefeller, and was reported favorably by the Commerce Committee \nearlier this month. This legislation is important for the future of the \nnation's economy and our competitive position in the global market-\nplace.\n  A key ingredient in the continued success and growth of our economy \nis federal investment in research and development. Much of America's \ntechnological leadership today and in the past has been stimulated by \nfederal R expenditures, and we need to continue to strengthen these \ninvestments as a top national priority.\n  The results of this public-private partnership are all around us. \nThey include the biotechnology industry, commercial satellite \ncommunications, integrated circuitry, the Internet, satellite-based \nglobal navigation and communications, and supercomputers.\n  The Act calls for doubling the federal non-defense science budgets \nover the next eleven years. As a share of GDP, federal investment in \nR now stands at about half what it was 30 years ago. This share is \nprojected to continue to fall under the current budget caps. Clearly, a \nstrong commitment is needed for investment in R funding for basic \nsciences. Without a strong commitment, the worsening imbalance in R \nfunding will have a negative impact on the economy and the nation's \ncompetitive position.\n  I strongly support the effort to double the federal R budget. It is \none of the most effective ways to ensure the continued prosperity of \nour nation. It is imperative that we continue making these investments \nwhich have made Massachusetts and many other states renowned for their \ninnovative leadership. We must continue and enhance, not cut back, on \nthese needed investments.\n  I commend Senator Rockefeller and Senator Frist for their leadership \nand vision on this critical piece of legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join in supporting this important Act.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to join Senators Frist \nand Lieberman and other distinguished colleagues to commend the Senate \nfor passing the Federal Research Investment Act. This legislation will \nset a long-term vision for federal funding of research and development \nprograms so that the United States can continue to be the world leader \nin the research and innovation upon which our high-tech industry is \nbased.\n  One only needs to look as far as the front page of the newspaper to \nsee the effect of high-technology on our country. New drugs are \nbecoming available for fighting cancer; new communication hardware is \nallowing more people to connect to the Internet; and advances in fuel-\ncell technology are leading to low-emission, high-efficiency \nalternative fuel vehicles. According to a 1998 National Science \nFoundation study, over seventy percent of all patent applications in \nAmerica cite non-profit or federally funded research as a core \ncomponent to the innovation being patented. Even at IBM, an industry \nleader in R, only 21 percent of its patent applications were based on \ncompany research. People are living longer, with a higher quality of \nlife, in a better economy due to processes, procedures, and equipment \nwhich are based on federally funded research.\n  New technologies and products do not appear out of thin air. They are \nthe result of a basis of knowledge which has been built up by \nresearchers supported by federal funding. American companies draw from \nthis knowledge base in developing the high-tech products which you and \nI read about in the paper and see on our store shelves everyday.\n  I view this knowledge base as an investment. The US government puts \nin modest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific \nresearch. The dividends come from the economic growth which is produced \nas this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies.\n  A large part of the current rosy economic situation is due to these \nhigh-tech industries. High-tech companies are responsible for one-third \nof our economic output and half of our economic growth. Alan Greenspan \nhas said that new technologies are primarily responsible for the \nnation's phenomenal economic performance, low unemployment, low \ninflation, high corporate profits and soaring stock prices. If we want \ncontinued economic growth, we therefore need to support the \nfundamental, pre-competitive research critical to these industries, at \nthe necessary levels, and in a stable manner from year to year--and we \nneed to do so now.\n  Just three years ago, federal science funding was in a serious \ndecline and fewer than half a dozen members of Congress gave it any \nattention. Now the connection between a healthy research enterprise and \nour nation's strong economic growth is widely understood. In the last \ntwo years the science budget has increased above inflation. In \nparticular, for Fiscal Year 1999, an unprecedented 10 percent increase \nin civilian R funding was appropriated. Yet, somehow we appear to be \nonce again in a situation where the future outlook for R funding is \neither declining, stagnating, or barely keeping pace with inflation. We \nmust not only pass the Federal Research Investment Act, but we must \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\nour fight to actually implement the R budgetary guidelines set forth \nin this bill.\n  Finally, let me just say that one of the original reasons that I \nbecame involved in technology issues, such as the EPSCoR and EPSCoT \nprograms, was because I believe that technology should be shared by \neveryone, not just those in Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in \nMassachusetts. Therefore, this bill should be seen as a means of \nallowing for diversity in our national innovation infrastructure--\nresearch must be allowed to flower in Montana, Alaska, West Virginia as \nwell as the traditional centers of science.\n  In conclusion, we have put together a long-term vision for federal \nR funding which we hope will lead to real increases in federal \nfunding for research and development. Federally funded research has \nbeen, and will continue to be, a driving power behind our economic \nsuccess. If we are to maintain and enhance our current economic \nprosperity we must make sure that research programs are funded at \nadequate levels in a consistent long-term manner.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill and ask \nunanimous consent that both my comments and the news article from the \nWheeling News-Register, ``Congress Must Act to Ensure That Vital \nResearch Doesn't Lapse in U.S.,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Wheeling News-Register, Tuesday, May 11, 1999]\n\n Congress Must Act to Ensure That Vital Research Doesn't Lapse in U.S.\n\n                  (By Erich Bloch and Charles M. Vest)\n\n       Our nation is currently enjoying the longest period of \n     sustained economic growth since World War II. Much of this \n     growth is driven by competition and commercial reward for \n     innovative companies that use new technologies to develop new \n     products and services. These new technologies are possible \n     only because of the nation's investment in research. Basic \n     scientific and engineering research funded by the federal \n     government and conducted at America's public and private \n     universities is of particular importance. University research \n     led to the laser, fiber optics and the Internet, which make \n     the modern computing and telecommunications industries \n     possible. It also discovered recombinant DNA techniques that \n     have fueled the biotechnology industry, and made most of the \n     advances of modern medicine.\n       The private sector also funds and conducts important \n     research. Indeed, in many instances it took both government \n     and industry funding to achieve the decisive result. The \n     private sector's primary function is to advance technology \n     and translate basic scientific knowledge into commercially \n     useful devices and systems. But here too, the federal \n     government has a critical role: it must provide a policy and \n     regulatory framework that encourages and rewards private \n     investment in research.\n       Although nearly all analysts agree that our strong economy \n     is driven by research, we are not promoting and investing in \n     new research at an acceptable level, in either the public or \n     the private sector. This puts our future economy at \n     substantial risk. Despite Washington's proclivity for slowing \n     the growth of basic research funding, even in this time of \n     record economic growth and increased tax revenues, this risk \n     is being noted. Last year, for instance, both the House and \n     Senate took major steps towards addressing their obligation \n     in this regard.\n       The House of Representatives, taking its lead from Rep. \n     Vernon Ehlers, a physicist and vice chairman of the Science \n     Committee, unanimously approved key principles for federal \n     involvement in science research. The Senate unanimously \n     passed a bill promoting federal investment in research and \n     development. These two congressional actions, together with a \n     host of independent reports on investment in research, \n     established a momentum that must be embraced and accelerated \n     by the new Congress.\n       But Washington memories are short. Many a good idea has \n     gotten buried between the end of one Congress and the start \n     of a new one. Let's make sure this is not happening in this \n     case. Despite the pressure that balancing the budget puts on \n     Congress, we need to stay on the course that has proven to be \n     so effective.\n       There is plenty of disagreement about the details of how \n     U.S. science and technology policy should move forward. \n     However, we wish to point to four recommendations of the \n     House Science Committee's report that are especially worthy \n     of strong bipartisan support in the 106th Congress.\n       First, Congress should give high priority to stable and \n     substantial federal funding for fundamental scientific \n     research. Federal support of fundamental research has \n     declined as a percentage of gross domestic product during \n     this decade. It is both ironic and frustrating that our \n     research base has not benefitted from the very economic \n     expansion it helped to create.\n       Second, the federal government should invest in fundamental \n     research across a wide spectrum of disciplines in science, \n     mathematics, and engineering. The seamlessness of science and \n     technology and the interrelation of their many fields are \n     demonstrated every day. For example, magnetic resonance \n     imaging devices (MRIs), which have become lifesaving \n     diagnostic tools in the medical professions, have their roots \n     in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and electrical \n     engineering.\n       Third, an increased focus on partnerships is needed. \n     University-industry partnerships, government-industry \n     partnerships, and three-way efforts are required today \n     because of the complicated relationship between research and \n     the needs and constraints of each sector.\n       Finally, the policy environment for research must be \n     improved. The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit must be \n     strengthened and made permanent. This credit has been on \n     again, off again during the past 15 years, despite its \n     effectiveness in stimulating private industry to invest in \n     R\n       At this point in the federal budget process, there is real \n     danger that an expanded federal commitment to scientific \n     research--a goal unanimously supported by Congress last \n     year--may fall victim to larger political battles. Congress \n     should ensure that R, especially fundamental research, \n     receives the priority it deserves and that partnerships \n     between government, academia, and the private sector are \n     given a chance to succeed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to praise S. 296, the Federal \nResearch Investment Act of 1999, legislation designed to reverse a \ndownward trend in the Federal Government's allocation to science and \nengineering research and development (R). S. 296 authorizes a 5.5% \nincrease in funding per year for federally funded civilian R \nprograms, through 2010. While the future of individual agencies, such \nas the National Institutes of Health or the National Science \nFoundation, remains with the authorizing committees, the bill \nestablishes a long term commitment to sustaining the aggregate research \nand development portfolio during the annual budget cycle. The bill also \nputs in place a number of review and accountability measures to assure \nthe public and Congress that, each year, the R funds are well spent. \nI am pleased to report that S. 296 passed the Senate last week, on July \n28, 1999, by unanimous consent. It had 41 cosponsors, about equally \ndivided between the two parties, including the Majority and Minority \nleaders. The magnitude of support for this bill reflects the growing \nrealization that technological progress is the single largest factor, \nbar none, in sustaining economic growth.\n  Today we find ourselves in a ``New Economy.'' Everything about it \ndefies conventional wisdom. Our unemployment rate is extremely low, but \nat the same time, our interest rates are low. The boom itself keeps \ngoing, defying expectations. In fact, the current economic boom is soon \nto be the longest one in our nation's history. Even our national debt \nhas fallen far faster than economists had ever predicted it could. In \nretrospect, these happy miscalculations reflect a flaw in economic \ngrowth theory. Conventional economic wisdom at first underestimated the \nstrength and depth of our New Economy because it ignored the \nsubstantial productivity gains generated by advances in technology, in \nthis particular case, information technology. However, had we paid \nattention to history, we would have known better.\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\n  Almost a dozen major economic studies, including those of Nobel Prize \nlaureate Robert Solow, have tracked economic growth over prior decades. \nThese studies found that in every time period studied, approximately \nhalf of all economic growth was due to technological progress. The \npreponderance of the evidence provided by these economic studies has \nled Alan Greenspan to note in many of his recent speeches that in \naddition to the traditional forces of labor and capital, a very \nsubstantial portion of economic growth is now recognized to be due to \ntechnological innovation and the productivity increases it brings to \nthe workplace. That technological innovation is what is sustaining our \nboom today. Beyond the effects of interest rates and fiscal policy, \nthere are the dot.com's and the gazelle stocks, pushing our nation's \ntechnological wunderkind into untold riches, and pulling the rest of \nthe nation along with them.\n  In an industrialized nation, the technological innovation so \nnecessary for robust economic growth is generated by research and \ndevelopment (R). R is directly responsible for creation of the new \nproducts and processes which account for half or more of the growth in \noutput per person, thereby fueling our economy. The private sector \nrecognizes these connections--earlier this summer, Business Week \ndevoted a entire issue, over a hundred pages, to highlighting the \ngreatest scientific and technological innovations of the past 100 \nyears. As the noted economist Lester Thurow puts it, ``The payoff from \nsocial investment in basic research is as clear as anything is ever \ngoing to be in economics.'' To drive home the economic impact of \nscientific R, I would like to bring up the specific example of \nbiomedical research, which at least one analysis finds has a rate of \nreturn that is greater than $13 for every dollar invested.\n  This correlation between technology and economic growth is especially \ncompelling today, and not just for the biomedical arena. On a local \nscale, scores of governors are striving to bring high tech corridors \ninto their states. They know, intuitively, that future economic growth \nfor their states depends on high tech. America's research-intensive \nindustries have been growing at about twice the rate of the average \neconomy over the past two decades. Job opportunities in information \ntechnology flood the newspaper want ads, an illustration of the \nInternet sector's 1.2 million new jobs in 1998. Moreover, high tech \nwages are 77% greater than the private sector average.\n  However, we have reached a cross-roads in this era of technological \ngrowth. We must remember that the ultimate origins of today's high-tech \ncompanies, and hence the dramatic economic gains we now see, were a few \nseminal discoveries made in the mid-1960's. It was at that time that \nwe, as a country, were seriously investing in research and development. \nBecause of the 20-30 year time lag between basic scientific discovery \nand market product, that substantial federal investment is now bearing \nfruit in the form of our exceptionally robust economy in the 1990's.\n  Unfortunately, since the mid-1960's we have not maintained our \ninvestment in R As a fraction of the federal budget, the federal \ngovernment's support of R has dropped by \\2/3\\ over the past 34 \nyears. When expressed as a fraction of GDP, federal funding of R has \ndeclined to half its mid-1960's value. For certain individual \ndisciplines, the future is bleak. A recent report from the National \nAcademy shows that in the years between 1993 and 1997, federal funding \nfor research in mechanical engineering declined 50.4%, that for \nelectrical engineering declined 35.7%, that for physics declined 28.7%, \nand that for chemical engineering declined 12.9%. These decreases are \nnot just abstract reductions in facilities and personnel at research \nlabs, and students and professors in universities. They represent the \nvery seed corn of our economic prosperity. We no longer have as robust \na pool of ideas to germinate into fundamentally new industries; we no \nlonger have the technically trained populace capable of fully \ncultivating and implementing those ideas. Meanwhile, other countries \nare stepping in to fill the gap. Thirteen countries now have greater \nfunding for basic research as a fraction of GNP than we do. For non-\ndefense research, Japan spends more than the US, even in absolute \ndollars.\n  The problem of declining US R funding is especially acute, and \ndemands action now, because of the dynamics of the global economy. In \norder to compete in the global economy, industry R funding has become \noverwhelmingly (84%) and increasingly concentrated on product \ndevelopment/refinement, i.e, the last stage of R Thus, for new \nproduct concepts, industry is correspondingly more dependent on the \nbasic and applied research sponsored by the government. The connection \nis a direct one. Currently, 73% of all papers cited in industrial \npatents are the product of government and non-profit funded research. \nWith our declining investment in government-funded R, coupled with \nthe increased appetite of industry for new market products and \ntechnologically literate workers, the government is stripping US \nindustry of the knowledge base required to derive new products and \ncompete in new industries.\n  We must also understand that this falloff in R will have serious \neconomic repercussions into the future. Our investments in science and \ntechnology have an impact which stretches out over a twenty to thirty \nyear horizon. Recognition of this fact is particularly crucial because \nof the projected dramatic rises in entitlement spending when the baby \nboom generation retires. To pay for Social Security, for Medicare, for \nall the hopes and dreams of our country, we will need a healthy \neconomic harvest in years to come. Increasing our commitment to R \ntoday is the surest way to provide for the robust economy that is \nessential to our future social commitments. As Judy Carter, President \nand CEO of Softworks, points out, ``Without a growing economy, \nAmericans' standard of living, and our ability to support the needs of \nour aging population will be in jeopardy. Faced with a static or \ndecreasing workforce as U.S. demographics shift, U.S. lawmakers must \nfocus on encouraging technology development to increase productivity, \nenabling a smaller workforce to support a growing population of \nretirees.''\n  We are doing well now economically because of our past R \ninvestments, but the declining R accounts bode poorly for our future. \nThe Council on Competitiveness put it succinctly when it concluded, \n``the United States may be living off historical assets that are not \nbeing renewed.'' It is time now to renew those investments. With its \nsmall but steady increases in the nation's R accounts and its \ncommitment to thoughtful planning and review of our R portfolio, The \nFederal Research Investment Act, S. 296, begins the replenishment of \nour consummate national treasure--our knowledge base.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout an important, yet often ignored aspect of the federal budget--our \ninvestment in research and development (R). While I strongly believe \nthat Congress must strive to stay within the budget caps, I also firmly \nbelieve that funding for R should be allowed to grow in fiscal year \n2000 and beyond. Many economists argue that such an investment, through \nits impact on economic growth, will not drain our resources, but will \nactually improve our country's fiscal standing.\n  The Federal Research Investment Act, which I authored with Senators \nRockefeller, Domenici, and Lieberman, passed the Senate last Monday for \nthe second year in a row. the bill would double the amount of \nfederally-funded civilian research and development (R) over eleven \nyear period. This critical federal investment, performed throughout our \nnational laboratories, universities, and private industry, is currently \nfueling 50% of our national economy through improvements in capital and \nlabor productivity.\n  Throughout my career in the Senate, I have spent a considerable \namount of time advocating for greater funding levels for civilian R \nTogether with many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I \nhave been trying to educate others on the value of the federal \ngovernment's role in funding merit-based and peer-reviewed programs. \nOne only has to look at the Internet, the foundation of the new digital \neconomy, to find an example of prudent federal investment in R\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\n  Current economic expansion and growth, however, cannot be maintained \nif we do not provide the necessary funds and incentives to perform \ncritical R throughout the scientific disciplines. Federal \nexpenditures of both civilian and defense R as a percentage of GDP \nhave dropped from 2.2 percent in 1965 to only 0.8 percent in 1999--\nnearly one third of its value.\n  We have both a long-term problem: addressing the ever-increasing \nlevel of mandatory spending; and a near-term challenge: apportioning \nthe ever-dwindling amount of discretionary funding. The confluence of \nincreased dependency on technology and decreased fiscal flexibility has \ncreated a problem too obvious to ignore: not all deserving programs can \nbe funded; not all authorized programs can be fully implemented. We \nmust set priorities.\n  The Federal Research Investment Act applies a set of guiding \nprinciples, established by the Senate Science and Technology Caucus, to \nconsistently ask the appropriate questions about each competing \ntechnology program; to focus on that programs' effectiveness and \nappropriateness for federal funding; and to help us make the hard \nchoices about which programs deserve to be funded and which do not.\n  The Government plays a critical role in driving the innovation \nprocess in the United States. The majority of the federal government's \nbasic R is directed toward critical missions to serve the public \ninterest in areas including health, environmental pollution control, \nspace exploration, and national defense. Federal funds support nearly \n60 percent of the Nation's basic research, with a similar share \nperformed in colleges and universities.\n  The Senate passage of the Federal Research Investment Act reflects a \nconsensus that although basic research is the foundation for many \ninnovations, the rate of return to society generated by investments in \nR is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by \nthe performing institution.\n  This legislation sends a strong message to the academic and \nscientific community--Congress understands the value of pre-\ncompetitive, basis research and its impact on the national economy and \nthe standard of living.\n  I hope that the House will be as courageous as the Senate and embrace \nthis long-term funding strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10366-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10366-S10367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note today that the international \ncommunity had a successful first conference on reconstructing Kosovo \nand southeastern Europe. Nearly 40 leaders met in Sarajevo last \nweekend. The presence of most of these heads of state, including \nPresident Clinton's commendable appearance, demonstrates that the \ninternational community will not shirk from the responsibility of \nrebuilding Kosovo from the inhumane devastation visited upon it by the \nultranationalist brutes still in power in Belgrade.\n  The people of Kosovo have suffered nearly unspeakable brutality, and \nit is entirely appropriate that the international community--which \ninvested a great deal in forcing the Serbian military, paramilitary, \nand other gangsters out of Kosovo--now recognizes that long-term \nstability will not be created until immediate humanitarian needs, as \nwell as medium-term goals of building a functioning economy, \nestablishing institutions to devise and protect the rule of law, and \nejecting the ultranationalists in Belgrade, are met.\n  It is also appropriate, Mr. President, that the European powers \nshoulder the majority of this cost, as the U.S. shouldered the majority \nof Operation Allied Force.\n  When we look at the humanitarian response to the crisis in Kosovo, we \nmust note with appreciation the participation of nongovernmental \norganizations around the world who rushed to aid the Kosovar victims.\n  The American Red Cross, for example, has been involved in the Balkans \nsince 1993--more proof that Milosovic has been wreaking havoc in the \nregion for years.\n  Doctors Without Borders has been addressing a myriad of public health \nproblems and responding to injuries.\n  These are just two organizations who have responded to the \noverwhelming needs of these people.\n  Prominent among these groups were the aid organizations of most of \nthe world's religions.\n  Again, to name only a few, Catholic Relief Services just last week \nshipped more than 1400 metric tons of food. It has contributed other \nsupplies and volunteers as well. The Catholic Relief Services have also \ntaken on the project of rebuilding the schools.\n  Church World Services, the relief arm of a consortium of protestant \ndenominations, has shipped tents, food, bedding, and other supplies.\n  The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, affiliated with the \nUnited Jewish Appeal, in addition to food and shelter supplies, has \nactivitied its medical registry of volunteer doctors and nurses to \noperate clinics in the refugee areas of Albania and Macedonia.\n  And I would like to highlight the significant efforts by my own \nchurch, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  In my address to the assembled members of our church last April, \nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley said, ``At this moment, our hearts reach \nout to the suffering people of Kosovo.'' He set in motion our church's \nefforts to help relieve that suffering.\n  The Church's initial response to the crisis was timely. On Tuesday, \nApril 6, specific plans were approved to ship family food boxes on a \nchartered air cargo plane. That night, over 300 Church members in Salt \nLake City packed 3,000 boxes with food to feed a family of four for one \nto two weeks. On Wednesday, the food boxes were loaded on the cargo \nplane arriving in Macedonia on Friday. Refugee families began receiving \nthe food boxes on Saturday, April 10. A second chartered air cargo \nplane was sent to Macedonia two weeks later with 26,000 family hygiene \nkits, 14,000 pounds of soap and 600 additional food boxes.\n  Other shipments containing blankets, food, and clothing have been \ndistributed to refugees in Macedonia. Also, blankets, food,and clothing \nhave been consigned to the American Red Cross. More hygiene kits have \nbeen assembled by Latter-day Saints in Germany, England, California, \nand Utah for shipment to refugees in June. Student and teacher \neducational supply kits have been provided to refugee camps in \nMacedonia. Fresh fruits, vegetables and bread are being purchased \nlocally by the Church in Macedonia and Albania and distributed to \nrefugee camps and host families.\n  The Church has sent volunteer couples to Macedonia and Albania to \ncoordinate distribution of humanitarian assistance. A third volunteer \ncouple with experience in the helping professions will go to Albania \nfor 3-6 months to assist refugee and host families with social-\nemotional needs.\n  To date, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has provided \nthe following humanitarian aid to Kosovar refugees:\n  Food--133,000 pounds shipped, plus cash donations of $400,000 for \nlocal purchases;\n  Clothing and shoes--2 million pounds, soap--166,000 pounds, school \nkits and educational supplies--4,000 pounds;\n  Family hygiene kits--52,000, blankets--28,000; and\n  Cash contributions to the German Red Cross and the Mother Teresa \nSoceity--$110,000\n  Once all currently planned shipments are completed, the value of \nassistance rendered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \nwill total approximately $5.2 million. The Church stands ready to \nevaluate and respond to future needs as circumstances may require and \nresources allow.\n  The Mormon Church today has as many adherents overseas as there are \nin this country. It is a global church. Its presence abroad contributes \nto an awareness of the need for public health, literacy, and \ndevelopment in other nations. But, more than that, it contributes to a \ngreater understanding among nations and cultures.\n  The people of my state--not only LDS members--have always \ndemonstrated a willingness to pitch in where there is need. Their \ncontributions are obvious at home. But, we do not mention enough that \ntheir charitable spirit extends regularly to less fortunate people \naround the world.\n  While Utahans are fiscally conservative people and are not tolerant \nof the\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\nfinancial waste perpetrated in Washington, they are also generous \npeople. I am pleased to highlight their support for the Kosovar relief \neffort.\n  It is a tribute to America's generous spirit and sense of goodness \nthat all of these organizations have mobilized to assist people \nsuffering half a world away. There is no doubt that, despite the \noverwhelming challenge, these organization will collectively make the \ndifference in the lives of these displaced Kosovar refugees and will \nprovide hop for their future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10367-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Senator Kohl, as Senator Cochran read through the \namendments included in the Managers package of the FY2000 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill late last night, I noticed that an amendment I had \nfiled was not included. It had been my understanding that my amendment \nwould be accepted during the wrap-up on the Agriculture Appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. KOHL. I am aware of the Senator's amendment. Will the Senator \nplease describe his amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My amendment was a non-controversial sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that the U.S. Customs Service should, to the maximum \nextent practicable, conduct investigations into, and take such other \nactions as are necessary to prevent, the importation of ginseng \nproducts into the United States from foreign countries, including \nCanada and Asian countries, unless the importation is reported to the \nService, as required under Federal law. It merely asks that current law \nbe complied with.\n  Mr. KOHL. Your amendment, expressing the sense-of-the-Senate \nregarding ginseng, was inadvertently left off the list for the \nManager's amendment. However, it should be noted, that the amendment \nwas not excluded based on its substance, but only because of a \nregrettable omission.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator and ask his assistance in including \nmy ginseng amendment in the final conference report on the FY2000 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to assure Senator Feingold that I will work \ntoward inclusion of this provision in the conference report. The \nSenator is correct that there was no objection raised to his amendment \nand I will make that point clear to my fellow conferees.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would like to engage the Senators from Wisconsin in \nthis colloquy. Yesterday, when the Senate considered the Agriculture \nAppropriations Bill, I had offered three amendments regarding the \nConservation Reserve Program. It is my understanding that at least one \nof these amendments had been cleared for approval until just prior to \nfinal passage of the bill, and that the Ranking Member and Chairman had \nbeen giving consideration to the remaining two amendments. However, the \nDepartment of Agriculture had expressed concerns and objections were \nraised.\n  Mr. KOHL. That is correct. Will the Senator from Kansas describe his \namendments?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The first amendment regarding CRP cross compliance is to \naddress a problem we have had in Kansas. In many areas of the state, we \nhave old homesteads that have long been abandoned. As time has passed \nthese old homes have become dilapidated, rundown, and liability risks. \nMany producers want to remove these old homesteads and incorporate the \nland into their CRP land, conservation practices, or cropping \nrotations. But they are unable to do so due to CRP cross compliance \nrules. Under these rules, producers lose eligibility for CRP payments \nif they break Highly Erodible land (HEL) into production. Much of the \nland is considered HEL. Thus most of these homesteads sit on HEL land, \nand if they are removed, producers have violated the rules and lose \npayments. This does not seem to make sense and USDA agrees. USDA \ninformed me that they planned to recommend to the Congress the \nelimination of this program in the next Farm Bill.\n  The other two amendments involve notices regarding CRP Notices 327 \nand 338 issued by the Farm Service agency last fall and this spring.\n  CRP Notice-327 issued by the Farm Service Agency prohibits the use of \nCRP land for hunting preserves. The notice does not prohibit land \nowners from leasing hunting rights or charging access fees to hunters. \nHowever, it does prohibit hunting preserves. This notice overturns a \npractice that has been allowed in many areas since the inception of the \nCRP program. In fact, these hunting preserves operate from the Kansas \nand Oklahoma areas to the Dakotas. These preserves are strongly \nregulated in Kansas and they have resulted in an important economic \ndevelopment activity for many rural areas. In Kansas, we have 112 \ntracts of land designated for use as hunting preserves. 36 of these \ntracts are in counties designated by USDA as eligible to apply for \nRound II Rural Empowerment zones under the criteria established by \nUSDA. Basically, to qualify under this criteria, a county must have \nlost 15 percent or more of its population between 1980 and 1994. These \npopulation losses represent a significant erosion of the economic base \nof these rural areas. Disallowing these hunting preserves would \nrepresent a loss of tourism dollars and an economic hit that many of \nthese counties simply cannot afford to take.\n  CRP Notice 338 prohibits the planting of grass strips on terrace tops \nfor enrollment in the continuous CRP. The notice prohibits the \nenrollment of grass strips located on the tops of terraces--where \nerosion is most likely to take place--but allows the enrollment of \nstrips planted between terraces--where crops can actually be grown. \nStrips planted on terraces provide important environmental functions by \nreducing both wind and water erosion. Grass strips help to prevent the \nbreakage of terraces that sometimes occurs during torrential rains and \nthey provide important habitat for wildlife. Fifteen groups in Kansas \nranging from the State Secretary of Agriculture to the Kansas Audubon \nSociety have asked Secretary Glickman to reverse this ruling. USDA's \nactions seem directly aimed at a recent brochure prepared by these 15 \nKansas organizations that explains how landowners can use these grass \nstrips to improve environmental and wildlife benefits. This amendment \ntries to return some aspect of local control to these decisions.\n  I thank the ranking member for taking another look at these \namendments, and I would ask the Ranking Member's assurance that he will \nwork with his Chairman and House counterparts to address my amendments \non the Conservation Reserve Program in conference as well.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to assure the Senator from Kansas that I will \nwork with Senator Cochran, Chairman of the Subcommittee, to make all \nmembers of the conference committee aware of the objectives of these \nthree amendments. The Senator also has my assurance that I hope we can \novercome any remaining objections to his amendment relating to CRP \ncross compliance. Further, I would like the Senator to know that I will \ncontinue discussions with all parties regarding his other two \namendments to see if it will be possible to give them favorable \nconsideration during conference committee action.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Ranking Member for his assistance and all \nhis work on the bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to echo that sentiment and also thank \nSenator Kohl for his assistance and all his work on this very important \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10367-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10367-S10368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CBO COST ESTIMATE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1330, a bill to \n     give the city of Mesquite, Nevada, the right to purchase at \n     fair market value certain parcels of public land in the city.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Victoria \n     Heid Hall (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-\n     2860, and Marjorie Miller (for the state and local impact), \n     who can be reached at 225-3220.\n     Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B. Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     S. 1330--A bill to give the city of Mesquite, Nevada, the \n         right to purchase at fair market value certain parcels of \n         public land in the city\n       S. 1330 provides for the conveyance of up to about 8,000 \n     acres of federal land to the city of Mesquite, Nevada. \n     Because S. 1330 would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply to the bill. CBO estimates that \n     enacting this bill would increase direct spending by about \n     $500,000 over the 2000-2004 period. S. 1330 contains no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would have \n     no significant impact on the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments, other than the city of Mesquite, Nevada, \n     which would benefit from its enactment.\n       S. 1330 would give the city of Mesquite, Nevada, the \n     exclusive right to purchase specified parcels of federal land \n     over the next 12 years. According to the Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) and the city of Mesquite, these parcels \n     comprise roughly 5,300 acres, depending on the outcome of \n     final surveys. The city would pay fair market value for the \n     acreage. Proceeds from the sale would be deposited in the \n     special account established under the Southern Nevada Public \n     Land Management Act of 1998 (SNPLM), out of which the \n     Secretary of the Interior may expend funds for land \n     acquisitions and other projects in the state of Nevada. Under \n     current law, BLM has no plans to sell the property. Based on \n     information from BLM and the city of Mesquite, we estimate \n     that these sales would result in additional federal receipts \n     of roughly $6 million over the 2000-2004 period and \n     subsequent spending of the same amount. Payments by the city \n     could be in one lump sum or over several years, which could \n     affect the total receipts from the sales. The funds deposited \n     in the SNPLM special account earn interest, which the \n     Secretary can spend. Because a lag between the deposit and \n     spending of sale proceeds is likely, we expect that enacting \n     S. 1350 would result in a net increase in direct spending \n     from the interest. Assuming all the acreage is sold to the \n     city in 2001, we estimate a net increase in direct spending \n     totaling about $500,000 over the 2000-2004 period. Estimated \n     annual budgetary effects are shown in the following table.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal years in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 1999   2000   2001   2002   2003   2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING (including offsetting receipts)\n \nEstimated Budget Authority....      0     -4      2      2      1      0\nEstimated Outlays.............      0     -4      2      2      1      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In addition, S. 1330 provides that within one year of \n     enactment the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to the \n     city of Mesquite up to 2,560 acres of federal land to be \n     selected by the city from parcels described in the bill. The \n     land would be used to develop a new commercial airport. The \n     bill requires that the conveyance be in accordance with 49 \n     U.S.C. 47125, which permits the Secretary of Transportation \n     to request that a federal agency convey land or airspace to a \n     public agency sponsoring a project such as a new airport. The \n     statute specifies that such conveyances be made only on the \n     condition that the federal government retain a reversionary \n     interest if the land is not used for an airport. Since BLM \n     has no plans to sell the property under current law, \n     conveying the property at no cost to the city would have no \n     net impact on receipts relative to current law.\n       S. 1330 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in UMRA. The city of Mesquite would benefit from enactment of \n     this legislation, which would allow it to obtain needed \n     parcels of land BLM would convey some of this land at no \n     cost. The conveyances would be voluntary on the part of the \n     city, as would any amounts spent by the city to purchase or \n     develop the land. The bill would have no significant impact \n     on the budgets of other local governments, or on state or \n     tribal governments.\n       The CBO staff contacts are Victoria Heid Hall (for federal \n     costs), who can be reached at 226-2860, and Marjorie Miller \n     (for the state and local impact), who can be reached at 225-\n     3220. This estimate was approved by Robert A. Sunshine, \n     Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10368-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10368-S10372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to highlight an issue of growing \nconcern, namely funding for the U.S. chemical demilitarization program. \nMy concern is that the Congress has been cutting the funding required \nto eliminate our stockpile of chemical weapons and agents, despite the \nfact that we have a treaty commitment under the Chemical Weapons \nConvention to destroy that stockpile by April 24, 2007.\n  Simply put, if we in Congress do not provide the funds needed to meet \nthat treaty commitment in time, we will be forcing the United States to \nviolate an arms control treaty that we in the Senate approved with our \nvote of advise and consent to ratification.\n  Mr. President, this is a trend we should not be continuing. In fact, \nwe should be providing the funds needed to ensure that the United \nStates can and does meet its treaty obligations for all treaties to \nwhich we are an adherent, including the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Given the Senate's unique constitutional role in providing advice and \nconsent to the ratification of treaties, I would hope this proposition \nwould be self-evident to all our colleagues. Nonetheless, Mr. \nPresident, the Conference Report on the Military Construction \nAppropriations Bill, H.R. 2465, contains significant reductions from \nthe funding requested for military construction of chemical \ndemilitarization facilities needed to meet our treaty obligations.\n  The program is cut by $93 million dollars in fiscal year 2000 funds, \nincluding a reduction of $15 million dollars for planning and design \nwork. This appears to be a technical mistake, Mr. President, since the \nbudget request did not contain any funds for planning and design in the \nmilitary construction projects for chemical demilitarization. This is \ndeeply disappointing since neither appropriations subcommittee had \nreduced the military construction funding in their respective bills. On \nthe contrary, each subcommittee had provided full funding of the budget \nrequest for military construction for the chemical demilitarization \nprogram. The conference, however, chose to ignore that and cut funding.\n  If, as I suspect, those funding reductions would jeopardize our \nability to meet our CWC treaty obligations, I hope the Defense \nDepartment will take some remedial action, such as a reprogramming or a \nsupplemental request to ensure that the necessary funds are available \nto do the work needed to ensure that we remain compliant with the \ntreaty. I also hope that the Defense Appropriations Conference will \nprovide the necessary funding for this program since there are \nreductions made by both House and Senate subcommittees that I believe \nare not warranted, and are based on incomplete information.\n  Mr. President, there was a preliminary assessment conducted by the \nDefense Department's Comptroller office earlier this year that looked \nat the rate of obligations and disbursements for the chemical \ndemilitarization program. Unfortunately, before that assessment was \ncompleted, an internal DoD memorandum was leaked with preliminary and \nincomplete information. That internal memo was the basis for much \nconcern among various congressional committees. The problem is that \nsome of the Committees acted on the basis of that incomplete \ninformation, and it is now clear that the preliminary information was \nincorrect. Consequently, Congress cut funds for the chemical \ndemilitarization program based on faulty information.\n  Since that internal memo was leaked, Congress has been looking into \nthe financial management of the chemical demilitarization program, and \nwe have been provided with more complete and accurate information. This \ninformation makes it clear that we should not be cutting the program \nfunding based on the earlier information.\n  The Armed Services Committee, on which I serve as the Ranking Member \nof the Emerging Threats subcommittee that has responsibility for this \nprogram, asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a preliminary \nreview of the financial management of the program. Their conclusion was \nthat the funds requested are all needed and that there are plans for \nspending them at a reasonable rate. In other words, Mr. President, the \nworries about slow obligation or expenditure rates are not justified, \nand there is a good explanation for why the funds are obligated and \nexpended at their current pace. In my\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\nview, this means that Congress should not be cutting the funds based on \nthe incorrect information, but should provide the needed funding.\n  The General Accounting Office sent the results of their preliminary \nreview to the Armed Services Committee in a letter dated July 29, 1999, \nand I will ask unanimous consent that the letter be included in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks. In addition, Mr. President, the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Department of Defense conducted a \nthorough review of the funding status of the chemical demilitarization \nprogram to review unobligated and unexpended balances. The results of \nthat review have recently been submitted to Congress. That review \nindicates that about $88 million dollars could conceivably be deferred \nuntil next fiscal year, but that such a deferral would entail risks to \nour ability to meet the CWC deadline, and ``should only be made after \nserious consideration.''\n  In other words, Mr. President, the Defense Department Comptroller's \noffice did not find the kinds of problems that had been suggested by \nthe earlier preliminary internal review, and did not find excess funds \nsuggested by that partial review. The review noted that ``without \nexception, the budgeted funds are needed to satisfy valid chemical \ndemilitarization requirements. Should any funds be removed from FY \n2000, the funds will need to be added back in the future budget.''\n  The Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Hamre, sent a letter to the \ncongressional defense committees dated August 3, 1999, in which he \nexplains the review and includes the executive summary of the \nComptroller report. I will ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of \nmy remarks that Secretary Hamre's letter and the enclosure be included \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, the only conclusion I can draw from this is that \nCongress should not cut the funding for chemical demilitarization to \nthe extent the Appropriations Committees did on the basis of the \npreliminary and partial information contained in the leaked internal \nmemo. Instead, the Congress should work with the Defense Department to \ndetermine the correct level of funding needed to comply with the treaty \nand provide it.\n  Furthermore, since the completion of the Comptroller's review, the \nDefense Department has agreed to conduct an evaluation of three \nadditional alternative technologies for chemical demilitarization, as \nsought in the Senate Military Construction Appropriations bill. This \nevaluation alone will cost some $40 million in FY 2000 funds, so that \nmeans that there is even less money that can be considered for \ndeferral.\n  Mr. President, I addressed the Senate on the issue of the chemical \ndemilitarization program when the Military Construction Appropriations \nbill, S. 1205, was before the Senate in June. At that time, I expressed \nmy concern that the Senate bill had restrictions that could jeopardize \nour ability to meet the CWC deadline. I am glad to say that since then, \nthe Defense Department has reached an understanding with the \nAppropriations Committee on a plan to evaluate the three additional \nalternative technologies without blocking or delaying construction \nactivity. I am pleased to see this agreement and I commend all those \nwho helped to achieve it, particularly the senior Senator from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. President, I know we take our treaty responsibilities very \nseriously here whenever a treaty is sent to the Senate for advice and \nconsent to ratification. I know that was the case when the Chemical \nWeapons Convention was approved by more than three-quarters of the \nSenate. I hope we will take as seriously our obligation to provide the \nfunds necessary to meet our treaty obligations. In this case, that \nmeans providing necessary funds for the chemical demilitarization \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the documents I \nreferred to previously, be included in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You are aware, I am sure, of the \n     extensive efforts we have been taking to destroy all of our \n     chemical weapons by April 29, 2007, the date that ensures \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Our \n     Chemical Demilitarization program, however, has suffered from \n     a lack of programmatic and technical stability.\n       One result of this instability has been that funds were not \n     used at the rate anticipated at the time budgets were \n     prepared, causing an unexpended balance to accrue. A \n     preliminary review of the current status of this balance was \n     made earlier this year. This assessment indicated the need \n     for a more detailed review, and as a result, the Office of \n     the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) recently \n     conducted a thorough analysis of the unexpended balances.\n       Enclosed is the Executive Summary of the resulting report, \n     the full details of which have been provided to your staff. \n     At the bottom line, the report indicates that about $88 \n     million could be deferred from the FY 2000 budget to the FY \n     2001 budget. This action, however, would eliminate some of \n     the program manager's ability to make necessary program \n     adjustments without jeopardizing CWC compliance.\n       Since the completion of the report, we have agreed to \n     conduct evaluations of the remaining alternative technologies \n     for destruction of chemical weapons. This effort will require \n     an additional $40 million in FY 2000, reducing to about $48 \n     million the amount that could be deferred to FY 2001.\n       I am sure you share my concern about meeting the deadline \n     for completing destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile, \n     and ask that you carefully consider this report as you \n     complete action on the FY 2000 budget.\n       A similar letter is being sent to the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the other Defense Oversight Committees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John J. Hamre.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Chemical Demilitarization (Chem Demil) program includes \n     both an acquisition and an operational component with the \n     goal of destroying a variety of chemical warfare agents \n     residing in weapons (all-up-rounds), storage containers, and \n     at production and storage facilities.\n       The program's schedule and funding has been driven by the \n     requirement to eliminate the existing stockpile and \n     associated components within the framework of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (CWC) treaty. The treaty stipulates that \n     all stockpiled agents must be destroyed by April 29, 2007.\n       The Chem Demil program has suffered from a lack of \n     programmatic and technical stability, in part due to \n     continuing concern and skepticism about the safety of the \n     incineration process used by the Army to destroy the chemical \n     agents.\n       As a result, the program office has regularly requested \n     schedule and funding realignments.\n       Two of the nine planned destruction facilities are \n     operational. Fourteen percent of the stockpiled chemical \n     agents have been destroyed as of June 23, 1999. At this time, \n     no firm plan or decision regarding nonstockpiled buried \n     chemical agents has been made. Furthermore, the final \n     disposition of the destruction facilities has yet to be \n     approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n       There is considerable schedule and cost risk with the \n     Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment Program at both the \n     Pueblo, Colorado and Blue Grass, Kentucky facilities. The \n     technology to be used to dispose of the chemical agents has \n     not been determined. Three technical proposals for \n     alternative disposal methods have been demonstrated to the \n     program office. Evaluation of the technologies by the \n     government is currently ongoing.\n       Information provided by the Department of the Army and the \n     Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) indicated that \n     as of February 1999, approximately $1 billion of current and \n     prior year Operation and Maintenance (O), Procurement, and \n     Research Development, Testing & Evaluation (RDT) funds were \n     unexpended. A preliminary review of the cause of the large \n     unexpended balances was conducted in February 1999, which \n     suggested a need for a more detailed review.\n       The current review is based on more complete program \n     execution data (through May 30th) and provides a more \n     accurate assessment of the reasons for the large unexpended \n     balances. Out of the $3.2 billion appropriated between FY \n     1993 and FY 1999, $845.6 million (26 percent) remain \n     unexpended. However, a detailed evaluation of the program \n     execution history indicates that the low expenditure rates \n     for the most part have been beyond the influence and control \n     of the program office.\n       Neither review uncovered an instance involving inadequate \n     program management controls, or gross violation of \n     departmental financial regulations.\n       In this review, the cause of the under execution of the \n     prior and current year program has been categorized into \n     seven causes:\n\n                          [Dollars in millions]\n \n                                                              Percentage\n                                                               of amount\n                                                              unexpended\n \nForward Financing................................       $5.8           1\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\n \nAccounting Recording Lag.........................        120  ..........\nAdministrative/In Progress.......................      224.7          44\nFEMA/State Processing............................       26.8  ..........\nAwaiting Permit Issuance.........................      331.7  ..........\nTechnical Restructure Delay......................       41.1          55\nContracting Delays...............................       95.5  ..........\n \n\n       The majority of the unexpended balance was budgeted to meet \n     schedules that seemed reasonable when the budget was built. \n     Fully 44 percent of the balance is associated with work that \n     either has occurred for which the payment has not been \n     recorded or work that is yet to occur but is on its planned \n     schedule. None of these funds should be considered for \n     deferral.\n       Only 1 percent is associated with classical forward \n     financing and should be considered for deferral.\n       The balance of unexpended funds reflect contracting \n     regulatory or technical delays that were largely beyond the \n     control of the program manager. The paper carefully reviews \n     each of these by site. It accepts the contractor's estimate \n     of the cost of work to be performed during FY 2000, because \n     the contractor is in the best position to judge what can be \n     accomplished in FY 2000 and he must be encouraged to \n     accomplish as much as possible if the Department is to \n     achieve the treaty compliance date. The paper then evaluates \n     remaining unexpended balances using a standard established in \n     prior execution reviews.\n       As one reviews this program, the overriding concern is that \n     the Department do everything in its power to achieve the \n     legislated target date of April 29, 2007, for completion of \n     chemical agent destruction. While this analysis indicates \n     that $87.9 million may be deferrable into FY 2001, such a \n     deferral should only be made after serious consideration \n     because it will take away some of the program manager's \n     ability to take additional steps to meet the treaty \n     compliance date.\n       It should also be noted that without exception the budgeted \n     funds are needed to satisfy valid chemical demilitarization \n     requirements. Should any funds be removed from FY 2000, the \n     funds will need to be added back in a future budget.\n\n\n                 events since completion of the report\n\n       The Department has agreed to conduct evaluations of the \n     three additional alternative technologies (Assembled Chemical \n     Weapons Assessment Program). This will require an additional \n     $40.0 million in FY 2000 and could be financed with funds \n     considered for deferral in this report, which would reduce \n     the total to be considered for deferral from $87.9 million to \n     $47.9 million.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                           GAO\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1999.\n     Subject: Chemical Demilitarization: Funding Status of the \n         Chemical Demilitarization Program.\n\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman.\n\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member,\n     Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate.\n       Since the late 1980's, the Department of Defense (DOD) has \n     been actively pursuing a program to destroy the U.S. \n     stockpile of obsolete chemical agents and munitions. DOD has \n     reported that this program, known as the Chemical \n     Demilitarization Program, is estimated to cost $15 billion \n     through 2007; approximately $6.2 billion has been \n     appropriated for the program from fiscal year 1988 through \n     fiscal year 1999. Because of the lethality of chemical \n     weapons and environmental concerns associated with proposed \n     disposal methods, the program has been controversial from the \n     beginning and has experienced delays, cost increases, and \n     management weaknesses.\n       The Chemical Demilitarization Program is funded through \n     operation and maintenance (O), procurement, research and \n     development (R), and military construction appropriations, \n     with each being available for use for varying periods of \n     time.\\1\\ Concerns were recently raised within DOD that the \n     program had built up significant levels of funding in excess \n     of spending plans. This led to concerns that the program's \n     fiscal year 2000 budget request might be overstating funding \n     requirements. As requested, we reviewed the extent to which \n     the program retains significant levels of prior years' \n     appropriations in excess of spending plans. Accordingly, this \n     report summarizes the results of a briefing we provided to \n     your office on July 23, 1999, in which we reported our \n     preliminary findings concerning (1) amounts of reported \n     unallocated appropriations and unliquidated obligations from \n     prior years' appropriations, (2) the extent to which more \n     obligations have been liquidated than previously reported, \n     (3) primary reasons for the reported unliquidated \n     obligations, and (4) actions that have affected or will \n     affect unliquidated obligations.\\2\\ We except to analyze the \n     program more extensively in a more detailed review. As part \n     of that review, we will examine program costs, spending \n     plans, schedules, and other management issues.\n\n\n                            results in brief\n\n       For the selected Chemical Demilitarization Program \n     appropriation accounts reviewed, we did not find sizable \n     amounts of unallocated appropriations and unliquidated \n     obligations from prior years that appear to be available for \n     other uses. There were sizable unliquidated obligations \n     reported from prior years. However, based on our review of \n     $382.1 million (62.6 percent) of the reported $610.5 million \n     in unliquidated obligations from the Chemical \n     Demilitarization Program for fiscal years 1992-98, we found \n     that $150.6 million (39.4 percent of the sample) had already \n     been liquidated but not recorded in Defense Finance and \n     Accounting Service (DFAS) budget execution reports. Further, \n     the remaining $231.5 million in unliquidated obligations in \n     our sample was scheduled to be liquidated by November 2000. \n     Reported unliquidated obligations were caused by a number of \n     factors such as delays in obtaining environmental permits and \n     technical delays. At the same time, we identified a number of \n     factors that have affected or will have the effect of \n     reducing previously identified unliquidated obligations. The \n     program has a reported $155.7 million in appropriations not \n     yet allocated or obligated to specific program areas. \n     However, nearly this entire amount ($145.2 million) involves \n     current year appropriations that can obligated and liquidated \n     over several years.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       In 1985, the Congress passed Public Law 99-145 directing \n     the Army to destroy the U.S. stockpile of obsolete chemical \n     agents and munitions. On April 25, 1997, the United States \n     ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international \n     treaty banning the development, production, stockpiling, and \n     use of chemical weapons. The Convention commits member \n     nations to dispose of (1) unitary chemical weapons stockpile, \n     binary chemical weapons, recovered chemical weapons, and \n     former chemical weapon production facilities by April 29, \n     2007, and (2) miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel by \n     April 29, 2002.\\3\\\n       To comply with congressional direction and meet the mandate \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Army established the \n     Chemical Demilitarization Program and developed a plan to \n     incinerate the agents and munitions on site in specially \n     designed facilities. The Program Manager for Chemical \n     Demilitarization in the Edgewood area of Aberdeen Proving \n     Ground, Maryland, manages the daily operations of the \n     program. The Army currently projects this program will cost \n     $15 billion to implement through 2007; approximately $6.2 \n     billion had been appropriated from 1988 through fiscal year \n     1999.\\4\\\n       Since its beginning, the Chemical Demilitarization Program \n     has been beset by controversy over disposal methods; delays \n     in obtaining needed federal, state, and local environmental \n     permits and other approvals; and increasing costs. We have \n     previously reported on these problems as well as problems \n     with management weaknesses in the program and disagreements \n     over the respective roles and responsibilities among federal, \n     state, and local entities associated with the program. For \n     example, in 1995, we reported that program officials lacked \n     accurate financial information to identify how funds were \n     spent and ensure that program goals were achieved.\\5\\ A \n     list of related GAO products is included at the end of \n     this report.\n       Concerns over chemical demilitarization financial \n     management issues surfaced again in February 1999, following \n     a quick program review summarized in internal memorandums \n     prepared by an official in the Office of the DOD Comptroller. \n     The memorandums suggested that significant portions of prior \n     years' O, procurement, and R appropriations obligated by \n     specific Military Inter-departmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) \n     \\6\\ remained unliquidated, and could be deobligated and \n     reprogrammed for other uses.\n\n\n       Funding Balances for the Chemical Demilitarization Program\n\n       The Chemical Demilitarization Program budget reports showed \n     $155.7 million in current and prior years' appropriations not \n     yet allocated ($107.1 million) or obligated ($48.6 million) \n     to specific program areas. Nearly this entire amount ($145.2 \n     million) is in current year appropriations. Also, the program \n     currently has approximately $1 billion in unliquidated \n     obligations, of which about 61 percent or $610.5 million are \n     associated with prior years' appropriations for fiscal years \n     1992-98.\n       To identify the amounts of unallocated appropriations and \n     unliquidated obligations from prior years, we collected \n     official DFAS budget execution data for the Chemical \n     Demilitarization Program. DFAS is responsible for providing \n     the program office and other DOD organizations' financial and \n     accounting services and information. Table 1 lists the \n     reported budget authority and the unallocated unobligated, \n     and obligated appropriations, along with unliquidated \n     balances for selected appropriations for the Chemical \n     Demilitarization Programs as of May 31, 1999. Budget \n     authority allows agencies to enter into financial obligations \n     that will result in immediate or future outlays of funds.\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\n\n\n   TABLE 1.--REPORTED BUDGET AUTHORITY AND UNALLOCATED, UNOBLIGATED, OBLIGATED, AND UNLIQUIDATED BALANCES FOR\n             SELECTED APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION PROGRAM (AS OF MAY 31, 1999)\n                                              [Dollars in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Budget                                                       Unliquidated\nFiscal year and funding category     authority      Unallocated     Unobligated      Obligated      obligations\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1992-98.........................        $3,170.2           $10.3            $0.2         $3159.5          $610.5\n                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Operation and Maintenance...         1,821.8             8.9               0         1,812.5           135.8\n    Procurement.................         1,119.6             1.3             0.2         1,118.3           444.7\n    Research and Development....           228.8             0.1               0           228.7            30.0\n                                 ===============================================================================\n1999............................          $666.8           $96.8           $48.4          $521.6          $393.0\n                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Operation and Maintenance...           428.3            17.2            23.5           387.6           263.1\n    Procurement.................           100.3            57.5             2.8            40.0            39.9\n    Research and Development....           138.2            22.1            22.1            94.0            90.0\n                                 ===============================================================================\n      Total.....................        $3,837.0          $107.1           $48.6        $3,681.1        $1,003.5\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote 1.--The Chemical Demilitarization Program had a reported $3.2 billion in budget authority for fiscal years\n  1992-98 and $666.8 million in budget authority in fiscal year 1999. The budget authority for fiscal years 1992\n  and 1993 O funds and fiscal year 1992 R funds are not included in the table because these funds have been\n  canceled. In addition, the table does not include military construction funds because these funds were not\n  included in this review.\nNote 2.--Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a fixed appropriation account is generally available for\n  adjusting and liquidating obligations properly chargeable to the account for 5 years following its period of\n  availability for obligation.

Returned funds include those amounts that were \n     returned to the program office from projects that were \n     terminated or completed for less than the obligated amount. \n     Most of the unallocated funds are no longer available for \n     obligation because their periods of availability for \n     obligation have lapsed. In addition, the program office's \n     unobligated balance for fiscal years 1992-98 was reported to \n     be approximately $200,000. At the same time, the program \n     reported $610.5 million in unliquidated obligations from \n     fiscal years 1992-98.\n       In addition, as shown in table 1, the program office had a \n     reported $96.8 million in unallocated and $48.4 million \n     unobligated appropriations, and $393 million in unliquidated \n     obligations in fiscal year 1999 funds. However, it is \n     important to note that the R and procurement, but not O \n     funds, will still be available for obligation for the \n     remainder of this year and 1 or 2 more future years; and the \n     obligations of all three appropriations may be liquidated for \n     several more years beyond that.\n\n\n    more fiscal years 1992-98 obligations have been liquidated than \n                                reported\n\n       For our preliminary review, we focused our analysis on the \n     status of the unliquidated obligations for fiscal years 1992-\n     98. Based on our review of 28 MIPRs with $382.1 million in \n     unliquidated obligations (or 62.6 percent of the total \n     reported unliquidated obligations), we found that $150.6 \n     million (39.4 percent) had been liquidated.\\7\\ The remaining \n     $231.5 million (60.6 percent) of the reported $382.1 million \n     in unliquidated obligations is scheduled to be liquidated \n     between August 1999 and February 2000 (see table 2).\n\n          TABLE 2.--ADJUSTED UNLIQUIDATED OBLIGATIONS FOR 28 MIPRS (AS OF JULY 7 THROUGH JULY 14, 1999)\n                                              [Dollars in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  Liquidated funds        Adjusted unliquidated\n                                  Number of      Reported    --------------------------        obligations\n       Category of funds          MIPRs GAO    unliquidated                            -------------------------\n                                   reviewed     obligations      Amount      Percent       Amount      Percent\n----------------------------------------------------\\1\\---------------------------------------------------------\nOperation and Maintenance......            8          $79.3         $66.9         84.4        $12.4         15.6\nProcurement....................           16          283.2          74.1         26.2        209.1         73.8\nResearch and Development.......            4           19.6           9.6         49.0         10.0         51.0\n                                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total....................           28         $382.1        $150.6         39.4       $231.5         60.6\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Reported as of May 31, 1999, by DFAS.\n \nNote 1.--The MIPRs were for fiscal years 1992-98 funds.\nNote 2.--Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a fixed appropriation account is generally available for\n  adjusting and liquidating obligations properly chargeable to the account for 5 years following its period of\n  availability for obligation. At the end of this 5-year period, the account is closed and all balances are\n  permanently canceled. O appropriations are available for obligation for 1 year, R appropriations are\n  available for obligation for 2 years, and procurement appropriations are available for obligation for 3 years.\n \nSource: DFAS data provided by the program office.\n\n       As shown in table 2, we reviewed eight MIPRs that included \n     a reported $79.3 million in unliquidated O obligations. Of \n     this amount, $55.2 million was allocated to the FEMA for the \n     Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP). \n     According to FEMA officials and supporting documentation, the \n     total amount has been liquidated but was not timely reported \n     to the program office for input to the finance service \n     records. In addition, another $11.7 million of the reported \n     $79.3 million in unliquidated O obligations has been \n     liquidated by the program office and its contractors. The \n     remaining $12.4 million of the $79.3 million amount is \n     scheduled to be liquidated between now and February 2000.\n       In addition,, as shown in table 2, we reviewed 16 MIPRs \n     that included a reported $283.2 million in unliquidated \n     procurement obligations. Of this amount, $54.2 million was \n     allocated to FEMA for CSEPP projects. According to FEMA \n     officials and supporting documentation, $40.5 million of the \n     $54.2 million in CSEPP obligations has been liquidated but \n     not reported to the program office in time for input to the \n     finance service records. The remaining $13.7 million is still \n     unliquidated but allocated to Alabama for its CSEPP projects. \n     In addition, another $33.6 million of the reported $283.2 \n     million in unliquidated procurement obligations has been \n     liquidated by the program office and its contractors by May \n     31, 1999, and the remaining $209.1 million is scheduled to be \n     liquidated between now and November 2000.\n       We also reviewed four MIPRs that included a reported $19.6 \n     million in unliquidated R obligations. Of this amount, the \n     program office and its contractors have liquidated $9.6 \n     million. The remaining $10 million is scheduled to be \n     liquidated between now and September 2000. Our preliminary \n     review of the budget execution reports and MIPRs shows no \n     indication that the program office obligated the same funds \n     to separate projects and contracts in order to reduce its \n     unobligated balances. We plan to complete a more extensive \n     analysis of the potential for such double obligations as part \n     of our future review discussed previously.\n\n\n            PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE UNLIQUIDATED OBLIGATIONS\n\n       We identified a variety of reasons for the reported \n     unliquidated obligation balances. Most included procedural \n     delays associated with reporting financial transactions to \n     the finance service. More specifically, they included:\n       Accounting and procedural delays: According to DOD and Army \n     officials, it can take from 90 to 120 days to process and \n     report liquidation data before liquidations are included in \n     the finance service budget execution data and reports. For \n     example, the program office's projects are large enough to \n     include a primary contractor and several subcontractors. \n     Primary contractors may take several weeks to validate, \n     process, and report liquidation actions by their \n     subcontractors to the program office, which also has its own \n     processes and procedures before reporting to the finance \n     service. Furthermore, the finance service requires time to \n     input and report its liquidation data to responsible DOD and \n     Army officials.\n       Army and FEMA accounting and procedural delays for CSEPP \n     funds: On the basis of our MIPR sample, CSEPP liquidations \n     were included in the finance service data because FEMA had \n     not reported liquidation actions in a timely manner to the \n     program office.\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\n       Environmental permit delays: Program officials found that \n     estimating the time required to obtain environmental permit \n     approvals was much more difficult than expected. For example, \n     permits to construct the Umatilla, Anniston, and Pine Bluff \n     chemical demilitarization facilities took 2 to 3 years more \n     than the program office anticipated. Although funds were \n     obligated for these projects, the program office could not \n     liquidate the obligations until after the respective state \n     approved the construction permit and the demilitarization \n     facilities were constructed.\n       Technical delays: According to program officials, lessons \n     learned from ongoing demilitarization operations at Johnston \n     Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and Tooele, Utah, resulted in \n     technical and design changes for future facilities that \n     required additional time and resources. While these changes \n     were being incorporated, liquidation of obligated funds \n     proved to be slower than program officials expected.\n\n\n   actions that have affected or will affect unliquidated obligations\n\n       Several factors have affected or will affect the program \n     office's unliquidated obligations. First, in fiscal year \n     1999, the Congress reduced the administration's budget \n     request for the Chemical Demilitarization Program by $75.1 \n     million. Consequently, there were fewer funds to obligate \n     during fiscal year 1999 than planned for the program. A \n     factor that should reduce unliquidated obligations is the \n     1997 approval of environmental permits for the construction \n     of the Umatilla, Oregon, and Anniston, Alabama, chemical \n     demilitarization facilities. The construction of these \n     facilities should allow the program office to liquidate \n     unliquidated procurement obligations for these locations. In \n     addition, the environmental permits were approved in 1999 for \n     the construction of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Aberdeen, \n     Maryland, chemical demilitarization facilities, which should \n     allow the program office to liquidate unliquidated \n     procurement obligations for these locations. At the same \n     time, program officials expect additional procurement costs \n     at the Umatilla and Anniston disposal sites due to design and \n     technical changes to previously purchased equipment.\n\n\n                   agency comments and our evaluation\n\n       We provided a draft copy of this report to DOD and the Army \n     for comment. Responsible officials stated that they did not \n     have sufficient time to formally review and comment on the \n     report. However, we were provided with various technical \n     comments which were used in finalizing the report.\n\n\n                         scope and methodology\n\n       To assess the unobligated appropriations and unliquidated \n     obligations for the Chemical Demilitarization Program, we \n     interviewed and obtained data from DOD, Army, and FEMA \n     officials, including officials from the Program Manager for \n     Chemical Demilitarization Program in the Edgewood area of \n     Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Office of the United \n     Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army, Chemical Demilitarization; Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army for Financial Management; Army Audit \n     Agency; and Office of Management and Budget. We reviewed DFAS \n     reported budget execution data for selected appropriations \n     for chemical demilitarization program budget authority, \n     unallocated, unobligated, and unliquidated balances for \n     fiscal years 1992-99. We did not attempt to reconcile budget \n     execution data with DOD's financial statements.\\8\\ In \n     addition, we interviewed DOD and Army officials to discuss \n     the (1) requirements for these funds, (2) primary causes for \n     the unliquidated obligations, and (3) actions that have \n     affected or will affect unliquidated obligations.\n       Because most unallocated appropriations are no longer \n     available for obligations, unobligated balances are \n     relatively small compared to the budget authority and fiscal \n     year 1999 funds are still available for obligation and \n     liquidation for several years, we focused our analysis on \n     the status of the unliquidated obligations for fiscal \n     years 1992-98. We judgmentally selected and reviewed 28 of \n     the program's 63 MIPRs with reported unliquidated \n     obligations of more than $1 million to (1) verify the \n     reported unliquidated obligation, and (2) identify \n     specific requirements and time frames for liquidating the \n     obligations. To verify the reported unliquidated \n     obligations, we interviewed responsible program officials \n     and reviewed supporting documentation from the Army and \n     its contractors and compared these data with the \n     unliquidated obligations reported in DFAS budget execution \n     reports. On the basis of this comparison, we determined \n     the extent to which more obligations have been liquidated \n     than previously reported by the finance service. These \n     liquidated obligations were deducted from the reported \n     unliquidated obligations to determine the revised \n     unliquidated amount. In addition, we interviewed \n     responsible program officials and reviewed supporting \n     documentation from the Army and its contractors to \n     determine the schedules for liquidating the remaining \n     unliquidated obligations.\n       We conducted our review from July 6 to July 26, 1999, in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards. We are continuing our review of the Chemical \n     Demilitarization Program.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to a program that, I think, deserves to be \ncommended. It is called ``Fight for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against \nViolence.'' The purpose of the program is to give our nation's youth \ninformation and advice on how to cope with the epidemic of violence \nthat is taking so many of their own.\n  The Departments of Justice, and Education are participants in the \ncampaign, but what I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to is \nthe role of MTV music television and the Recording Industry Association \nof America.\n  The most basic and profound responsibility that our culture--any \nculture--has, is raising its children. We are failing that \nresponsibility, and the extent of our failure is being measured in the \ndeaths, and injuries of our kids in the school yard and on the streets \nof our neighborhoods and communities.\n  Our children are killing each other, and they are killing themselves.\n  Primary responsibility lies with the family. As a country, we are not \nparenting our children. We are not adequately involving ourselves in \nour children's lives, the friends they hang out with, what they do with \ntheir time, the problems they are struggling with. This is our job, our \nparamount responsibility, and most unfortunately, we are failing. We \nmust get our priorities straight, and that means putting our kids \nfirst. But, parents need help.\n  This is an extraordinarily complex problem. However, at its core, is \na collapse of the value shaping institutions of our society. Our public \nschools are restricted from teaching basic morals and values. Stresses \non families, the most basic value building institution in our society, \nthe demands of two income households, and the breakdown of the \ntraditional family structure are undermining our ability to raise \ndecent and moral children. The marginalizing of the critical role of \nreligion, of\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\nchurches and synagogues, in our modern society contributions to a youth \nculture devoid of moral responsibility and accountability. All of these \nfactors conspire to disconnect our children from humanity, and are \nturning some of them into killers.\n  Our homes and our families--our children's minds, are being flooded \nby a tide of violence. This dehumanizing violence pervades our society: \nour movies depict graphic violence; our children are taught to kill and \nmaim by interactive video games; the Internet, which holds such \ntremendous potential in so many ways, is tragically used by some to \ncommunicate unimaginable hatred, images and descriptions of violence, \nand ``how-to'' manuals on everything from bomb construction to drugs.\n  With the pressures of this modern society, the emphasis on \ntechnology, the demand for performance, the fast pace of events, our \nchildren seem to be increasingly isolated from family and peers.\n  If we are to turn this tide of youth violence, we must examine all of \nthese factors together. We must develop a comprehensive understanding \nof how these factors interrelate to produce a child capable of the \nshocking violence unfolding in our streets and school yards.\n  I have repeatedly joined various of my colleagues in efforts to call \nthe entertainment industry to task for creating and marketing violent \nproducts to children. Most recently, I joined in many of my \ndistinguished colleagues, prominent Americans, and concerned citizens \nin an ``Appeal to Hollywood,'' asking the leaders of the entertainment \nindustry to adopt a voluntary code of conduct exercising restraint from \nmarking violence and smut to our nation's youth. I have also introduced \nlegislation requiring the Surgeon General to complete a comprehensive \nstudy to determine the effect of media violence on children. I joined \nSenator Lieberman in calling for a special Youth Violence Study \nCommission that will study all of the various complex factors that \nconspire to generate such youth violence as we have recently witnessed. \nEarlier this year, I also introduced the Youth Violence Prevention Act, \nwhich targeted the various illegal ways by which our nation's children \nare gaining access to guns. As I have stated, this is a complex \nproblem, and we must press the issue on all fronts.\n  For this reason, I wish to commend the efforts of MTV and the \nRecording Industry Association of America. The electronic media \ndominate much of our children's lives. They are the first generation of \nAmericans to grow up entirely in a digital age. Much of what they see \nthrough the media is good. Some of it is both irresponsible and \ndangerous.\n  The ``Take a Stand Against Violence'' campaign represents the \npositive potential of the television and music industry. It is a \npositive campaign that engages the various factors that contribute to \nyouth violence, and most important, it does so in a language that young \npeople understand. As I believe the entertainment industry should be \nheld responsible when they peddle violence and smut to America's youth, \nI equally believe that the industry should be given credit for the many \npositive things they do.\n  The epidemic of youth violence in our Nation is a complex challenge. \nIt will only be solved if we all work together. Again, I urge all \nAmericans to get involved in their kids' lives. Ask questions, listen \nto their fears and concerns, their hopes and their dreams.\n  Again, I think we should commend entertainment industry leaders when \nthey take positive steps to curb the tide of youth violence. In \nparticular, I want to commend MTV and the Recording Industry of America \nfor the ``Take a Stand Against Violence'' campaign. It represents a \nvery positive step, and should serve as an example for others in the \nentertainment field.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a summary of this program be inserted into \nthe Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Fight for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against Violence\n\n       MTV's Emmy Award-winning 1999 pro-social campaign ``Fight \n     for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against Violence'' gives young \n     people a voice in the national debate on violence and \n     provides them with tactics for reducing violence in their \n     communities. Fight for Your Rights involves special \n     programming, Public Service Announcements, grassroots events, \n     and News special reports.\n       Both on air and off, MTV's campaign focuses on the three \n     types of violence that most affect its audience: Violence in \n     the Schools, Violence in the Streets (hate violence and gang \n     violence), and Sexual Violence. Through high profile \n     programming events, coverage on MTV News, thought-provoking \n     on-air promos, a 20 college campus tour, and local events \n     involving cable affiliates across the country, the campaign \n     provides ideas beyond curfews and school uniforms. Focusing \n     on solutions, such as peer mentoring, conflict resolution \n     programs, artistic responses to violence and youth advocacy \n     groups, Fight for Your Rights gives young people the tools \n     they need to take a stand against violence.\n       ``Fight for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against Violence'' \n     programming includes:\n       True Life: Warning Signs, an investigation of the \n     psychological factors that can cause a young person to turn \n     violent, produced in conjunction with the American \n     Psychological Association.\n       Point Blank, a one-hour national debate on the issue of gun \n     control and the role guns play in the lives of young people.\n       Scared Straight! 1999, MTV's update of the Oscar and Emmy \n     award-winning documentary of the same title.\n       Rising Hate Crimes Among Youth, an examination of the \n     alarming increase in hate-related incidents.\n       Unfilered: Violence from the Eyes of Youth, puts cameras in \n     the hands of 10-15 young people to document violence in their \n     lives.\n       True Life: Matthew's Murder, takes viewers into the heart \n     of young America's shock and confusion about the death of 21-\n     year old college student Matthew Shepard.\n       Fight Back, a hard-hitting look at the thousands of young \n     women and men who are the victims of sexual abuse each year.\n       Through partnerships with The US Departments of Justice and \n     Education, as well as the National Endowment for the Arts. \n     MTV developed a 24-page Action Guide/all-star CD that will be \n     distributed throughout the campaign. The CD contains music \n     and comments on the subject of violence from top recording \n     artists such as Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Alanis \n     Morissette, and many others. The Guide outlines five actions \n     aimed at engaging young people in solutions to violence, as \n     well as providing alternative outlets to violence. One \n     million copies of the CD/Guide package will be given away to \n     MTV viewers via a special toll-free number promoted on MTV \n     during PSA's, programming and on-air promotions devoted \n     specifically to the topic of youth violence.\n       The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) \n     graciously donated and manufactured the all-star CD which \n     also contains CD-ROM content focusing on conflict resolution \n     skills produced by the National Center for Conflict \n     Resolution Education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10373-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10373-S10374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRESS MISSES THE BUS ON GUN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in less than two weeks, the students of \nColumbine High School will resume classes and begin their 1999-2000 \nschool year. Since the now infamous Columbine massacre on April 20th, \nthe school has gone through a complete transformation. Sixteen high-\ndefinition security cameras have been installed in the school; bullet \nholes have been patched or covered; the alarm system, which rang for \nhours during the reign of terror, has been replaced; and new glass \nwindows have been installed to replace broken ones shattered by bullets \nand home-made bombs. In addition, keyed entry doors have been replaced \nby high-security electronic doors, a makeshift library has been created \nout of classrooms, and the school district has hired two additional \nsecurity guards for protection.\n  School officials will be making additional changes up until the very \nday students come back on August 16th, all in an effort to make the \nColumbine students feel safer when they return to school. Yet, \nColumbine students were not the only ones affected by last April's \nshooting. Students and teachers around the nation have lost the sense \nof safety they deserve to have at school. These students will hardly \nregain that safety by new landscaping or replaced alarm systems. These \nstudents and their families will continue to live in fear until the \nreal issue at hand is addressed: the easy accessibility that young \npeople have to guns.\n  When school resumes on August 16th at Columbine and around the \nnation, Congress will have done nothing to prevent young people from \npurchasing dangerous weapons. Students across the nation will walk into \nschool to begin a new year, while Congress is in a month-long recess, \nhaving done nothing to change the same loopholes in the\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\nsame Federal firearms laws that put the weapons in the hands of minors.\n  Congress's failure to act is inexcusable. Moderate reforms designed \nto limit juvenile access to firearms are long overdue. Yet, proponents \nof even the most modest gun safety legislation have come up against \nnothing but stonewalling and procedural delays. Sadly, it seems as if \naction on the juvenile justice bill is only propelled forward by \nadditional tragedies; the Senate bill, having been passed on the day of \nanother school shooting at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia, \nand the final motion to appoint conferees occurring just one day after \na mass shooting in Atlanta. I pray that it does not take yet another \nmass shooting to move this legislation out of Conference Committee and \nonto the President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10374-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the Majority Leader regarding the New Millennium \nClassrooms Act. Last week, the Abraham-Wyden New Millennium Classrooms \nAct amendment the the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 was cleared on both \nsides of the aisle and accepted by the full United States Senate. This \nbill provided tax incentives for businesses to donate both new and used \ncomputers to K-12 schools and senior centers. The Senate's approval of \nthis amendment demonstrates our strong commitment to provide school \nchildren--especially those children who live in impoverished areas--\naccess to up-to-date computer technology and the Internet. \nUnfortunately, despite the Senate's strong support for this measure, I \nunderstand that it was opposed by the House conferees to the Taxpayer \nRefund Act.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Michigan is correct. The New Millennium \nClassrooms Act was not included in the House-passed tax bill, and was \nlater omitted from the final tax conference report at the request of \nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer. I would say that to the \nSenator from Michigan that your New Millennim Classrooms Act remains a \ntop legislative priority for our Senate Republican High Tech Task \nForce. Accordingly, I will continue to work with you to find a way to \nsecure final Congressional approval of this important pro-technology, \npro-education initiative.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Majority Leader for his support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10374-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10374-S10375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FORMOSAN TERMITES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to engage into a colloquy \nwith the distinguished Chairman and the senior senator from Louisiana, \nMr. Breaux, about two very important ongoing agriculture research \nprojects relating to Formosan termites, and phytoestrogen research \nongoing in Louisiana, which the Appropriations Committee has supported \nin the past.\n  For the past two fiscal years, vital funding has been provided to the \nSouthern Regional Research Center in New Orleans to continue \n``Operation FullStop'', which has targeted research and test pilots to \nfind ways to control the Formosan termite. This past, first introduced \ninto the United States from east Asia in the 1940s has spread like a \nplague through the Southeast, and its range now extends from Texas to \nSouth Carolina. In Louisiana, damage is most severe in New Orleans \nwhere the total annual cost of termite damage and treatment is \nestimated at an astonishing $217,000,000. Many historic structures in \nthe French Quarter have been devastated, and now as many as \\1/3\\ of \nthe beloved live oaks that shade historic thoroughfares such as St. \nCharles Avenue are at risk of being lost to termite damage. To help \nfind appropriate controls for Formosan termites in Louisiana and other \nstates where termites are just being found, it is critical for this \nresearch to continue.\n  Additionally, the Southern Regional Research Center in coordination \nwith Tulane and Xavier Universities in New Orleans have merged their \ncomplementary expertise in a unique and powerful collaborative on \ncomparative research of the impact of Phytoestrogens on human health. \nThese natural chemicals in soybeans and other plant substances is only \nstarting to receive attention as dietary substances capable of \nimproving human health. In addition, to showing beneficial health \neffects for the prevention of breast cancer and other health disorders, \nthis research has developed techniques in molecular biology which could \nlead to applications that control the development of harmful insects. \nResearchers are on the verge of harnessing this knowledge and applying \nit to the possible biological amelioration of Foremosan termite \ninfestations. Thus, continuation of this research funded by a special \nAgriculture Research Service grant, is needed to build upon the ongoing \nprogram and hopefully find answers to how chemicals found in plant \nproducts could be used to replace other toxic pharmaceuticals and \npesticides.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Senator Landrieu. I agree that it is vital \nthat these ongoing agriculture research projects be given much deserved \nand badly needed attention and consideration by the U.S. Congress. and \nI join Senator Landrieu in my concern about the urgency to control \nFormosan termite devastation to privately-owned and public property, to \nhistoric preservation, to commerce, and to economic development. \nResearch being conducted at the Agriculture Research Service in New \nOrleans is vital to controlling the Formosan termite. Formosan termites \nare unique and are capable of inflicting more damage to more plant \nspecies than native termite species. In addition, they have unique \nbiological traits which make them more difficult to control, such as \nbeing able to avoid traditional termite controlling toxins by building \nnests above ground. The fundamental research currently conducted in New \nOrleans will identify vulnerabilities in termite biology or colony \ndevelopment which can be exploited for the development of new detection \nmethods and environmentally-sound control strategies. The structural \nfoundation of New Orleans and other areas all along the coast will \nbenefit from this research.\n  Also, the ongoing Phytoestrogen research being conducted by the \nSouthern Regional Research Center in coordination with Tulane and \nXavier Universities in New Orleans is an exemplary partnership. The \nTulane/Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research has one of the \nleading laboratory efforts in the world for the study of estrogenic \nchemicals, including Phytoestrogens. USDA's Southern Research Center \nhas 54 years of distinguished service to agriculture and science, \nmaking this a productive and sensible collaboration. The ramifications \nof this partnership will be broad-reaching, aiding not only the \nprevention and treatment of disease in humans, but also the development \nof safe biological alternatives to conventional pest control. I join \nSenator Landrieu in looking forward to the continuation of these \nprojects.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments from \nmy colleagues from Louisiana.

Mr. President and Members of the Senate, next \nweek our Nation will pass an important if unnoticed anniversary--the \nanniversary of one of the first official notifications we were given of \nthe atrocities of the Holocaust.\n  On August 8, 1942, Dr. Gerhart Reigner, the World Jewish Congress \nrepresentative in Geneva, sent a cable to both Rabbi Stephen Wise--the \nPresident of the World Jewish Congress--and a British Member of \nParliament. In it, Dr. Reigner wrote about ``an alarming report'' that \nHitler was planning that all Jews in countries occupied or controlled \nby Germany ``should after deportation and concentration * * * be \nexterminated at one blow to resolve once and for all the Jewish \nquestion in Europe.'' Our Government's reaction to this news was not \nour greatest moment during that terrible era.\n  First, the State Department refused to give the cable to Rabbi Wise. \nAfter Rabbi Wise got a copy of the cable from the British, he passed it \nalong to the Undersecretary of State, who asked him not to make the \ncontents public until it could be confirmed. Rabbi Wise didn't make it \npublic, but he did tell President Roosevelt, members of the cabinet, \nand Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter about the cable. None of \nthem chose to act publicly on its contents.\n  Our government finally did acknowledge the report some months later, \nbut the question remains: how many lives could have been saved had we \nresponded to this clear warning of the Holocaust earlier and with more \nvigor? The questions of how the United States responded to the \nHolocaust and, specifically, what was the fate of the Holocaust \nvictims' assets that came into the possession or control of the United \nStates government, is the focus of the Presidential Advisory Commission \non Holocaust Assets in the United States, of which I am a member.\n  This bipartisan Commission--chaired by Edgar M. Bronfinan--is \ncomposed of 21 individuals, including four Senators, four Members of \nthe House, representatives of the Departments of the Army, Justice, \nState, and Treasury, the Chairman of the United States Holocaust \nMemorial Council, and eight private citizens.\n  The Commission is charged with conducting original research into what \nhappened to the assets of Holocaust victims--including gold, other \nfinancial instruments and art and cultural objects--that passed into \nthe possession or control of the Federal government, including the \nFederal Reserve. We are also to survey the research done by others \nabout what happened to the assets of Holocaust victims that passed into \nnon-Federal hands, including State governments, and report to the \nPresident, making recommendations for future actions, whether \nlegislative or administrative.\n  The Commission was created last year by a unanimous Act of Congress, \nand has been hard at work since early this year. Perhaps the most \nimportant information that the Commission's preliminary research has \nuncovered is the fact that the question of the extent to which assets \nof Holocaust victims fell into Federal hands is much, much larger than \nwe thought even a year ago, when we first established this Commission.\n  Last month, at the quarterly meeting of the Commissioners in \nWashington, we unveiled a ``map'' of Federal and related offices \nthrough which these assets may have flowed. To everyone's surprise, \ntaking a sample year--1943--we found more than 75 separate entities \nthat may have been involved.\n  The records of each of these offices must first be located and then \nscoured--page by page--at the National Archives and other record \ncenters across the United States. In total, we must look at tens of \nmillion of pages to complete the historical record of this period.\n  Furthermore, to our nation's credit, we are currently declassifying \nmillions of pages of World War II-era information that may shine light \non our government's policies and procedures during that time. But, this \nsalutary effort dramatically increases the work the Commission must do \nto fulfill the mandate we have given it.\n  In addition, as the Commission pursues its research, it is \ndiscovering new aspects of the story of Holocaust assets that hadn't \npreviously been understood. The Commission's research may be unearthing \nan alarming trend to import into the United States through South \nAmerica, art and other possessions looted from Holocaust victims. \nPursuing these leads will require the review of additional thousands of \ndocuments.\n  The Commission is also finding aspects of previously known incidents \nthat have not been carefully or credibly researched. The ultimate fate \nof the so-called ``Hungarian Gold Trains.''--for example--a set of \ntrains containing the art, gold, and other valuables of Hungarian \nvictims of the Nazis that was detained by the liberating US Army during \ntheir dash for Berlin has not been carefully investigated.\n  In another area of our research, investigators are seeking to piece \ntogether the puzzle of foreign-owned intellectual property--some of \nwhich may have been owned by victims of Nazi genocide--the rights to \nwhich were vested in the Federal government under wartime law.\n  For all of these reasons and more, I am introducing today with \nSenators Boxer, Dodd and Grams the ``U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission \nExtension Act of 1999.'' This simple piece of legislation moves to \nDecember, 2000, the date of the final report of the Presidential \nAdvisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, giving \nour investigators the time to do a professional and credible job on the \ntasks the congress has assigned to them.\n  This bill also authorizes additional appropriations for the \nCommission to complete its work. I strongly urge all of my colleagues \nto join me in support of this necessary and simple of legislation.\n  As we approach the end of the millennium, the United States is \nwithout a doubt the strongest nation on the face of the earth. Our \nstrength, however, is not limited to our military and economic might. \nOur nation is strong because we have the resolve to look at ourselves \nand our history honestly and carefully--even if the truth we find shows \nus in a less-than flattering light.\n  The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the \nUnited States is seeking the truth about the belongings of Holocaust \nvictims that came into the possession or control of the United States \ngovernment. All of my colleagues should support this endeavor, and we \nmust give the Commission the time and support it needs by supporting \nthe U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Extension Act of 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10375-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10375-S10376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ARMY SPECIALIST T. BRUCE CLUFF\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army \nSpecialist T. Bruce Cluff of Washington, Utah. Specialist Cluff was one \nof five American soldiers from the 204th Military Intelligence \nBattalion stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, who perished when \ntheir U.S. Army surveillance plane crashed in the rugged mountains of \nColombia while conducting a routine counter narcotics mission in \nconjunction with the Colombian government.\n  I am deeply saddened by the loss of this fine young man while in the \nservice of our country. This is a greater tragedy by the fact that \nSpecialist Cluff leaves behind a wife, Meggin, and two young children, \nMaciah and Ryker, with another child yet to be born. My heart and my \nprayers go out to them as well as to their extended family.\n  I also acknowledge and extend my sympathies to the families of the \nother four American soldiers who perished in the crash. I especially \nhope that Meggin Cluff, her children, and the other families of these \nsoldiers will feel the immense gratitude that we have for the sacrifice \nof their loved ones.\n  Indeed, Specialist T. Bruce Cluff and his crew mates are heroes, as \nare all of the men and women of our armed forces who everyday \nunselfishly put life and limb at risk to defend our great nation. \nSpecialist Cluff and his Army unit were engaged in a different type of \nwar. Illegal drug trafficking has become the scourge of our society, \nand we are determined to stop this practice at its very roots.\n  The men and women of our armed forces assisting in these offshore \ninterdiction efforts will not be deterred by\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\nthe tragic loss of this aircrew. In fact, I suspect they and their \nfamilies will be all the more motivated to continue the ``war'' against \ndrug trafficking. We should all take due notice of the costs associated \nwith this effort, including the first loss of military lives. We should \nbe unrelenting in our opposition to and our pursuit and prosecution of \ntraffickers as well as pushers of dangerous drugs.\n  May God bless the memories of Specialist Cluff and his fellow crew \nmembers, and give comfort and peace to their families. And may we \nremember and continue to defend the principles for which these brave \nyoung people fought and died for. We owe that commitment to them, to \ntheir families, and to those who will continue their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10376-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10376-S10378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MICROSOFT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as we approach the August recess, my \nconstituents at Microsoft face the task of battling the Department of \nJustice, DoJ, as well as their competitors in the courts, while \ncontinuing to run one of the most successful companies in one of the \nmost competitive industries in American history. I would like to share \nsome interesting developments that have arisen since I last took to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate to speak to this issue.\n  Specifically, USA Today recently reported that the Department of \nJustice is inquiring as to how a possible breakup of Microsoft could be \nimplemented. According to USA Today, unnamed senior officials at DoJ \nhave requested a complex study, which would cost hundreds of thousands \nof dollars, to assess where Microsoft's logical breakup points would \nbe.\n  Mr. President, this seems to be putting the cart before the horse. I \nwould hope that the Department of Justice has more important things on \nwhich to spend the taxpayers' money. If not, I am aware of several \nprograms included in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill \nthat could use additional funding.\n  To put the premature nature of this action in perspective, the \nfindings of fact that summarize the points that each side made during \nthe testimony aren't even due until next week. After Judge Penfield \nJackson has had an opportunity to review these documents, the two sides \nwill present closing arguments. Following the closing arguments, Judge \nJackson will issue his ``proposed findings of fact.'' In response, the \ngovernment and Microsoft will prepare another set of legal briefs to \nargue how antitrust law applies to the facts. Judge Jackson then will \nhear additional courtroom arguments, and finally issue his \n``conclusions of law'' around November.\n  Should Judge Jackson rule against Microsoft, a verdict with which I \nwould vehemently disagree, another set of hearings on possible \n``remedies'' would need to be held. Those proceedings could last \nseveral weeks and involve additional witnesses, which would put a final \ndecision off until sometime next spring. Microsoft almost certainly \nwould appeal its case to U.S. Court of Appeals and possibly all the way \nto the Supreme Court--pushing the time frame out another two years.\n  Although the timing of this DoJ action is premature, the most \nintriguing aspect of the July 29, 1999 USA Today article was that the \ntwo investment banking firms approached by the DoJ to study the breakup \nof Microsoft declined the invitation. According to the story, both \nfirms were ``worried about the impact of siding with a Justice \nDepartment that they say is viewed in the business community as \ninterventionist.'' If Microsoft were a monopoly, and stifling growth in \nthe Information Technology sector, it seems to me that these technology \ninvestment banks would have jumped at the chance to downsize Microsoft \nin order to open the market to competition, therefore increasing \ninvestment opportunities. This is obviously not the case.\n  Far from being guilty of the charges levied against it, Microsoft is \nactually winning cases brought by other firms charging anti-competitive \nbehavior. Connecticut-based Bristol Technology Inc., which manufactures \na software tool called Wind/U, filed a federal antitrust suit against \nMicrosoft on August 18, 1998. Bristol accused Microsoft of ``refusing \nto deal'' because Microsoft wouldn't license the source code for \nWindows NT 4 under Bristol's proposed more favorable terms. Despite \nnever having made more than $1.5 million in net profits in their best \nyear, Bristol was seeking up to $270 million in monetary damages.\n  Not unlike the suit brought by the DoJ against Microsoft, the \nBristol case seemed to be driven more by those trying to gain \ncompetitive advantage than by violation of antitrust law. Bristol hired \na Public Relations firm to set out its ``David vs. Goliath'' PR \ncampaign while supposedly negotiating in good faith with Microsoft. A \nmember of Bristol's Board of Directors went so far as to send an email \nto the CEO and senior management discussing what Bristol was then \nreferring to as the ``we-sue-Microsoft-for-money business plan,'' which \nhe proposed might be funded by Microsoft competitors.\n\n  I see it as a disturbing trend to have litigation used as a get rich \nquick scheme instead of protecting ordinary citizens from harm. It is \nparticularly disturbing that the United States government aids and \nabets this distortion of the American legal system. The insistence of \nthe Department of Justice on continuing its case, in the face of \noverwhelming evidence that consumers have not been harmed, not to \nmention that the industry is booming, sets a poor precedent for \nAmericans to follow and can only serve to encourage this behavior.\n  Fortunately, Bristol's hometown jury took less than two days to \nreturn a unanimous verdict. Every one of the antitrust charges were \ndismissed.\n  As gratifying as the jurors' common-sense decision was in the Bristol \ncase, they did find against Microsoft on one count--and awarded Bristol \none dollar in damages. Mr. President [pull out dollar bill?], I would \nsuggest that the Bristol jurors got it exactly right. In fact, I think \nthat's a pretty good precedent to follow in the DOJ case: assess \nMicrosoft one dollar per indecorous email submitted by government \nlawyers as ``evidence'' and maybe the total will be a few hundred \ndollars or so. That wouldn't really give taxpayers much of a return on \nthe estimated $30 to $60 million dollars this lawsuit has cost them, \nbut no matter: what's a few million taxpayer dollars in the pursuit of \nthat most critical of federal mandates, enforcing corporate etiquette?\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the August 5th Investor's \nBusiness Daily addressing this issue be printed in the Congressional \nRecord after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GORTON. Another interesting development that has arisen since my \nlast speech is the controversy regarding instant messaging technology. \nInstant messaging, which allows people to chat in real-time with a \nselect list of agreed-upon users, has become the hottest new on-line \napplication. With over 100 million users, instant messaging shows how \nthe Internet is changing the dynamic of the Information Technology \nindustry.\n  Let me give you a brief description of the controversy. AOL, \nMicrosoft, Prodigy, and Yahoo all have developed competing instant \nmessaging technology. Unfortunately, users of these competing versions \ncould not communicate with each other until Microsoft, Prodigy, and \nYahoo released versions of this technology that allow their users to \ntalk to AOL users. AOL responded by shutting out the competition and \ncomplaining that the competing technology was the equivalent of hacking \ninto the AOL system. This is the equivalent of MCI and Sprint users not \nbeing able to place long distance calls to one another.\n  Over the last two weeks, AOL and Microsoft have been engaged in a \nduck and parry routine over the ability of competing technologies to \naccess AOL users, with Microsoft creating new versions as fast as AOL \ncould block them. I hope that the two sides can come to an agreement \nsoon on the development of an industry standard which will allow for \nopen competition in the marketplace.\n  With AOL having a 20-1 advantage over the nearest rival in the field, \nthey must hope that Milton Friedman's admonition regarding the \n``suicidal tendencies'' of some in the industry in supporting the DOJ's \nintervention doesn't prove prophetic. I hope that the Justice \nDepartment does not feel the\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\nneed to get involved. This industry, which is changing and advancing so \nrapidly, doesn't need the government to lay down speed bumps in the \nroad. The federal government should be fostering growth and monitoring \nthe progress, allowing the smooth flow of the traffic of commerce to \ncontinue unimpeded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a recent Wall Street \nJournal article in the Record that illustrates many of the points I \nhave made regarding the absurdity of the DoJ's case against Microsoft. \nOnce again, I implore my colleagues to join me in denouncing this \nfolly.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 30, 1999]\n\n                       (By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.)\n\n       The evidentiary phase of the Microsoft lawsuit wrapped up \n     last week, and it's been an education. If Joel Klein were \n     possessed of any public spirit at all, he would drop the case \n     right now.\n       Yet there he was on Thursday, declaiming on the courthouse \n     steps that Microsoft represents a ``serious, serious \n     problem'' that only sweeping Justice Department remedies can \n     fix. ``If you think that Microsoft's operating system \n     monopoly is going to go away in two or three years,'' he \n     added, ``then we shouldn't have brought this case. But I \n     obviously don't believe that.''\n       That last bit is lawyer-speak meaning ``In the real world I \n     don't believe what I'm saying, but in court I believe it.'' \n     Mr. Klein doesn't want future clients to think he's a dim \n     bulb.\n       He's got a problem. As a matter of law maybe, but certainly \n     as a matter of doing what's right, the evidence and events \n     outside the courtroom have clearly shown Microsoft's \n     ``monopoly'' to be more semantic than real. This month \n     Justice rolled out its latest ringer, an IBM manager who \n     testified Microsoft threatened to withhold a Windows license \n     unless IBM made all sorts of concessions not to promote \n     products that compete with Microsoft's office applications, \n     encyclopedia, etc.\n       Uh-huh. When all the palavering was done, IBM said ``no'' \n     and got its Windows deal anyway, and a pretty good deal at \n     that.\n       The same was true of the Apple, Intel and AOL witnesses \n     earlier. That's why the government's case has been built \n     entirely on the premise that Microsoft breaks the law merely \n     by engaging in hard bargaining, never mind what bargains were \n     reached or how events played out.\n       This might be a good time for Mr. Klein to remember that he \n     works for us, not for Microsoft's competitors. They've been \n     cheerleading for this lawsuit since day one, but they can't \n     afford to mislead the markets the way Justice spins the \n     public. The SEC frowns on CEOs who mislead investors.\n       Take Larry Ellison. He was on the Neil Cavuto show talking \n     for the umpteenth time about Bill Gates the bullying \n     monopolist. But he hastily drew a line: ``I mean he's never \n     bullied Oracle. But I certainly . . .''\n       When Mr. Cavuto pressed on, suggesting that Oracle must be \n     dead meat now that the ``bully'' has targeted its flagship \n     database software, Mr. Ellison became indignant:\n       ``Well, let's look at the facts. Right now, the fastest \n     growing segment of my industry is the Internet. Of the 10 \n     largest consumer Web sites, all 10 of them use the Oracle \n     database. In the 10 largest business-to-business Web sites, \n     nine of the 10 use Oracle. None of them use Microsoft. Every \n     single web portal, things like Lycos, Excite, Yahoo!, all use \n     Oracle. None use Microsoft. Microsoft's been in the database \n     business for a decade and they continue to lose. They've been \n     losing share to us at a faster and faster rate over the last \n     several years. In fact, we dominate. We almost have Gates-\n     like share in the Internet and it's the Internet that's \n     driving the business.''\n       OK, Larry.\n       Moving along to Sun's Scott McNealy: His partnership with \n     AOL and Netscape has figured prominently in court, with the \n     government swearing a blue stream that their plans don't \n     ``threaten'' Microsoft. That's not what Mr. McNealy told a \n     trade publication, tele.com, in January. What follows is a \n     lot of jargon, but it means Microsoft has a monopoly in \n     nothing:\n       ``We added in Netscape and AOL as distribution channels \n     getting Java 2 into the tens of millions of disks that AOL \n     sends out, so that the world is going to be littered with \n     Java 2, just on the desktop. Then you add in what's going on \n     in Personal Java and Java Card and Java on the server, and \n     all of a sudden we have a very, very interesting, stable \n     volume platform that gives any developer for the telco or ISP \n     community a virus-free, object-oriented, smart card-to-\n     supercomputer scalable, down-the-experience-curve platform \n     that allows you to interoperate with every kind of device you \n     can imagine.''\n       But nobody spins like AOL's Steve Case. In court, the story \n     is that AOL was ``bullied'' into accepting a free browser \n     from Microsoft (until then, AOL customers had to pay 40 bucks \n     for a Netscape browser). It was ``bullied'' into accepting \n     free placement on every Windows desktop.\n       These deals made AOL king of the Internet, dwarfing \n     everybody including Microsoft. Now AOL has bought Netscape, \n     but as Mr. Case will smirkingly tell you, it's up to him to \n     decide when to dump Microsoft's browser and begin promoting \n     Netscape's browser instead.\n       When will that happen? When he no longer cares whether \n     Microsoft kicks him off the desktop (meaning when Microsoft \n     can no longer hope to gain anything by kicking him off the \n     desktop).\n       AOL has signed up to provide Internet access on the Palm, \n     using a non-Microsoft operating system. Deals are in the \n     works with various smart-phone makers, again bypassing \n     Windows. Mr. Case has spun the court and gullible journalists \n     by saying ``of course'' AOL has no intention of competing \n     directly with Microsoft--which works if your understand of \n     the industry is so skimpy that you believe the relevant \n     threat is another PC operating system.\n       But, hark, AOL is going to compete on the desktop too. Last \n     week we learned about talks with Microworkz to launch an AOL-\n     branded computer, using BeOS and Linux (i.e., no Windows). \n     Gateway is working on its own Internet computer using the \n     Amiga operating system (yep, the same OS adopted by Commodore \n     in the 1980s).\n       Faster than anyone predicted, the Windows universe is \n     fragmenting. Microsoft built us a common platform by \n     committing itself to a big, bulky, backwards-compatible \n     Windows, and now it's stuck with a platform too big and bulky \n     to be useful for a new generation of devices. These gadgets \n     will run happily on any number of narrowly targeted, code-\n     light operating systems, as long as they speak the common \n     language of the Internet. Even Mr. McNealy predicts Windows \n     will have less than 50% of the market by 2002--that is, in \n     ``two or three years.''\n       This was in the cards before Justice ever filed its \n     antitrust suit. We pointed out here three years ago that if \n     ``the future of computing is a toaster tied to the \n     Internet,'' the ``death struggle of the operating systems'' \n     is over. We're happy to report that Microworkz is calling its \n     non-Windows machine the ``iToaster.''\n       Pursuing this case any further would be nothing but a \n     gratuitous favor to companies that don't want Microsoft to be \n     allowed even to compete. It's time to pull the plug.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Investor's Business Daily, August 5, 1999]\n\n                     Case Closed: Lay Off Microsoft\n\n                          (By Paul Rothstein)\n\n       The government's antitrust case against Microsoft continues \n     at a snail's pace. A decision by a U.S. judge is not expected \n     until late this year. In the meantime, eight average citizens \n     in Bridgeport, Conn., have already offered their view in the \n     contest of a lesser known but perhaps equally important \n     antitrust case also involving Microsoft.\n       Bristol Technology is a small Connecticut-based software \n     company that offers a product allowing users to run Windows-\n     based applications in other operating system environments, \n     including various flavors of Unix. Bristol sued Microsoft in \n     federal court last year, asserting 12 claims for relief under \n     state and federal antitrust laws and seeking as much a $263 \n     million in damages.\n       Like the government, Bristol alleged Microsoft had an \n     illegal monopoly in the PC operating system market. The suit \n     claimed Microsoft had used it to try to monopolize two other \n     markets--operating system software for ``technical \n     workstations'' and for ``departmental servers.''\n       At trial, Microsoft presented a compelling case based on \n     hard facts and evidence illustrating stiff competition from \n     the likes of multibillion-dollar companies like IBM and Sun \n     Microsystems. The competition historically has charged \n     consumers much more than Microsoft does. Microsoft's entry in \n     1993 with Windows NT actually generated significant cost \n     savings for consumers and increased the level of innovation \n     and competition.\n       Bristol's hometown jury took less than two days to agree \n     with Microsoft. In a unanimous verdict, the jury quickly \n     dismissed every one of the antitrust charges. It upheld only \n     a minor state claim for which the jury awarded Bristol $1 in \n     ``damages.''\n       Although the specific facts are different, basic \n     similarities exist between the Connecticut case and the \n     government's antitrust suit in D.C.\n       In both cases, the plaintiffs argued that Microsoft \n     possesses an illegal monopoly with its Windows operating \n     system. Bristol claimed Microsoft's control of the operating \n     system market was so strong and so permanent that any company \n     wishing to produce applications that run on operating \n     systems, must necessarily do Microsoft's bidding. The Justice \n     Department charged that this alleged power was used to thwart \n     competition from Netscape\n       In both cases, Microsoft showed that the volatile computer \n     industry is not and cannot be dominated by a single player, \n     even one whose product appears to enjoy widespread \n     popularity.\n       Software is so easy to create that anyone with a home PC \n     and a few hundred dollars can enter the market as a viable \n     competitor to IMB, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq \n     and, yes, even Microsoft.\n       Just ask Linus Torvalds. He's the creator of the \n     increasingly popular server operating system software called \n     Linux. Torvalds created Linux in the early 1990s in his \n     college dorm room at age 19. Today, the latest International \n     Data Corp. data show Linux with\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n     nearly 20% of the server software market and growing.\n       The Connecticut lawsuit couldn't show any harm to consumers \n     or competition. The record supported Microsoft's position--\n     that its efforts to provide Windows NT has increased choice, \n     increased features and dramatically reduced prices for \n     customers seeking to use high-end PCs and servers.\n       Fortunately for all of us, the jury in the Bristol case \n     recognized that antitrust laws are designed to protect \n     competition, not competitors.\n       It is unfortunate that the Department of Justice, joined by \n     some state attorneys general, does not share that view. \n     Indeed, another lesson from the Bristol case is that the \n     selective and subjective use of out-of-context e-mail \n     snippets, while perhaps good theater, does not prove an \n     antitrust case.\n       Seen in this light, the Bristol jury's verdict ought to \n     concern the government. Why? If the Bristol verdict \n     illustrates anything, it's that eight everyday consumers can \n     recognize the intense level of competition that exists in \n     today's software industry and the obvious benefits of low \n     prices and better products for consumers.\n       Given that reality, the government's long battle against \n     America's most admired company is a waste of taxpayer money. \n     It's a flawed proceeding for which consumers clearly have no \n     use.\n       By issuing a verdict reaffirming the pro-competitive and \n     pro-consumer nature of today's software industry, the \n     Connecticut jury signaled its support of continued innovation \n     and free-market competition.\n       Paul Rothstein is a professor of law at Georgetown \n     University and a consultant to Microsoft who has studied \n     antitrust law under a U.S. Government Fulbright grant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10378-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CRANBERRY AMENDMENT TO AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to express my regret that I \nam unable to sign the conference repot on the Fiscal Year 2000 \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act.\n  This was my first year as a member of the Armed Service Committee. I \nwant to commend Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for their leadership \nand commitment to our nation's defense. The committee provided ample \nopportunity for me to learn about the issues, participate in the \ndiscussion, and express my views. I believe that the process which \ncreated this bill was, overall, thoughtful and fair.\n  This bill has many excellent provisions. It provides for a \nsignificant increase in defense spending but allocates the funds \nwisely. In creases funds for research and development which we must \ninvest in if we are to remain the world's finest fighting force. It \nadds additional funds to the service's operation and maintenance \naccounts which should ease the strain of keeping our bases and \nequipment in good condition. The bill also funds many of the Service \nChief's unfunded requirements, items, that are not flashy but are vital \nto military readiness.\n  Certainly the most important parts of this bill are those that \naddress the issue of recruitment and retention. This bill provides for \na pay increase, restoration of retirement benefits, and special \nincentive pays. The bill also begins to address some of the problems \nidentified in the military healthcare system. Our men and women in \nuniform work tirelessly every day to defend the principles of this \ncountry and they deserve the benefits that are included in this \nlegislation.\n  I have grave concerns, however, over the sections of this bill which \naffect the Department of Energy. A reorganization of the agency which \nmanages our nation's nuclear arsenal should not be undertaken quickly \nor haphazardly. Yet this conference report contains language which was \nnot considered by any committee or debated on the floor of either the \nHouse or the Senate. The ramifications of these provisions are unclear. \nRegrettably, I am unable to support a report which contains such \nprovisions until I have had the opportunity to study them further.\n  I hope that further analysis reveals that this reorganization is \nworkable and that ultimately, I am able to vote in favor of this \nreport. However, at this time, I am reserving my judgment and will not \nsign the conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10378-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PET SAFETY AND PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, yesterday I was pleased to be joined by \nSenators Rockefeller, Snowe, and Mikulski in introducing the Electronic \nCommerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999. The purpose of the bill \nis simple--to ensure that small businesses in every corner of our \nnation fully participate in the electronic commerce revolution \nunfolding around us by helping them find and adopt the right e-commerce \ntechnology and techniques. It does this by authorizing an ``electronic \ncommerce extension'' program at the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology modeled on NIST's existing, highly successful Manufacturing \nExtension Program.\n  Everywhere you look today, e-commerce is starting a revolution in \nAmerican business. Precise e-commerce numbers are hard to come by, but \nby one estimate e-commerce sales in 1998 were $100 billion. If you add \nin the hardware, software, and services making those sales possible, \nthe number rises to $300 billion. Another estimate has business to \nbusiness e-commerce growing to $1.3 trillion by 2003. Whatever the \nexact numbers, an amazing change in our economy has begun.\n  But the shift to e-commerce is about more than new ways to sell \nthings; it's about new ways to do things. It promises to transform how \nwe do business and thereby boost productivity, the root of long term \nimprovements in our standard of living. A recent Washington Post piece \non Cisco Systems, a major supplier of Internet hardware, notes that \nCisco saved $500 million last year by selling its products and buying \nits supplies online. Imagine the productivity and economic growth \nspurred when more firms get efficiencies like that. And that's the \npoint of the bill, to make sure that small businesses get those \nbenefits too.\n  Electronic commerce is a new use of information technology and the \nIneternet. Many people suspect information technology is the major \ndriver behind the productivity and economic growth we've been enjoying. \nThe crucial verb here is ``use.'' It is the widespread use of a more \nproductive technology that sustains accelerated productivity growth. It \nwas steam engine, not its sales, that powered the industrial \nrevolution.\n  Closer to today, in 1987, Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow \nquipped, ``We see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity \nstatistics.'' Well, it looks like the computer has started to show up \nbecause more people are using them in more ways, like e-commerce. \nInformation technology producers, companies like Cisco Systems who are, \nnotably, some\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\nof the most sophisticated users of IT, are 8% of our economy; from 1995 \nto 1998 they contributed 35% of our economic growth. There are also \nsome indications that IT is now improving productivity among companies \nthat only use IT.\n  But here is the real point. If we are going to sustain this \nproductivity and economic growth, we have to spread sophisticated uses \nof information technology like e-commerce beyond the high tech sector \nand companies like Cisco Systems and into every corner of the economy, \nincluding small businesses. Back in the 1980's, we used to debate if it \nmattered if we made money selling ``potato chips or computer chips.'' \nBut here is the real difference: consuming a lot of potato chips isn't \ngood for you; consuming a lot of computer chips is.\n\n  I emphasize this because too often our discussions of government \npolicy, technology, and economic growth dwell on the invention and sale \nof new technologies, but shortchange the all important topic of their \nuse. Extension programs, like the electronic commerce extension program \nin my bill, are policy aimed at precisely spreading the use of more \nproductive technology by small businesses.\n  With that in mind, the e-commerce revolution creates both \nopportunities and challenges for small businesses. On the one hand, it \nwill open new markets to them. On the web, the garage shop can look as \ngood as IBM. On the other hand, the high fixed costs, low marginal \ncosts, and technical sophistication that can sometimes characterize e-\ncommerce, when coupled with a good brand name, may allow larger, more \nestablished e-commerce firms to quickly move from market to market. \nAmazon.com has done such a wonderful job of making a huge variety of \nbooks widely available that it's been able to expand to CDs, to toys, \nto electronics, to auctions. Moreover, firms in more rural areas have \nsuddenly found sophisticated, low cost, previously distant businesses \nentering their market, and competing with them. Thus, there is \nconsiderable risk that many small businesses will be left behind in the \nshift to e-commerce. That would not be good for them, nor for the rest \nof us, because we all benefit when everyone is more productive and \neveryone competes.\n  The root of this problem is the fact that many small firms have a \nhard time identifying and adopting new technology. They are hard \nworking, but they just don't have the time, people, or money to \nunderstand all the different technologies they might use. And, they \noften don't even know where to turn to for help. Thus, while small \nfirms are very flexible, they can be slow to adopt new technology, \nbecause they don't know which to use or what to do about it. That is \nwhy we have extension programs. Extension programs give small \nbusinesses low cost, impartial advice on what technologies are out \nthere and how to use them.\n  What might an e-commerce extension program do? Imagine you're a small \nspeciality foods retailer in rural New Mexico and you see e-commerce as \na way to reach more customers. But your specialty is chiles, not \ncomputers; imagine all the questions you would have. How do I sell over \nthe web? Can I buy supplies that way too? How do I keep hackers out of \nmy system? What privacy policies should I follow? How do I use \nencryption to collect credit card numbers and guarantee customers that \nI'm who I am? Can I electronically integrate my sales orders with \ninstructions to shippers like Federal Express? Should I band together \nwith other local producers to form a chile cybermall? What servers, \nsoftware, and telecommunications will I need and how much will it cost? \nYour local e-commerce extension center would answer those questions for \nyou. And, you could trust their advice, because you would know they \nwere impartial and had no interest in selling you a particular product.\n\n  This bill will lead to the creation of a high quality, nationwide \nnetwork of non-profit organizations providing that kind of advice, \nanalogous to the Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, network NIST \nruns today, but with a focus on e-commerce and on firms beyond \nmanufacturers. MEP demonstrates that NIST could do this new job well.\n  Similarly, this bill is modeled on the MEP authorization. It retains \nthe key features of MEP: a network of centers run by non-profits; \nstrict merit selection; cost sharing; and periodic independent review \nof each center. In addition, it emphasizes serving small businesses in \nrural or more isolated areas, so that those businesses can get a leg up \non e-commerce too. In short, this legislation takes an approach that \nhas already been proven to work.\n  Practically speaking, if this bill becomes law, I assume NIST would \nbegin by leveraging their MEP management expertise to start a few e-\ncommerce extension centers and then gradually build out a network \nseparate from MEP. I also want to note that this is a new, separate \nauthorization for an e-commerce extension program because it will have \na different focus than MEP and because I do not want it to displace MEP \nin any way.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant, timely, and practical piece of legislation. Just as a strong \nagricultural sector called for an agricultural extension service, and a \nstrong industrial sector called for manufacturing extension, our shift \nto an information economy calls for electronic commerce extension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10379-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to join Senator \nGorton and many other distinguished colleagues as a sponsor of the \nAdvancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act. Autism is a heartbreaking \ndisorder that strikes at the core of family relationships. We need to \ndo all we can to understand the causes of autism in order to learn how \nto treat this tragic condition more effectively, and ultimately to \nprevent it. I want to commend Senator Gorton, the Cure Autism Now \nFoundation, and the many organizations and families in Massachusetts \nfor their impressive leadership in dealing with this important cause of \ndisability in children. In this age of such extraordinary progress on \npreventing, treating and curing so many other serious and debilitating \nillnesses, we cannot afford to miss this unique opportunity for \nprogress against autism as well.\n  Clearly, we can do more to provide support for children and families \nwho face the tragedy of autism. At the same time, I am concerned about \ncertain provisions in the proposed legislation which could \ninadvertently cause harm to children with autism and to our system of \nfunding research.\n  One provision allows use of NIH funds for health care and other \nservices that ``will facilitate the participation'' in research. We \nmust be clear that research dollars should be used only to cover costs \nthat are required to carry out research. Insurance providers should \nnever be able to use participation in research as an excuse to avoid \npaying for medically necessary health care. In addition, we must be \nespecially careful to protect vulnerable children and families from \nsituations in which financial incentives could affect decisions about \nparticipation in research.\n  I am confident that we can work together to address such issues as \nthe bill moves through Congress. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues,\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\nwith the advocacy organizations and with familes to enact the best \npossible measure to bring hope to the lives of these very special \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10380-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As an executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10380-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROPOSED LEGISLATION ``CENTRAL AMERICAN AND HAITIAN PARITY ACT OF \n               1999''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 55\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nproposed legislation; which was referred to the Committee on Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit for your immediate consideration and \nenactment the ``Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 1999.'' Also \ntransmitted is a section-by-section analysis. This legislative \nproposal, which would amend the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA), is part of my Administration's \ncomprehensive effort to support the process of democratization and \nstabilization now underway in Central America and Haiti and to ensure \nequitable treatment for migrants from these countries. The proposed \nbill would allow qualified national of El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, and Haiti an opportunity to became lawful permanent residents \nof the United States. Consequently, under this bill, eligible national \nof these countries would receive treatment equivalent to that granted \nto the Nicaraguans and Cubans under NACARA.\n  Like Nicaraguans and Cubans, many Salvadorans, Guatemalans, \nHondurans, and Haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political \nand economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet these latter groups \nreceived lesser treatment than that granted to Nicaraguans and Cubans \nby NACARA. The United States has a strong foreign policy interest in \nproviding the same treatment to these similarly situated people. \nMoreover, the countries from which these migrants have come are young \nand fragile democracies in which the United States has played and will \ncontinue to play a very important role. The return of these migrants to \nthese countries would place significant demands on their economic and \npolitical systems. By offering legal status to a number of nationals of \nthese countries with long-standing ties in the United States, we can \nadvance our commitment to peace and stability in the region.\n  Passage of the ``Central American and Haitian Party Act of 1999'' \nwill evidence our commitment to fair and even-handed treatment of \nnationals from these countries and to the strengthening of democracy \nand economic stability among important neighbors. I urge the prompt and \nfavorable consideration of this legislative proposal by the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

These \n     losses represent a loss of barrier islands and wetlands that \n     effect the pattern of salinity gradients in our bays, sounds, \n     and inlets which is the foundation for sustaining biological \n     productivity; and\n       Whereas, United States Senator John Chaffe and United \n     States Senator John Breaux will be introducing the Estuary \n     Habitat Restoration Partnership Act to encourage the \n     restoration of America's vital estuary resources; and\n       Whereas, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act \n     will use federal dollars to encourage and move state, local, \n     and private resources to restore one million acres of estuary \n     habitat by the year 2010.\n       Therefore, be it resolved That the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to enact \n     the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     forwarded to the presiding officers of the United States \n     Senate and United States House of Representatives and to the \n     Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-291. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the Federal Migratory \n     Bird Conservation Act; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 107\n\n       Whereas, to provide the public with the convenience of \n     increased availability of hunting and fishing licenses, many \n     states have implemented or are in the process of implementing \n     an electronic system for the issuance of hunting and fishing \n     licenses; and\n       Whereas, generally those systems for the electronic \n     issuance of hunting and fishing licenses allow for the \n     issuance of all licenses and permits and stamps which are \n     required by the state; however, no system at this time has \n     the authority to include issuance of the federal duck stamp \n     through its electronic system; and\n       Whereas, the authority to include issuance of the federal \n     duck stamp would enable a citizen to purchase all required \n     hunting and fishing licenses, permits, and stamps all at one \n     time, in one place, without the necessity of going to another \n     place to purchase just the federal duck stamp; and\n       Whereas, legislation has been prepared which would allow \n     each state the option of devising their own system to issue, \n     recognize, and account for a temporary electronic federal \n     duck stamp until such time as the actual duck stamp is \n     received in the mail.\n       Therefore; be it: Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature \n     does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to amend \n     the Federal Migratory Bird Conservation Act (16 U.S.C.A. 715) \n     to authorize certain states to issue temporary federal duck \n     stamp privileges through electronic license issuance systems.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-292. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the United States-Asia \n     Environmental Partnership, the Environmental Technology \n     Network for Asia, and the Council of State Governments' State \n     Environmental Initiative; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 222\n\n       Whereas, the United States Agency for International \n     Development established the United States-Asia Environmental \n     Partnership to address environmental degradation and \n     sustainable development issues in the Asia/Pacific region by \n     mobilizing the environmental experience, technology, and \n     services available in the United States; and\n       Whereas, the goals of the United States-Asia Environmental \n     Partnership are to foster and disseminate clean technology \n     and environmental management, to develop urban environmental \n     infrastructure, and to establish a policy framework to \n     sustain a ``clean revolution'' to protect the environment; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership \n     promotes the development of less-polluting and more resource-\n     efficient products, processes, and services as well as \n     practical solutions to local environmental problems in the \n     Asia/Pacific region; and\n       Whereas, along with its many partners, the United States-\n     Asia Environmental Partnership stimulates direct technology \n     transfer, develops networks and long-term relationships, \n     disseminates information, identifies financial assistance \n     vehicles, provides grants and fellowships, and organizes \n     business and technology exchanges; and\n       Whereas, the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership \n     has opened Offices of Technology Cooperation, in thirteen \n     Asian cities, staffed by experts who identify market \n     opportunities, make contacts, and advocate United States \n     environmental technology and services to Asian companies by \n     matching the problems of Asian companies with the appropriate \n     United States environmental experience and technology to \n     solve them; and\n       Whereas, the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership \n     and the Global Technology Network of the United States Agency \n     for International Development established the Environmental \n     Technology Network for Asia as a clearinghouse to collect \n     environmental trade leads from the Asia/Pacific region and \n     disseminate them to United States environmental technology \n     and services firms; and\n       Whereas, the Environmental Technology Network for Asia \n     assists program participants by preparing market trend \n     analyses on participating countries, providing business \n     counseling to United States environmental companies \n     interested in expanding into Asia, developing fact sheets on \n     United States technologies, and disseminating that \n     information to United States government counterparts \n     overseas; and\n       Whereas, through the Environmental Technology Network for \n     Asia, the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership has \n     created over eight thousand one hundred jobs, generated over \n     four thousand trade leads, and matched those leads with two \n     thousand four hundred environmental companies in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the Council of State Governments and the United \n     States-Asia Environmental Partnership established the State \n     Environmental Initiative, a matching grant program, to \n     encourage international partnerships in environment and \n     economic development between individual states and Asian \n     countries through the transfer of United States environmental \n     experience, technology, and practice from individual states \n     to Asian countries; and\n       Whereas, the goals of the State Environmental Initiative \n     are to promote the transfer of environmental expertise and \n     technology, facilitate partnerships that link Asian needs \n     with United States environmental experience, technology, and \n     practice, and to initiate a ``clean revolution'' in Asia by \n     promoting clean technology and responsible environmental \n     management; and\n       Whereas, the State Environmental Initiative fosters the \n     export of United States environmental solutions and \n     experience by matching the needs of Asian countries with \n     appropriate environmental technology and state environmental \n     regulatory experience, by informing United States \n     environmental firms about Asian opportunities, and by \n     sponsoring a matching grant program to encourage \n     international partnerships.\n       Therefore; be it: Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress \n     to continue to support and fund the United States-Asia \n     Environmental Partnership, the Environmental Technology \n     Network for Asia, and the Council of State Governments' State \n     Environmental Initiative.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-293. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the DeRidder Automated \n     Flight Service Station; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 216\n\n       Whereas, flight service stations are general aviation air \n     traffic control facilities that are an integral part of the \n     air traffic control system and are staffed with highly \n     skilled essential government employees; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations provide pilots with \n     current and forecasted whether at origination, en route, and \n     at destination, and also as necessary suggest appropriate \n     flight routes and levels and alternate routes or \n     destinations, based upon consideration of weather, operating \n     characteristics of the aircraft, navigation aids, and \n     terrain; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations provide pilot briefings, \n     en route flight advisories, search and rescue services, \n     assistance to lost and distressed aircraft, relay air traffic \n     control clearances, originate notices to airmen, monitor \n     pilot reports, broadcast aviation weather information, \n     receive and process flight plans, monitor navigational aids, \n     take weather observations, issue airport advisories, and \n     advise Customs and Immigration officials of flights crossing \n     national borders; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations provide up-to-the-minute \n     weather information in pilot briefings by integrating and \n     interpreting weather information from multiple sources such \n     as satellite imagery, upper air charts, and pilot weather \n     reports, to stay abreast of current weather trends; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations provide en route flight \n     advisories which are timely and pertinent weather information \n     bulletins prepared by specially trained and highly skilled \n     air traffic specialists who interpret and adapt the latest \n     weather information for the type, route, and altitude of a \n     specific en route flight; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations are valuable resources \n     that monitor flight plans and provide lifesaving search and \n     services by initiating a chain of events using the combined \n     efforts of several federal agencies to find aircraft that \n     become overdue; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations control airspace by \n     monitoring gliders and parachute jumps and provide emergency \n     security\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\n     control of air traffic when emergency conditions exist which \n     threaten national security by identifying the position of all \n     friendly air traffic and controlling the density of air \n     traffic operating in airspace critical to air defense \n     operations; and\n       Whereas, flight service stations began as aviation support \n     facilities known as airway radio stations that provided local \n     weather observations and forecasts for military aircraft in \n     World War I and later for air mail aircraft; and\n       Whereas, the Air Commerce Act brought airway radio stations \n     under the control of the Department of Commerce, and later \n     the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred aeronautical functions \n     from the Department of Commerce to the newly created Civil \n     Aeronautics Authority, which changed the name of the airway \n     radio station to the airway communication station; and\n       Whereas, during World War II, airway communication stations \n     provided air traffic control services to military aircraft, \n     and the rapid growth of postwar aviation led to the Federal \n     Aviation Act which merged the Civil Aeronautics Authority \n     with other agencies to create the Federal Aviation Agency; \n     and\n       Whereas, initially airborne pilots could only get verbatim \n     weather reports and forecasts, but in 1961 flight service \n     station personnel were trained as pilot weather briefers and \n     could summarize and interpret weather charts and reports to \n     provide pilot weather briefings aimed at reducing weather-\n     related aviation accidents; and\n       Whereas, after a series of fatal aviation accidents, the \n     Federal Aviation Agency was renamed the Federal Aviation \n     Administration and transferred to the Department of \n     Transportation with a focus on upgrading radar and computer \n     equipment to reduce weather-related aircraft accidents; and\n       Whereas, as a result of increasing traffic loads, the \n     flight service automation system was conceived to upgrade and \n     consolidate air navigation facilities to provide better and \n     more efficient air traffic control services; and\n       Whereas, in accordance with the flight service automation \n     system, the four hundred flight service stations in the \n     country have been consolidated into just over one hundred \n     automated flight service stations; and\n       Whereas, it is the policy of the United States that the \n     safe operation of the airport and airway system is the \n     highest aviation priority; and\n       Whereas, it is the duty of the administrator of the Federal \n     Aviation administration to implement this policy by \n     maximizing the effectiveness of the air traffic control \n     system and insuring that all air traffic control stations are \n     adequately staffed and equipped; and\n       Whereas, to improve air traffic control services and \n     increase air traffic safety, congress passed the Airport and \n     Airway Improvement Act of 1982, the Aviation Safety and \n     Capacity Expansion Act of 1990, and the Air Traffic \n     Management System Performance Improvement Act of 1996; and\n       Whereas, flight service station personnel are under a duty \n     to both pilots and their passengers to furnish accurate, \n     complete, and current weather information and to suggest \n     appropriate action to avoid storms and dangerous areas; and\n       Whereas, flight service station personnel are responsible \n     for the consequences of placing aircraft in a position of a \n     peril by negligently furnishing inaccurate weather \n     information; and\n       Whereas; because the United States has assumed the duty to \n     provide weather information to aircraft for the protection of \n     air travelers, it can be held liable under the Federal Tort \n     Claims Act for the negligence of flight service station \n     personnel who provide inaccurate information to aircraft that \n     rely on it to their detriment; and\n       Whereas; all of the flight service stations in Louisiana \n     have been consolidated into the DeRidder Automated Flight \n     Service Station, thus making its personnel responsible for \n     all of general aviation in the state; and\n       Whereas; adequate staffing of the DeRidder Automated Flight \n     Service Station is critical to providing general aviation \n     aircraft in Louisiana essential information for safe and \n     secure air travel; and\n       Whereas; the DeRidder Automated Flight Service Station \n     often services the entire state with only three or four air \n     traffic control specialists to cover five operational \n     positions; and\n       Whereas; due to the staffing situation, the supervisor of \n     the DeRidder Automated Flight Service Station will often have \n     to eliminate the recorded daily broadcast of general weather \n     information for pilots and the display of critical weather \n     information used by pilot weather briefers; and\n       Whereas; additional experienced personnel have not been \n     provided to alleviate the shortage, and the current staff \n     will soon begin spending more time training the new employees \n     that are being hired to replace those that are leaving; and\n       Whereas; when air traffic becomes too great for the staff, \n     the operational procedure is to transfer calls to another \n     automated flight service station, which results in degraded \n     services to the pilots because the pilot weather briefers \n     taking the transferred calls are not area rated for the state \n     of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas; this degradation of air traffic control services \n     could pose a serious safety risk to the flying public because \n     it weakens a critical link that pilots need to assess weather \n     conditions along their flight route; and\n       Whereas; considering that approximately half of all general \n     aviation aircraft accidents are weather-related, and that \n     Louisiana has the highest level of helicopter travel in the \n     nation, general aviation air travelers cannot afford to rely \n     on degraded air traffic control services.\n       Therefore, be it: Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress \n     to take such actions as are necessary to adequately fund and \n     staff the DeRidder Automated Flight Service Station.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-294. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the U.S. Geological \n     Survey's water resource programs; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 185\n\n       Whereas, water, in the form of floods, is a major natural \n     hazard to our country's people, property, and environment, \n     and the United States Geological Survey, the USGS, has long \n     been the source nationwide for reliable and accurate water \n     resources data of importance to many people who make critical \n     decisions daily which affect public health and safety; and\n       Whereas, with our ever-increasing population and \n     urbanization, there is a growing need to develop programs, \n     plans, and facilities to mitigate the effects of flooding \n     throughout the country; and\n       Whereas, the most accurate and universally used source of \n     water resources data is the USGS and the stream-gauging \n     network they have set up and operated across the country over \n     the period of several decades, which stream-gauging network \n     collects real-time river stage and discharge data which is \n     transmitted by satellite from more than 4,200 USGS stream-\n     gauging stations to various federal agencies such as the \n     National Weather Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n     and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where it is used \n     to make critical decisions for which inaccurate or inadequate \n     data would have a devastating impact; and\n       Whereas, the USGS budget for Fiscal Year 2000 anticipates a \n     ten percent reduction in the Federal-State Cooperative \n     program, within which several Louisiana state departments and \n     local agencies participate, a $2.5 million decrease for the \n     Clean Water Action Plan, and a four percent reduction in the \n     Hydrologic Network and Analysis Program; and\n       Whereas, these are all critical programs to the accuracy \n     and adequacy of water resources data across the country, and \n     particularly in the state of Louisiana where water is such a \n     large part of our lives, our public planning process, and \n     where river stage and discharge information are of critical \n     importance to the preservation of life, property, and water \n     quality, all at a time when the need for streamflow data is \n     increasing rather than decreasing.\n       Therefore, be it: Resolved by the House of Representatives \n     of the Louisiana Legislature, the Senate thereof concurring, \n     That the United States Congress is hereby memorialized to \n     restore budget cuts to the Fiscal Year 2000 budget for the \n     U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources Programs and \n     particularly its State-Federal Cooperative program.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     forwarded to each member of the Louisiana delegation and to \n     the presiding officer of each house of the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-295.

If Congress has given the \n     power to this court, we possess it, not otherwise''; and\n       Whereas, Justice Joseph Story, in his authoritative \n     Commentaries on the Construction, similarly declares, ``In \n     all cases where the judicial power of the United States is to \n     be exercised, it is for Congress alone to furnish the rules \n     of proceeding, to direct the process, to declare the nature \n     and effect of the process, and the mode, in which the \n     judgments, consequent thereon, shall be executed . . .

[The \n     power of Congress [is] complete to make exceptions'']; and\n       Whereas, this position is confirmed not only by the signers \n     of the Constitution themselves, such as George Washington and \n     James Madison, but also by other leading constitutional \n     experts and jurists of the day, including Chief Justice John \n     Rutledge, Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth, Chief Justice John \n     Marshall, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Yates, George Mason, and \n     John Randolph; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has long \n     recognized and affirmed this power of congress, to limit the \n     appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, as in 1847 when \n     the court declared that the ``court possesses no appellate \n     power in any case unless conferred upon it by act of \n     Congress'' and in 1865 when it declared ``it is for Congress \n     to determine how far . . . . appellate jurisdiction shall be \n     given; and when conferred, it can be exercised only to the \n     extent and in the manner prescribed by law''; and\n       Whereas, congress has on numerous occasions exercised this \n     power to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts, and the \n     Supreme Court has consistently upheld this power of congress \n     in rulings over the last two centuries, including cases in \n     1847, 1866, 1868, 1876, 1878, 1882, 1893, 1898, 1901, 1904, \n     1906, 1908, 1910, 1922, 1926, 1948, 1952, 1966, 1973, 1977, \n     etc; and\n       Whereas, it is congress alone which can remedy this current \n     crisis and return to the states the power to make their own \n     decisions on partial-birth abortions by excepting this issue \n     from the appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n       Therefore, be it: Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana respectfully appeals to the Congress of these \n     United States to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the \n     federal courts regarding the specific medical practice of \n     partial-birth abortions.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     sent to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the Chief Clerical Officers of the United States House of \n     Representatives and the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-305. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the Mississippi River \n     Gulf Outlet; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 266\n\n       Whereas, the construction and opening of the Mississippi \n     River Gulf Outlet (``Mr. Go'') in 1963 destroyed a 475-foot \n     wide, 37 mile long strip of wetlands and swamps in St. \n     Bernard Parish, and the channel has been further widened to \n     two thousand feet through years of ship traffic wakes eating \n     away at the banks of the channel; and\n       Whereas, because there are no longer natural levees formed \n     by winding bayous, water from the Gulf of Mexico moves \n     straight up ``Mr. Go'' unimpeded as though it were a \n     superhighway for storm surges caused by hurricanes and other \n     less severe storms, and such influx of water results in \n     increased flooding in St. Bernard Parish, Orleans Parish, and \n     Plaquemines Parish; and\n       Whereas, because of the destruction of wetlands and marshes \n     resultant from the construction of the Mississippi River Gulf \n     Outlet, there is increased saltwater intrusion which, in \n     turn, has resulted in increased destruction of marshes and \n     freshwater swamps surrounding Lake Borgne; and\n       Whereas, because of the saltwater intrusion, the hydrology \n     and animal and plant life of the Lake Pontchartrain and \n     Breton Sound basins have been dramatically altered, ``dead \n     zones'' have been created, and seafood yields have been \n     drastically reduced; and\n       Whereas, hurricane impact in addition to the impact from \n     ``Mr. Go'' make Plaquemines, Orleans, and St. Bernard \n     parishes particularly vulnerable to severe hurricane damage \n     and tropical storms and, in fact, tidal surges have already \n     been measured at speeds of over 18 feet per second; and\n       Whereas, the increased costs of maintaining the channel, \n     including $35 million spent to dredge the channel after \n     Hurricane Georges swept tons of silt into the channel which \n     blocked the channel to larger ships, an anticipated $7 to $10 \n     million needed each year to maintain the channel, and an \n     anticipated expenditure of another $35 million to rock the \n     north face of the channel, are hardly worth the benefit \n     received by the approximately two ships per day which use the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; and\n       Whereas, because of the continued and increased \n     deterioration of the channel and its detrimental impact on \n     the state's wetlands and coastal zone, the state of \n     Louisiana's coastal restoration plan, Coast 2050, calls for \n     the phasing out of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet:\n       Therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the U.S. Congress to \n     appoint a task force to develop a process and plan for the \n     timely closure of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet.\n       Be it further resolved, That the task force consist of a \n     policy committee and a technical advisory committee and that, \n     within the next twelve months, the task force design and \n     develop a program to phase out the Mississippi River Gulf \n     Outlet with a focus on public safety; maintenance of the \n     economic viability of the St. Bernard Port; and mitigation, \n     preservation, protection, and restoration of wetlands and \n     wetlands habitat.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     sent to the presiding officers of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States Congress, to each member \n     of the Louisiana congressional delegation, and to the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-306. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to military service \n     personnel under the age of twenty-one; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 157\n\n       Whereas, under the direction of President Slobodan \n     Milosevic, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has repeatedly \n     violated United Nations Security Council resolutions by \n     ordering the unrestrained assault by Yugoslav military, \n     police, and paramilitary forces on Kosovar civilians, thereby \n     creating a massive humanitarian catastrophe which also \n     threatens to destablize the surrounding region; and\n       Whereas, hundreds of thousands of people have been \n     ruthlessly expelled from Kosovo by the indiscriminate use of \n     force and stripped of their identity and dignity by the \n     Yugoslav government which is responsible for the appalling \n     violations of human rights; and\n       Whereas, the repression and humanitarian atrocities \n     supported by the Yugoslav government have escalated the \n     conflict between Serbian military and ethnic Albanian forces \n     in Kosovo; and\n       Whereas, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an \n     alliance based on political and military cooperation of \n     independent countries that are committed to safeguarding the \n     freedom, common heritage, and civilization of their peoples; \n     and\n       Whereas, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has \n     transformed its political and military structures to enable \n     it to participate in the development of cooperative security \n     structures for the whole of Europe and peacekeeping/crisis \n     management tasks undertaken in cooperation with countries \n     which are not members of the alliance; and\n       Whereas, the crisis in Kosovo respresents a fundamental \n     challenge to the principles of democracy, individual liberty, \n     human rights, and the rule of law, for which the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization has stood since its foundation \n     fifty years ago; and\n       Whereas, on March 24, 1999, in response to the deepening \n     humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Kosovo as Yugoslav military \n     and security forces continued their attacks on their own \n     people, the combined military forces of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization began an air combat operation, Operation \n     Allied Force, to force the Milosevic regime to withdraw its \n     forces and facilitate the return of refugees to their homes; \n     and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Operation Allied Force is to \n     disrupt, degrade, and destroy the Yugoslav military and \n     security forces in order to deter and prevent further \n     military actions against innocent civilians until President \n     Milosevic complies with the demands of the international \n     community; and\n       Whereas, despite continuous air bombing campaigns, \n     President Milosevic has refused to change his oppressive and \n     criminally irresponsible policy of ethnic cleansing and \n     rejected a political agreement that would bring peace and \n     stability to that region of Europe; and\n       Whereas, as a result of President Milosevic's continued \n     refusal to cease the oppression of the Kosovar civilians, the \n     leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are meeting \n     to discuss the possibility of expanding Operation Allied \n     Force by sending military ground troops to continue the fight \n     against Yugoslav military and security forces; and\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n       Whereas, sending military ground troops to fight against \n     Yugoslav military and security forces increases the \n     possibility that young American soldiers will be injured or \n     killed and become casualties of war; and\n       Whereas, as long as there are restrictions and \n     discrimination and the encouragement and enticement for \n     restrictions and discrimination based on age perpetuated by \n     the federal government and sustained by state governments on \n     persons aged eighteen through twenty years, such persons \n     should not be sent to participate in any combat operations \n     until such restrictions and discrimination and the enticement \n     and encouragement therefor cease to exist; and\n       Whereas, the young men and women of the United States armed \n     forces are the future military leaders of our nation.\n       Therefore, be it: Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress \n     to take such actions as are necessary to ensure that United \n     States military service personnel under the age of twenty-one \n     are not sent to participate in any compact operations carried \n     out by ground troops in Yugoslavia.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-307. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the compensation of \n     retired military personnel; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 205\n\n       Whereas, many American servicemen and women have dedicated \n     their careers to protect the rights and privileges that the \n     public at large enjoys and, in doing so, many also endured \n     hardships, privation, the threat of death or disability, and \n     long separations from their families; and\n       Whereas, career military personnel earn retirement benefits \n     based on longevity, which requires a minimum of twenty years \n     honorable and faithful service at the time of retirement and, \n     by contrast, veterans' disability compensation requires a \n     minimum of ninety days active duty service and is intended to \n     compensate for pain, suffering, disfigurement, chemical-\n     related injuries, wounds, and loss of earnings capacity; and\n       Whereas, military personnel contribute toward their \n     retirement pay with employee contributions which reduces \n     their congress-approved base pay which some assert is lower \n     than their civilian counterparts and which is paid based on a \n     life and career of hardship, long hours without overtime pay \n     and lack of freedom of expression through employee unions; \n     and\n       Whereas, integral to the success of the nation's military \n     forces are those soldiers and sailors who have made a career \n     of defending our great country in peace and war from the \n     revolutionary war to present day but, notwithstanding that \n     fact, there exists a gross inequity in the federal statutes \n     that denies disabled career military personnel equal rights \n     to receive veterans' disability compensation concurrent with \n     receipt of earned military retired pay; and\n       Whereas, veterans who are both retired and disabled are \n     denied concurrent receipt of full retirement pay and \n     disability pay, but instead may receive one or the other or \n     must have deducted from their retirement pay an amount equal \n     to the disability compensation being received by such \n     veterans, and no such deduction applies to federal civil \n     service so that a disabled veteran who has held a nonmilitary \n     federal job for the requisite duration receives full \n     longevity pay undiminished by the subtraction of disability \n     compensation pay; and\n       Whereas, this injustice and discrimination can only be \n     corrected by legislation which, if enacted into law, will \n     ensure that America's commitment to a strong military in \n     pursuit of national and international goals is a reflection \n     of the allegiance of those who sacrifice on behalf of those \n     goals.\n       Therefore, be it: Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress \n     to amend the United States Code, Chapter 71, relating to the \n     compensation of retired military personnel, to permit full, \n     concurrent receipt of military longevity pay and service-\n     connected disability compensation pay.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the president of the United States, to the \n     speaker of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     president of the United States Senate, and to the members of \n     the Louisiana congressional delegation that they may be \n     apprised of the sense of the Legislature of Louisiana in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-308.

A bill to title XVIII of the Social Security Act to promote \nthe coverage of frail elderly Medicare beneficiaries permanently \nresiding in nursing facilities in specialized health insurance programs \nfor the frail elderly; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n Medicare's Elderly Receiving Innovative Treatments (MERIT) Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Grams, in sponsoring \nthe Medicare's Elderly Receiving Innovative Treatments (MERIT) Act of \n1999.\n  This legislation ensures that frail elderly persons residing in \nnursing homes continue to have the opportunity for improved quality of \ncare and better health outcomes provided by the EverCare program. This \nprogram is reimbursed by Medicare on a capitated fee basis to managed \ncare organizations that deliver preventive and primary medical care \ngeared to the special needs of this population. Care is given by nurse \npractitioner/physician primary care teams which also coordinate care \nwhen the patient is hospitalized. Ideally, as much care as possible is \nprovided at the nursing home thus preventing the expense of \nhospitalization. A major goal is to maintain stability in the patients' \nlife by caring for them in their place of residence. The typical \npatient is over 85, 82 percent are female, 75 percent are on Medicaid \nand 70 percent have dementia.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires the Health Care \nFinancing Administration (HCFA) to establish a new risk-adjusted \nmethodology for payments to health plans which is to go into effect on \nJanuary 1, 2000. An interim risk adjusted payment will be based on \ninpatient hospital encounter data. However, an unintended consequence \nof this methodology may be a dramatic drop in EverCare payments by more \nthan 40 percent, according to Long Term Care Data Institute study. This \nwould jeopardize the program, which is currently comprised of \ndemonstration and non-demonstration components, since providers could \nnot afford to remain in business. HCFA recognized the possibly of this \nand did grant an exemption from the interim methodology for one year, \n2000-2001. HCFA, however, has not yet presented a methodology that \nwould be fair and adequate to ensure the continuance of EverCare.\n  This legislation exempts programs serving the frail elderly living in \nnursing homes from the phased in risk-adjustment payment methodology \nand continues payments using the current system. It directs HCFA to \ndevelop a distinct payment methodology which meets the needs of these \npatients and to establish performance measurement standards.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for an additional payment for services provided to certain \nhigh-cost individuals under the prospective payment system for skilled \nnursing facility service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n  Medicare Beneficiary Access To Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today along with the distinguished \nChairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and other \ncolleagues in introducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality \nNursing Home Care Act of 1999.'' This bill will help ensure that \nMedicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to vitally needed \nnursing home care services.\n  When Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the BBA, we \ncreated a new prospective payment system (PPS) for skilled nursing \nfacilities (SNF). While the industry generally supported the SNF PPS, \nthere clearly have been some unintended consequences as a result of the \nimplementation the new payment system which is now beginning to affect \npatient care.\n  We have an obligation to Medicare beneficiaries, and particularly \nthose in nursing homes as well as those who need to gain admission to \nnursing homes, to correct this problem. This legislation is designed \nspecifically to address the problem with patient access to nursing home \ncare.\n  The measure we are introducing today is designed to address two \nsignificant problems that have occurred as a result of the \nimplementation of the PPS.\n  First, the bill provides additional monies to care for the so-called \nhigh-acuity SNF patients who require non-therapy ancillary services for \nconditions such as cancer, hip fracture, and stroke.\n  Second, with respect to the market basket update, the bill closes the \ngap between the inaccurate inflation market basket estimate and the \nactual cost increases between fiscal years 1995 and 1998.\n  It is my understanding that both solutions could be easily \nimplemented by HCFA.\n  Mr. President, let me focus more specifically on each of the two \nprovisions.\n  With respect to non-therapy ancillary care, the bill proposes to add-\non additional monies under the federal per diem rate for 15 categories \nof care. We are now finding that high-acuity and medically complex \npatients are being shortchanged because the current case-mix system \ndoes not accurately measure or account for patients with high medical \ncomplexities which utilize greater ancillary services.\n  HCFA has even acknowledged that they do not have accurate data to \nproperly compensate for such non-therapy ancillary care. According to \nHCFA, they believe that more accurate data reflecting the case-mix for \nsicker patients should be available in 2001.\n  Unfortunately, we now know that beneficiaries are having difficulty \nreceiving non-therapy ancillary care today. For some, waiting 2 years \nfor the HCFA data is simply not an option.\n  Accordingly, the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing \nHome Care Act'' will provide interim relief until HCFA has developed \nmore complete and accurate data. The bill provides additional funds for \n15 RUS III categories, or the so-called resource utilization groups.\n  These RUGS were chosen because they represent categories of services \nthat closely match the diagnoses for high-acuity patients. Such \nadditional funds would only be provided for a two-year period, or less, \nuntil the Secretary of Health and Human Services has corrected the data \nto properly reflect the costs of non-therapy ancillary care.\n  It is my understanding that HCFA believes they can implement a new \ncase mix methodology within this time frame.\n  In response to concerns expressed to me by HCFA over Y2K problems and \nthe difficulty of any systems' changes at this point in the PPS \nimplementation, my bill provides for a simple, temporary add-on federal \ndollars to the federal per diem component.\n  Based on informal comments from HCFA officials, the bill should be \neasy for the agency to implement in time to have an immediate positive \nimpact on patient care.\n  The second feature in our bill attempts to close the gap between the \ninflation adjuster--the market basket update--and the actual cost \nincreases. Recent data are now showing that HCFA's market basket \nincrease is well below actual inflation costs for nursing home care.\n  When Congress passed the BBA, the year 1995 was chosen as the base \nyear for future inflation adjustments because it provided the most \nrecent set of complete cost reporting data for PPS implementation.\n  HCFA was charged with developing a market basket of nursing home \ngoods and services to trend forward to 1998, which was when PPS was \nimplemented. Unfortunately, it appears that HCFA has underestimated the \nmarket basket index by not considering the cost of nursing home \nservices. In addition, the statute requires the inflation adjuster to \nbe market basket minus one, which only makes the estimate worse.\n  Evidence is now available to illustrate that the market basket \nestimate is inadequate to properly compensate for nursing home care.\n  In 1996, HCFA's market basket increase was approximately 2.7 percent, \nwhile data now indicates that the actual cost increase was \napproximately 10.5 percent. Preliminary 1997 cost data reflect similar \ndifferences between the HCFA market basket index and the actual change \nin costs experienced by nursing facilities.\n  My legislation provides easily implemented relief to nursing homes \nwhich are being short changed by inadequate market basket estimates. \nThe bill eliminates the ``minus one'' from the inflation adjuster for \n1996, 1997, and 1998, thereby providing a one-percent increase of the \nindex over three years, compounded.\n  While there may need to be further modification to the actual market \nbasket, this straightforward legislative solution enables HCFA to \nimplement this provision immediately. This solution will provide \nmeaningful and practical relief to nursing homes so they can continue \nto provide quality care for the more medically complex Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, many nursing homes are on the verge of filing for \nbankruptcy and others may be closing their doors due to various PPS \nimplementation problems. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries are \nfinding themselves on long waiting lists to be admitted to a skilled \nnursing facility. Others are remaining in hospitals for extended stays, \nwhile they wait for nursing home availability.\n  The ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act'' \nis a common sense solution to address these very real problems. It \nprovides\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\ntwo solutions that HCFA can implement today without being mired in Year \n2000 compliance efforts.\n  I would add that I am pleased that the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, has indicated his interest in moving a \nbipartisan BBA technical bill following the August recess.\n  I have written to Senator Roth asking him to carefully review our \nskilled nursing facility bill as he develops a BBA technical \ncorrections bill over the next several weeks. I strongly believe this \nbill serves as a viable option on which to address the PPS problem that \nso many nursing homes are facing today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to my colleague and good \nfriend, Senator Domenici, for his valued help in developing the bill \nwith me as well as to the many others Senators who have joined us today \nas cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access \n     to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act are experiencing decreased \n     access to skilled nursing facility services due to inadequate \n     reimbursement under the prospective payment system for such \n     services under section 1888(e) of such Act.\n       (2) Such inadequate reimbursement may force skilled nursing \n     facilities to file for bankruptcy and close their doors, \n     resulting in reduced access to skilled nursing facility \n     services for medicare beneficiaries.\n       (3) The methodology under the prospective payment system \n     for skilled nursing facility services has made it more \n     difficult for medicare beneficiaries to find nursing home \n     care. Some beneficiaries are remaining in hospitals for \n     extended stays due to reduced access to nursing homes. Others \n     are placed in nursing homes that are hours away from family \n     and friends.\n       (4) The Health Care Financing Administration has indicated \n     that the prospective payment system for skilled nursing \n     facility services does not accurately account for the costs \n     associated with providing medically complex care (non-therapy \n     ancillary services and supplies). Due to Year 2000 problems, \n     the Health Care Financing Administration claims that it will \n     be unable to properly account for such costs under such \n     system.\n       (5) The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has \n     indicated that payments to skilled nursing facilities under \n     the medicare program may not be adequate for beneficiaries \n     who need relatively high levels of non-therapy ancillary \n     services and supplies. According to MedPAC, such inadequate \n     funding could result in access problems for beneficiaries \n     with medically complex conditions.\n       (6) In order to provide adequate payment under the \n     prospective payment system for skilled nursing facility \n     services, such system must take into account the costs \n     associated with providing 1 or more of the following \n     services:\n       (A) Ventilator care.\n       (B) Tracheostomy care.\n       (C) Care for pressure ulcers.\n       (D) Care associated with individuals that have experienced \n     a stroke or a hip fracture.\n       (E) Care for non-vent, non-trach pneumonia.\n       (F) Dialysis.\n       (G) Infusion therapy.\n       (H) Deep vein thrombosis.\n       (I) Care associated with individuals with transient \n     peripheral neuropathy, a chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, a wound \n     infection, a respiratory infection, sepsis, tuberculosis, \n     HIV, or cancer.\n       (7) A temporary legislative solution is necessary in order \n     to ensure that medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions \n     continue to receive access to appropriate skilled nursing \n     facility services.\n       (8) The skilled nursing facility market basket increase \n     over the last 3 years evidences a critical payment gap that \n     exists between the actual cost of providing services to \n     medicare beneficiaries residing in a skilled nursing facility \n     and the reimbursement levels for such services under the \n     prospective payment system. In addition, the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, in establishing the skilled nursing \n     facility market basket index under section 1888(e)(5)(A) of \n     the Social Security Act only accounted for the cost of goods, \n     but not for the cost of services, as such section requires.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Hatch \nin introducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing \nHome Care Act of 1999.''\n  I am convinced that this bill is urgently needed to assure our senior \ncitizens have access to quality nursing home care through the Medicare \nprogram.\n  We can all take a certain amount of pride in the bipartisan Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, which contained the most sweeping reforms for \nMedicare since the program was enacted in 1965. These reforms have \nextended the solvency of the program to 2015 and brought new health \ncoverage options to seniors throughout the country.\n  However, it should come as no surprise that legislation as complex as \nthe Balanced Budget Act (BBA), as well as its implementation by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, has produced some unintended \nconsequences that need to be corrected.\n  That is exactly the situation in the case of nursing homes. The \ntransition to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing \nFacilities (SNFs) that was contained in the BBA is seriously \nthreatening access to needed care for seniors all across the country.\n  In May, 63 Senators joined with me in sending a bipartisan appeal to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services urging her to address the \ngrowing crisis in the nursing home industry through administrative \naction. To date, we have received no direct response from the Secretary \non this matter, nor has the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \nshown any willingness to address the problem.\n  With time quickly running out on many nursing home operators, I \nbelieve Congress must act before it is too late to assure our seniors \nwill continue to have access to quality nursing home care.\n  Let me note that Congress is not alone in believing there is a \nproblem here. Dr. Gail Wilensky, the Chair of the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, recently testified before the Senate Finance \nCommittee that some Medicare patients are having difficulty accessing \ncare in skilled nursing facilities. Dr. Wilensky went on to say that \nthe current reimbursement system adopted by HCFA does not adequately \naccount for patients requiring high levels of nontherapy ancillary \nservices and supplies.\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\n  In New Mexico, there are currently 81 nursing homes in the state \nserving about 6,000 patients, and I am convinced that the current \nMedicare payment system, as implemented by HCFA, simply does not \nprovide enough funds to cover the costs being incurred by these \nfacilities when they care for our senior citizens.\n  For rural states like New Mexico, corrective action is critically \nimportant. Many communities in my state are served by a single facility \nthat is the only provider for many miles. If such a facility were to \nclose, patients in that home would be forced to move to facilities much \nfarther away from their families. Moreover, nursing homes in smaller, \nrural communities often operate on a razor thin bottom line, and, for \nthem, the reductions in Medicare reimbursements have been especially \ndevastating.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would go a long way toward \nrestoring stability in the nursing home industry. It would increase \nreimbursement rates through two provisions.\n  First, a 2-year period, the bill modestly increases payments for 15 \nhigh acuity conditions, like cancer, hip fracture, and stroke. At the \nend of 2 years, HCFA expects that they will have the data to more \nproperly reflect the high costs of these cases in the payment system.\n  Second, the bill eliminates the one percentage point reduction in the \nannual inflation update for all reimbursement rates for skilled nursing \nfacilities.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and the other cosponsors \nof this bill in pushing for passage of this critical legislation when \nwe return in September.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1501. A bill to improve motor carrier safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            the motor carrier safety improvement act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. I am pleased to introduce the Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act of 1999. This measure is designed to remedy certain \nweaknesses regarding the Federal motor carrier safety program as \nidentified by the Department of Transportation's Inspector General (DOT \nIG) in April 1999. The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act also \ncontains several new initiatives intended to advance safety on our \nnation's roads and highways.\n  The bill would establish a separate Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration within the DOT. That agency would be responsible for \ncarrying out the Federal motor carrier safety enforcement and \nregulatory responsibilities currently held by the Federal Highway \nAdministration. It would be headed by an Administrator, appointed by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate.\n  To guard against increasing the already bloated Federal bureaucracy, \nthe bill would cap employment and funding at the levels currently \nendorsed by the Administration for motor carrier safety activities. \nThis legislation also recognizes the significant differences between \ntruck operations and passenger carrying operations and accordingly, \nwould call for a separate division within the new agency to ensure \ncommercial bus safety.\n  Aside from organizational issues, the Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act would require the Department to implement all the IG's \nrecently issued truck safety recommendations. DOT has indicated it will \nact on some of the recommendations, but it has failed to articulate a \ndefinitive action plan to implement all of the IG's recommendations. We \nshould not risk the consequences of ignoring the IG's recommendations \nand this bill would require action to eliminate the identified safety \ngaps at DOT. In addition, it would authorize additional funding as \nrequested by the Administration to address safety shortcomings. It also \nincludes a number of items to address truck safety and enforcement, \nincluding provisions to strengthen the Commercial Drivers License \nProgram, to improve data collection activities and to promote the \naccurate exchange of driver information among the states.\n  I want to take a moment to share with my colleagues how I reached the \ndecision to develop this measure.\n  In the last Congress, a comprehensive package of motor carrier and \nhighway safety provisions was enacted as part the Transportation Equity \nAct for the 21st Century (TEA-21). This package was developed over a \ntwo-year period. Throughout the 105th Congress, the primary impediment \nfaced by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation when \ncrafting our highway safety legislation was an insufficient allocation \nof contract authority from the highway trust fund. Despite this serious \nconstraint, the Committee did succeed in raising the authorizations for \nmotor carrier and highway safety programs. At the same time, the \nCommittee also succeeded in incorporating into TEA-21 almost every \nsafety initiative brought to the Committee's attention.\n\n  Several months after TEA-21 was signed into law, I asked the IG to \nassess a proposal to move the then Office of Motor Carriers (OMC) form \nthe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The proposal was being advanced \nby the Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation who was, and is, concerned about OMC's effectiveness in \noverseeing the safety of our nation's truck and bus industries, \nconcerns I share overall.\n  The proposal, originally contained in an appropriations bill, was \neliminated when it was brought to the House Floor. Consequently, I was \nsurprised to learn of its resurrection as a line item in early drafts \nof the conference report on the Omnibus Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 1999. I remind my colleagues that the transfer had never been \nincluded in any House or Senate-passed legislation, nor had any of the \nauthorizing Committees of jurisdiction ever been asked to consider it \nat all in the 105th Congress.\n  Rather than enact measures that have surface appeal, it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress to ascertain whether the proposals would \nbe effective. I felt it very important that we first determine whether \nNHTSA was the most appropriate entity to oversee truck safety before \nrequiring it to take on such critical yet unfamiliar responsibilities. \nThat is why I asked for the IG's counsel.\n  I chaired a hearing in April at which the IG released his report and \noffered several ways to improve motor carrier safety. The IG's report \ndoes not endorse transferring the responsibilities to NHTSA. While this \nand several options were discussed, the IG stressed that the greatest \nproblem impeding the effectiveness of the Office of Motor Carriers was \na fundamental lack of leadership as currently structured. I repeat, the \nIG found that leadership was the greatest gap hindering truck safety \nadvancements.\n  One way to raise the visibility of truck safety and bring leadership \nto motor carrier safety issues is to create an entity that has motor \ncarrier safety as its sole purpose. Given that we have agencies \nresponsible for air, rail, and highway safety, it seems within reason \nto provide similar treatment in this modal area, particularly given the \nmany identified problems stemming from a lack of attention within its \ncurrent structure.\n  Further, creating a direct link with the Office of the Secretary \nwould guarantee that motor carrier safety share holders, including \nowners, operators, drivers, safety advocates and even government \nemployees, would not be forced to vie for an agency's attention, forced \nto compete against highway construction and other interests as is \ncurrently the case. As we have regrettably learned, the scales of \nsafety and highway construction are not balanced and we need to take \naction to alter this inequity.\n  Other legislative proposals have been offered in recent days. I \nassure my colleagues that I am willing to review those measures and \nlisten to other suggestions to improve this legislation.\n  In the many meetings and hearings that have been held to discuss \noptions to enhance highway safety, it became very clear that all motor \ncarrier stake holders share a common goal. We want to improve truck and \nbus safety, decrease highway accidents, and reduce accident fatalities. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues, the Administration, \nhighway safety groups, safety enforcement officials, and truck and \nmotor coach representatives to achieve a realistic and effective safety \nbill. To attempt to do less would be an abrogation of our \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1502. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nrequire mandatory spending limits for Senate candidates and limits on \nindependent expenditures, to ban soft money, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n               THE CAMPAIGN SPENDING CONTROL ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation I am \nintroducing, the Campaign Spending Control Act of 1999. I introduced \nsimilar legislation in 1997. Unfortunately, in the last two years we \nhave only seen the financial excesses of our campaign system grow, \nfurther disenfranchising and disillusioning voters. If our government \nis to regain the confidence and participation of the electorate, \nenactment of this legislation is more necessary today than it was two \nyears ago.\n  Mr. President, two independent public policy groups recently released \nsurveys gauging the public's opinion of their federal government. The \nnews, once again, was not good for our democracy.\n  Earlier this month the Council for Excellence in Government released \na nonpartisan poll, conducted by respected pollsters Peter Hart and \nRobert Teeter, which demonstrated that less than four in ten Americans \nnow believe that President Lincoln's refrain, that our government is \n``of, by, and for the people'' is accurate. While past disillusionment \nwith government was directed at so-called ``unaccountable \nbureaucrats,'' today most Americans blame the moneyed special interests \nand the politicians and their political parties for the fact that \ngovernment is not accountable to the average citizen. Patricia \nMcGinnis, the Council's President, characterized the poll as \ndemonstrating that ``we have an anemic democracy, badly in need of \ninvolvement and ownership by its citizens.''\n  Back in January of this year the Center on Policy Attitudes, released \na nonpartisan poll which showed continued record high public \ndissatisfaction with government. This finding is disconcerting given \nthat our nation is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom coupled \nwith military security. Nonetheless, the Center's study showed that \nless than one in three Americans ``trust the government in Washington \nto do what is right'' most of the time. The study concludes that \n``[t]he public's dissatisfaction with the US government is largely due \nto the perception that elected officials, acting in their self-\ninterest, give priority to special interests and partisan agendas, over \nthe interests of the public as a whole.'' Specifically, the survey \nfound that three in four Americans believe that the government is ``run \nfor the benefit of a few big interests.''\n  Mr. President, I believe that the biggest culprit fueling the public \nperception that politicians, political parties, and representational \ngovernment is beholden to special interests, not the needs of the \naverage citizen, is our campaign financing system. When politicians \ndepend upon wealthy special interests, which represent less than one \npercent of the citizenry, for the political contributions that fuel \ncampaigns the public is left to conclude that its voice will not, \ncannot, be heard, never mind addressed.\n  The 1996 elections produced record spending: over 2.7 billion \ndollars, or approximately 28 dollars per voter. All this money produced \nrecord-low voter participation. These two tragic facts are inextricably \nlinked. Most Americans believe our current campaign system is tainted \nby a flood of special interest money, drowning out their voice, making \ntheir participation meaningless, and leaving their concerns \nunaddressed.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the excesses of 1996 were only \nmultiplied in 1998. Funded by unregulated, unlimited ``soft money'' \ncontributions, the use of unaccountable ``issue ads'' tripled. Without \nthe ability to check either the facts or the sponsors of these ads, \nAmericans became more cynical and less likely to participate. \nCandidates, on the other hand, are forced to raise money to not only \nmatch the resources and the advertising, of their opponent, but also \noutside groups that are running ``issue ads.''\n  Those challenging sitting Members of Congress are most disadvantaged \nby our financing system: in 1998 almost half of the House of \nRepresentatives faced opponents with little or no funding. The money \nchase saps a candidate's time, limiting the ability and incentive to \ndebate, attend forums, and otherwise engage voters. Even the donors \ndislike the current system: with many corporate leaders announcing \ntheir opposition to, and unwillingness to participate in, the current \nsystem. We are trapped in a system that no one, not the voters, not the \ncandidates, not the donors, thinks proper.\n  The roots of this abysmal situation can be traced to a misguided \nSupreme Court decision. In Buckley v. Valeo, a 1976 case which \nchallenged the 1974 campaign reform legislation, the Court held that, \nin order to avoid corruption, or its appearance, political \ncontributions could be limited. However, the Court invalidated campaign \nexpenditure limits. The Court surmised that, given the contribution \nlimit reforms, expenditure limits were not only unnecessary but would \nstifle unlimited and in-depth debate stimulated by greater campaign \nspending. This conjecture has been proven absolutely false by over \ntwenty years of practical experience.\n  The single most important step to reform elections and revitalize our \ndemocracy is to reverse the Buckley decision by limiting the amount of \nmoney that a candidate or his allies can spend.\n  For this reason Senator Johnson and I are introducing legislation \nwhich directly challenges the Buckley decision and places mandatory \nlimits on all campaign expenditures. These limits do not favor \nincumbents. Historically, these limits would have restricted almost \nfour out of five incumbents, while impacting only a handful of \nchallengers. Additionally, this legislation would fully ban corporate \ncontributions, as well as unlimited and unregulated contributions by \nwealthy individuals and organizations. Further, our bill would limit \ncampaign expenditures by supposedly, neutral, independent groups, and \nrestrict corporations, labor unions, and other organizations from \ninfluencing campaigns under the guise of issue advocacy. The end result \nof this legislation would be to eliminate over a half-billion dollars \nfrom the system, encourage challenges to incumbents, and further \npromote debate among both candidates and the electorate.\n  What effect would these limits have on political debate? Contrary to \nthe Supreme Court, I believe such limits would increase dialogue. \nCandidates would be free from the burdens of unending fundraising and \nthus be available to participate in debates, forums, and interviews. \nWith greater access to candidates and less reason to believe that \ncandidates were captives of their contributors, voters might well be \nmore prepared to invest the time needed to be informed on issues of \nconcern and ask candidates to address them.\n  Some of the most extreme defenders of our current campaign financing \nsystem will argue that this legislation impinges upon freedom of \nspeech. In analyzing this criticism it is important to remember that \nthe vast majority of Americans, ninety-six percent, have never made a \npolitical contribution. The bill will marginally restrict the rights of \na few to contribute and spend money--not speak--so that the majority of \nvoters might restore their faith in the process. Campaign finances will \nbe restricted no more than necessary to fulfill several compelling \ninterests, the most important of which is the people's faith in their \ngovernment. Such a restriction conforms with Constitutional \njurisprudence and has been demonstrated as necessary by history. The \nfact is all democratic debates are restricted by rules. My legislation \nwould simply reinstall some rules into our political campaigns while \ndirectly impacting very few Americans.\n\n  Another criticism of this bill will be that it goes too far. Many \nreform proponents argue that we should concentrate on more modest \ngains. It is irrefutable that today, Congress struggles to consider \neven the most modest of reforms, such as banning so called soft money: \nunlimited donations by corporations, labor unions, and wealthy \nindividuals to political party committees. Unfortunately the debate in \nCongress has regressed terribly from the original McCain-Feingold bill,\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nwhich addressed runaway campaign expenditures with voluntary spending \nlimits. Yet, there are also reasons to be optimistic about \nimplementation of substantial campaign reform.\n  Reform has broad public support and has grown into a major grass-\nroots initiative outside of Washington, DC. Elected officials from \nthirty-three states have urged that the Buckley decision be revisited \nand limits implemented. Legislative bodies in Ohio and Vermont have \nimplemented sweeping reform by enacting mandatory caps on candidate \nexpenditures. Other states, such as my own, have embraced public \nfinancing as a more modest, but significant, means of reform. On \nelection day in 1998 voters in Arizona and Massachusetts approved \nsignificant reforms, both of which would ban so called ``soft money'' \nas well as encourage contribution and spending limits through voluntary \npublic financing. Currently, campaign finance reform is enacted or \nbeing pursued in more than forty states. While significant reform may \nbe a major step for Congress; our constituents and their state and \nlocal representatives are implementing important reform throughout the \nnation.\n  Unfortunately, because of the overly restrictive and confused \njurisprudence flowing from the Buckley decision, many of these popular \ninitiatives face years of special interest challenge in court. Indeed, \nthe most effective reforms will, most likely, be struck down by trial \ncourts. While I enthusiastically support any substantive reform, if we \nare to address the underlying cancer which has disintegrated voter \ntrust and participation, the problem of unlimited expenditures must be \ndirectly confronted. As I have already stated, this is a step that one \nmunicipality and two states have embraced. Many more state officials as \nwell as prominent constitutional law scholars have urged such a course. \nExpenditure limitations have been proposed by Congressional reformers \nin the past, and it is time to rededicate ourselves to this goal. The \nlargest impediment to such reform is the Supreme Court, and I believe \nthat there is, again, reason to be optimistic that the Court will \naccommodate such reform in the near future.\n  Currently, the Court has before it a case which challenges the \nBuckley decision. In Buckley, the Court upheld against First Amendment \nchallenge the $1,000 federal contribution limit passed by Congress. In \nShrink Missouri Government PAC v. Adams, the case currently under \nreview by the Supreme Court, the Eighth Circuit struck down as \nunconstitutional Missouri's virtually identical state-wide contribution \nlimit of $1,075, holding that only proof of corruption can justify \ncontribution limits. I have led several members of Congress in an \namicus brief to the Court.\n  Mr. President, our brief makes two arguments. First, it demonstrates \nthat the Eighth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Buckley and should be reversed on that ground \nalone. Second, it contends that the Court should give legislatures the \nleeway to pass reforms that will respond meaningfully to the erosion of \npublic confidence in the government created by the current campaign \nfinancing system.\n  This leeway can be provided in two ways. First, the Court should \nreview campaign finance reforms under a deferential standard of \nreview--``intermediate'' scrutiny rather than ``strict'' scrutiny--as \nlong as the legislature does not justify the reforms on the \ncommunicative impact of the speech at issue. Second, the Court should \nrecognize the institutional competence uniquely possessed by \nlegislatures both to identify threats to the integrity of the electoral \nsystem and to implement corresponding reforms.\n  The amicus brief does not advocate any particular type of reform, but \nrather urges the Court to provide leeway for legislatures to enact \nnecessary reforms. It is my hope that this case, while not changing the \nfundamental holding of Buckley, will stimulate the Court to provide \ngreater deference to legislatures that seek to address the threat that \ncampaign financing, and the cynicism it creates, poses to our \ndemocracy.\n  Once such leeway has been provided, the Court will be forced to \nrevisit its holding that spending money is the functional equivalent to \nspeaking. Experience since this 1976 decision should force the Court to \nrealize that while money fuels speech, at some point, financial \nexpenditures only increase a speaker's volume. Spending has now reached \na shrill pitch that the vast majority of Americans want addressed. \nElected representatives in thirty three states and countless grassroots \nofficials agree with this sentiment. The legislation I have introduced \ntoday will implement such reform, restoring rules to our political \ndebate, encouraging public participation, and thus stimulating faith in \nour democracy. I thank Senator Johnson for his support in this \nendeavor.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS OF FACT.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The current Federal campaign finance system, with its \n     perceived preferential access to lawmakers for interest \n     groups capable of contributing sizable sums of money to \n     lawmakers' campaigns, has caused a widespread loss of public \n     confidence in the fairness and responsiveness of elective \n     government and undermined the belief, necessary to a \n     functioning democracy, that the Government exists to serve \n     the needs of all people.\n       (2) The United States Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, \n     424 U.S. 1 (1976), disapproved the use of mandatory spending \n     limits as a remedy for such effects, while approving the use \n     of campaign contribution limits.\n       (3) Since 1976, campaign expenditures have risen steeply in \n     Federal elections with spending by successful candidates for \n     the United States Senate between 1976 and 1996 rising from \n     $609,100 to $3,775,000, an increase that is twice the rate of \n     inflation.\n       (4) As campaign spending has escalated, voter turnout has \n     steadily declined and in 1996 voter turnout fell to its \n     lowest point since 1924, and stands now at the lowest level \n     of any democracy in the world.\n       (5) Coupled with out-of-control campaign spending has come \n     the constant necessity of\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\n     fundraising, arising, to a large extent, from candidates \n     adopting a defensive ``arms race'' posture of constant \n     readiness against the risk of massively financed attacks \n     against whatever the opposing candidate may say or do.\n       (6) The current campaign finance system has had a \n     deleterious effect on those who hold public office as endless \n     fundraising pressures intrude upon the performance of \n     constitutionally required duties. Capable and dedicated \n     officials have left office in dismay over these distractions \n     and the negative public perceptions that the fundraising \n     process engenders and numerous qualified citizens have \n     declined to seek office because of the prospect of having to \n     raise the extraordinary amounts of money needed in today's \n     elections.\n       (7) The requirement for candidates to raise funds, the \n     average 1996 expenditure level required a successful Senate \n     candidate to raise more than $12,099 a week for 6 years, \n     significantly impedes on the ability of Senators and other \n     officeholders to tend to their official duties, and limits \n     the ability of candidates to interact with the electorate \n     while also tending to professional responsibilities.\n       (8) As talented incumbent and potential public servants are \n     deterred from seeking office in Congress because of such \n     fundraising pressures, the quality of representation suffers \n     and those who do serve are impeded in their effort to devote \n     full attention to matters of the Government by the campaign \n     financing system.\n       (9) Contribution limits are inadequate to control all of \n     these trends and as long as campaign spending is effectively \n     unrestrained, supporters can find ways to protect their \n     favored candidates from being outspent. Since 1976, major \n     techniques have been found and exploited to get around and \n     evade contribution limits.\n       (10) Techniques to evade contribution limits include \n     personal spending by wealthy candidates, independent \n     expenditures that assist or attack an identified candidate, \n     media campaigns by corporations, labor unions, and nonprofit \n     organizations to advocate the election or defeat of \n     candidates, and the use of national, State, or local \n     political parties as a conduit for money that assists or \n     attacks such candidates.\n       (11) Wealthy candidates may, under the present Federal \n     campaign financing system, spend any amount they want out of \n     their own resources and while such spending may not be self-\n     corrupting, it introduces the very defects the Supreme Court \n     wanted to avoid. The effectively limitless character of such \n     resources obliges a wealthy candidate's opponent to reach for \n     larger amounts of outside support, causing the deleterious \n     effects previously described.\n       (12) Experience shows that there is an identity of interest \n     between candidates and political parties because the parties \n     exist to support candidates, not the other way around. Party \n     expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, an \n     identifiable candidate are, therefore, effectively spending \n     on behalf of a candidate.\n       (13) Political experience shows that so-called \n     ``independent'' support, whether by individuals, committees, \n     or other entities, can be and often is coordinated with a \n     candidate's campaign by means of tacit understandings without \n     losing its nominally independent character and, similarly, \n     contributions to a political party, ostensibly for ``party-\n     building'' purposes, can be and often are routed, by \n     undeclared design, to the support of identified candidates.\n       (14) The actual, case-by-case detection of coordination \n     between candidate, party, and independent contributor is, as \n     a practical matter, impossible in a fast-moving campaign \n     environment.\n       (15) So-called ``issue advocacy'' communications, by or \n     through political parties or independent contributors, need \n     not advocate expressly for the election or defeat of a named \n     candidate in order to cross the line into election campaign \n     advocacy; any clear, objective indication of purpose, such \n     that voters may readily observe where their electoral support \n     is invited, can suffice as evidence of intent to impact a \n     Federal election campaign.\n       (16) When State political parties or other entities \n     operating under State law receive funds, often called ``soft \n     money'', for use in Federal elections, they become de facto \n     agents of the national political party and the inclusion of \n     these funds under applicable Federal limitations is necessary \n     and proper for the effective regulation of Federal election \n     campaigns.\n       (17) The exorbitant level of money in the political system \n     has served to distort our democracy by giving some \n     contributors, who constitute less than 3 percent of the \n     citizenry, the appearance of favored access to elected \n     officials, thus undermining the ability of ordinary citizens \n     to petition their Government. Concerns over the potential for \n     corruption and undue influence, and the appearances thereof, \n     has left citizens cynical, the reputation of elected \n     officials tarnished, and the moral authority of Government \n     weakened.\n       (18) The 2 decades of experience since the ruling of the \n     Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 have made it \n     evident that reasonable limits on election campaign \n     expenditures are now necessary and these limits must \n     comprehensively address all types of expenditures to prevent \n     circumvention of such limits.\n       (19) The Supreme Court based its Buckley v. Valeo decision \n     on a concern that spending limits could narrow political \n     speech ``by restricting the number of issues discussed, the \n     depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience \n     reached''. The experience of the past 20 years has been \n     otherwise as experience shows that unlimited expenditures can \n     drown out or distort political discourse in a flood of \n     distractive repetition. Reasonable spending limits will \n     increase the opportunity for previously muted voices to be \n     heard and thereby increase the number, depth, and diversity \n     of ideas presented to the public.\n       (20) Issue advocacy communications that do not promote or \n     oppose an identified candidate should remain unregulated, as \n     should the traditional freedom of the press to report and \n     editorialize about candidates and campaigns.\n       (21) In establishing reasonable limits on campaign \n     spending, it is necessary that the limits reflect the \n     realities of modern campaigning in a large, diverse \n     population with sophisticated and expensive modes of \n     communication. The limits must allow citizens to benefit from \n     a full and free debate of issues and permit candidates to \n     garner the resources necessary to engage in that debate.\n       (22) The expenditure limits established in this Act for \n     election to the United States Senate were determined after \n     careful review of historical spending patterns in Senate \n     campaigns as well as the particular spending level of the 3 \n     most recent elections as evidenced by the following:\n       (A) The limit formula allows a candidate a level of \n     spending which guarantees an ability to disseminate the \n     candidate's message by accounting for the size of the \n     population in each State as well as historical spending \n     trends including the demonstrated trend of lower campaign \n     spending per voter in larger States as compared to voter \n     spending in smaller States.\n       (B) The candidate expenditure limits included in this \n     legislation would have restricted 80 percent of the incumbent \n     candidates in the last 3 elections, while only impeding 18 \n     percent of the challengers.\n       (C) It is clear from recent experience that expenditure \n     limits as set by the formula in this Act will be high enough \n     to allow an effective level of competition, encourage \n     candidate dialogue with constituents, and circumscribe the \n     most egregiously high spending levels, so as to be a bulwark \n     against future campaign finance excesses and the resulting \n     voter disenfranchisement.\n                TITLE I--SENATE ELECTION SPENDING LIMITS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Ethics through fiscal year 2003; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs\n\n\n       the office of government ethics authorization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement \nby Senator Lieberman and myself regarding the ``Office of Government \nEthics Authorization Act of 1999'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\n   Joint Statement by Senator Fred Thompson, Chairman, Committee on \n Governmental Affairs, and Senator Joseph Lieberman, Ranking Minority \n Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, on the Introduction of the \n       ``Office of Government Ethics Authorization Act of 1999''\n\n       Today we are pleased to join together in introducing the \n     ``Office of Government Ethics Authorization Act of 1999.'' \n     This legislation would reauthorize the Office of Government \n     Ethics for four years, through the end of fiscal year 2003.\n       The Office of Government Ethics was created in 1978 to \n     administer the Ethics in Government Act. The Office was \n     established as a separate agency in the Executive branch, \n     independent from the Office of Personnel Management, as part \n     of the Office's reauthorization in 1988. The Office is headed \n     by a Director who is appointed to serve a 5-year term with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate. The current Director, \n     Stephen Potts, is serving his second term which expires in \n     August 2000.\n       The Office has responsibility for Executive branch policies \n     relating to preventing conflicts of interest on the part of \n     officers and employees in the Executive branch. The Office is \n     a small and respected agency and promotes policies and \n     ethical standards that are implemented by a network of more \n     than 120 Designated Agency Ethics Officers. The Office also \n     provides training and educational programs in an effort to \n     provide guidance to employees throughout the government.\n       The Office's current authorization is set to expire at the \n     end of this fiscal year. In introducing this legislation, it \n     is our expectation for the Committee on Governmental Affairs \n     and the Senate to act on a timely basis in reauthorizing this \n     agency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1504. A bill to improve health care quality and reduce health care \ncosts by establishing a National Fund for Health Research that would \nsignificantly expand the Nation's investment in medical research; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 national fund for health research act\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \n``National Fund for Health Research Act of 1999''. And I am \nparticularly pleased to be joined in this effort by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Specter. This bill is similar to legislation I \nintroduced with Senator Specter in the 105th Congress, and with Senator \nHatfield during the 104th Congress. The bill gained broad bipartisan \nsupport in both the House and Senate.\n  Our proposal would establish a National Fund for Health Research to \nprovide additional resources for health research over and above those \nprovided to the National Institutes of Health in the annual \nappropriations process. The Fund would greatly enhance the quality of \nhealth care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures and \ncost-effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that \nstrike Americans.\n  To finance the Fund, health plans would set aside approximately 1 \npercent of all health premiums and transfer the funds to the National \nFund for Health Research.\n  Each year under our proposal amounts within the National Fund for \nHealth Research would automatically be allocated to each of the NIH \nInstitutes and Centers. Each Institute and Center would receive the \nsame percentage as they received of the total NIH appropriation for \nthat fiscal year. The set aside would result in a significant annual \nbudget increase for NIH.\n  In 1994 I argued that any health care reform plan should include \nadditional funding for health research. Systematic health care reform \nhas been taken off the front burner but the need to increase our \nnation's commitment to health research has not diminished.\n  While health care spending devours over $1 trillion annually our \nmedical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States \ndevotes less than 3 percent of its total health care budget to health \nresearch. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on \nresearch. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war \nagainst disease and disability continues.\n  Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health \ncosts in the long run. For example, the costs of Alzheimer's will more \nthan triple in the coming century--adding further strains to Medicare \nas the baby boomers retire. We know that through research there is a \nreal hope of a major breakthrough in this area. Simply delaying the \nonset of Alzheimer's by 5 years would save an estimated $50 billion.\n  Gene therapy and treatments for cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could \neliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving \npatients' quality of life.\n  Mr. President, Senator Specter and I do everything we can to increase \nfunding for NIH through the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations bill. But the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has \nput us on track to dramatically decrease discretionary spending, so \nthat the nation's investment in health research through the NIH is \nlikely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative action is \ntaken.\n  The NIH is not able to fund even 30% of competing research projects \nor grant applications deemed worthy of funding. Science and cutting \nedge medical research are being put on hold. We may be giving up \npossible cures for diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's and countless other \ndiseases.\n  Mr. President, health research is an investment in our future--it is \nan investment in our children and grandchildren. It holds the promise \nof cure of treatment for millions of Americans.\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join \nSenator Tom Harkin, my colleague and distinguished ranking members of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, which I chair, in introducing the National Fund for Health \nResearch Act of 1999. This creative proposal, which would create a \ndedicated health research fund in the U.S. Treasury to supplement the \ncurrent federal research funding mechanisms, was first developed by \nSenator Harkin and our former Senate colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. \nI think their idea is a sound one and ought to be adopted, and I am \npleased to join Senator Harkin in introducing this legislation as I did \nduring the 105th Congress. I have also included this proposal as a \nprovision of my comprehensive health care reform legislation, the \nHealth Care Assurance Act of 1999 (S. 24), introduced on January 19, \n1999.\n  I have said many times that I firmly believe that the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) is the crown jewel of the Federal \ngovernment, and substantial investment is crucial to allow the \ncontinuation of the breakthrough research into the next decade. In \n1981, NIH funding was less than $3.6 billion. For the past three years, \nNIH funding has increased by 6.8 percent in fiscal year 1997, 7.1 \npercent in fiscal year 1998, and 15 percent in fiscal year 1999, for a \ntotal of $15.7 billion. Senator Harkin and I are continuing to fight to \ndouble the NIH budget, a sentiment which was unanimously supported in \nthe United States Senate during the 105th Congress.\n  I was dismayed, however, upon examining President Clinton's $15.9 \nbillion budget request for the NIH for fiscal year 2000--only a little \nover two percent growth, far less than the 15 percent needed to double \nNIH. At the President's requested level, new and competing NIH research \nproject grants would drop by 1,554--from 9,171 in fiscal year 1999 to \n7,617 in fiscal year 2000. This outlook on future grant awards is \nwholly inadequate to meet the country's most important challenges to \nimprove the health and quality of life for millions of Americans.\n  To call the President's plan short-sighted would be an \nunderstatement. In practical terms, two percent amounts to spending \nless than $24 for every American who suffers from coronary heart \ndisease. Two percent means slowing the race to cure breast cancer or \ndiscover a vaccine to prevent the spread of AIDS. And it means that \nsome of the most promising new breakthroughs in science, like stem cell \nresearch, may be postponed for years. Breaking the code for complex \nproblems takes a steady and sustained commitment of people and money.\n  The National Fund for Health Research Act which we are introducing \ntoday would continue Senator Harkin's and my unwavering commitment to \nincreasing the nation's investment in biomedical research. The \nlegislation would create a special fund for health research to \nsupplement funding achieved through the regular appropriations \nprocess--possibly by as much as $6 billion annually. Our legislation \nwould require health insurers to transfer to the U.S. Treasury an \namount\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nequal to 1 percent of all health premiums they receive. To ensure that \nthe additional funds generated do not simply replace regularly \nappropriated NIH funds, monies from the health research fund would only \nbe released if the total amount appropriated for the NIH in that year \nequaled or exceeded the prior year appropriations.\n  We must all recognize that expanding our base of scientific knowledge \ninevitably leads to better health, lower health care costs, and an \nimproved quality of life for all Americans. I believe that the creation \nof a fund for health research would bring us closer to those critical \ngoals.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the National Fund for \nHealth Research Act, and urge its swift adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 1506. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on cyclic olefin \ncopolymer resin; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               duty suspension on certain copolymer resin\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill suspend the duties imposed on a certain copolymer resin used in \nthe production of high technology products. Currently, this resin is \nimported for use in the United States because there is no domestic \nsupplier or readily available substitute. Therefore, suspending the \nduties on this copolymer resin would not adversely affect domestic \nindustries.\n  This bill would temporarily suspend the duty on cyclic olefin \ncopolymer resin, which is a resin used in the manufacturing of high \ntechnology products such as high precision optical lenses and \nlaboratory micro liter plates.\n  Mr. President, suspending the duty on this resin will benefit the \nconsumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing the end-use \nproducts. Further, this suspension will allow domestic producers to \nmaintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. There are \nno known domestic producers of this material. I hope the Senate will \nconsider these measures expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed to the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the integration and consolidation of \nalcohol and substance programs and services provided by Indian tribal \ngovernments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n native american alcohol and substance abuse program consolidation act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Native \nAmerican Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program Consolidation Act of 1999, \nto enable Indian tribes to consolidate and integrate alcohol and \nsubstance abuse prevention, diagnosis, and treatment programs to \nprovide unified and more effective services to Native Americans.\n  Native communities continue to be plagued by alcohol and substance \nabuse at staggering rates and this abuse is wreaking havoc on Native \nfamilies across the country.\n  Unfortunately, alcohol continues to be an important risk factor \nassociated with the top three killers of Native youth--accidents, \nsuicide, and homicide.\n  Based on 1993 data, the rate of mortality due to alcoholism among \nNative youth ages 15 to 24 was 5.2 per 100,000, which is 17 times the \nrate for whites of the same age.\n  Native Americans have higher rates of alcohol and drug use than any \nother racial or ethnic group. Despite previous treatment and preventive \nefforts, alcoholism and substance abuse continue to be prevalent among \nNative youth: 82 percent of Native adolescents admitted to having used \nalcohol, compared with 66 percent of non-Native youth.\n  In a 1994 school-based study, 39 percent of Native high school \nseniors reported having ``gotten drunk'' and 39 percent of Native kids \nadmitted to using marijuana.\n  Alcohol and substance abuse also contributes to other social problems \nincluding sexually transmitted diseases, child and spousal abuse, poor \nschool achievement and dropout, drunk-driving related deaths, mental \nhealth problems, hopelessness and, too commonly, suicide.\n  The Federal Government offers several disparate and currently \nuncoordinated substance abuse prevention and treatment programs for \nwhich Native Americans are eligible. This bill addresses how to best \ncoordinate these programs so that the resources are effectively \ntargeted at the communities that need them.\n  Program funds from the Department of Education include the Office of \nElementary and Secondary Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities--National Programs; and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities--State Grants.\n  In the Department of Health and Human Services the programs include \nthe Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) Social Services \nBlock Grant; the Indian Health Service's (IHS) Urban Indian Health \nServices funds; the IHS's Research funds; the IHS's Alcohol and \nSubstance Abuse services including outpatient visits, inpatient days, \nregional treatment centers, admissions, aftercare referrals, and \nemergency placements; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA) Grants for Residential Treatment Programs for \nPregnant and Postpartum Women; the SAMHSA Demonstration Grants for \nResidential Treatment for women and their Children; the SAMHSA \nCooperative Agreements for Substance Abuse Treatment and Recovery \nSystems for Rural, Remote and Culturally Distinct Populations; the \nSAMHSA Mental Health Planning and Demonstration Projects; the SAMHSA \nDemonstration Grants for the Prevention of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Among \nHigh-Risk Populations; the SAMHSA Demonstration Grants on Model \nProjects for Pregnant and Postpartum Women and their Infants; the \nSAMHSA Comprehensive Residential Drug Prevention and Treatment, \nProjects for Substance-Using Women and their Children; and the SAMHSA \nBlock Grants for Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse.\n  Programs in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \ninclude Community Planning and Development, Shelter Plus Care; and \nHUD's Drug Elimination Grant funds.\n  Department of the Interior program funds include the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, Services to Indian Children, Elderly and Families funds.\n  Programs in the Department of Justice include National Institute of \nJustice, Justice Research, Development, and Evaluation Project Grants.\n  The Department of Transportation funds include National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration/Federal Highway Administration funds.\n  Funds available through the National Institutes of Health--National \nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism include several different \ngrant programs for minorities and the prevention of alcohol abuse.\n  The goal of this bill is to authorize tribal governments and inter-\ntribal organizations to consolidate these programs through a single \nFederal office, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and use a single \nimplementation plan to reduce the administrative and bureaucratic \nprocesses and result in more and better services to Native Americans.\n  This legislation tracks the widely-hailed and very successful ``477 \nmodel''\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nthat Indian tribes have had used to effectively coordinate employment \ntraining and related services through the Indian Employment Training \nand Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 (Pub. Law 102-477).\n  Under the ``477 model,'' an applicant tribe can file a single \ncomprehensive plan to draw and coordinate resources from many federal \nagencies and administer them through one office, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs in the Department of the Interior.\n  To facilitate this inter-agency resource transfer, Secretaries of \nnamed agencies are required to negotiate and enter into memoranda of \nunderstanding.\n  The bill I am introducing today mirrors the ``477 model'' for \npurposes of alcohol and drug abuse resources.\n  I am certain that with this authority, Indian tribes can achieve the \nsame high level of success they have had in the employment training \nfield.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1507\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Alcohol and \n     Substance Abuse Program Consolidation Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are (a) to enable Indian tribes to \n     consolidate and integrate alcohol and other substance abuse \n     prevention, diagnosis and treatment programs to provide \n     unified and more effective and efficient services to Native \n     Americans afflicted with alcohol and other substance abuse \n     problems; and (b) to recognize that Indian tribes can best \n     determine the goals and methods for establishing and \n     implementing prevention, diagnosis and treatment programs for \n     their communities, consistent with the policy of self-\n     determination.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' has the \n     same meaning given the term in section 551(1) of title 5, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) Indian tribe.--The terms ``Indian tribe'' and ``tribe'' \n     shall have the meaning given the term ``Indian tribe'' in \n     section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act.\n       (3) Indian.--The term ``Indian'' shall have the meaning \n     given such term in section 4(d) of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act.\n       (4) Secretary.--Except where otherwise provided, the term \n     ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide technical and legal assistance for tribal \njustice systems and members of Indian tribes, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                 NATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Indian Tribal \nJustice System Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 1999'' to bolster \nearlier efforts to strengthen Indian tribal justice systems such as the \nIndian Tribal Justice Act of 1933. I want to be clear: the legislation \nI am introducing today is intended to complement, not substitute for, \nthe 1993 Act.\n  Unfortunately, most Native Americans continue to live in abject \npoverty and as with other indigent groups, access to legal assistance \nis poor.\n  In 1997 the Department of Justice published a report showing that \ncrime, particularly violent crime, is rampant on Indian lands. The \nCongress and the Administration both properly responded with an \ninfusion of millions of dollars for crime prevention, prosecution and \ndetention.\n  There is also a huge need civil legal assistance in Native \ncommunities that is not now being met and that is one of the aims of \nthe bill I am introducing today.\n  Since the late 1960's Indian Legal Services (``ILS'') organizations \nhave stepped into the fray to provide basic legal service to individual \nNative Americans and tribes whose members\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nfall within the federal poverty guidelines.\n  There are now 30 Indian legal service organizations--very small \nprograms which receive the bulk of their funds from the Legal Services \nCorporation (LSC). ILS programs provide basic, bread-and-butter legal \nrepresentation to individual Indian people, and small tribes, \nthroughout the United States.\n  In addition to providing legal help to individual Natives, ILS \nassists tribes in developing tribal justice systems, including training \ncourt personnel, and strengthening the capacity of tribal courts to \nhandle both civil and criminal matters.\n  The ILS organizations have been involved in developing written codes \non tribal law and practice and procedure in tribal courts, \ntraining tribal judges, developing tribal court ``lay advocate'' \nprograms and training lay advocates, and the developing tribal \n``peacemaking'' systems which are traditional alternative dispute \nresolution methods.\n\n  The ILS programs carrying out these key functions include the DNA \nLegal Services of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; the Michigan Indian \nLegal Services; the Dakota Plains Legal Services; Wisconsin Judicare; \nIdaho Legal Aid Services; Oklahoma Indian legal Services; Pine Tree \nLegal Assistance of Maine, and many others.\n  Together, tribal governments and the ILS organizations work to ensure \nthat Native justice systems work and that Natives and non-Natives alike \nhave confidence in tribal justice systems and institutions.\n  Generating that confidence is important for a variety of reasons. For \ninstance, there are many factors determining whether or not a Native \ncommunity can be competitive and attract investment and business \nactivities to boost employment: a solid physical infrastructure, a \nskilled and healthy workforce, access to capital, and a governing \nstructure that encourages risk taking and entrepreneurship.\n  Part of such an environment is a judicial system that instills \nconfidence in businesses as well as individuals that disputes can be \nsettled fairly, that contracts will be honored, and that the governed \nrecognize the government's authority as legitimate.\n  A disordered system does not foster that confidence. Whether or not \nindividuals will have access to legal services and well-ordered \ntribunals is key to development.\n  A strong ``legal infrastructure'' is widely recognized in American \nbusiness circles as a necessary condition for business development \nwhether it be in Russian, Indonesia, inner city America, or on Indian \nlands.\n  Within existing appropriations, the bill I am introducing authorizes \nthe Attorney General, in consultation with the Office of Tribal \nJustice, to provide assistance to legal service organizations and non-\nprofit entities to help build capacity of tribal courts and tribal \njustice systems so that confidence in these systems can be augmented, \nand much-needed legal assistance will be provided.\n  The three areas targeted for assistance are training for tribal \njudicial personnel, tribal civil legal assistance, and tribal criminal \nassistance.\n  I believe that in addition to regulatory reform, physical \ninfrastructure, and development assistance, strengthening tribal \njustice systems is another component in bringing real development to \ntribal economies and government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House or Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the Indian Tribal Justice \n     Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 1999.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       1) There is a a government-to-government relationship \n     between the United States and Indian tribes;\n       2) Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are responsible \n     for exercising governmental authority over Indian tribes;\n       3) The rate of violent crime committed in Indian country is \n     approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in \n     the United States as a whole;\n       4) In any community, a high rate of violent crime is a \n     major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic \n     growth;\n       5) Tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal \n     governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the \n     health and safety and the political integrity of tribal \n     governments;\n       6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly \n     recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate \n     forums for the adjudication of disputes affected personal and \n     property rights on Native lands;\n       7) Enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to \n     those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal \n     political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;\n       8) There is both inadequate funding and an inadequate \n     coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal \n     assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of \n     adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their \n     operation;\n       9) Tribal court membership organizations have served a \n     critical role in providing training and technical assistance \n     for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;\n       10) Indian legal services programs, as funded partially \n     through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established \n     record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian \n     people in tribal court forums, and also contribute \n     significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal \n     jurisprudence; and\n       11) The provision of adequate technical assistance to \n     tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and \n     tribal courts is an essential element in the development of \n     strong tribal court systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To carry out the responsibility of the United States to \n     Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes by ensuring access \n     to quality technical and legal assistance;\n       (2) To strengthen and improve the capacity of tribal court \n     systems that address civil and criminal causes of action \n     under the jurisdiction of Indian tribes;\n       (3) To strengthen tribal governments and the economies of \n     Indian tribes through the enhancement and, where appropriate, \n     development of tribal court systems for the administration of \n     justice in Indian country by providing technical and legal \n     assistance services;\n       (4) To encourage collaborative efforts between national or \n     regional membership organizations and associations whose \n     membership consists of judicial system personnel within \n     tribal justice systems; non-profit entities which provide \n     legal assistance services for Indian tribes, members of \n     Indian tribes, and/or tribal justice systems; and\n       (5) To assist in the development of tribal judicial systems \n     by supplementing prior Congressional efforts such as the \n     Indian Tribal Justice Act (Public Law 103-176).\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Indian Employment, Training, and Related \nServices Demonstration Act of 1992, to emphasize the need for job \ncreation on Indian reservations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n              indian employment, training and job creation\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Indian \nEmployment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act Amendments \nof 1999.\n  This bill will amend Public Law 102-477, better known as ``the 477 \nlaw'' that authorizes Indian tribes and tribal organizations to bring \ntogether many federal employment and training programs, consolidate \nthem into one plan, and in the process achieve an efficiency that \notherwise would not be possible.\n  The 1992 Act allows tribes to submit one comprehensive plan, to one \nagency, and in the process to bring together resources from the \nDepartments of Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, and others \nfor purposes of employment training.\n  The keys to the success of ``477'' is that it is entirely voluntary--\nwith tribes deciding for themselves whether to take advantage of its \nbenefits; and second, it involves no federal appropriations of funds to \nadminister it. Participating tribes report that the elimination of \npaperwork and bureaucracy are as important as is the administrative \nflexibility that ``477'' provides to tribes.\n  The focus of the 1996 federal welfare reform laws now being \nimplemented by states and Indian tribes is on getting and retaining \nemployment.\n  For Native American communities, many of whom suffer unemployment \nrates in the 80 to 90 percent range, job opportunities are difficult to \ncome by and as a result the success of the 1996 law in Native \ncommunities is threatened.\n  In the 106th Congress the Committee on Indian Affairs has put \neconomic and business development on Native lands at the center of its \nagenda. In addition to regulatory reform, physical infrastructure, and \naccess to capital, part of the agenda must be to find creative efforts \nto maximize scarce federal resources for Indian development.\n  By all accounts, the 1992 Act has been a success for Native people \nstruggling to get employment and training and other services related \nto the world of work.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today will build on that success and \nliberalize tribal authority under the statute, authorize actual job-\ncreation activities, permit regional consortia of Alaska Native \nentities to participate in the program, and require that the agencies \nand the ``477 tribes'' begin to take the next steps in enlarging the \nscope of ``477'' by bringing in the resources of additional agencies \nwhose mission is related to human resource, physical infrastructure, \nand economic development assistance generally.\n  A feasibility study and report are due to the authorizing committees \nnot later than one year after enactment of the legislation.\n  As the Self Governance model has already shown, putting tribes in the \ndriver's seat results in better services to consumers, more efficient \nadministrative frameworks, and often times a savings in federal \nresources. This bill will improve on an already-successful program and \nhelp Native communities provide employment training and jobs to their \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord,  as follows:\n\n                                S. 1509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise the laws of the United States appertaining \nto United States cruise vessels, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         THE UNITED STATES ship TOURISM DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, today I, with Senators Hutchison, \nFeinstein, and Murkowski, are introducing the United States Cruise Ship \nTourism Development Act of 1999. The purposes of this bill is to \nprovide increased domestic cruise opportunities for the American \ncruising public by temporarily reducing barriers to operation in the \ndomestic cruise market. I want to start by thanking Senator Hutchison, \nwho as Chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee is continuing her efforts to help rebuild our nation's \ncruise ship industry. She along with Senators Feinstein and Murkowski \nare great partners to have as this legislation moves forward.\n  Americans today have a wide variety of choices when it comes to \nvacationing on large oceangoing cruise ships. However, due to barriers \nto entry that were created in 1886, the itineraries, with few \nexceptions, do not include domestic trade. Large cruise ship domestic \ntrade options are currently limited to one ocean going cruise vessel in \nHawaii. Also, the U.S. port calls on international itineraries are \nheavily concentrated in Florida and Alaska due to the proximity of \nthese states to neighboring countries. This means that America's \ncruising public is denied the opportunity to cruise to many attractive \nU.S. port destinations, and those ports are denied the economic \nbenefits of those visits.\n  We have an opportunity in this Congress to temporarily reduce \nbarriers for entry into the domestic cruise ship trade, creating new \nU.S. jobs, and generating millions of dollars in new U.S. business \nwithout any cost to existing U.S. jobs. During the 105th Congress three \nseparate bills addressing the domestic cruise ship trade were referred \nto the Commerce Committee. Unfortunately, we were not able to reach a \nconsensus on any measure that would remove the barriers created in the \nlaw measure that would remove the barriers created in the law commonly \nreferred to as the Passenger Vessel Services Act. I am hopeful that the \nbill that we are introducing today will see more success.\n  While I have made it clear in the past that I would like to do away \nwith the trade barriers contained in the Passenger Vessel Services Act, \nthis bill does not do that. What this bill does do is allow the \nSecretary of Transportation a limited time to waive certain coastwise \ntrade restrictions. It is my strong belief that this will stimulate \ngrowth and opportunity within the domestice cruise ship trade with the \nbeneficiaries being U.S. port cities and business, and more \nimportantly, the millions of American citizens who want to be able to \nenjoy cruising between U.S. ports. I expect some of my colleagues on \nthe on the Commerce Committee may want to make additional changes to \nthis bill in Committee. I look forward to working these issues out with \nthem in the coming months.\n  I believe it is important for this Congress to take action on this \nissue in order to maximize the economic growth potential of the \ndomestic cruise ship trade and the cruising opportunities for America's \npublic.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If operators of \n     comparable vessels submit comparable requests within 30 days \n     of each other, the priorities of this section apply at the \n     discretion of the Secretary.\n       (4) Scheduling.--\n       (A) Action by secretary.--Within 60 days after receiving an \n     itinerary submitted under this subsection, the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (i) review the schedule for compliance with the priorities \n     established by this section;\n       (ii) advise affected cruise ship operators of any specific \n     itinerary that is not available and the reason it is not \n     available; and\n       (iii) publish a proposed list of approved itineraries.\n       (B) Operators response.--If the Secretary advises an \n     operator under subparagraph (A)(ii) that a requested \n     itinerary is not available, the operator may respond to the \n     Secretary's advice within 30 days after it is received by the \n     operator by appealing the Secretary's decision or by \n     submitting a new itinerary proposal.\n       (C) Resolution of conflicts.--As soon as practicable after \n     the end of the 30-day period described in subparagraph (B), \n     the Secretary shall--\n       (i) resolve any appeals and consider new itinerary \n     proposals;\n       (ii) advise cruise ship operators who responded under \n     subparagraph (B) of the Secretary's decision with respect to \n     the appeal or the new itinerary proposal; and\n       (iii) publish a final list of approved itineraries.\n       (f) Itineraries Before Final List Is First Published.--\n       (1) Requests.--For itineraries before the first calendar \n     year for which the Secretary publishes a final list of \n     approved itineraries under subsection (e), the operator of a \n     cruise vessel may submit a request for an itinerary to be \n     sailed before that calendar year.\n       (2) Conflicting higher priority use.--If the itinerary \n     submitted by an operator under paragraph (1) conflicts with \n     an itinerary in use by a vessel with a higher priority under \n     this section, the Secretary shall disapprove the request and \n     notify the operator of the disapproval and the reason for the \n     disapproval within 5 days (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal \n     public holidays (as defined in section 6103 of title 5, \n     United States Code, excepted) after the request is received.\n       (3) No initial conflict.--If the itinerary submitted by an \n     operator under paragraph (1) does not conflict with an \n     itinerary in use by a vessel with a higher priority under \n     this section, the Secretary shall publish the request and the \n     requested itinerary immediately. If, within 30 days after the \n     request is published, the operator of a cruise vessel with a \n     higher priority under this section requests the use of the \n     published itinerary, then the Secretary shall deny the \n     published request and approve the request for the higher \n     priority vessel. If no operator of a cruise vessel with a \n     higher priority under this section requests the use of the \n     published itinerary within 30 days after it is published, the \n     Secretary shall approve the requested itinerary and publish \n     notice of the approval.\n       (4) Publication of interim itineraries.--Until the first \n     publication of a final list of approved itineraries under \n     subsection (e), the Secretary shall publish, on a quarterly \n     basis, a list of itineraries approved under this subsection.\n       (g) Report.--The Secretary shall issue an annual report on \n     the number of operating days used by each cruise vessel \n     assigned a priority under this section.\n\n     SEC. 106.

The \n     Secretary shall revoke the coastwise endorsement for any such \n     vessel placed under foreign registry under this subsection \n     permanently. Any vessel the coastwise endorsement for which \n     is revoked under this subsection is not eligible thereafter \n     for coastwise endorsement.\n\n                      TITLE III--OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 301.

A bill to provide for education infrastructure improvement, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n                 21st century school modernization act\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last month I had the honor of \naccompanying President Clinton and Education Secretary Richard Riley on \na visit to Amos Hiatt Middle School in Des Moines, Iowa. We were joined \nby a high school teacher named Ruth Ann Gaines and an 8th grade \nstudent, Catherine Swoboda for a discussion on the need to modernize \nour nation's schools.\n  Hiatt Middle School opened its doors in 1925 and students spend all \nbut a few hours a week in classrooms built during a time when Americans \ncould not\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nimagine the technological advances that would occur by the end of the \ncentury.\n  In 1925, Americans were flocking to movie theaters to see--and hear--\nthe first talking motion picture--Al Jolson's ``The Jazz Singer.'' The \nstudents who walked through the doors of the brand new Hiatt school \nthat year could not imagine IMAX theaters with surround sound where a \nmovie goer actually becomes a part of the film.\n  In 1925, consumers were lining up in department stores to buy \nnovelties like electric phonographs, dial telephones, and self-winding \nwatches. CDS, DVD players, cellular telephones or palm pilots were \nunthinkable.\n  And, the introduction of state-of-the art technologies like rural \nelectrification and crop dusting were revolutionizing the lives of \nfamilies and farmers alike.\n  There have been incredible technological and scientific advances in \nthe past seven decades. Yet, our schools have not kept pace with the \ntimes. We continue to educate our children in schools built and \nequipped in bygone eras.\n  Mr. President, Iowa has a long and proud tradition when it comes to \npublic education--a tradition which dates back to before statehood.\n  As a result of the Land Ordinance of 1785, every township in the new \nWestern Territory was required to set aside 640 acres of land for \nsupport of public education. Iowa's first elementary school was \nestablished in 1830 and the first high school in 1850.\n  In 1858, the Iowa Free School Act laid the foundation for Iowa's \npublic school system. By 1859 the state had 4,200 public schools--some \nin log cabins.\n  This long commitment to education has brought great results.\n  From 1870 on into this century, Iowa had the nation's highest \nliteracy rate and the nation's highest test scores. Iowa students \ncontinue to do well but we must do better. Our public education system \nhas served us well. But, the times have changed dramatically.\n  The thousands of one-room school houses that dotted the countryside \nserved us well for many generations. But time marches on and so must \nour schools. Just as the pot-belly stove gave way to central heat; \ncandles gave way for electric lights; the blackboard and chalk must \nmake way for the computer. We must make sure that every child and every \nschool can facilitate the technology of the 21st century. However, Iowa \nState University reports that we need at least $4 billion over the next \nten years to repair and upgrade school buildings and Iowa and make sure \nthey can effectively utilize educational technology.\n\n  Mr. President, the facts about the need to modernize and upgrade our \nnation's pubic school facilities are well known.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that 14 million American \nchildren attend classes in schools that are unsafe or inadequate and it \nwill cost $112 billion to upgrade existing public schools to overall \ngood condition. In addition, GAO reports that 46 percent of schools \nlack adequate electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \ntechnology.\n  Enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at all time high \nand will continue to grow over the next 10 years making it necessary \nfor the United States to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers reports that public schools \nare in worse condition that any other sector of our national \ninfrastructure. I ask unanimous consent that a report card on the \nnation's infrastructure be inserted in the record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  To respond to this critical national problem, I am introducing the \n21st Century School Modernization Act. I am pleased to have Senator \nKennedy, Robb, Levin and Murray as cosponsors of this proposal.\n  This legislation reauthorizes direct federal grants to local school \ndistricts for the repair, renovation of construction of public schools. \nThese grants are critically important to districts in impoverished \nareas that may not benefit from the tax-oriented proposals. Secondly, \nthe bill builds a new partnership with states by creating State \nInfrastructure Banks to provide subsidized loans for school \nmodernization purposes. Finally, the bill provides grants to assist \nschool districts in the planning and design of new facilities that will \nserve as the center of the community.\n  The need to rebuild our nation's crumbling public schools is clear \nand I believe we must fight this battle on two critical fronts--this \nsession's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand by enacting legislation to provide targeted tax relief. The 21st \nCentury School Modernization Act complements tax-oriented plans, such \nas those proposed by President Clinton and Senators Daschle, Lautenberg \nand Robb, to provide school modernization tax credits to finance at \nleast $25 billion in public school construction or renovation.\n  Mr. President, if the nicest thing our kids ever see are shopping \nmalls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown place \nthey see is their school, what signal are we sending them about the \nvalue we place on education and the future?\n  Let me give your some firsthand testimony from Jonathan Kozol's book, \nSavage Inequalities. Kozol writes about a school in Washington, D.C.'s \nlow-income Anacostia district:\n  Tunisia, a fifth grader in Washington, D.C., tells Kozol:\n\n       It's like this. The school is dirty. There isn't any \n     playground. There's a hole in the wall behind the principal's \n     desk. What we need to do is first rebuild the school. Build a \n     playground. Plant a lot of flowers. Paint the classrooms. Fix \n     the hole in the principal's office. Buy doors for the toilet \n     stalls in the girl's bathroom. Make it a beautiful clean \n     building. Make it pretty. Way it is, I feel ashamed.\n\n  Tunisia tells the story better than any politician can. She faces it \nevery day when the school bell rings. We can and we must do a better \njob for Tunisia and her peers.\n  This is a serious national problem. And, it demands a comprehensive \nnational response. The 21st Century School Modernization Act is a key \npart of that comprehensive national response and I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this proposal to \ninvest more in rebuilding and modernizing the nation's schools. I \ncommend Senator Harkin for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation, which is necessary to help the \nnation meet the critical need to modernize and rebuild crumbling and \novercrowded schools.\n  Schools, communities, and governments at every level have to do more \nto improve student achievement. Schools need smaller classes, \nparticular in the early grades. They need stronger parent involvement. \nThey need well-trained teachers in the classroom who keep up with \ncurrent developments in their field and the best teaching practices. \nThey need after-school instruction for students who need extra help, \nand after-school programs to engage students in constructive \nactivities. They need safe, modern facilities with up-to-date \ntechnology.\n  But, all of these reforms will be undermined if facilities are \ninadequate. Sending children to dilapidated, overcrowded facilities \nsends a message to these children. It tells them they don't matter. No \nCEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher \nshould have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can \nto ensure that children are learning in safe, modern buildings.\n  I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Robb's Public School \nModernization and Overcrowding Relief Act, which provides tax \nincentives to rebuild and modernize schools. Senator Harkin's bill is a \nnecessary complement to that legislation. Although tax incentives are \nan important way to meet the nation's critical school infrastructure \nneeds, they do not meet the needs of all communities. The neediest \ncommunities need our direct support--and they need it now.\n  Senator Harkin's legislation authorizes discretionary funds to help \nlocal school districts and states repair, renovate, and rebuild \ncrumbling public schools. It provides targeted discretionary grants to \npublic schools that have major needs. To do so, it creates a revolving \nloan fund at the state level, which would provide low-interest or no-\ninterest loans to repair existing schools or construct new facilities. \nThe legislation will also provide a grant to\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\nhelp local school districts in the planning and design of new \nfacilities that would include input from parents, teachers, and the \ncommunity.\n\n  Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 \nmillion children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in \nsubstandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school \nbuildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in \nalmost every community, urban, rural, or suburban.\n  In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, \ncommunities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising \nenrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school \nenrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 million \nstudents, and will continue to grow.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools \nwill be needed by 2003 to accommodate rising enrollments. The General \nAccounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 billion \nto repair and modernize the nation's schools. Congress should lend a \nhelping hand and do all we can to help schools and communities across \nthe country meet this challenge.\n  In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one \nbuilding needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of \nschools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 \npercent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And \n36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems.\n  Last year, I visited Everett Elementary School in Dorchester. The \nschool is experiencing serious overcrowding. The average class size is \n28 students. The principal of the school gave up her office and moved \ninto a closet in the hall in order to help accommodate rising \nenrollment. When the school wants to use the multi-purpose auditorium/\nlibrary, the rolling bookcases are moved to the basement, and the \nlibrary has to close for the rest of the day.\n  Two cafeterias at Bladensburg High School in Prince Georges County, \nMaryland were recently closed because they were infested with mice and \nroaches. A teacher commented, ``It's disgusting. It causes chaos when \nthe mice run around the room.'' At an elementary school in Montgomery, \nAlabama, a ceiling which had been damaged by leaking water collapsed \nonly 40 minutes after the children had left for the day.\n\n  Most of Los Angeles' school buildings are 30 to 70 years old. \nEnrollment rose from 539,000 in 1980 to 691,000 in 1998, an increase of \n28 percent. District officials expect an additional 50,000 students \nover the next five years.\n  In Detroit, Michigan, over half--150 of the 263--school buildings \nwere built before 1930. The average age is 61 years old, and some date \nto the 1800's. Detroit estimates that the city has $5 billion in unmet \nrepair and new construction needs. Detroit voters approved a $1.5 \nbillion, 15-year school construction program, but it's not enough.\n  New York City school enrollment has grown by 100,000 students, to a \ntotal of 1,083,000 since 1990. School officials expect up to an \nadditional 90,000 students by 2004. P.S. 7 was built for 530 students, \nbut 1,048 students are now enrolled. P.S. 108 was built for 280 \nstudents, however 808 students are now enrolled. New York City \neducation officials have identified $7.5 billion in building needs.\n  Schools across the country are struggling to meet needs such as \nthese, but they can't do it alone. The federal government should join \nwith state and local governments and community organizations to ensure \nthat all children have the opportunity for a good education in a safe \nand up-to-date school building.\n  Children need and deserve a good education in order to succeed in \nlife. But they cannot obtain that education if school roofs are falling \ndown around them, if sewage is backing up through faulty plumbing, if \nasbestos is flaking off the walls and ceilings, if schools lack \ncomputers and modern technology and classrooms are overcrowded. We need \nto help states and communities rebuild their crumbling schools, \nmodernize old buildings, and expand facilities to accommodate reduced \nclass sizes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Harkin's 21st Century \nModernization Act. The time is now to do all we can to rebuild and \nmodernize public schools, so that all children can learn in safe, well-\nequipped facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1512. A bill to provide educational opportunities for \ndisadvantaged children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n          INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION REGARDING SCHOOL CHOICE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize a three-year nationwide school choice demonstration program \ntargeted at children from economically disadvantaged families. The \nprogram would expand educational opportunities for low-income children \nby providing parents and students the freedom to choose the best school \nfor their unique academic needs, while encouraging schools to be \ncreative and responsive to the needs of all students.\n  This legislation is identical to the school choice amendment which I \noffered on July 30, 1999 to S.1429, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. I \nam gravely disappointed that the Senate failed to pass this amendment \nas a part of the Taxpayer Refund Act. However, I am committed to seeing \nit implemented before Congress adjourns this year and will be working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP) to ensure that this \nmeasure is implemented before Congress adjourns, perhaps as a part of \nthe legislation reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct (ESEA).\n  This bill authorizes $1.8 billion annually for fiscal years 2001 \nthrough 2003 to be used to provide school choice vouchers to \neconomically disadvantaged children through the nation. The funds would \nbe divided among the states based upon the number of children they have \nenrolled in public schools. Then, each state would conduct a lottery \namong low-income children who attend the public schools with the lowest \nacademic performance in their state. Each child selected in the lottery \nwould receive $2,000 per year for three years to be used to pay tuition \nat any school of their choice in the state, including private or \nreligious schools. The money could also be used to pay for \ntransportation to the school or supplementary educational services to \nmeet the unique needs of the individual student.\n  In total, this bill authorizes $5.4 billion for the three-year school \nchoice demonstration program, as well as a GAO evaluation of the \nprogram upon its completion. The cost of this important test of school \nvouchers is fully offset by eliminating more than $5.4 billion in \nunnecessary and inequitable corporate tax loopholes which benefits the \nethanol, sugar, gas and oil industries.\n  First, the legislation eliminates tax credits for ethanol producers, \neliminating a $1.5 billion subsidy. Ethanol is an inefficient, \nexpensive fuel that has not lived up to claims that it would reduce \nreliance on foreign oil or reduce impact on the environment. It takes \nmore energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than the amount of energy \nthat a gallon of ethanol contains. Ethanol tax credits are simply a \nsubsidy for corn producers, and the amendment ends the taxpayers' \nsupport for this outdated program.\n  Second, the bill eliminates three subsidies enjoyed by the oil and \ngas industry, totaling $3.9 billion. It phases out oil and gas \nindustry's special right to fully deduct capital costs for drilling, \nexploration and development; eliminates the 15 percent tax credit for \nrecovering oil using particular methods; and ends special right of oil \nand gas property owners to claim unlimited passive losses under income \nand alternative minimum tax provisions. Subsidizing the cost of \ndomestic production has not been shown to have reduced reliance on \nforeign oil or directly contributed to more efficient resource use or \ndomestic productivity. This bill would end these special tax \ntreatments.\n  Finally, this measure eliminates the special loan program for sugar \nproducers and processors, worth $390 million. The federal government is \nburdened with an unnecessary and unprofitable loan program for bug \nsugar producers and enforcing mandated import\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\nquotas on foreign sugar. Sugar price supports also force consumers to \npay $1.4 billion every year in artificially inflated sugar prices. This \nbill simply eliminates the taxpayer-funded loan program in 2003 and \nimmediately requires repayment of existing loans in case, rather than \nsugar.\n  These tax benefits and subsidies were originally intended to serve a \nlimited purpose during times of economic recession and hardship in the \n1970's. Our economy has long since recovered and I believe that these \nsubsidies have outlived its purpose. The sunset of these programs will \nend these corporate welfare programs and return any remaining benefit \nback to our Nation's children.\n  Mr. President, we all know that one of the most important issues \nfacing our nation is the education of our children. Providing a solid, \nquality education for each and every child in our nation is a critical \ncomponent in their quest for personal success and fulfillment. A solid \neducation for our children also plays a pivotal role in the success of \nour nation; economically, intellectually, civically and morally.\n  We must strive to develop and implement initiatives which strengthen \nand improve our education system thereby ensuring that our children are \nprovided with the essential academic tools for succeeding \nprofessionally, economically and personally. I am sure we all agree \nthat increasing the academic performance and skills of all our nation's \nstudents must be the paramount goal of any education reform we \nimplement.\n  School vouchers are a viable method of allowing all American children \naccess to high quality schools, including private and religious \nschools. Every parent should be able to obtain the highest quality \neducation for their children, not just the wealthy. Tuition vouchers \nwould finally provide low-income children trapped in mediocre, or \nworse, schools the same educational choices as children of economic \nprivilege.\n  Some of my colleagues may argue that vouchers would divert money away \nfrom our nation's public schools and instead of instilling competition \ninto our school systems we should be pouring more and more money into \npoor performing public schools. I respectfully disagree. While I \nsupport strengthening financial support for education in our nation, \nthe solution to what ails our system is not simply pouring more and \nmore money into it.\n  Currently our Nation spends significantly more money than most \ncountries and yet our students scored lower than their peers from \nalmost all of the forty countries which participated in the last Third \nInternational Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) test. Students in \ncountries which are struggling economically, socially and politically, \nsuch as Russia, outscored U.S. children in math and scored far above \nthem in advanced math and physics. Clearly, we must make significant \nchanges beyond simply pouring more money into the current structure in \norder to improve our children's academic performance in order to remain \na viable force in the world economy.\n\n  It is shameful that we are failing to provide many of our children \nwith adequate training and quality academic preparation for the real \nworld. The number of college freshman who require remedial courses in \nreading, writing and mathematics when they begin their higher education \nis unacceptably high. In fact, presently, more than 30 percent of \nentering freshman need to enroll in one or more remedial course when \nthey start college. It does not bode well for our future economy if the \nmajority of workers are not prepared with the basic skills to engage in \na competitive global marketplace.\n  I concede that school vouchers are not the magic bullet for \neradicating all that is wrong with our current educational system, but \nthey are an important opportunity for providing improved academic \nopportunities for all children, not just the wealthy. Examination of \nthe limited voucher programs scattered around our country reveal high \nlevels of parent and student satisfaction, an increase in parental \ninvolvement, and a definite improvement in attendance and discipline at \nthe participating schools. Vouchers encourage public and private \nschools, communities and parents to all work together to raise the \nlevel of education for all students. Through this bill, we have the \nopportunity to replicate these important attributes throughout all our \nnation's communities.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``The purpose of education is to create young \ncitizens with knowing heads and loving hearts.'' If we fail to give our \nchildren the education they need to nurture their heads and hearts, \nthen we threaten their futures and the future of our nation. Each of us \nis responsible for ensuring that our children have both the love in \ntheir hearts and the knowledge in their heads to not only dream, but to \nmake their dreams a reality.\n  The time has come for us to finally conduct a national demonstration \nof school choice to determine the benefits or perhaps disadvantages of \nproviding educational choices to all students, not just those who are \nfortunate enough to be born into a wealthy family. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill and put the needs of America's school children \nahead of the financial gluttony of big business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n                   TITLE I--EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill for the relief of Jacqueline Salinas and her children \nGabriela Salinas, Alejandro Salinas, and Omar Salinas; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          PRIVATE RELIEF BILL\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \ngrant permanent resident status to Gabriela Salinas, 11, her mother \nJacqueline, and her brothers, Alejandro, 11, and Omar, Jr., 4, all of \nwhom currently live in Tennessee. Although I am aware that private \nrelief legislation is enacted only in rare cases, I believe that the \nextraordinary circumstances surrounding the Salinas family merit \nconsideration of this bill.\n  In March of 1996, Gabriela, then seven, and her father Omar Salinas \nleft their home in Bolivia and traveled to New York City to seek \nlifesaving treatment at Mt. Sinai Medical Center for Gabriela's rare \nbone cancer, ewing sarcoma. Gabriela, however, was denied treatment at \nMt. Sinai because her family was unable to afford the $250,000 deposit \nrequired by the hospital.\n  Days later, Gabriela and her father were flown into Memphis, \nTennessee, for treatment at the internationally renowned St. Jude \nChildren's Hospital. Actress Marlo Thomas, whose father founded St. \nJude, after hearing of the Salinas family's misfortunes, arranged for \nGabriela to receive pro bono treatment at St. Jude. Shortly after \nGabriela's chemotherapy treatment began, her mother, Jacqueline, and \nher three siblings joined her and her father in Tennessee. The family \nreceived an outpouring of sympathy and support from the Memphis \ncommunity and looked forward to returning to Bolivia once Gabriela's \ntreatment was completed.\n  Tragically, however, on April 14, 1997, prior to the end of \nGabriela's treatment, Omar and Gabriela's 3-year old sister, Valentina, \nwere killed in a car accident on their way back from Washington, D.C. \nto renew their passports. Jacqueline, seven months pregnant at the \ntime, was permanently paralyzed from the waist down. This terrible \ntragedy generated national media coverage. As Jacqueline, who gave \nbirth to a healthy baby boy two months later, had no other means of \nfinancial support, St. Jude Hospital generously stepped in to care for \nthe family. The hospital, in fact, has made a commitment to provide \nfull financial support for Jacqueline and her children to live \npermanently in the United States.\n  Because they do not meet the requirements for permanent residence \nunder current immigration law, however, the Salinas family will be \nforced to leave the United States following the expiration of their \ntourist visas. Although Jacqueline's son, Danny, nearly two years old, \nis a U.S. citizen, he will not be qualified to sponsor his mother for \npermanent residence until he reaches the age of twenty-one. Despite her \nbackground in teaching, Jacqueline does not qualify for permanent \nresidence under any of the employment-based visa categories. Therefore, \nprivate relief legislation is the only means by which the family will \nbe able to remain permanently in the United States.\n  Gabriela and her family have suffered through a long and difficult \nordeal. Yet, with the compassion, generosity, and support of the people \nof Tennessee and the nation, they have managed to start a new life. The \nfamily has settled into a new home in Memphis. The children attend \nschool in the community. And Gabriela continues to be treated under the \ncare of some of the best doctors in the world. With the expiration of \ntheir tourist visas approaching, it is my hope that we can act soon to \nprevent another tragic setback for the Salinas family. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1514. A bill to provide that countries receiving foreign \nassistance be conductive to United States business; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n             THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the International \nAnti-Corruption Act of 1999 to address the growing problem of official \nand unofficial corruption abroad and the direct impact on U.S. \nbusiness. This bill is based on S.1200, which I introduced in the 105th \nCongress.\n  As the Co-chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, I intend to address this growing problem of corruption. Last \nmonth, I chaired a Commission hearing that focused on the issues of \nbribery and corruption in the OSCE region, an area stretching from \nVancouver to Vladivostok. The Commission heard that, in economic terms, \nrampant corruption and organized crime in this vast region has cost \nU.S. businesses billions of dollars in lost contracts with direct \nimplications for our economy.\n  Ironically, Mr. President, in some of the biggest recipients of U.S. \nforeign assistance--countries like Russia and Ukraine--the climate is \neither not conducive or outright hostile to American business. Last \nmonth, I also attended the annual session of the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly in St. Petersburg, Russia, where I had an opportunity to sit \ndown with U.S. business representatives to learn, first-hand, the \nobstacles they face.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to stop providing aid as usual to \nthose countries which line up to receive our assistance, only to turn \naround and fleece U.S. businesses conducting legitimate operations in \nthese countries. For this reason, I am introducing the International \nAnti-Corruption Act of 1999 to require the State Department to submit a \nreport and the President to certify by March 1 of each year that \ncountries which are receiving U.S. foreign aid are, in fact, conducive \nto American businesses and investors. If a country is found to be \nhostile to American businesses, aid from the United States would be cut \noff. The certification would be specifically based on whether a country \nis making progress\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\nin, and is committed to, economic reform aimed at eliminating \ncorruption.\n  Under my bill, if the President certifies that a country's business \nclimate is not conducive for U.S. businesses, that country will, in \neffect, be put on probation. The country would continue to receive U.S. \nforeign aid through the end of the fiscal year, but aid would be cut \noff on the first day of the next fiscal year unless the President \ncertifies the country is making significant progress in implementing \nthe specified economic indicators and is committed to recognizing the \ninvolvement of U.S. business.\n  My bill also includes the customary waiver authority where the \nnational interests of the United States are at stake. For countries \ncertified as hostile to or not conducive for U.S. business, aid can \ncontinue if the President determines it is in the national security \ninterest of the United States. However, the determination expires after \n6 months unless the President determines its continuation is important \nto our national security interest.\n  I also included a provision which would allow aid to continue to meet \nurgent humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, disaster and \nrefugee relief, to support democratic political reform and rule of law \nactivities, and to create private sector and nongovernmental \norganizations that are independent of government control, or to develop \na free market economic system.\n  Mr. President, instead of jumping on the bandwagon to pump millions \nof additional tax dollars into countries which are hostile to U.S. \nbusinesses and investors, we should be working to root out the kinds of \nbribery and corruption that have an overall chilling effect on much \nneeded foreign investment. Left unchecked, such corruption will \ncontinue to undermine fledgling democracies worldwide and further \nimpede moves toward a genuine free market economy. I believe the \nlegislation I am introducing today is a critical step this direction, \nand I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Anti-\n     Corruption Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \npensions.\n\n\n         radiation exposure compensation act amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act Amendments of 1999,'' known as RECAA 1999. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell; the \ndistinguished Senate Minority Leader, Senator Tom Daschle; Senator Jeff \nBingaman; and Senator Pete Domenici in introducing this legislation.\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\n  These long awaited amendments will ensure that the United States \ngovernment meets its responsibility to provide fair and compassionate \ncompensation to the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the \nmining of uranium and from fallout during the testing of nuclear \nweapons in the early post-war years. These citizens helped our nation \nduring the Cold War and we must not forget them.\n  In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) was \nenacted. RECA, which I was proud to sponsor, affirmed the \nresponsibility of the federal government to compensate individuals who \nwere harmed by the radioactive fallout from atomic testing, for which \nthe government took few precautions to ensure safety. Additionally, \nworkers who have suffered long-term health problems because they were \nnot adequately informed of the dangers faced during uranium mining were \neligible for compensation under the act.\n  Administered through the Department of Justice, RECA has been \nresponsible for compensating approximately 6,000 individuals for their \ninjuries, but we can and should help a lot more. While the passage of \nthe 1990 law was a momentous event, I have been carefully monitoring \nthe implementation of the RECA program.\n  I am disturbed over numerous reports from my Utah constituents \nconcerning the burdensome process of filing claims with the Department \nof Justice. One complaint which I hear far too often is ``that it is \neasier to compensate a dead miner, than one living with disease.'' We \ncannot let this injustice continue. We have drafted the RECA Amendments \nof 1999 in response to these concerns.\n  We should not add a bureaucratic nightmare to the burden of disease \nand ill-health already carried by these citizens. Moreover, excessive \nregulatory hurdles have made it too difficult for some deserving \nindividuals to be fairly compensated under the Act. We must streamline \nand speed up the application process. In addition, advances in our \nmedical knowledge compel us to modify the 1990 Act to define better \ncriteria for compensation and to include diseases that we now know have \nradiogenic causes.\n  Let me explain how this bill was developed. RECA originally defined a \nlist of 13 compensable diseases based upon the 1988 Radiation Exposed \nVeterans Compensation Act and the findings of the 1980 report of the \nCommittee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations (BEIR-III). \nIn 1992, REVCA was amended based upon the findings of an updated BEIR-\nIV and -V Reports which defined a host of cancers that are considered \nfor disability compensation due to radiation exposure.\n  In addition, the report of the President's Advisory Committee on \nHuman Radiation Experiments, released in 1995, provides further \nscientific evidence for changes in the 1990 RECA law. The Committee \nreviewed 125 current studies and more than 200 public witnesses in \nevaluating the risks and diseases caused by exposure to radiation \nconducted in the Cold War period. The conclusions of the advisory \ncommittee report support the reduction in radiation level exposure, the \nelimination of distinction between smokers and nonsmokers for lung \ncancer, and the inclusion of other radiogenic diseases.\n  Based on the evidence in both the President's Advisory Committee and \nthe BEIR-V Committee Reports, we have extended the number of eligible \nradiogenic pathologies by six to include: lung, brain, colon, ovary, \nbladder, and salivary gland cancers. In addition, specific non-cancer \ndiseases, such as silicosis, have been incorporated. Adding these \ndiseases, which have been documented by science as linked to radiation \nexposure, will more fairly compensate our fellow citizens who were \nexposed to this danger so long ago.\n  With the inclusion of these modifications, miners, millers, and \nuranium ore transporters will be eligible in 11 western states to seek \nequitable compensation for their sacrifice in our nation's effort to \nproduce our nuclear defense arsenal. I have worked with Senators \nDaschle, Campbell, and Bingaman in reviewing Atomic Energy Commission \nrecords to document the uranium/vanadium mines supported by the U.S. \ngovernment during and after the Manhattan Project. Eleven western \nstates were found to have mines dating from 1947 through 1970 from \nwhich the U.S. government purchased radioactive ore.\n  Furthermore, uranium mills in these areas testify to the need to \ninclude millers who were exposed to radioactive decay without the \nbenefit of state or government-instituted safety precautions. The \nreport ``Raw Materials Activities of the Manhattan Project on the \nColorado Plateau,'' by William Chenoweth, a noted geologist, documents \nthe tragedies of exposure endured by miners, millers, and ore \ntransporters as they extracted, prepared and moved the radioactive ore \nfor use in the nuclear arsenal. These changes would enable an estimated \n6,000 individuals harmed by exposure to uranium radiation to seek \ncompensation.\n  Of the thousands affected by radiation exposure, many of the \ndownwinders, miners and millers were members of Indian tribes. \nParticularly noteworthy was the large number of U.S. atomic energy \nmines on Native American reservations. Many of these miners were not \naware of the dangers that radiation exposure can cause, and the \ngovernment did little to inform them of the risks. After RECA 1990 was \npassed into law, many complications have hindered members of Indian \ntribes from seeking their compensation. In working with the members of \nthe Navajo Nation and other Native American tribes, we have developed \nlegislation that largely addresses their concerns. The bill also \ninstructs the Attorney General to take into account and make \nappropriate allowances for the laws, traditions, and customs of Indian \ntribes.\n\n  Finally, my bill also contains a grant program designed to provide \nfor the early detection, prevention and education on radiogenic \ndiseases. These programs will screen for the early warning signs of \ncancer, provide medical referrals, educate individuals on radiogenic \ncancers as well as prevention, and facilitate documentation of RECA \nclaims. These grants will be available to a wide range of health care \nproviders including: cancer centers, hospitals, Veterans Affairs \nmedical centers, community health centers, and state departments of \nhealth.\n  Some may question the cost of our legislation. Let me set the record \nstraight. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will \ncost close to $1 billion over the next 21 years. That averages out to \njust over $47 million a year. This estimate is significantly lower than \nother proposals that have been considered by Congress over the past \nseveral years. Ours is, I believe, a common sense approach that keeps \nto the intent of the original statute.\n  But, Mr. President, in considering the cost, it is important to \nremember what prompted the original statute. What justified this \ncompensation program in the first place? The answer is that the federal \ngovernment during the early years of the atomic testing program, \nexposed American citizens--our neighbors--to deadly nuclear fallout. \nKnowing that there would be adverse effects of exposure to fallout, the \ngovernment exploded these bombs so that the fallout would blow \n``downwind'' of the more heavily populated cities. There was no warning \nor instruction about minimizing exposure for the citizens in these \nrural areas. In my view, Mr. President, this bill is only fair and \njust. If we fail to provide even basic compensation for the hardships \nthey have endured, we will still be taking them for granted.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and Senators Daschle, Campbell, \nBingaman, and Domenici in meeting our nation's commitment to the \nthousands of individuals who were victims of radiation exposure while \nsupporting our country's national defense. I believe we have an \nobligation to care for those who were injured, especially since, at the \ntime, they were not adequately warned about the potential health \nhazards involved with their work. Now is our chance to compensate these \nmen and women for their injuries. I urge my colleagues to support these \nAmericans by cosponsoring the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act \nAmendments of 1999.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am delighted to join in the \nintroduction of the ``Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of \n1999.''\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\n For the last year, I have been working to extend the benefits of the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to South Dakotans who worked \nin uranium mines and a uranium mill in western South Dakota. This \nlegislation would accomplish that goal, and I am very grateful to \nSenator Hatch for his hard work on this issue.\n  In the 9 years since the passage of RECA, we have had time to reflect \nupon its strengths and its shortcomings. During that time, it has \nbecome overwhelmingly clear that we have not fully met our obligation \nto victims of our nuclear program. Most seriously, we have arbitrarily \nand unfairly limited compensation for underground miners to those in \nonly five States, despite the fact that underground miners in other \nstates such as South Dakota faced exactly the same risk to their \nhealth. This fact alone requires us to amend RECA so that we can right \nthis wrong.\n  However, we have also excluded other groups of workers, and their \nsurviving families, from compensation for serious health problems and, \nin some cases, deaths, that have resulted from their work to help \ndefend our Nation. Many of those who worked in uranium mills have \ndeveloped serious respiratory problems as a result of exposure to \nuranium dusts and silica. Similar concerns have been raised about \nabove-ground miners and uranium transportation workers as well.\n  This legislation would address those shortcomings and ensure that \nthose who have suffered health problems because the government failed \nto warn them about the hazards of working with uranium are compensated. \nIt is my hope that Congress will act on it this session so that we can \nprovide compensation to these workers as quickly as possible.\n  There is one issue I hope we can address when this bill is considered \nin committee. Earlier this summer, I hosted a meeting of former uranium \nworkers in Edgemont, SD. The most pressing concern of many of them was \ntheir inability to purchase affordable, quality health insurance due to \nthe serious, ongoing health problems many of them have as a result of \ntheir work. Even if compensated by the Federal Government, they fear \nthey are only one hospital stay away from bankruptcy. I hope that I can \nwork with my colleagues over the next several months to determine how \nwe can ensure that these workers, who sacrificed their health for their \ncountry, have access to affordable health insurance.\n  Finally, I have noted in the past the difficulty of tracking down \ndocumentation about South Dakota's uranium mining and milling \nactivities. For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources and a \nletter from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology on this \nissue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Environment\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                     Pierre, SD, January 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: Peter Hanson of your office requested \n     that this letter be sent to you regarding past uranium mining \n     activities in South Dakota. Both underground and surface \n     uranium mining activities took place in South Dakota a few \n     decades ago. While we can confirm that these activities took \n     place, it is important to point out that South Dakota did not \n     have a mining regulatory program during the years uranium \n     mining took place. Therefore, there are no detailed records \n     or statistical information in our files. Certain staff \n     members have mainly collected the documents in our office as \n     a result of interest in the subject. The information below is \n     excerpted from some of these documents.\n       Uranium deposits of economic significance were discovered \n     in 1951 in Fall River County, South Dakota, in what became \n     know as the Edgemont mining district. Prospecting quickly \n     intensified and by 1953 production of uranium ore increased \n     to the point that the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission \n     established a buying station in Edgemont. In 1956, a mill for \n     processing uranium ore was completed in Edgemont. Commercial \n     uranium deposits were also discovered in lignite beds of \n     Harding County in 1954.\n       According to our records, including Mullen and Agnew (1959) \n     and Bieniewski and Agnew (1964), production of uranium ore \n     occurred in Fall River and Harding Counties, as well as some \n     production in Custer, Lawrence, and Pennington Counties (and \n     an ``unknown'' county).\n       The number of producing properties varied through the \n     years. Bieniewski and McGregor (1965) indicate that in 1963 \n     production of uranium ore was attributed to 37 operations, 19 \n     of which were in Fall River County, 14 in Harding County, 3 \n     in Custer County, and 1 in Pennington County. Production of \n     ore reached a peak in 1964 (with 110,147 short tons of \n     uranium ore produced) and then declined greatly in the late \n     1960's (USGS, 1975 and Stotelmeyer, et al., 1966). According \n     to Stotelmeyer, et al. (1967), it appears that there were 49 \n     uranium mining operations in 1964, 29 of which were in Fall \n     River County, 15 in Harding County, and 5 in Custer County.\n       The mill at Edgemont stopped producing uranium concentrates \n     in 1972. By the end of 1973, nearly one million tons of \n     uranium ore containing about 3,200,000 pounds of \n     U3O8 were produced from deposits in \n     South Dakota (USGS, 1975).\n       Our records are very sketchy regarding the number of \n     uranium mine employees. Bieniewski and Agnew (1964) indicate \n     that the average number of men employed in uranium mines and \n     mills in 1961 was 104, excluding officeworkers. A total of \n     204,216 man-hours were worked in 1961. There were 23 uranium \n     mine and mill operations that year. There were 10 nonfatal \n     injuries in 1961, which equated to a frequency rate of 49 \n     injuries per million man-hours (Bieniewski and Agnew, 1964).\n       In 1962, preliminary figures indicated that the average \n     number of men employed was 103. A total of 202,062 man-hours \n     were worked in 1962. There were 20 operations that year. \n     There were 16 nonfatal injuries in 1962, which equated to a \n     frequency rate of 79.1 injuries per million man-hours \n     (Bieniewski and Agnew, 1964).\n       We were unable to locate uranium employment statistics for \n     other years. I wouldn't be surprised if there were more \n     uranium mine employees in other years than those referenced \n     in the 1961-1962 statistics above, such as during the peak \n     production year of 1964.\n       We have provided Peter Hanson with some information and \n     references on the subject. Among other things, that \n     information includes reference citations to several \n     documents, publications, and maps that refer to uranium \n     mining and uranium deposits in South Dakota, some of which \n     are referenced here. We also sent the web address of our \n     department's web page on Inactive and Abandoned Mines in the \n     Black Hills http://www.state.sd.us/denr/DES/mining/\nacidmine.htm\n       The names of some of the uranium mines are shown on the \n     maps referred to above. If you would like copies of these \n     maps, or of any of the other documents cited in the \n     information sent to Mr. Hanson, please let us know.\n       You may wish to contact Dr. Arden Davis and Dr. Kate Webb \n     at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology for \n     further information on uranium mining and abandoned uranium \n     mines in South Dakota.\n       If you have any questions or need further assistance, \n     please contact Tom Durkin with the Minerals and Mining \n     Program at 605-773-4201.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Nettie H. Myers,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            South Dakota School of\n\n\n                                         Mines and Technology,\n\n                                  Rapid City, SD, January 8, 1999.\n     Senator Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: This letter is to provide a brief \n     background on uranium mining in South Dakota as well as \n     documentation of underground uranium mining activity within \n     the state. Mr. Peter Hanson of your office contacted us \n     earlier this week about this subject. Dr. Cathleen Webb and I \n     have conducted inventories of abandoned mines in the Black \n     Hills area for the U.S. Forest Service and for the South \n     Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, so we \n     are familiar with uranium mines in the western part of the \n     state.\n       Uranium deposits were discovered in the southern Black \n     Hills of South Dakota in 1951. By 1953, the former U.S. \n     Atomic Energy Commission had established a station at \n     Edgemont in Fall River County. A mill for processing uranium \n     in Edgemont was completed in 1956. This mill served open-pit \n     and underground mining operations in the southern Black Hills \n     area. Uranium also was mined in Harding County, South Dakota.\n       Production of uranium ore in South Dakota reached its peak \n     in 1964, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In the late \n     1960's, production declined after federal price supports were \n     eliminated and supply exceeded demand. The mill at Edgemont \n     ceased production of uranium concentrates in 1972 and was de-\n     commissioned in the 1980's. Most uranium mines in the Black \n     Hills have been inactive or abandoned since the late 1960's \n     or early 1970's.\n       Information from the former U.S. Atomic Energy Commission \n     and the U.S. Geological Survey shows that nearly one million \n     tons of uranium ore were mined in South Dakota from 1953 to \n     1972. More than one hundred mines operated at one time or \n     another in the Edgemont area, although in some cases several \n     claims were consolidated later into a single mine. Much of \n     the mining was from open pits, but at least 22 mines had \n     underground workings. These mines are listed\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\n     below. Photographs of some of these mine openings are \n     reproduced on an enclosed page.\n       We hope this information will be helpful. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Arden D. Davis,\n                              Professor of Geological Engineering.\n                                                 Cathleen J. Webb,\n                                 Associate Professor of Chemistry.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Today I join my colleague, Senator Hatch, in \nintroducing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 1999. \nThese amendments, which are desperately needed, will help to provide \nmuch needed relief and assistance to many victims of uranium exposure \nand make this Act more consistent with current medical knowledge.\n  From 1946 to 1971, the United States purchased domestically-mined \nuranium for our nuclear weapons arsenal. Many of these mines were \nlocated in western Colorado, affecting citizens in my state. With the \nuranium mined there, in my colleague's state of Utah and throughout the \nwestern United States, we were able to develop vast stores of nuclear \nweapons, which were the key to our national security. The cold war \ndemanded that we keep producing these weapons in order to keep up with, \nand defend ourselves against, the former Soviet Union. It was not until \nmany years later that scientists began to realize that, ironically, the \nuranium we were mining to help create weapons to protect us in a \nnuclear war, was actually killing those men who mined it. Also harmed \nwere those brave men and women who participated in atmospheric tests of \nthe weapons armed with the uranium.\n  By 1971, the Atomic Energy Commission had put in place, and fully \nimplemented, ventilation and safety procedures which greatly reduced \nthe threat of radiation exposure. But for those miners and test-site \nparticipants who were involved in the atomic weapons program in the \nyears before the changes, there was little more available for them than \na kind word and pat on the back as they developed cancer and other \ndiseases.\n  In 1990, we took steps to change the way we treated these victims. I \ncosponsored a measure in the House which allowed victims of certain \ntypes of radiation exposure to file claims with the Department of \nJustice and collect up to $100,000 in damages. It was the first step \ntoward acknowledging the unknown sacrifice many of those miners and \ntest participants made to win the cold war.\n  With the passage of the law, the Committee on the Biological Effects \nof Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) began further researching the health \neffects of radiation exposure. Their studies have revealed that several \nother types of cancer and nonmalignant respiratory diseases are caused \nby exposure to radiation, in addition to those listed in the original \nact. Furthermore, the BEIR Committee has discovered that many of the \nfactors we thought contributed to cancer, such as coffee consumption, \nactually have no effect. Additionally, the unnecessarily long length of \nexposure, sometimes as high as 500 working level months, was determined \nby experts to be excessive and difficult to accurately measure and \nprove. The findings of the BEIR Committee have led us to seek to update \nthe original law, with the advice and input of many experts in the \nhealth and mining fields, by amending the act with the latest \nscientific research.\n  It's time to finish what we started in the 1990 act. These victims \nneed to be treated fairly and receive adequate care. We also owe it to \nthe other people who worked with uranium to continue studying the \neffects of their contribution on their health. That's why this bill \nexpands coverage to other uranium victims and establishes grant \nprograms for education and the prevention and early detection of \nradiogenic diseases.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us today in making good on our promise to \nthese people who so dutifully served their nation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of this \nimportant bill to make some much needed changes to the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act. I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nincluding the chairmen of the Senate Judiciary and Indian Affairs \nCommittees, in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, my home state of New Mexico is the birthplace of the \natomic bomb. New Mexico's national laboratories have long been involved \nin developing and testing nuclear weapons. One of the unfortunate \nconsequences of our country's rapid development of its nuclear arsenal \nwas that many of those who worked in the earliest uranium mines, prior \nto the implementation of government health and safety standards in \n1971, became afflicted with terrible illnesses.\n  I began to notice this problem more than 20 years ago, when I learned \nthat miners had contracted an alarmingly high rate of lung cancer and \nother diseases commonly related to radiation exposure.\n  Many of the miners native Americans, mostly members of the Navajo \nNation, with whom the U.S. Government has had a longstanding trust \nrelationship based on the treaties and agreements between our country \nand the tribes. Some 1,500 Navajos worked in the uranium mines from \n1947 to 1971. Many of them have since died of radiation-related \nillnesses.\n  All of the uranium miners, including the Navajos, performed a great \nservice out of patriotic duty to this country. Their work helped us to \nwin the cold war. Unfortunately, our Nation failed to fulfill its duty \nto protect the miners' health and some 20 years ago, I began the effort \nto see that the miners and their families received just compensation \nfor their illnesses.\n  In 1978, in the 95th Congress, I introduced the first bill to \ncompensate uranium miners who contracted radiation-related diseases. \nThe bill was called the Uranium Miners Compensation Act, and it was the \npredecessor to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) which is \nlaw today.\n  The following year in 1979, I held the first field hearing on this \nissue in Grants, NM, to learn about the concerns and the health \nproblems faced by uranium miners. In later years, I traveled to \nShiprock, NM, and the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation to gather more \ninformation about the uranium mines and their families.\n  Twelve years after I introduced that first bill, President Bush \nsigned RECA into law. At the time, RECA was intended to provide fair \nand swift compensation for those miners and downwinders who \nhad contracted certain radiation-related illnesses.\n\n  Since the RECA trust fund began making awards in 1992, the Department \nof Justice has approved a total 3,135 claims valued at nearly $232 \nmillion. In my home state of New Mexico, there have been 371 claims \napproved with a value of nearly $37 million. For that work, the \nDepartment of Justice is to be commended.\n  The original RECA was a compassionate law which unfortunately has \ncome to be administered in a bureaucratic, dispassionate and often \nunfair manner. Many claims have languished at the Department of Justice \nfor far too long.\n  Miners and their families, particularly Navajos, often have waited \nmany years for their claims to be processed. Many claims were denied \nbecause the miners were smokers and could not prove that their diseases \nwere related solely to uranium mining. In other cases, miners faced \nproblems establishing the requisite amount of working level months \nneeded to make a successful claim. Native American claims by spousal \nsurvivors often were denied because of difficulties associated with \ndocumenting native American marriages.\n  This bill makes some important, common sense changes to the radiation \ncompensation program to address the problems I have outlined. First, it \nexpands the list of compensable diseases to include new cancers, \nincluding leukemia, thyroid, and brain cancer. It also includes certain \nnoncancer diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Medical science has \nbeen able to link these diseases to uranium mining in the 10 years \nsince the enactment of the original RECA. We now know that prolonged \nradiation exposure can cause many additional diseases. This bill uses \nthe best available science to make sure that those who were injured by \nradiation exposure are compensated.\n  The bill also extends eligibility to above-ground and open-pit \nminers, millers and transport workers. The latest science tells us that \nthe risks of disease associated with radiation exposure were not \nnecessarily limited to those who worked in unventilated mines.\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\n  Most importantly, the bill requires the Department of Justice to take \nnative American law and customs into account when deciding claims. I \nhave heard countless stories about the inequities faced by the spouses \nof Navajo miners who have been unable to successfully document their \ntraditional tribal marriages to the satisfaction of the Justice \nDepartment under current law and regulations. This bill will change \nthat, and make it easier for spousal survivors to make successful \nclaims.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this important legislation. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost close \nto $1 billion over the next 21 years. That is far less than some of the \nother proposals floated in the House and Senate during the past few \nyears. This is a commonsense approach, which addresses many of the \nproblems with the existing program, without unnecessarily expanding the \nscope of the Radiation Exposure compensation Act. The chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee has done a fine job crafting this bill and I \nhave been pleased to work with him in that regard. I look forward to \nhelping move this bill through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1516. A bill to amend title III of the Stewart B. McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11331 et seq.) to reauthorize the \nFederal Emergency Management Food and Shelter Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n   LEGISLATION TO RE-AUTHORIZE THE EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Chairman Thompson in \nintroducing a bill that will re-authorize a small but highly effective \nprogram, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, or EFS for short. The \nEFS program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, supplements community efforts to meet the needs of the homeless \nand hungry in all fifty states. I am pleased that my friend, Chairman \nThompson, is sponsoring this legislation. Our Committee on Governmental \nAffairs has jurisdiction over the EFS program, and it is my hope that \ntogether we can generate even more bipartisan support for a program \nthat makes a real difference with its tiny budget. The EFS program is a \ngreat help not only to the Nation's homeless population but also to \nworking people who are trying to feed and shelter their families at \nentry-level wages. Services supplemented by the EFS funding, such as \nfood banks and emergency rent/utility assistance programs, are \nespecially helpful to families with big responsibilities but small \npaychecks.\n  One of the things that distinguishes the EFS program is the extent to \nwhich it relies on non-profit organizations. Local boards in counties, \nparishes, and municipalities across the country advertise the \navailability of funds, decide on non-profit and local government \nagencies to be funded, and monitor the recipient agencies. The local \nboards, like the program's National Board, are made up of charitable \norganizations including the National Council of Churches, the United \nJewish Communities, Catholic Charities, USA, the Salvation Army, and \nthe American Red Cross. By relying on community participation, the \nprogram keeps administrative overhead to an unusually low amount, less \nthan 3%.\n  The EFS program has operated without authorization since 1994 but has \nbeen sustained by annual appropriations. The proposed bill will re-\nauthorize the program for the next three years. It will also authorize \nmodest funding increases over the amounts appropriated in recent years. \nFrom 1990 the EFS program was funded at approximately $130 million \nannually, but that number was cut back by appropriators in fiscal year \n1996 and has held steady at $100 million since then. Creeping inflation \nhas taken an additional bite: $130 million in 1990 dollars is \nequivalent to $165.6 million today. The draft legislation will \nauthorize increases to $125 million in the coming fiscal year and an \nadditional five million dollars each of the following two years. \nAlthough the increases will not bring the program's funding up to its \nprevious levels, they will provide additional aid to community-based \norganizations struggling to meet the needs of the homeless and working \npoor in an era of steep budget cuts.\n  In summary, Mr. President, FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program \nis a highly efficient example of the government relying on the \ncountry's non-profit organizations to help people in innovative ways. \nThe EFS program aids the homeless and the hungry in a majority of the \nnation's counties and in all fifty states, and I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this program and our re-authorizing legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill war order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 322 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 11352) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 322.

PARTICIPATION OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ON LOCAL \n                   BOARDS.\n\n       Section 316(a) of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11346(a)) is amended by striking \n     paragraph (6) and inserting the following:\n       ``(6) guidelines requiring each local board to include in \n     their membership not less than 1 homeless individual, former \n     homeless individual, homeless advocate, or recipient of food \n     or shelter services, except that such guidelines may waive \n     such requirement for any board unable to meet such \n     requirement if the board otherwise consults with homeless \n     individuals, former homeless individuals, homeless advocates, \n     or recipients of food or shelter services.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1517. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure that Medicare beneficiaries have continued access under current \ncontracts to managed health care by extending the Medicare cost \ncontract program for 3 years.\n\n\n                the medicare cost contract extension act\n\n Mr. Allard. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the Medicare Managed Care Cost Contract Extension Act of \n1999.\n  The Medicare Program traditionally offers participating HMOs two \ncontracts to choose from: Medicare risk (Medicare+Choice) and Medicare \ncost. In an effort to expand and refine the Medicare+Choice program, \nSection 4002 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 terminates the Medicare \ncost contract program effective December 31, 2002. This termination of \ncost contracts will leave two options for a Medicare recipient, that of \ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare+Choice.\n  As of June of this year 358,658 Americans receive Medicare HMO \nservice through Medicare cost contracts. The vast majority of these \nAmericans live in rural areas where there are no Medicare+Choice \noptions. In my house state of Colorado, 97 percent of Medicare cost \ncontracting beneficiaries live in a county that does not currently have \nanother Medicare HMO option. If the intention of the Balanced Budget \nAct and Medicare+Choice is to provide a standard, reliable option to \nMedicare fee-for-service coverage it has not yet accomplished this in \nrural areas. It appears to me that until Medicare+Choice coverage is \navailable to rural cost contract recipients Congress should re-consider \nthis sunset.\n  While I agree with the wisdom of the Balanced Budget Act, we have \ndiscovered a number of areas where the Act has not produced the results \nthat Congress intended. As well meaning as the sunset provision for \ncost contracts may have been, I am confident that Congress has no \nintention of leaving rural Americans without a choice in their Medicare \ncoverage.\n  The legislation I am introducing will postpone the sunset date by \nthree years to December 31, 2005. I believe that this extension \naccomplishes a\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\nnumber of things consistent with the Balanced Budget Act as it concerns \ncost contracting.\n  The Medicare Managed Care Cost Contract Extension Act of 1999 will \nnot change current requirement that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration produce a study on the impact of cost contracting \ntermination. This study is currently due in January 2001. I think it is \nimportant that this report be delivered to Congress while there is \nstill time to establish a permanent extension or another sensible \nsolution that will maintain choice for Medicare recipients.\n  As we have seen in my home state of Colorado, Medicare+Choice options \nhave not developed in rural areas currently served by Medicare cost \ncontractors. The Balanced Budget Act may have intended to replace cost \ncontracting services with Medicare+Choice options, but these options \nare not yet available. I believe it would be irresponsible to continue \nto move cost contract beneficiaries toward an option that is \nunavailable. If Medicare+Choice can effectively serve rural areas they \nshould have time to establish themselves. Based on current trends in \nrural health care I do not believe that Medicare+Choice will be a \nviable option in 2002, and perhaps not any time in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  I believe that Medicare beneficiaries deserve a choice in how they \nreceive their health care, and for a few people in our nation the only \nnation to Medicare fee-for-service is through a cost contract. I hope \nthat as we consider various proposals for Medicare reform that we will \nconsider the 358,658 Americans who are facing the elimination of the \nMedicare option they chose to provide their health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 1518. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan income tax credit to long-term caregivers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              EDUCATIONAL TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKERS\n\n   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation today that will help thousands of American workers with the \nfinancial burden associated with sending a daughter or son to college. \nIn this climate of labor shortages, U.S. companies are looking for \ninnovative ways to maintain and attract a dedicated and qualified \nworkforce. Some companies have creatively turned to providing college \nscholarships for their employees' children. My legislation would allow \nemployees to deduct these scholarships from their gross income. Under \ncurrent law, an employee generally is not taxed on post-secondary \neducation assistance provided by an employer for the benefit of the \nemployee. My bill would extend this treatment to employer-provided \neducation assistance for the employees' children, up to $2,000 per \nchild.\n  As many of my colleagues know, employer-provided education assistance \nis considered an integral tool in keeping America's workforce well \ntrained and equipped to deal with the changing face of the New Economy. \nCurrent law not only allows companies to keep an up-to-date labor pool, \nbut also allows many workers to move from low-wage, level positions up \nthe economic ladder of success. Extending tax-free treatment to the \nchildren of employees not only will help working families, but will \ncontribute to our nation's competitiveness in an increasingly dynamic \nglobal economy.\n  My legislation is very simple. It allows employees whose companies \nprovide educational scholarships for employees' children to exclude up \nto $2000 from gross income per child. An employee may not exclude more \nthan $5,250 from gross income for employer education assistance. This \nis the limit established under Section 127(a)(2) of the Internal \nRevenue Code for employer education assistance. In essence, there would \nbe ``family cap.'' Workers could deduct a $2,000 scholarship for their \nchild and could also exclude up to $3,250 of educational benefits for \nthemselves, however, the combined amounts could not exceed $5,250.\n  I believe that Congress should do all it can to help families with \nthe soaring costs of higher education. In today's economy, American \ncompanies are no longer looking purely for a high-school diploma, but \nrequire that their workers have some sort of post-secondary education \nor training. Many working families struggle in providing this basic \nstart which will help their children get well-paying jobs.\n  This piece of legislation is also a modest proposal. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has scored this provision at $231 million over 10 \nyears. I look forward to working with my colleagues in making sure that \nthis provision is fully offset in a responsible manner.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my name to this initiative, for \nthis legislation has been already introduced in a bi-partisan manner in \nthe United States House of Representatives by Representatives Levin and \nEnglish. This bill has the support of over 60 Members of the House and \nI plan on working to ensure that this bill receives the same sort of \nbipartisan support that its companion in the House enjoys.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Grams, and \n        Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1520. A bill to amend the U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Act of \n1998 to extend the period by which the final report is due and to \nauthorize additional funding; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n         u.s. holocaust assets commission extension act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, next \nweek our Nation will pass an important if unnoticed anniversary--the \nanniversary of one of the first official notifications we were given of \nthe atrocities of the Holocaust.\n  On August 8, 1942, Dr. Gerhart Reigner, the World Jewish Congress \nrepresentative in Geneva, sent a cable to both Rabbi Stephen Wise--the \nPresident of the World Jewish Congress--and a British Member of \nParliament. In it, Dr. Reigner wrote about ``an alarming report'' that \nHitler was planning that all Jews in countries occupied or controlled \nGermany ``should after deportation and concentration . . . be \nexterminated at one blow to resolve once and for all the Jewish \nquestion in Europe.'' Our Government's reaction to this news was not \nour greatest moment during that terrible era.\n  First, the State Department refused to give the cable to Rabbi Wise. \nAfter Rabbi Wise got a copy of the cable from the British, he passed it \nalong to the Undersecretary of State, who asked him not to make the \ncontents public until it could be confirmed. Rabbi Wise didn't make it \npublic, but he did tell President Roosevelt, members of the cabinet, \nand Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter about the cable. None of \nthem chose to act publicly on its contents.\n  Our government finally did acknowledge the report some months later, \nbut the question remains: how many lives could have been saved had we \nresponded to this clear warning of the Holocaust earlier and with more \nvigor? The questions of how the United States responded to the \nHolocaust and, specifically, what was the fate of the Holocaust \nvictims' assets that came into the possession or control of the United \nStates government, is the focus of the Presidential Advisory Commission \non Holocaust Assets in the United States, of which I am a member.\n  This bipartisan Commission--chaired by Edgar M. Bronfman--is composed \nof 21 individuals, including four Senators, four Members of the House, \nrepresentatives of the Departments of the Army, Justice, State, and \nTreasury, the Chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, \nand eight private citizens.\n  The Commission is charged with conducting original research into what \nhappened to the assets of Holocaust victims--including gold, other \nfinancial instruments and art and cultural objects--that passed into \nthe possession or control of the Federal government, including the \nFederal Reserve. We are also to survey the research done by others \nabout what happened to the assets of Holocaust victims that passed into \nnon-Federal hands, including State governments, and report to the \nPresident, making recommendations for future actions, whether \nlegislative or administrative.\n  The Commission was created last year by a unanimous Act of Congress, \nand has been hard at work since early this year. Perhaps the most \nimportant information that the Commission's preliminary research has \nuncovered is the fact that the question of the extent\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\nto which assets of Holocaust victims fell into Federal hands is much, \nmuch larger than we thought even a year ago, when we first established \nthis Commission.\n  Last month, at the quarterly, meeting of the Commissioners in \nWashington, we unveiled a ``map'' of Federal and related offices \nthrough which these assets may have flowed. To everyone's surprise, \ntaking a sample year--1943--we found more than 75 separate entities \nthat may have been involved.\n  The records of each of these offices must first be located and then \nscoured--page by page--at the National Archives and other record \ncenters across the United States. In total, we must look at tens of \nmillion of pages to complete the historical record of this period.\n  Futhermore, to our nation's credit, we are currently declassifying \nmillions of pages of World War II-era information that may shine light \non our government's policies and procedures during that time. But, this \nsalutary effort dramatically increases the work the Commission must do \nto fulfill the mandate we have given it.\n  In addition, as the Commission pursues its research, it is \ndiscovering new aspects of the story of Holocaust assets that hadn't \npreviously been understood. The Commission's research may be unearthing \nan alarming trend to import into the United States through South \nAmerica, art and other possessions looted from Holocaust victims. \nPursuing these leads will require the review of additional thousands of \ndocuments.\n  The Commission is also finding aspects of previously known incidents \nthat have not been carefully or credibly researched. The ultimate fate \nof the so-called ``Hungarian Gold Trains,''--for example--a set of \ntrains containing the art, gold, and other valuables of Hungarian \nvictims of the Nazis that was detained by the liberating US Army during \ntheir dash for Berlin has not been carefully investigated.\n  In another area of our research investigators are seeking to piece \ntogether the puzzle of foreign-owned intellectual property--some of \nwhich may have been owned by victims of Nazi genocide--the rights to \nwhich were vested in the Federal government under wartime law.\n  For all the reasons and more, I am introducing today with Senators \nBoxer, Dodd and Grams the ``U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Extension \nAct of 1999.'' This simple piece of legislation moves to December, \n2000, the date of the final report of the Presidential Advisory \nCommission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, giving our \ninvestigators the time to do a professional an credible job on the \ntasks the Congress has assigned to them.\n  This bill also authorizes additional appropriations for the \nCommission to complete its work. I strongly urge all of my colleagues \nto join me in support of this necessary and simple piece of \nlegislation.\n  As we approach the end of the millennium, the United States is \nwithout a doubt the strongest nation on the face of the earth. Our \nstrength, however, is not limited to our military and economic might. \nOur nation is strong because we have the resolve to look at ourselves \nand our history honestly and carefully--even if the truth we find shows \nus a less-than-flattering light.\n  The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the \nUnited States is seeking the truth about the belongings of Holocaust \nvictims that came into the possession or control of the United States \ngovernment. All of my colleagues should support this endeavor, and we \nmust give the Commission the time and support it needs by supporting \nthe U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Extension Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and forestry.\n\n\n                 PET SAFETY AND PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pet \nSafety and Protection Act of 1999, a bill to close a serious loophole \nin the Animal Welfare Act. Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Inouye and Lebin \nare cosponsors of the legislation.\n  Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act over 30 years ago to stop the \nmistreatment of animals and to prevent the unintentional sale of family \npets for laboratory experiments. Despite the Animal Welfare Act's well-\nmeaning intentions and the enforcement efforts of the Department of \nAgriculture, the Act routinely fails to provide pets and pet owners \nwith reliable protection against the actions of some unethical dealers.\n  Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against \ndisease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight \nagainst AIDS, cancer, and a host of life-threatening diseases. Animal \nresearch has been, and continues to be, fundamental to advancements in \nmedicine. I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not \nbe used in research. Rather, I am concerned with the sale of stolen \npets and stray animals to research facilities.\n  These are less than 40 ``random source'' animal dealers operating \nthroughout the country who acquire tens of thousands of dogs and cats. \n``Random source'' dealers are USDA licensed Class B dealers that \nprovide animals for research. Many of these animals are family pets, \nacquired by so-called ``bunchers'' who sometimes resort to theft and \ndeception as they collect animals and sell them to Class B dealers. \n``Bunchers'' often respond to ``free pet to a good home'' \nadvertisements, tricking animal owners into giving away their pets by \nposing as someone interested in adopting the dog or cat. Some random \nsource dealers are known to keep hundreds of animals at a time in \nsqualid conditions, providing them with little food or water. The \nmistreated animals often pass through several hands and across state \nlines before they are eventually sold by a random source dealer to a \nresearch laboratory.\n\n  Mr. President, the use of these animals in research is subject to \nlegitimate criticism because of the fraud, theft, and abuse that I have \njust described. Dr. Robert Whitney, former director for the Office of \nAnimal Care and Use at the National Institutes of Health echoed this \nsentiment when he stated, ``The continue existence of these virtually \nunregulatable Class B dealers erodes the public confidence in our \ncommitment to appropriate procurement, care, and use of animals in the \nimportant research to better the health of both humans and animals.'' \nWhile I doubt that laboratories intentionally seek out stolen or \nfraudulently obtained dogs and cats as research subjects, the fact \nremains that these animals end up in research laboratories, and little \nis being done to stop it. Mr. President, it is clear to most observers, \nincluding animal welfare organizations around the country, that this \nproblem persists because of random source animal dealers.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act strengthens the Animal Welfare Act \nby prohibiting the use of random source animal dealers as suppliers of \ndogs and cats to research laboratories. At the same time, the Pet \nSafety and Protection Act preserves the integrity of animal research by \nencouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate \nsources that comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Legitimate sources are \nUSDA-licensed Class A dealers or breeders, municipal pounds that choose \nto release dogs and cats for\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\nresearch purposes, legitimate pet owners who want to donate their \nanimals to research, and private and federal facilities that breed \ntheir own animals. These four sources are capable of supplying millions \nof animals for research, far more cats and dogs than are required by \ncurrent laboratory demand. Furthermore, at least in the case of using \nmunicipal pounds, research laboratories could save money since pound \nanimals cost only a few dollars compared to the high fees charged by \nrandom animal dealers. The National Institutes of Health, in an effort \nto curb abuse and deception, has already adopted policies against the \nacquisition of dogs and cats from random source dealers.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act also reduces the Department of \nAgriculture's regulatory burden by allowing the Department to sue its \nresources more efficiently and effectively. Each year, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars are spent on regulating 40 random source dealers. \nTo combat any future violations of the Animal Welfare Act, the Pet \nSafety and Protection Act increases the penalties under the Act to a \nminimum of $1,000 per violation.\n  The history of disregard for the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act \nby some animal dealers makes the Pet Safety and Protection Act \nnecessary. Mr. President, the purpose of this Act to stop the \nfraudulent practices of some Class B Dealers. Most importantly, it \nensures that animals used in research are not gained by theft or \ndeceit, and are provided decent shelter, ventilation, sanitation, and \nnourishment. The bill in no way impairs or impedes research, but ends \nsenseless neglect, brutality, and deceit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 1523. A bill to provide a safety net for agricultural producers \nthrough improvement of the marketing assistance loan program, expansion \nof land enrollment opportunities under the conservation reserve \nprogram, and maintenance of opportunities for foreign trade in United \nStates agricultural commodities; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             ``HELP OUR PRODUCERS EQUITY (HOPE) ACT OF 1999\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation \ntoday to provide a ray of hope for our farmers across the country. The \nsituation is dire in the agricultural community. Commodity prices are \nat Depression era levels and are projected to remain low through this \nyear and beyond. Despite the federal government's efforts over the past \nyear to alleviate some the financial strain affecting the agriculture \nindustry, a simple fact remains: we no longer have a policy that \nprotects farmers when forces beyond their control drive prices down.\n\n  Farmers are the hardest working people I know. They work from dusk to \ndawn on land that has been past down from generation to generation. \nThis heritage is in jeopardy of being lost due to depressed commodity \nprices and the lack of an adequate safety net for family farmers.\n  The agricultural industry is the backbone of rural communities. I'm \nnot just hearing from farmers about this crisis. In the past weeks and \nmonths, I've talked with bankers, tractor and implement dealers, \nfertilizer distributors, and even the local barber shop. They are all \nconcerned about the train wreck that will occur if nothing is done to \nprovide an adequate safety net for producers. The bottom line in rural \nAmerica: if farmers are hurting, everyone is hurting.\n  It's really ironic watching the news these days. We're too busy \npatting ourselves on the back over the strength of the stock market and \na potential tax cut that we have all but forgotten those that are not \nbenefitting from this record setting economy. This situation is very \nreminiscent of the roaring 20's that our country experienced earlier in \nthe century, followed by the Great Depression of the 1930's. I hope and \npray that it does not take a situation so severe and drastic to \nconvince this Congress, and the nation, that our agricultural sector \nand domestic production needs our support.\n  The HOPE Act that I am introducing today is built on solid but simple \nprinciples and takes steps to reestablish a safety net for our nation's \nfarmers. To reconstruct the safety we must restore the formula based \nmarketing loan structure that existed prior to the 1996 Farm Bill. Loan \nrates were arbitrarily capped in 1996 and I feel that it is imperative \nto return this assistance loan back into a formula based, market-\noriented program. In doing so, loan rates would more accurately reflect \nmarket trends and provide an adequate price floor for producers. No \nbusiness in America can survive selling their products at levels below \ncost of production. With Depression era prices, that is the situation \nour farmers currently face. An adequate safety net must be restored. \nThis legislation also extends the loan term by up to six months, \nallowing farmers more time to market their crops at the most \nadvantageous price.\n  Secondly, my legislation would require the President to fully explain \nthe benefits and costs of existing food sanctions. It does not make \nsense to force Cuba to purchase their rice from Asia when the United \nStates is only 90 miles away. Without access to foreign markets, we \ncannot expect the agricultural community to survive. We cannot let our \nforeign policy objectives cloud common sense. These sanctions rarely \nimpose significant hardship on the dictators against whom they are \ntargeted. The unfortunate victims are the innocent citizens of these \nforeign lands and the U.S. producers who lose valuable markets when \nthese restrictions are put into place. We require cost/benefit analysis \nfrom almost all sections for our government regulators. We should do no \nless in our agricultural trade arena.\n  I am also very committed to preserving our environment. The \nConservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram(WRP) are responsible for taking a great number of erodible \nacres out of production. Unfortunately, these programs are victims of \ntheir own success because they are near the maximum enrollment levels \nallowed by current law. I propose to expand these programs so that even \nmore marginal acreage is eligible for participation.\n  I urge my colleagues to act quickly and address the growing crisis in \nthe agriculture community. Everyone of us enjoys the safest, most \nabundant, and most affordable food supply in the world. Unfortunately, \nwe often take that for granted in this nation. The consequences of \ndoing nothing are far too great. This safe and abundant supply will not \nbe there for this Nation or the world if we do not support our family \nfarmers at this critical time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 1524. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide for \nthe creation of a certification program for Motor Carrier Safety \nSpecialist and certain informational requirements in order to promote \nhighway safety through a comprehensive review of motor carriers; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           motor carrier safety specialist certification act\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Motor Carrier \nSafety Specialist Act. The reason for the Act is to ensure that all \ninspectors performing compliance reviews on inter- and intra-state \nmotor carriers are certified to a uniform standard and proficiency. \nThis Act is in part a response to the recent bus accident in Louisiana \nby Custom Bus Charter, Inc. in which 22 people were killed, and in \nwhich the driver was found to have marijuana in his system.\n  In July 1996, just four months after the Federal Highway \nAdministration (``FHWA'') inspected and assigned a Satisfactory rating \nto Customs Bus Charter, Inc., a private company under contract to the \nDepartment of Defense failed Custom Bus Charter, Inc. for not having a \ndrug and alcohol testing program. The absence of a drug and alcohol \ntesting program is a FHWA Critical violation for which the carrier \nshould have been assigned, at best, a Conditional rating by FHWA. \nFurthermore, 27 percent of motor carriers that were assigned a \nSatisfactory rating by FHWA, failed to enter the DoD program because of \nCritical violations discovered by the DoD contractor. These examples \ndemonstrate that FHWA does not have the resources and structure to \ncertify inspectors, and that compliance reviews are not always \nperformed in a consistent or accurate manner.\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\n  In addition to inconsistent inspection, FHWA cannot possibly collect \nsufficient safety information on the motor carrier industry. There are \nestimated to be more than 450,000 inter-state motor carriers licensed \nto do business in the U.S. The Federal Highway Administration has the \nresources to conduct only a limited number of compliance reviews \nannually. While they intend to double the current level of inspections, \nthis will only bring the total to approximately 8,000 inspections \nannually, less than 2 percent of the estimated motor carrier \npopulation, with more than twice that amount entering and exiting the \nmarket. Over 70 percent of existing motor carriers have never been \ninspected by FHWA, and fewer than 5 percent of the inspections \nconducted could be considered current, within the past three years.\n  Clearly, the problem is twofold: FHWA is in desperate need of more \ninformation regarding the compliance level of carriers licensed to do \nbusiness, and, those individuals that collect the information through \ninspections must possess some uniform level of competence and \nconsistency. Thus, this Act is needed to certify all Motor Carrier \nSafety Specialists, both in the private and pubic sectors, so that \nthese professionals can perform consistent compliance reviews and \nprovide safety data on motor carriers to the government, industry, and \nthe public. The Act not only provides for certification and training of \nfederal motor carrier safety specialists, but state, local, and third-\nparty safety specialists as well.\n\n  Third-party, private auditors can provide additional information to \nassist FHWA in monitoring carrier performance. Previously, the FHWA has \nnot accepted information from private sources because there is no \ncertification of their proficiency. The Motor Carrier Safety Specialist \nCertification Board, a non-profit organization, would be formed by \ntechnical representatives of the transportation industry, for the \nexpressed purpose of working with the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish a training and certification program for Motor Carrier Safety \nSpecialists and to serve as a clearinghouse for motor carrier data from \nthird-party auditors. This follows the policy contained in Office of \nManagement and Budget Circular Number A-119 and directs agencies to use \nvoluntary standards where possible and the model used successfully by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency for referring federally-mandated \ncertification to private organizations.\n  Further, FHWA needs accurate and current information on motor \ncarriers in order to target its resources towards problem carriers. \nInvestigations by the General Accounting Office and the Department of \nTransportation's Inspector General found that FHWA motor carrier data \nare inadequate and out-of-date, limiting FHWA's ability to identify and \ntarget ``at risk'' carriers. Private auditors could provide additional \ninformation to augment FHWA's database. The Motor Carrier Safety \nSpecialist Certification Board would establish a program to collect and \nverify current information on motor carriers, and provide this \ninformation to the Federal Highway Administration to augment their \ndatabase.\n  Finally, the public must play a role in removing unsafe carriers from \nU.S. highways by considering safety first when hiring a motor carrier. \nSimply put, if the public does not hire carriers that have poor safety \nperformance, they will be put out of business and off our nation's \nhighways. A media campaign must be implemented to educate the public on \ntheir role in increasing motor carrier safety, and about publicly \navailable information systems that provide safety information on motor \ncarriers. Two such internet-accessible systems are the publicly-funded \nFHWA SAFER system and the privately funded International Motor Carrier \nAudit Commission (IMCAC).\n  This program can be quickly implemented due to the support of \nexisting groups that are equipped to carry out training, certification \nand clearinghouse functions, such as the Commercial Vehicle Safety \nAlliance (CVSA) which currently provides certification for roadside \nvehicle inspectors, and the International Motor Carrier Audit \nCommission (IMCAC) which currently provides safety data to the public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed into \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following;\n       (1) The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century \n     provides for the Secretary of Transportation to work in \n     partnership with States and other political jurisdictions to \n     establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor \n     vehicle, and driver safety, to support a safe and efficient \n     transportation system by focusing resources on strategic \n     safety investments, to promote safe for-hire and private \n     transportation, including transportation of passengers and \n     hazardous materials, to identify high-risk carriers and \n     drivers, and to invest in activities likely to generate \n     maximum reductions in the number and severity of commercial \n     motor vehicle crashes.\n       (2) The Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector \n     General Report on the Federal Highway Administration's Motor \n     Carrier Safety Program found that established policies and \n     procedures do not ensure that motor carrier safety \n     regulations are enforced.\n       (3) The Report also found that the Safety Status \n     Measurement System (known as ``SafeStat''), which was \n     implemented to identify and target motor carriers with high-\n     risk safety records, cannot target all carriers with the \n     worst records because its database is incomplete and \n     inaccurate, and data input is not timely.\n       (4) Testimony by the General Accounting Office before the \n     House of Representative's Subcommittee on Transportation and \n     Related Agencies indicated that SafeStat's ability to target \n     high-risk carriers is also limited by out-of-date census \n     data.\n       (5) There are no procedures in place to certify Federal, \n     State, and private motor carrier safety specialists and no \n     standards to ensure consistent carrier compliance reviews.\n       (6) There are no established protocols for acceptance of \n     data from third-party or non-Federal or non-State motor \n     carrier safety specialists, which detail the safety factors \n     of motor carriers.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \n     creation of a certification program for Motor Carrier Safety \n     Specialists and to establish certain informational \n     requirements in order to promote highway safety through a \n     comprehensive review of motor carriers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

DEFINITIONS\n\n       Motor Carrier Safety Specialist.--A Motor Carrier Safety \n     Specialist is an individual who:\n       (1) is responsible for conducting regulatory compliance \n     reviews and safety inspections of commercial motor carriers;\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. INOUYE):\n  S. 1525. A bill to provide for equitable compensation of the Spokane \nTribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation in settlement of its claims \nconcerning its contribution to the production of hydropower by the \nGrand Coulee Dam, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n                    THE SPOKANE TRIBE SETTLEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce on behalf \nof myself and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, ``The \nSpokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam \nEquitable Compensation Act.'' This bill will provide a settlement of \nthe claims of the Spokane Tribe for its contribution to the production \nof hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam.\n  The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete dam in the world, the \nlargest electricity producer in the United States, and the third \nlargest electricity producer in the world. Grand Coulee is one mile in \nwidth; its spillway is twice the height of Niagara Falls. It provides \nelectricity and water to one of the world's largest irrigation \nprojects, the one million acre Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee \nis the backbone of the Northwest's federal power grid and agricultural \neconomy.\n  To the Spokane Tribe, however, the Grand Coulee Dam brought an end to \na way of life. The dam flooded their reservation on two sides. The \nSpokane River changed from a free flowing waterway that supported \nplentiful salmon runs, to barren slack water that now erodes the \nsouthern lands of the reservation. The benefits that accrued to the \nnation and the Northwest were made possible by uncompensated injury to \nthe Native Americans of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers.\n  The legislation I am introducing seeks to compensate the Spokane \nTribe for its losses. In 1994, Congress enacted similar settlement \nlegislation to compensate the neighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. \nThat legislation provided a onetime payment of $53 million for past \ndamages and approximately $15 million annually from the proceeds from \nthe sale of hydropower by the Bonneville Power Administration. The \nSpokane Tribe settlement legislation would provide a settlement \nproportional to that provided to the Colville Tribes, which was based \non the percentage of lands appropriated from the respective tribes for \nthe dam. This translates into 39.4% of the past and future compensation \nawarded the Colville Tribes.\n  Let me give my colleagues some of the background surrounding this \nissue. From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its tributaries. \nIn its report to Congress, the Corps recommended the Grande Coulee site \nfor hydroelectric development. In 1933, the Department of Interior \nfederalized the project under the National Industrial Recovery Act, and \nin 1935, Congress authorized the project in the Rivers and Harbors Act.\n  In 1940, Congress enacted a statute to authorize the Interior \nDepartment to designate whichever Indian lands it deemed necessary for \nGrand Coulee construction and to receive all rights, title and interest \nthe Indians had in them. In return, the Tribes received compensation in \nthe amount determined by Interior Department appraisals. However, the \nonly land that was appraised and for which Tribes were compensated was \nthe newly flooded land, for which the Spokane Tribe received $4700. \nThere is no evidence that the Department advised or that Congress knew \nthat the Tribes' water rights were not extinguished. Neither was there \nevidence the Department know the Indian title and trust status for the \nTribal land underlying the river beds had not been extinguished. No \ncompensation was included for the power value contributed by the use of \nthe Tribal resources or for the loss of the Tribal fisheries or other \ndamages to Tribal resources.\n\n  As pointed out in a 1976 Opinion of Lawrence Aschenbrenner, the \nActing Associate Solicitor, Division of Indian Affairs, Department of \nInterior\n\n       The 1940 act followed seven years of construction during \n     which farm lands, and timber lands were flooded, and a \n     fishery destroyed, and during which Congress was silent as to \n     the Indian interests affected by the construction. Both the \n     Congress and the Department of Interior appeared to proceed \n     with the Grand Coulee project as if there were no Indians \n     involved there. . . . There is no tangible evidence, \n     currently available, to indicate that the Department ever \n     consulted with the Tribes during the 1993-1940 period \n     concerning the ongoing destruction of their land and \n     resources and proposed compensation therefore. . . . It is \n     our conclusion that the location of the dams on tribal land \n     and the use of the water for power production, without \n     compensation, violated the government's fiduciary duty toward \n     the Tribes.\n\n  In 1994, the Colville legislation settled the claims of the Colville \nTribes to a share of the hydropower revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam. \nThis claim was among the claims which the Colville Tribes filed with \nthe Indian Claims Commission (ICC) under the Act of August 13, 1946, \nwhich included a five year statute of limitations. While the Colville \nTribes had been formally organized for more than 15 years, the Spokane \nTribe did not formally organize until 16 days prior to the ICC statute \nof limitations deadline. In addition, while the BIA was aware of the \npotential claims of the Spokane Tribe to a portion of the hydropower \nrevenues generated by Grand Coulee, there is no evidence that the BIA \never advised the Tribe of such claims. The settlement for the Spokane \nTribes was not included with that for the Colville Tribes in 1994 \nbecause the Colvilles had concerns that the statute of limitations \nwould hold up the legislation.\n  Since the 1970s, Congress and federal agencies have indicated that \nboth the Colville and Spokane Tribes should be compensated. Since 1994, \nwhen an agreement was reached to compensate the Colville Tribes, \nCongress and federal agencies have expressed interest in providing \nequitable compensation to the Spokane Tribe. This legislation will \nprovide for the long overdue settlement to which the Spokane Tribe is \nentitled. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1525\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of \n     the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable \n     Compensation Settlement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress find the following:\n       (1) From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n     Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n     tributaries to determine sites where power could be produced \n     at low cost.\n       (2) The Corps of Engineers listed a number of sites, \n     including the site where the Grand Coulee Dam is now located, \n     with recommendations that the power development be performed \n     by local governmental authorities or private utilities under \n     the Federal Power Act.\n       (3) Under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act, licensees \n     must pay Indian tribes for the use of reservation lands.\n       (4) The Columbia Basin Commission, an agency of the State \n     of Washington, applied for, and in August 1933 received, a \n     preliminary permit from the Federal Power Commission for \n     water power development of the Grand Coulee Site.\n       (5) In the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not \n     subject to the Federal Power Act, federalized the Grand \n     Coulee Dam project and began construction of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam.\n       (6) At the time the Grand Coulee Dam project was \n     federalized, the Federal Government knew and recognized that \n     the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam \n     project, including but not limited to development of \n     hydropower, extinguishment of a salmon fishery upon which the \n     Spokane Tribe was almost totally dependent, and inundation of \n     lands with loss of potential power sites previously \n     identified by the Spokane Tribe.\n       (7) In an Act dated June 29, 1940 (54 Stat. 703; 16 U.S.C. \n     835d), Congress enacted legislation to grant to the United \n     States all the rights of the Indians in lands of the Spokane \n     Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations required for the Grand \n     Coulee Dam project and various rights-of-way over Indian \n     lands required in connection with the project. The Act \n     provided that compensation for the lands and rights-of-way \n     required shall be determined by the Secretary of the Interior \n     in such amounts as such Secretary determines just and \n     equitable.\n       (8) In furtherance of the Act of June 29, 1940, the \n     Secretary of the Interior paid to the Spokane Tribe the total \n     sum of $4,700. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation received a payment of $63,000.\n       (9) In 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n     Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \n     Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the \n     United States that provided for past damages and annual \n     payments of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, \n     based on revenues for the sale of electric power and \n     transmission of such power by the Bonneville Power \n     Administration.\n       (10) In legal opinions issued throughout the years by the \n     Department of the Interior Solicitor's Office a Task Force \n     Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, and in hearings before the Congress \n     when the Confederated Tribes Act was enacted, it has \n     repeatedly been recognized that the Spokane Tribe suffered \n     similar damages and had a case legally comparable with that \n     of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation with \n     the sole exception that the 5-year statute of limitations \n     provided in the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946 \n     prevented the Spokane Tribe from bringing its own action \n     for fair and honorable dealings as provided in that Act.\n       (11) The failure of the Spokane Tribe to bring an action of \n     its own before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed \n     to a combination of factors, including the failure of the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry out its advisory \n     responsibilities as required by the Indian Claims Commission \n     Act (Act of August 13, 1946, ch. 959, 60 Stat. 1050) and an \n     effort of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to impose \n     improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by Indian \n     tribes which caused delays in retention of counsel and full \n     investigation of the Spokane Tribe's potential claims.\n       (12) As a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam project, the Spokane Tribe has suffered the complete loss \n     of the salmon fishery upon which it was dependent, the loss \n     of identified hydropower sites it could have developed, the \n     loss of hydropower revenues it would have received under the \n     Federal Power Act had the project not been federalized, and \n     it continues to lose hydropower revenues which the Federal \n     Government recognized the Spokane Tribe was due at the time \n     the project was constructed.\n       (13) Over 39 percent of the Indian-owned lands used for the \n     Grand Coulee Dam project were Spokane Tribe lands.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable \n     compensation to the Spokane Tribe on a basis that is \n     proportionate to the compensation provided to the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation for the \n     damages and losses suffered as a consequence of construction \n     and operation of the Grand Coulee Dam project.\n\n     SEC. 4. SETTLEMENT FUND ACCOUNT.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Account.--There is hereby established \n     in the Treasury an interest bearing account to be known as \n     the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund Account''.\n       (b) Deposit of Amounts.--\n       (1) Initial deposit.--Upon enactment of this Act and \n     appropriation of funds, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     deposit into the Fund Account a sum equal to 39.4 percent of \n     the sum paid to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation in a lump sum pursuant to section 5(a) of the \n     Confederated Tribes Act, adjusted by the consumer price index \n     from the date of that payment of the Confederated Tribes \n     until the date of enactment of this Act, as payment and \n     satisfaction of the Spokane Tribe's claim for use of its \n     lands for generation of hydropower for the period from 1940 \n     through November 2, 1994, the date of the enactment of the \n     Confederated Tribes Act.\n       (2) Subsequent deposits.--Commencing on September 30 of the \n     first fiscal year following enactment of this Act and on \n     September 30 of each of the 5 fiscal years following such \n     fiscal year, the Administrator of the Bonneville Power \n     Administration shall pay into the Fund Account a sum equal to \n     20 percent of 39.4 percent of the sum authorized to be paid \n     to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation \n     pursuant to section 5(b) of the Confederated Tribes Act \n     through the end of the fiscal year during which this Act is \n     enacted, adjusted by the consumer price index to maintain the \n     purchasing power the Spokane Tribe would have had if annual \n     payments had been made to the Spokane Tribe on the date \n     annual payments commenced and were subsequently made to the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation pursuant to \n     section 5(b) of the Confederated Tribes Act.\n       (e) Annual Payments.--On September 1 of the fiscal year \n     following the enactment of this Act and of each fiscal year \n     thereafter, payments shall be made by the Bonneville Power \n     Administration, or any successor thereto, directly to the \n     Spokane Tribe in an amount which is equal to 39.4 percent of \n     the annual payment authorized to be paid to the Confederated \n     Tribes of the Colville Reservation in the operative and each \n     subsequent fiscal year pursuant to section 5(b) of the \n     Confederated Tribes Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. USE AND TREATMENT OF SETTLEMENT FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Transfer of Funds to Tribe.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall transfer all or any portion of the settlement \n     funds described in section 4(a) to the Spokane Business \n     Council not later than 60 days after such Secretary receives \n     written notice of the adoption by the Spokane Business \n     Council of a resolution requesting that such Secretary \n     execute the transfer of such funds. Subsequent requests may \n     be made and funds transferred if not all of the funds are \n     requested at one time.\n       (b) Use of Initial Payment Funds.--\n       (1) General discretionary funds.--Twenty-five percent of \n     the settlement funds described in section 4(a) and (b) shall \n     be reserved by the Business Council and used for \n     discretionary purposes of general benefit to all members \n     of the Spokane Tribe.\n       (2) Funds for Specific Purposes.--Seventy-five percent of \n     the settlement funds described in section 4(a) and (b) shall \n     be used for the following:\n       (A) Resource development program.\n       (B) Credit program.\n       (C) Scholarship program.\n       (D) Reserve, investment, and economic development programs.\n       (c) Use of Annual Payment Funds.--Annual payments made to \n     the Spokane Tribe pursuant to section 4(c) may be used or \n     invested by the Spokane Tribe in the same manner as other \n     tribal governmental funds.\n       (d) Approval of Secretary Not Required.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, the approval of the Secretary of \n     the Treasury or the Secretary of the Interior for any \n     payment, distribution, or use of the principal, interest, or \n     income generated by any settlement funds transferred or paid \n     to the Spokane Tribe pursuant to this Act shall not be \n     required and such Secretaries shall have no trust \n     responsibility for the investment, supervision, \n     administration, or expenditure of such funds once such funds \n     are transferred to or paid directly to the Spokane Tribe.\n       (c) Treatment of Funds for Certain Purposes.--The payments \n     or distributions of any portion of the principal, interest, \n     and income generated by the settlement funds described in \n     section 4 shall be treated in the same manner as payments or \n     distributions from the Investment Fund described in section 6 \n     of Public Law 99-346 (100 Stat. 677).\n       (f) Tribal Audit.--The settlement funds described in \n     section 4, once transferred or paid to the Spokane Tribe, \n     shall be considered Spokane Tribe governmental funds and, as \n     other tribal governmental funds, be subject to an annual \n     tribal governmental audit.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPAYMENT CREDIT.\n\n       Beginning in the fiscal year following enactment of this \n     Act and continuing for so long as annual payments are made \n     under this Act, the Administrator of the Bonneville Power \n     Administration shall deduct from the interest payable to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury from net proceeds as defined in \n     section 13 of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System \n     Act, a percentage of the payment made to the Spokane Tribe \n     for the prior fiscal year. The actual percentage\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\n     of such deduction shall be calculated and adjusted to ensure \n     that the Bonneville Power Administration receives a deduction \n     comparable to that which it receives for payments made to the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation pursuant to \n     the Confederated Tribes Act. Each deduction made under this \n     section shall be credited to the interest payments otherwise \n     payable by the Administrator to the Secretary of the Treasury \n     during the fiscal year in which the deduction is made, and \n     shall be allocated pro rata to all interest payments on debt \n     associated with the generation function of the Federal \n     Columbia River Power System that are due during that fiscal \n     year; except that, if the deduction in any fiscal year is \n     greater than the interest due on debt associated with the \n     generation function for the fiscal year, then the amount of \n     the deduction that exceeds the interest due on debt \n     associated with the general function shall be allocated pro \n     rata to all other interest payments due during that fiscal \n     year.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit to taxpayers investing in entities seeking to provide \ncapital to create new markets in low-income communities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                         new markets tax credit\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a new tool, \nthe ``New Markets Tax Credit,'' to be used to expand economic \ndevelopment opportunities in low-income communities in West Virginia \nand across this country. I'm very pleased that my good friends, Senator \nRobb, Sarbanes, Kennedy, and Kerry, are joining me in this effort.\n  Despite the unprecedented period of expansion of the U.S. economy, \nmany urban and rural areas continue to be held back by stubborn \nproblems such as high unemployment and underemployment, insufficient \naffordable housing, shortages of services such as day care and shopping \ncenters, and perhaps most importantly, by a chronic shortage of the \nprivate investment capital needed to stimulate and support community \ndevelopment.\n  For example, in West Virginia, we have counties where the official \nunemployment rate is as high as 14%. Counties like Mingo, McDowell, \nLogan and Boone have seen devastating job losses in the past two \ndecades. For these rural communities, the nation's current economic \nboom is a distant echo. It's not that these people do not want to work, \nor that the entrepreneurial spirit is lacking. A major factor is the \nlack of private sector equity investment for business growth.\n  I have been pursuing economic development opportunities for my state \nfor over 30 years, and perhaps the largest problem I've encountered is \nthe lack of venture capital. America's most depressed economic areas \ndesperately need private investment. They get very little not only \nbecause they are unattractive, but also because of misperceptions and \nmarket failures. A lack of information, for instance, means that many \ncompanies may have an exaggerated idea of the risk of investing in \ndeprived areas, and often have no idea of potential markets. Yes, it is \ntrue that private venture capital investment rose 24% in 1998, 76% of \nthe total went to technology-based companies--primarily in California's \nSilicon Valley and New England's high-tech corridors. But only 5.7% of \nall venture capital in 1998 went to South Central, Southwest and \nNorthwest regions combined. Obviously, this is a huge disparity that \nneeds to be corrected.\n  The New Markets Tax Credit is designed to encourage $6 billion in \nprivate sector equity investment for business growth in low and \nmoderate income rural and urban communities. It would do that by \nproviding tax credits for investments of $1.2 billion annually. The \ninvestments would be made by banks, foundations, companies or \nindividuals. These investors would acquire stock or other equity \ninterests in selected community economic development entities whose \nprimary mission is serving distressed communities. Urban and rural \ncommunities with high poverty and low median income would be targeted.\n  The tax credits would be issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to \nthe selected entities. These entities in turn would sell or syndicate \nthe credit to investors. The tax credit ultimately delivered to the \ninvestor would be in the amount of 6 percent annually of the amount of \nthe investment, for an approximate aggregate value to the investor of \n25 percent of the ``present value'' of the original investment over the \n7 years. A ``qualified investment'' by an investor would be a cash \npurchase of stock or other equity in a selected entity, which must be \nheld for at least 7 years. Substantially all of the investment would be \nrequired to be used by the community economic development entity to \nmake ``qualified low-income community investments,'' which would be \nequity investments in, or loans to, qualified active businesses in the \nlow-income communities.\n  The goal of this tax credit will be to encourage private investors \nwho may have never considered investing in high-risk areas to do so. By \ninvesting in the community through local businesses private investors \ncan explore new markets and improve the quality of life for the people \nin the area. Community development organizations may use the funds from \nprivate investors to develop micro-enterprise, manufacturing \nbusinesses, commercial facilities, communities facilities, like child \ncare facilities and senior centers and co-operatives. It has the \npotential to encourage $6 billion in venture capital to these high-risk \nareas. And because community development vehicles may not redeem the \nequity interest for at least seven years, capital stays in the \ncommunity. The New Markets Tax Credit will create new relationships \nbetween investors, community development vehicles, and small \nbusinesses, which will foster continued support and lasting investment.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the New Markets Tax Credit may be one \nof the most promising and viable new idea for genuine economic \ndevelopment in distressed urban and rural communities in recent years. \nPresident Clinton has highlighted this proposal as part of his FY2000 \nbudget, and just last month took the case to people across the country, \nthose parts of our country which have been too long ignored can \nexperience real benefit from this type of initiative. Communities, \nbusinesses, and investors are responding enthusiastically.\n  Hope that is backed up by a strong program of economic investment is \nneeded in West Virginia and urban and rural communities throughout \nAmerica. We have all heard the talk in the recent weeks as proponents \nof massive new tax breaks argue that we should send even more money \nback to those who have benefited the most from our historic economic \nexpansion. I believe it would be irresponsible for us to create ways to \nprovide additional tax relief to those in our society who need the \nleast assistance before we make a concerted effort to revitalize the \nparts of our country, and to help the people of our country, who have \nbeen noticeably left out of the prosperity that went elsewhere. If \nwe're going to do more for those who need it least, let us also commit \nto do what we can to propel those most in need of a helping hand into \nthe future with real hope of economic success. The New Markets Tax \nCredit is one solid way to do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine this proposal carefully and give it \ntheir full\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\nsupport. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nRockefeller, in introducing the New Markets Tax Credit Act, innovative \nlegislation that will benefit both rural and urban America.\n  As its name suggests, the New Markets bill is designed to create new \nmarkets within our nation for investment, for job growth, and for \nrenewal. While most of the nation experiences record economic growth, \nthere are some places that have been left behind. Too many communities \nin both rural and urban America haven't been able to share the wealth, \nand without willing investors, that wealth may never come. Capitalism \ncannot flourish where there is no capital. This legislation we're \nintroducing today addresses the need for investment in all our \ncommunities, and I believe the tax credits contained in this bill \nprovide a way for America to lift as it climbs.\n  Under this bill, tax credits would be allocated to Community \nDevelopment Entities located within the neighborhoods and rural areas \nwhere help is needed. Those who invest in these Community Development \norganizations would receive tax benefits, and the funds they invested \nwould be used by the organizations to invest in local businesses, \nprovide start-up capital, or make low interest loans. The investment \ndecisions would be made at the local level by those who best know the \ncommunity, would attract private enterprise to create economic growth, \nand would use federal tax credits to achieve these objectives. This \nlocal, federal, and private sector partnership holds the key to \nimproving communities across this nation.\n  The New Markets Initiative can use both the business incubator and \ncommunity action models that have proven so successful in many \ncommunities. An example of such success can be found at People, \nIncorporated in Southwest Virginia, a community action agency that \npromotes economic growth by leveraging funds and lending expertise to \nnew or expanding businesses.\n  This legislation, along with the Enterprise Zone bill I recently \nintroduced, gives lcoal communities the tools they need to spur \neconomic growth where they live. Attracting investments to the neediest \ncommunities will pay dividends, not just in economic terms, but in \nquality of life terms as well. Prospering communities can provide \nquality education, improved transportation and better police \nprotection. And improving communities can provide a draw for those who \nwould otherwise be tempted to move out to the suburbs, thereby reducing \nthe pressures that have created suburban sprawl and increasing commutes \nand diminishing open spaces.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can move this legislation quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1527. A bill to amend section 258 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to enhance the protections against unauthorized changes in \nsubscriber selections of telephones service providers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     THE ANTI-SLAMMING ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nconcerning legislation which I am introducing to deal with the problem \nof slamming.\n  Telephone ``slamming'' is the illegal practice of switching a \nconsumer's long distance service without the individual's consent. This \nproblem has increased dramatically over the last several years, as \ncompetition between long distance carriers has risen, and slamming is \nthe top consumer complaint lodged at the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC), with 11,278 reported complaints in 1995, and 16,500 \nin 1996. In both 1997 and 1998, more than 20,000 complaints were filed. \nIt is very clear that this problem is on the rise, and unfortunately, \nthis represents only the tip of the iceberg because most consumers \nnever report violations to the FCC. One regional Bell company estimates \nthat 1 in every 20 switches is fraudulent. Media reports indicate that \nas many as 1 million illegal transfers occur annually. Thus, slamming \nthreatens to rob consumers of the benefit of a competitive market, \nwhich is now composed of over 500 companies which generate $72.5 \nbillion in revenues. As a result of slamming, consumers face not only \nhigher phone bills, but also the significant expenditure of time and \nenergy in attempting to identify and reverse the fraud. The results of \nslamming are clear: higher phone bills and immense consumer \nfrustration.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware of the stiff competition which occurs \nfor customers in the long distance telephone\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\nservice industry. The goal of deregulating the telecommunications \nindustry was to allow consumers to easily avail themselves of lower \nprices and better service. Hopefully, this option will soon be \npresented to consumers for in-state calls and local phone service. \nIndeed, better service at lower cost is a main objective of those who \nseek to deregulate the utility industry. Unfortunately, fraud threatens \nto rob many consumers of the benefits of a competitive industry.\n  Telemarketing is one of the least expensive and most effective forms \nof marketing, and it has exponentially expanded in recent years. By \nstatute, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates most \ntelemarketing, prohibiting deceptive or abusive sales calls, requiring \nthat homes not be called at certain times, and that companies honor a \nconsumer's request not to be called again. The law mandates that \nrecords concerning sales be maintained for two years. While the FTC is \ncharged with primary enforcement, the law allows consumers, or state \nAttorneys General on their behalf, to bring legal action against \nviolators. Yet, phone companies are exempt from these regulations, \nsince they are subject to FCC regulation.\n  While the FCC has brought action against twenty-two of the industry's \nlargest and smallest firms for slamming violations with penalties \ntotaling over $1.8 million, this represents a minute fraction of the \nviolations. FCC prosecution does not effectively address or deter this \nserious fraud. State officials have become more aggressive in pursuing \nviolators. The California Public Utility Commission fined a company $2 \nmillion in 1997 after 56,000 complaints were filed against it. Arizona, \nArkansas, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, \nNew Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin have all pursued litigation \nagainst slammers. Public officials of twenty-five states asked the FCC \nto adopt tougher rules against slammers.\n  As directed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC has moved \nto close several loopholes which have allowed slamming to continue \nunabated. Most important, the FCC has proposed to eliminate the \nfinancial incentive which encourages many companies to slam by \nmandating that customers who are slammed do not have to pay fees to \nslammers for the first thirty days after the switch occurred. At \npresent, a slammer can retain the profits generated from an illegal \nswitch. Additionally, the FCC has proposed regulations which would \nrequire that a carrier confirm all switches generated by telemarketing \nthrough either (1) a letter of agency, known as a LOA, from the \nconsumer; (2) a recording of the consumer verifying his or her choice \non a toll-free line provided by the carrier; or (3) a record of \nverification by an appropriately qualified and independent third party. \nThe regulations, which were recently finalized by the FCC, \nunfortunately have been blocked by court order until long distance \ncarriers have time to analyze the implications of the rules. If and \nwhen these rules are finalized, I still believe that these remedies \nwill be wholly inadequate to address the ever-increasing problem of \nslamming. The problem is that slammed consumers would still be left \nwithout conclusive proof that their consent was properly obtained and \nverified.\n  My legislation encompasses a three-part approach to stop slamming by \nstrengthening the procedures used to verify consent obtained by \nmarketers; increasing enforcement procedures by allowing citizens or \ntheir representatives to pursue slammers in court with the evidence \nnecessary to win; and encouraging all stakeholders to use emerging \ntechnology to prevent fraud.\n  Mr. President, let me also thank the National Association of \nAttorneys General, the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners which through both their national offices and individual \nmembers provided extensive recommendations to improve this bill. \nAdditionally, I have found extremely helpful the input of several \ngroups which advocate on behalf of consumers. I was particularly \npleased to work with the Consumer Federation of America to address \nconcerns which its members expressed.\n  Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to outline the specific \nprovisions of my bill. My legislation requires that a consumer's \nconsent to change service is verified so that discrepancies can be \nadjudicated quickly and efficiently. Like the 1996 Act, my bill \nrequires a legal switch to include verification. However, my \nlegislation enumerates the necessary elements of a valid verification. \nFirst, the bill requires verification to be maintained by the provider, \neither in the form of a letter from the consumer or by recording \nverification of the consumer's consent via the phone. The length that \nthe verification must be maintained is to be determined by the FCC. \nSecond, the bill stipulates the form that verification must take. \nWritten verification remains the same as current regulations. Oral \nverification must include the voice of the subscriber affirmatively \ndemonstrating that she wants her long distance provider to be changed; \nis authorized to make the change; and is currently verifying an \nimminent switch. The bill mandates oral verification to be conducted in \na separate call from that of the telemarketer, by an independent, \ndisinterested party. This verifying call must promptly disclose the \nnature and purpose of the call. Third, after a change has been \nexecuted, the new service provider must send a letter to the consumer, \nwithin five business days of the change in service, informing the \nconsumer that the change, which he requested and verified, has been \neffected. Fourth, the bill mandates that a copy of verification be \nprovided to the consumer upon request. Finally, the bill requires the \nFCC to finalize rules implementing these mandates within nine months of \nenactment of the bill.\n  These procedures should help ensure that consumers can efficiently \navail themselves of the phone service they seek, without being exposed \nto random and undetectable fraudulent switches. If an individual is \nswitched without his or her consent, the mandate of recorded, \nmaintained verification will provide the consumer with the proof \nnecessary to prove that the switch was illegal.\n  The second main provision of my legislation would provide consumers, \nor their public representatives, a legal right to pursue violators in \ncourt. Following the model of Senator Hollings' 1991 Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act, my bill provides aggrieved consumers with a private \nright of action in any state court which allows, under specific \nslamming laws or more general consumer protection statutes such an \naction. The 1991 Act has been adjudicated to withstand constitutional \nchallenges on both equal protection and tenth amendment claims. Thus, \nthe bill has the benefit of specifying one forum in which to resolve \nillegal switches of all types of service: long distance, in-state, and \nlocal service.\n  Realizing that many individuals will not have the time, resources, or \ninclination to pursue a civil action, my bill also allows state \nAttorneys Generals, or other officials authorized by state law, to \nbring an action on behalf of citizens. Like the private right of action \nin suits brought by public officials damages are statutorily set at \n$1,000 or actual damages, whichever is greater. Treble damages are \nawarded in cases of knowing or willful violations. In addition to \nmonetary awards, states are entitled to seek relief in the form of \nwrits of mandamus, injunction, or similar relief. To ensure a proper \nrole for the FCC, state actions must be brought in a federal district \ncourt where the victim or defendant resides. Additionally, state \nactions must be certified with the Commission, which maintains a right \nto intervening in an action. The bill makes express the fact that it \nhas no impact on state authority to investigate consumer fraud or bring \nlegal action under any state law.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation recognizes that neither \nlegislators nor regulators can solve tomorrow's problems with today's \ntechnology. Therefore, my bill mandates that the FCC provide Congress \nwith a report on other, less burdensome but more secure means of \nobtaining and recording consumer consent. Such methods might include \nutilization of Internet technology or issuing PIN numbers or customer \ncodes to be used before carrier changes are authorized. The bill \nrequires that the FCC report to Congress on such methodology not later \nthan 180 days after enactment of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my initiative \nto stop\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\nslamming. Last year we came close to passing significant anti-slamming \nlegislation. I hope that this issue can be addressed quickly this \nCongress. As a result, I would urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As the telecommunications industry has moved toward \n     competition in the provision of long distance telephone \n     services, consumers have increasingly elected to change the \n     carriers that provide their long distance telephone services. \n     As many as 50,000,000 consumers now change long distance \n     telephone service providers each year.\n       (2) The fluid nature of the market for long distance \n     telephone services has also allowed an increasing number of \n     unauthorized changes of telephone service providers to occur. \n     Such changes have been called ``slamming'', a term which \n     denotes any practice in which a consumer's long distance \n     telephone service provider is changed without the consumer's \n     knowledge or consent.\n       (3) Slamming accounts for the largest number of consumer \n     complaints received by the Common Carrier Bureau of the \n     Federal Communications Commission. As many as 1,000,000 \n     consumers are subject to the unauthorized change of telephone \n     service providers each year.\n       (4) The increased costs which consumers face as a result of \n     the unauthorized change of telephone service providers \n     threaten to deprive consumers of the financial benefits \n     created by a competitive marketplace in telephone services.\n       (5) The burdens placed upon consumers by unauthorized \n     changes of telephone service providers will expand \n     exponentially as competition enters into the markets for \n     intraLATA and local telephone services.\n       (6) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to combat \n     unauthorized changes of telephone service providers by \n     requiring that a provider who changes a subscriber without \n     authorization pay the previously selected carrier an amount \n     equal to all charges paid by the subscriber after the change. \n     The Federal Communications Commission has proposed \n     regulations to implement this requirement. Implementing these \n     regulations will eliminate many of the financial incentives \n     to execute unauthorized changes of telephone service \n     providers. However, under current and proposed regulations \n     consumers have, and will continue to face, difficulty in \n     securing proof of unauthorized changes. Thus, enforcement of \n     the regulations will be impeded by a lack of tangible proof \n     of consumer consent to the change of telephone service \n     providers.\n       (7) The interests of consumers require that telephone \n     service providers maintain evidence of their verification of \n     consumer consent to changes in telephone service providers. \n     This evidence should take the form of a consumer's written \n     consent or a recording of a consumer's oral consent obtained \n     by the telephone service provider or a third party.\n       (8) Both Congress and the Federal Communications Commission \n     should continue to examine electronic means by which \n     consumers could most readily change telephone service \n     providers while ensuring that such changes would result only \n     from consumer action evidencing express consent to such \n     changes.\n       (9) By providing consumers with a private right of action \n     in State court, if State law permits, against those who have \n     executed unauthorized changes of telephone service providers, \n     Congress insures in a constitutional manner that neither \n     Federal nor State courts will be overburdened with \n     litigation, while also providing the proper forum for such \n     actions given that competition will soon come to all segments \n     of the telephone service market.\n       (10) The majority of consumers who have been subject to the \n     unauthorized change of telephone service do not seek redress \n     through the Federal Communications Commission. In light of \n     the general responsibilities of the States for consumer \n     protection, as well as the prosecutions against unauthorized \n     changes already undertaken by the States, it is essential \n     that the States be allowed to pursue actions on behalf of \n     their citizens, while also preserving the proper role of the \n     Federal Communications Commission in regulating the \n     telecommunications industry.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect consumers from unauthorized changes of \n     telephone service providers;\n       (2) to allow the efficient prosecution of legal actions \n     against telephone service providers who defraud consumers by \n     transferring telephone service providers without consumer \n     consent; and\n       (3) to facilitate the ready selection of telephone service \n     providers by consumers.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to clarify liability under that \nAct for certain recycling transactions; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n                    SUPERFUND RECYCLING ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senate Minority Leader Daschle, and Senators Warner, \nChafee, Baucus, and Lincoln, in introducing the Superfund Recycling \nEquity Act of 1999.\n  This legislation, similar to that which the distinguished minority \nleader and I introduced in the previous Congress, removes an unintended \nconsequence of the Superfund statute that has inhibited the growth of \nrecycling in our nation. I am certain that when the Congress passed the \nComprehensive Emergency Response, Liability and Compensation Act \n(CERCLA), members of both bodies did not want, and did not suggest, \nthat traditional recyclable materials--paper, glass, plastic, metals, \ntextiles, and rubber--should be any more subject to Superfund liability \nthan a competitive product made of virgin material. However, that is \nhow the courts have interpreted Superfund.\n  Consequently, CERCLA has created a competitive disadvantage between \nvirgin materials used as manufacturing feedstocks and recyclable \nmaterials used for precisely the same purpose. The courts have \nconcluded that recyclables are materials that have been disposed of and \nare therefore subject to Superfund liability. Even most American \nschoolchildren know, recycling is good for the nation--that recycling \nis the exact opposite of disposal. Recycling serves important national \ngoals by keeping materials from entering the waste stream. Through \nrecycling we reclaim useful products and materials. We use recyclables \nas manufacturing feedstocks just as we do virgin raw materials, but \nusing recyclables also helps to preserve the earth's scarce resources, \nreduces society's energy demand, lowers water and air pollution and \nreduces solid waste.\n  Mr. President, our bill corrects this unintended consequence of \nSuperfund. It recognizes that recycling is not disposal. That recyclers \nare not subject to Superfund's liability scheme should the owners of \nmills, foundries or refineries, to which recyclers ship their material, \ncontaminate their facilities.\n  Let me highlight an example of the unintended consequence that will \ncontinue to exist without this needed clarification. A recycler sends \nscrap metal as feedstock to be manufactured into a new product at a \nmill. The same mill also uses virgin metals to make the identical \nproduct. If the mill contaminates its facility with a hazardous \nsubstance, only the recyclable becomes subject to Superfund liability. \nBecause recyclables are considered solid wastes, the recycler's actions \nare considered arranging for disposal, thus creating liability. \nHowever, the shipper of the virgin material is not liable under \nSuperfund since it shipped a product and did not ``arrange for \ndisposal.''\n  The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 is essential to correct \nSuperfund's unintended bias against recycling. It will provide the same \nrelief from Superfund liability for legitimate recyclers as that \nenjoyed by those who sell virgin materials. It will also ensure that, \nsham recyclers will not benefit from the provisions of this bill. The \nSuperfund Recycling Equity Act contains conditions that can only be met \nby legitimate recyclers of paper, glass, plastic, metals, textiles and \nrubber. And, to be free of liability, recyclers must act in an \nenvironmentally sound manner and sell their product to manufacturers \nwith environmentally responsible business practices.\n  It is also important to note what this bill will not do. It will not \nrelieve from liability any recycler who has contaminated his own \nfacility. Nor will it assist recyclers who have disposed of waste at \nlandfills or other places at which waste was the cause of a release of \nhazardous substances to a site that is addressed by the Superfund \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Minority Leader and I previously stated our \nintention that, should a more comprehensive Superfund bill fail to move \ntoward conclusion in the Senate, we would work in a bipartisan fashion, \ntoward the goal of Superfund relief for legitimate recyclers in the \n1999 session of this Congress. Members of the Environment and Public \nWorks, led by Chairman Chafee, Subcommittee Chairman Smith, and Ranking \nMinority Member Baucus, have worked extraordinarily hard to try to \nbring a common sense Superfund bill to the Senate floor that addresses \na series of issues, including relief for recyclers. Unfortunately, once \nagain, differences appear to have stymied that effort. I congratulate \nmy colleagues for their efforts to address this issue. However, \nrealizing the chances of passing a more comprehensive Superfund reform \nbill are now somewhat remote, it is time to address the Superfund \nrecycling issue.\n  The language offered today is similar to the bipartisan measure we \nintroduced last year. In the last Congress, the Minority Leader and I \nwere joined by 63 of our colleagues across party and ideological lines \nin support of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act (S. 2180). It is now \ntime to complete our work and provide relief--relief for recyclers that \nis long overdue.\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\n  There is one remaining issue regarding polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs) in recycled paper which has been the subject of negotiations \nbetween various parties and the Administration. It is my understanding \nthat these parties are negotiating in good faith, and that many, but \nnot all issues, have been resolved. I have said in the past, I would be \nwilling to modify the Superfund recycling language if the original \nnegotiating partners agreed to a proposed language change. That remains \nmy position. Should there be an agreement among the original \nnegotiators on the paper PCB issue subsequent to today's introduction, \nI will at the earliest appropriate moment make the agreed upon change.\n  Mr. President, Americans have properly embraced the benefits of \nrecycling. Americans know that increased recycling means more efficient \nuse of natural resources and a meaningful reduction in solid waste. By \nremoving the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, Congress will \nstimulate more recycling. I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this \npro-environment bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Superfund Recycling Equity \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the reuse and recycling of scrap material in \n     furtherance of the goals of waste minimization and natural \n     resource conservation while protecting human health and the \n     environment;\n       (2) to create greater equity in the statutory treatment of \n     recycled versus virgin materials; and\n       (3) to remove the disincentives and impediments to \n     recycling created as an unintended consequence of the 1980 \n     Superfund liability provisions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Recycling transactions.''.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues in introducing legislation to relieve legitimate recyclers \nfrom Superfund liability.\n  This legislation has become necessary because of an unintended \nconsequence of the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation, and \nLiability Act, more commonly called Superfund. Some courts have \ninterpreted CERCLA to mean that the sale of certain traditional \nrecyclable feedstocks is an arrangement for the treatment or disposal \nof a hazardous substance and, therefore, fully subject to Superfund \nliability. While there exists in law and legislative history no \nsuggestion whatsoever that the Congress intended to impede recycling in \nAmerica by providing a strong preference for the use of virgin \nmaterials through the Superfund liability scheme, that is precisely \nwhat has happened.\n  The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 is intended to place \ntraditional recyclable materials which are used as feedstocks in the \nmanufacturing process on an equal footing with their virgin, or primary \nfeedstock, counterparts. Traditional recyclables are made from paper, \nglass, plastic, metals, batteries, textiles, and rubber.\n  During the 103rd Congress I first introduced a bill to relieve \nlegitimate recyclers of scrap metal from unintended Superfund \nliability. The bill was developed in conjunction with the recycling \nindustry, the environmental community, and the Administration. All of \nthe parties worked closely together and consistently agreed that \nliability relief for recyclers is necessary and right.\n  The language in this bill is the culmination of a process that we \nhave been working on since the 103rd Congress. Similar language was \nalso introduced in the 104th and 105th Congresses with the most recent \nversion garnering almost 400 Senate and House co-sponsors. I am sure \nyou can see, Mr. President, the push to relieve these legitimate \nrecyclers of this unintended liability has received broad, bi-partisan \nsupport.\n  The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 acknowledges that Congress \ndid not intend to subject to Superfund liability those government and \nprivate entities that collect and process secondary materials for sale \nas feedstocks for manufacturing. This bill removes from liability those \nwho collect, process, and sell to manufacturers paper, glass, plastic, \nmetal textiles, and rubber recyclables. This bill also exempts from \nliability those individuals who collect lead acid, nickel, cadmium, and \nother batteries for the recycling of the valuable components. However, \nthis bill does not exempt chemical, solvent, sludge, or slag recycling. \nIt addresses traditional recyclables in a CERCLA context only. We do \nnot intend it to be viewed as a precedent for any other amendment to \nSuperfund or to any other environmental statute, whatsoever.\n  It should also be clearly understood that this bill addresses the \nproduct of recyclers, that is the recyclables they sell which are \nutilized to make new products. This does not affect liability for \ncontamination that is created at a facility owned or operated by a \nrecycler. Neither does it affect liability related to any process \nwastes sent by a recycler for treatment or disposal. In order to assure \nthat only bonafide recycling facilities benefit from this bill, a \nnumber of tests have been established within the bill by which \nliability relief will be denied to sham recyclers.\n  I have consistently supported Superfund reforms beginning with my \ntime in the House and continuing in the Senate. Unfortunately, \ncomprehensive Superfund reforms have yet to garner broad support \nthroughout the Congress and action on recyclers has been held up in the \nprocess. Relief for legitimate recyclers has been the one portion of \nSuperfund reform that has consistently garnered widespread, bi-partisan \nsupport. The recycling industry should no longer be denied their \nlegitimate exemption from Superfund liability because of broader issues \nthat do not relate to them.\n  Mr. President, I am aware of ongoing negotiations concerning a \nsection within this recycling bill that applies to PCBs in paper. I \nwant to again stress that when we began preparing for this bill in \n1993, we formed a coalition of parties that all agreed upon the \nlanguage within the bill. This coalition has remained until this day. \nThese parties are currently working to amend the language of the bill \nto resolve this concern. Upon final agreement, I will welcome an \namendment to this bill to include the resolution language.\n  Mr. President, there are legitimate recyclers across our nation that \nstand to lose their livelihoods if we don't act immediately. Legitimate \nrecyclers that reuse and recycle the scrap leftover from our everyday \nprocesses. Legitimate recyclers that reduce the waste we put in our \nlandfills and produce a useful product. Legitimate recyclers that were \nnot intended by the writers of CERCLA to be burdened with liability for \ntaking scrap metal and other products and processing them into products \nequivalent to virgin material.\n  Mr. President, we have been working toward providing this needed \nliability relief for legitimate recyclers for over 6 years. It is time \nto pass this important legislation now. Doing so will not only relieve \nthis unintended liability but will promote recycling in our country. I \nurge all my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 1530. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nclarify the Act, and for other purposes; to\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               family and medical leave clarification act\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today marks the sixth anniversary \nof the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act. This act, as \nmy colleagues will recall, was intended to be used by families for \ncritical periods such as after the birth or adoption of a child and \nleave to care for a child, spouse, or one's own ``serious medical \ncondition.''\n  Since its passage, the Family and Medical Leave Act has had a \nsignificant impact on employers' leave practices and policies. \nAccording to the Commission on Family and Medical Leave two-thirds of \ncovered work sites have changed some aspect of their policies in order \nto comply with the act.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Labor's implementation of certain \nprovisions of the act has resulted in significant unintended \nadministrative burden and costs on employers; resentment by co-workers \nwhen the act is misapplied; invasions of privacy by requiring employers \nto ask deeply personal questions about employees and family members \nplanning to take FMLA leave; disruptions to the workplace due to \nincreased unscheduled and unplanned absences; unnecessary record \nkeeping; unworkable notice requirements; and conflicts with existing \npolicies.\n  Despite these problems, which have been well documented through three \nseparate congressional hearings, including one I chaired three weeks \nago, there are those in Congress and the administration who choose to \nignore those problems and instead push for imposition of the law on \neven smaller businesses and for purposes well beyond those judged by \nCongress to be the most critical. These proponents of expansion will \nrefer to a report issued by the U.S. Commission on Leave which failed \nto find significant problems associated with the act.\n  However, the fact of the matter is, the Commission on Leave's report \nwas issued well before the final implementing regulations were in \nplace--regulations which are in fact the source of much of the concern \nover the act's implementation.\n  Mr. President, to consider expansion at this time is not just \nirresponsible, it is unconscionable.\n  The Department of Labor's vague and confusing implementing \nregulations have resulted in the FMLA being misapplied, misunderstood \nand mistakenly ignored. Employers aren't sure if situations like pink \neye, ingrown toe nails and even the common cold will be considered by \nthe regulators and the courts to be serious health conditions.\n  Because of these concerns and well documented problems with the act, \nI am today introducing the Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act \nto make reasonable and much needed changes to clarify the Family and \nMedical Leave Act and restore the original congressional intent.\n  The FMLA Clarification Act has the strong support of The Society for \nHuman Resource Management and close to 300 leading companies and \nassociations who make up the Family and Medical Leave Act Technical \nCorrections Coalition. I have received a letter of support from the \nCoalition and ask that it be printed in the Record. This broad based \ncoalition shares my belief that both employers and employees would \nbenefit from making certain technical corrections to the FMLA--\ncorrections that are needed to restore congressional intent and to \nreduce administrative and compliance problems experienced by employers \nwho are making a good faith effort to comply with the act.\n  The bill I am introducing today does several important things:\n  First, it repeals the Department of Labor's current regulations for \n``serious health condition'' and includes language from the Democrats' \nown Committee Report on what types of medical conditions (such as heart \nattacks, strokes, spinal injuries, etc) were intended to be covered.\n  In passing the FMLA, Congress stated that the term ``serious health \ncondition'' is not intended to cover short-term conditions for which \ntreatment and recovery are very brief, recognizing that ``it is \nexpected that such condition will fall within the most modest sick \nleave policies.''\n  The Department of Labor's current regulations are extremely \nexpansive, defining the term ``serious health condition'' as including, \namong other things, any absence of more than 3 days in which the \nemployee sees any health care provider and receives any type of \ncontinuing treatment (including a second doctor's visit, or a \nprescription, or a referral to a physical therapist)--such a broad \ndefinition potentially mandates FMLA leave where an employee sees a \nhealth care provider once, receives a prescription drug, and is \ninstructed to call the health care provider back if the symptoms do not \nimprove; the regulations also define as a ``serious health condition'' \nany absence for a chronic health problem, such as arthritis, asthma, \ndiabetes, etc., even if the employee does not see a doctor for that \nabsence and is absent for less than three days.\n  Second, the bill amends the act's provisions relating to intermittent \nleave to give employers the right to require that intermittent leave be \ntaken in minimum blocks of 4 hours. This would minimize the misuse of \nFMLA by employees who use FMLA as an excuse for regular tardiness and \nroutine justification for early departures.\n  Third, the bill shifts to the employee the responsibility to request \nleave be designated as FMLA leave, and requires the employee to provide \nwritten application within 5 working days of providing notice to the \nemployer for foreseeable leave. With respect to unforeseeable leave, \nthe bill requires the employee to provide, at a minimum, oral \nnotification of the need for the leave not later than the date the \nleave commences unless the employee is physically or mentally incapable \nof providing notice or submitting the application. Under that \ncircumstance the employee is provided such additional time as necessary \nto provide notice.\n  Shifting the burden to the employee to request leave be designated as \nFMLA leave eliminates the need for the employer to question the \nemployee and pry into the employee's and the employee's family's \nprivate matters, as required under current law, and helps eliminate \npersonal liability for employer supervisors who should not be expected \nto be experts in the vague and complex regulations which even attorneys \nhave a difficult time understanding. Under current law, it is the \nemployer's responsibility in all circumstances to designate leave, paid \nor unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying. Failure to do so in a timely manner or \nto inform an employee that a specific event does not qualify as FMLA \nleave may result in that unqualified leave becoming qualified leave \nunder FMLA. This scenario has actually been upheld in Court and has \nplaced an enormous burden on employers to respond within 48 hours of an \nemployee's leave request. In addition, the courts have held that there \nis personal liability for employers under the FMLA and that an \nindividual manager may be sued and held individually liable for acts \ntaken based upon or relating to the FMLA. See Freemon v. Foley, 911 F. \nSupp. 326 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (in case of first impression in 7th Circuit, \ncourt stated, ``We believe the FMLA extends to all those who controlled \n`in whole or in part' [plaintiff's] ability to take leave of absence \nand return to her postion'').\n  Fourth, with respect to leave because of the employee's own serious \nhealth condition, the bill permits an employer to require the employee \nto choose between taking unpaid leave provided by the FMLA or paid \nabsence under an employer's collective bargaining agreement or other \nsick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or policy of the \nemployer. This change provides incentive for employers to continue \ntheir generous sick leave policies while providing a disincentive to \nemployers considering getting rid of such employee-friendly plans, \nincluding those negotiated by the employer and the employee's union \nrepresentative. Paid leave would be subject to the employer's normal \nwork rules and procedures for taking such leave, including work rules \nand procedures dealing with attendance requirements.\n  Despite the common belief that leave under the FMLA is necessarily \nunpaid, employers having generous sick leave policies, or who have \nworked out employee-friendly sick leave programs with unions in \ncollective bargaining agreements, are being penalized by the FMLA. In \nfact, for many companies,\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\nmost FMLA leave has become paid leave. According to the U.S. Commission \non Leave, 66.3 percent of FMLA leave is paid (46.7 percent fully paid). \nThis existing paid leave sandwiched on top of the broad, yet vague, \nFMLA definitions has resulted in employees requesting or characterizing \na variety of minor situations as FMLA leave.\n  Mr. President, the FMLA Clarification Act is a reasonable response to \nthe hundreds of concerns that have been raised about the act. It leaves \nin place the fundamental protections of the law while attempting to \nmake changes necessary to restore FMLA to its original intent and to \nrespond to the very legitimate concerns that have been raised. In the \nspirit of the FMLA I urge my colleagues to mark it's anniversary by \nrestoring the Family and Medical Leave Act to its original \ncongressional intent.\n  I asked that the bill and a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                S. 1530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Substitution of paid leave.\nSec. 7. Regulations.\nSec. 8. Effective date.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Act'') is not working as Congress \n     intended when Congress passed the Act in 1993. Many \n     employers, including those employers that are nationally \n     recognized as having generous family-friendly benefit and \n     leave programs, are experiencing serious problems complying \n     with the Act.\n       (2) The Department of Labor's overly broad regulations and \n     interpretations have caused many of these problems by greatly \n     expanding the Act's coverage to apply to many nonserious \n     health conditions.\n       (3) Documented problems generated by the Act include \n     significant new administrative and personnel costs, loss of \n     productivity and scheduling difficulties, unnecessary \n     paperwork and recordkeeping, and other compliance problems.\n       (4) The Act often conflicts with employers' paid sick leave \n     policies, prevents employers from managing absences through \n     their absence control plans, and results in most leave under \n     the Act becoming paid leave.\n       (5) The Commission on Leave, established in title III of \n     the Act (29 U.S.C. 2631 et seq.), which reported few \n     difficulties with compliance with the Act, failed to identify \n     many of the problems with compliance because the study on \n     which the report was based was conducted too soon after the \n     date of enactment of the Act and the most significant \n     problems with compliance arose only when employers later \n     sought to comply with the Act's final regulations and \n     interpretations.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.\n\n       Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (2) by aligning the margins of those clauses with the \n     margins of clause (i) of paragraph (4)(A);\n       (3) by inserting before ``The'' the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Exclusions.--The term does not include a short-term \n     illness, injury, impairment, or condition for which treatment \n     and recovery are very brief.\n       ``(C) Examples.--The term includes an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition such as a heart \n     attack, a heart condition requiring extensive therapy or a \n     surgical procedure, a stroke, a severe respiratory condition, \n     a spinal injury, appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe \n     arthritis, a severe nervous disorder, an injury caused by a \n     serious accident on or off the job, an ongoing pregnancy, a \n     miscarriage, a complication or illness related to pregnancy, \n     such as severe morning sickness, a need for prenatal care, \n     childbirth, and recovery from childbirth, that involves care \n     or treatment described in subparagraph (A).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(b)(1) (29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1)) is amended by \n     striking the period at the end of the second sentence and \n     inserting the following: ``, as certified under section 103 \n     by the health care provider after each leave occurrence. An \n     employer may require an employee to take intermittent leave \n     in increments of up to \\1/2\\ of a workday. An employer may \n     require an employee who travels as part of the normal day-to-\n     day work or duty assignment of the employee and who requests \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule to take \n     leave for the duration of that work or assignment if the \n     employer cannot reasonably accommodate the employee's \n     request.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(e) (29 U.S.C. 2612(e)) is amended by inserting \n     after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Request for leave.--If an employer does not exercise, \n     under subsection (d)(2), the right to require an employee to \n     substitute other employer-provided leave for leave under this \n     title, the employer may require the employee who wants leave \n     under this title to request the leave in a timely manner. If \n     an employer requires a timely request under this paragraph, \n     an employee who fails to make a timely request may be denied \n     leave under this title.\n       ``(4) Timeliness of request for leave.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (3), a request for leave shall be considered to be \n     timely if--\n       ``(A) in the case of foreseeable leave, the employee--\n       ``(i) provides the applicable advance notice required by \n     paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n       ``(ii) submits any written application required by the \n     employer for the leave not later than 5 working days after \n     providing the notice to the employer; and\n       ``(B) in the case of unforeseeable leave, the employee--\n       ``(i) notifies the employer orally of the need for the \n     leave--\n\n       ``(I) not later than the date the leave commences; or\n       ``(II) during such additional period as may be necessary, \n     if the employee is physically or mentally incapable of \n     providing the notification; and\n\n       ``(ii) submits any written application required by the \n     employer for the leave--\n\n       ``(I) not later than 5 working days after providing the \n     notice to the employer; or\n       ``(II) during such additional period as may be necessary, \n     if the employee is physically or mentally incapable of \n     submitting the application.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(d)(2) (29 U.S.C. 2612(d)(2)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) Paid absence.--Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and \n     (B), with respect to leave provided under subparagraph (D) of \n     subsection (a)(1), where an employer provides a paid absence \n     under the employer's collective bargaining agreement, a \n     welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or under any \n     other sick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or \n     policy of the employer, the employer may require the employee \n     to choose between the paid absence and unpaid leave provided \n     under this title.''.\n\n     SEC. 7. REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Existing Regulations.--\n       (1) Review.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall review \n     all regulations issued before that date to implement the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et \n     seq.), including the regulations published in sections \n     825.114 and 825.115 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (2) Termination.--The regulations, and opinion letters \n     promulgated under the regulations, shall cease to be \n     effective on the effective date of final regulations issued \n     under subsection (b)(2)(B), except as described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (b) Revised Regulations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Labor shall issue revised \n     regulations implementing the Family and Medical Leave Act of \n     1993 that reflect the amendments made by this Act.\n       (2) New regulations.--The Secretary of Labor shall issue--\n       (A) proposed regulations described in paragraph (1) not \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (B) final regulations described in paragraph (1) not later \n     than 180 days after that date of enactment.\n       (3) Effective date.--The final regulations take effect 90 \n     days after the date on which the regulations are issued.\n       (c) Transition.--The regulations described in subsection \n     (a) shall apply to actions taken by an employer prior to the \n     effective date of final regulations issued under subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), with respect to leave under the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act of 1993.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall take effect 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                The FMLA Technical\n\n\n                                        Corrections Coalition,\n\n                                            7505 Inzer Street,\n\n                                  Springfield, VA, August 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Children and Families,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Gregg: On behalf of the nearly 300 members of \n     the Family and Medical Leave Act Technical Corrections \n     Coalition, I am writing to commend you for introducing the \n     Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act and to offer our \n     support. This\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\n     essential legislation would address the well-documented \n     problems with the law's misapplication by restoring the law \n     to reflect the original intent of Congress.\n       The Coalition is a diverse, broad-based, nonpartisan group \n     of nearly 300 leading companies and associations. Members of \n     the Coalition are fully committed to complying with both the \n     spirit and the letter of the FMLA and strongly believe that \n     employers should provide policies and programs to accommodate \n     the individual work-life needs of their employees. At the \n     same time, the Coalition believes that the FMLA should be \n     fixed to protect those employees that Congress aimed to \n     assist while streamlining administrative problems that have \n     arisen. Since the FMLA is not working properly, the Coalition \n     does not support expansions to the Act.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the \n     Subcommittee during your July 14, 1999 hearing. The most \n     disturbing finding of the hearing was the fact that the \n     greatest cost of the FMLA's misapplication is the cost to \n     employees themselves. A strong public record has now been \n     thoroughly established. Numerous witnesses have now \n     documented the unintended consequences of the FMLA's \n     misapplication in three Congressional hearings;\n       1. The May 9, 1996 hearing in the Senate Subcommittee on \n     Children and Families; 2. The June 10, 1997 hearing in the \n     House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee \n     on Education and the Workforce; and 3. Your July 14, 1999 \n     hearing in your Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families.\n       The hearings demonstrated that the FMLA's definition of \n     serious health condition is vague and overly broad due to the \n     Department of Labor's (DOL's) interpretations. Additionally, \n     the hearings documented that the intermittent leave \n     provisions as misapplied by the DOL are complicated and \n     difficult to administer, causing many serious workplace \n     problems.\n       In addition, many companies expressed that Congress should \n     consider allowing employers to permit employees to take \n     either a paid leave package under an existing collective \n     bargaining agreement or the 12 weeks of FMLA protected leave, \n     whichever is greater.\n       It is now time for the Senate to move forward to enact \n     ``The Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act'' on a \n     bipartisan basis. It is our strong hope that the Family and \n     Medical Leave Clarification Act will be fully embraced by all \n     the original authors of the FMLA and advance quickly in the \n     Senate with a bipartisan spirit.\n       Technical corrections do not need to be polarizing, \n     combative or controversial, but they do need to be done as \n     soon as possible, so that the FMLA operates in the manner and \n     in the spirit that Congress intended.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this critical \n     legislation and look forward to working with you to ensure \n     its success. The entire FMLA Technical Corrections Coalition \n     looks forward to working with you toward that end.\n           Respectfully,\n                                            Deanna R. Gelak, SPHR,\n                                       Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 1531. A bill to amend the Act establishing Women's Rights National \nHistorical Park to permit the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \ntitle in fee simple to the Hunt House located in Waterloo, New York; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         legislation authorizing the purchase of the hunt house\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that \nwould authorize the Secretary of the Interior to purchase the Hunt \nHouse in Seneca Falls, New York. This summer the owners of the Hunt \nHouse put it on the market for $139,000. Of four historic buildings in \nSeneca Falls that should be part of the Women's Rights National \nHistorical Park, the Hunt House is the only one that is not. It was the \nsite of the gathering of five women (the founding mothers, you might \nsay) who decided to hold the nation's first women's rights convention. \nThat convention took place in Seneca Falls in July, 1848. The Women's \nRights Park is a monument to the idea they espoused that summer, that \nwomen should have equal right with men; one of the most influential \nideas of the last 150 years.\n  Adding the Hunt House to the Park would complete it. The problem is \nthat the Department was not given the authorization to purchase the \nHunt House in the bill I offered 20 years ago so that speculation would \nnot drive up the price of the house when it eventually went on the \nmarket. That worked. But now the lack of an authorization should not \nkeep us from being able to acquire the house at all. This bill simply \nremoves the restriction against a fee simple purchase by the Park \nService. I hope my colleagues will offer their support, and I ask that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1531\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACQUISITION OF HUNT HOUSE.\n\n       Section 1601(d) of Public Law 97-607 (94 Stat. 3547; 16 \n     U.S.C. 410ll(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by inserting after ``park,'' the \n     following: ``including the Hunt House designated under \n     subsection (c)(8),''; and\n       (2) in the last sentence, by striking ``McClintock'' and \n     inserting ``Hunt''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Moynihan):\n  S. 1532. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to restrict \nthe sale or other transfer of armor piercing ammunition and components \nof armor piercing ammunition disposed of by the Army; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n\n\n    Military Armor Piercing Ammunition Resale Limitation Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.  President, under the Conventional Demilitarization \nProgram, the Department of Defense sells .50 caliber ammunition that \nhas been on the shelf too long and could misfire or is otherwise \nunserviceable to a private company. That company refurbishes some of \nthat ammunition and sells it to civilian buyers.\n  Our colleagues in the House, Representatives Rod Blagojevich and \nHenry Waxman, asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the \navailability of armor-piercing .50 caliber ammunition in the United \nStates. GAO investigators found that ``U.S.-made armor piercing fifty \ncaliber ammunition is readily available in the United States and that \nthis widespread availability is directly attributable to the little-\nknown Conventional Demilitarization Program within the Department of \nDefense.''\n  I want to be sure that my colleagues know what .50 caliber rifles and \nammunition can do. They can rip through bullet-proof glass, armor-\nplated limousines, tanks, helicopters, or aircraft from more than a \nmile away with deadly accuracy. They can hit targets from four miles \naway. Their shells can pierce five or six walls with no problem. That \nis just what the armor-piercing variety can do. The armor-piercing \nincendiary .50 caliber ammunition can do everything I just mentioned, \nbut then can also start a fire or explode on impact. So if the sniper \nmissed the person inside the limousine or tank or airplane with an \narmor piercing shell, he could instead shoot an incendiary shell and \ncause the target to catch fire or blow up.\n  Nobody goes deer hunting with a .50 caliber rifle. No one shoots a \nbear with .50 caliber rifle. There would be little left of the \nhapless animal, although I suppose fragments of it could come already \nbarbecued if a .50 caliber incendiary shell were used.\n\n  What is this weapon good for? It is an appropriate and necessary \nweapon for the United States Armed Forces and has some important law \nenforcement uses. Its usefulness was demonstrated time and again in the \nGulf War to shoot Iraqi tanks, armored vehicles, and bunkers. It is \nterrific for blowing up land mines and other small unexploded ordnance. \nThe tracer variety is important for military targeting at night.\n  Otherwise, it is extremely useful for assassins, terrorists, drug \ncartels, and doomsday cults. Since 1992, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms has initiated 28 gun traces involving .50 caliber \nsemiautomatic rifles. Many of these traces led to terrorists, outlaw \nmotorcycle gangs, international and domestic drug traffickers, and \nviolent criminals.\n  The General Accounting Office conducted an undercover investigation \nthat revealed that ammunition dealers use an ``ask no questions'' \napproach to the purchase of .50 caliber ammunition. Even after \nundercover GAO investigators made clear to ammunition dealers that they \nwanted to be sure the ammunition could pierce an armor-plated limousine \nor could shoot down a helicopter, the dealers were perfectly willing to \nsell it.\n  In fact, there are fewer restrictions on the sale of .50 caliber \nweapons than on handguns. Yet a leading manufacturer of new .50 caliber \nammunition, Arizona Ammunition, Inc., says it does not sell .50 caliber \narmor piercing, incendiary, and tracer ammunition to the general public \n``because they have no sporting application.'' That leaves\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\nthe U.S. Department of Defense demilitarization contract as the source \nof U.S.-made .50 caliber ammunition for the civilian market.\n  Today I have introduced a bill that would require DoD contractors for \nthe disposal of .50 caliber surplus military ammunition to agree not to \nsell the refurbished ammunition to civilians. The Defense Department \nmust include in its contract a provision that refurbished .50 caliber \nmay not be sold to non-military or law enforcement organizations or \npersonnel. The Defense Department should no longer be the indirect \nsource of ammunition that could be used for assassination, terrorism, \nor drug trafficking.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1532\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Armor Piercing \n     Ammunition Resale Limitation Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                  COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator McCain, Chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, is a cosponsor of this legislation. This bill \nreauthorizes the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) through Fiscal Year \n2004. This legislation will improve the qualify of life for those \nAmericans fortunate enough to live in coastal communities and the \nmillions of others who visit these regions each year. First and \nforemost, the bill recognizes the many benefits of economic \ndevelopment, and balances those needs with the protection of our \nvaluable public resources.\n  The United States has more than 95,000 miles of coastline along the \nAtlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, and the Great \nLakes. Nearly 53 percent of all Americans live in these coastal \nregions, but that accounts for only 11 percent of the country's total \nland area. This small portion of our country supports approximately 200 \nsea ports, contains most of our largest cities, and serves as critical \nhabitat for a variety of plants and animals.\n  To help meet the growing challenges facing these coastal areas, \nCongress enacted the CZMA in 1972. The CZMA provides incentives to \nstates to develop comprehensive programs that balance the many \ncompeting uses of coastal resources and to meeting the needs for the \nfuture growth of coastal communities.\n  As a voluntary program, the framework of the CZMA provides guidelines \nfor state plans to address multiple environmental, societal, cultural, \nand economic objectives. This allows the states the flexibility \nnecessary to prioritize management issues and utilize existing state \nregulatory programs and statutes wherever possible. Obviously, each \nstate's priorities and needs are unique. That is why this bill provides \nmaximum flexibility to states to address the diverse problems affecting \nour coastal areas.\n  The coastal zones managed under the CZMA range from the arctic to \ntropical islands, from sandy to rocky shorelines, and from urban to \nrural areas. Because of these varying habitats and resource types, no \ntwo state plan and the same, nor should they be.\n  Likewise, there are multiple uses of the coastal zone. Coastal \nmanagers are asked to strike a balance among residential, commercial, \nrecreational, and industrial development; harbor development and \nmaintenance; shoreline erosion and commercial and recreational fishing. \nCoastal programs address these competing needs for resources, steer \nactivities to appropriate areas of the coast, and attempt to minimize \nthe effects of these activities on coastal resources. As you may \nimagine, being able to balance economic development while protecting \npublic resources requires careful strategies, substantial financial \nresources, and cooperation among stakeholders.\n  So far, 32 of the 35 eligible coastal states and U.S. territories \nhave federally approved coastal zone management plans under the CZMA. \nTwo of the remaining eligible states are currently completing their \nplans. I am proud to say that my state of Maine has had a federally \napproved plan since 1978. The approved plans cover 99% of the eligible \nU.S. coastline.\n  Another component of the CZMA is the National Estuarine Research \nReserve System. These reserves not only provide habitat for a wide \nvariety of fish, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, but they also serve \nas natural laboratories for research and education. There are currently \n22 of these reserves in 18 states.\n  Mr. President, this bill authorizes $100 million to carry out the \nobjectives of the CZMA for fiscal year 2000. The authorization level \nincreases by $5 million each year to $120 million in FY 2004. Of the \nannual $5 million increase, $3.5 million would be targeted for the base \nstate-grant programs; $1 million would be authorized for coastal zone \nenhancement and coastal community grant programs; and $500,000 would be \nauthorized for the national Estuarine Research Reserve System. This \nbill will enable the states to build upon the successes of their \nmanagement plans an confront emerging problems along our coasts. \nFurther, this bill allows each state to maintain the flexibility it \nrequires in order to address the specific needs of its coastal \ncommunities.\n  Because flexibility at the state level is a critical element of this \nbill, titled the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1999 allows states to \nestablish partnerships with local communities to encourage wise and \nsustainable development of their public resources. As the United \nStates' population continues to increase in coastal communities, it is \nimperative that we provide those communities with the capability to \nplan for growth. This will enable coastal communities to address open \nspace needs, environmental protection, and infrastrasture needs.\n  Finally, let me say that the foundation of this legislation is the \nexisting federal/state partnership that has made the CZMA so effective. \nThe federal funds to implement CZMA management plans are matched by \nstate matching monies. Some states have capitalized on the \nopportunities presented by the CZMA by leveraging even more money than \nthe required match. In my state, the State of Maine, for example, the \nimportance of investing in coastal areas has been clearly recognized \nand the CZMA federal funds have been matched at a rate of seven state \ndollars per federal dollar. Given examples like this, the potential for \nthis reauthorization could produce several hundred million dollars for \ncoastal zone management programs.\n  I believe the legislation that I am introducing today will provide \nstates with the necessary funding and framework to meet the challenges \nfacing our coastal communities in the 21st Century.\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is a solid, reasonable and realistic bill that \nenjoys bipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. I look forward to \nmoving this bill at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section explanation of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Section 1 provides the title of the Bill: \n     Coastal Zone Management Act of 1999.\n       Section 2. Section 2 specifies that amendments and repeals \n     shall be applied to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) (CZMA).\n       Section 3. Section 3 amends the CZMA congressional findings \n     to update emerging issues and to reflect the need for Federal \n     and state support of local community-based comprehensive \n     planning and solutions to local problems.\n       Section 4. Section 4 amends the congressional declarations \n     of policy to support the National Estuarine Research Reserve \n     System (NERRS) and to encourage the use of innovative \n     technologies in the coastal zone.\n       Section 5. Section 5 amends the CZMA definitions to clarify \n     the terms ``estuarine reserve'' and ``coastal nonpoint \n     pollution control plan'' and to clarify that ``coastal \n     state'' no longer includes the trust territories of the \n     Pacific Island, i.e. the now independent nation of Palau.\n       Section 6. Section 6 amends section 305(a) of the CZMA to \n     ensure that resources are available to the remaining states \n     without approved coastal management programs to complete such \n     program development.\n       Section 7. Section 7 amends section 306 to reauthorize the \n     base administrative grant program and clarifies which \n     programs are eligible for grants under this section.\n       Section 8. Section 8 amends section 306A, the coastal \n     resource improvement grants, by defining the term ``qualified \n     local entity.'' Section 8 broadens the objectives to which \n     that Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) may allocate funds and \n     provides states with the option of allocating funds for \n     restoration and preservation of coastal habitats as well as \n     the continued implementation of the states' coastal nonpoint \n     plans.\n       Section 9. Section 9 amends section 308, the coastal zone \n     management fund, by moving CZMA program administration to \n     section 318, transfer load repayments to the Operations, \n     Research and Facilities account, and deletes the annual \n     reporting requirement.\n       Section 10. Section 10 amends section 309, the coastal zone \n     enhancement grants, by adding two new objectives to which the \n     Secretary may allocate funds and provides states with the \n     option of allocating funds for restoration and preservation \n     of coastal habitats as well as the continued implementation \n     of the states' coastal nonpoint plans. Section 10 also amends \n     section 309(d) by removing outdated sections and amends \n     section 309(f) to remove the $10,000,000 cap on annual \n     section 309 allocations to conform with increasing \n     authorization levels.\n       Section 11. The Coastal Community Program creates a new \n     grant option section 309A) for states that want to focus on \n     coastal community-based initiatives. This section \n     demonstrates the need for Federal and state support of \n     community-based planning, strategies, and solutions to local \n     sprawl and development issues in the coastal zone. This \n     section allows the Secretary to make grants to states through \n     the base program allocation formula and requires that the \n     states match the amount of the grant so that section 306, \n     306A and this section, in aggregate, equal a 1:1 match. It \n     will also revitalize previously developed areas, promote \n     conservation projects in environmentally sensitive areas, \n     emphasize water dependent uses, and protect coastal habitats.\n       Section 12. Section 12 amends section 310, technical \n     assistance, to allow the Secretary to conduct a cooperative \n     program to apply innovative technologies to the coastal zone.\n       Section 13. Section 13 amends section 312(a), performance \n     review, by adding coordination with the national estuarine \n     research reserves to the review of performance process.\n       Section 14. Section 14 amends section 314 of the CZMA to \n     allow the Secretary the discretion to issue the Walter B. \n     Jones Awards if funds are available.\n       Section 15. Section 15 amends section 315 of the CZMA to \n     clarify and strengthen the National Estuarine Research \n     Reserve System. A majority of the amendments are technical \n     changes to include training, education and stewardship \n     concepts. This section clarifies the NERRS description and \n     allows the Secretary to enter into contracts and agreements \n     with non-profit organizations to carry out projects that \n     support reserves and to accept donations of funds or services \n     for projects consistent with the purposes of section 315.\n       Section 16. Section 16 amends section 316 of the CZMA to \n     clarify the requirements for the reports to Congress and to \n     provide to Congress a report on federal agency coordination \n     and cooperation in coastal management.\n       Section 17. Section 17 amends section 318, authorization of \n     appropriations, to authorize CZMA funding, providing a \n     separate line items for 306 and 306A, 309 and 309A, 315, a \n     NERRS construction fund, and administrative costs.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nNational Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 1999. I want to thank \nSenator Snowe for sponsoring this legislation. This bill will help \nguide the use of the our marine environment into the next century. \nAgain, I wish to thank Senator Snowe for her leadership in this area.\n  The 12 existing national marine sanctuaries protect our marine \nresources while facilitating ``compatible'' public and private uses of \nthe ocean. The National Marine Sanctuaries Program reflects a \nresponsible balance between conservation and multiple uses, such as \ncommercial fishing and recreational activities. In addition, the \nnational sanctuaries provide for important research, outreach, and \neducational activities involving unique marine assets.\n  To date, the sanctuary program has been unable to reach its full \npotential due to a lack of funding. This bill will make existing \nsanctuaries fully operational for the first time in the history of the \nprogram. The bill we are introducing today authorizes $30 million in FY \n2000 and incrementally increases the annual authorization by $2 million \na year to $38 million in FY 2004. The bill will also allow for the \ncompletion of basic tasks which have been neglected in the past at \nsanctuaries, such as a review of each sanctuary management plan and \nhabitat characterizations. The research and educational opportunities \nprovided by this legislation are quite promising and will allow our \nchildren and future generations to learn to value our ocean resources.\n\n[[Page S10441]]\n\n  The bill also provides for the implementation of meaningful \nenforcement plans and allows sanctuaries to partner with states or \nother entities to enhance enforcement efforts. Furthermore, \ninterference with an enforcement agent could result in a criminal \npenalty.\n  Mr. President, this is a strong bill that enjoys bipartisan support \non the Commerce Committee. With this legislation, Senator Snowe and I \nenvision a reasonable balance between conservation and the compatible \nmultiple uses of our ocean resources in marine sanctuaries. I look \nforward to moving this bill in the near future and request the support \nof my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             By Mr. GRAMS:\n\n  S. 1535. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under part B of \nthe Medicare program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n          medicare ensuring prescription drugs for seniors act\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation I've drafted to provide a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  While I firmly believe we must deal directly with the structural \nproblems facing the Medicare program, I also understand the very real \nneed to provide prescription drug coverage now.\n  Mr. President, Americans might be surprised to learn there are \nestimates that about half the people who have ever--ever--reached age \n65 are alive today. It's a revealing statistic--one we should be proud \nof because America has had much to do with the success in lengthening \nthe life expectancy of nearly everyone in the world. Whether it's \nthrough government-funded research at the National Institutes of Health \nor private research funded through foundations, it has all contributed \nto this success.\n  In 1900, the average American could expect to see their 47th \nbirthday. Today, Americans can expect to celebrate 29 more birthdays--\nliving to the age of 76. Clearly, this increased life expectancy can be \nattributed to many things, but the advances made in pharmaceuticals is, \nperhaps, the most significant contributor.\n  When the Medicare program was being discussed by Congress in the \n1960s, no one could foresee the enormous change our health care system \nwould experience over the course of thirty years. Of course, we \ncouldn't have expected them to know how different things would be \ntoday.\n  In the 1960s, health care was predominately hospital or clinic \noriented and as a result, Medicare focused on hospital stays. Indeed, \neven months before the final Medicare package was passed there was \ndebate over whether physician visits should be included in the program. \nNow, we find ourselves with a program going broke, but in need of \nreform--a program largely successful for the past 30 years, but \nwoefully inadequate in meeting the needs of today's seniors.\n  Mr. President, one of the first witnesses before the Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare, Robert Reischauer, described \nMedicare's problems as the four ``i's:'' insolvency, inadequacy, \ninefficiency and inequity. I couldn't agree more.\n  As I alluded to earlier, perhaps the best example of the inadequacy \nof the current Medicare program is the lack of a prescription drug \nbenefit. While I continue to believe the best way for us to include a \nprescription drug benefit in Medicare is through overall reform, I also \nbelieve it is important for us to explore different ways we can meet \nthe challenge of adding the benefit without undermining the entire \nprogram.\n  In putting together my plan for providing a prescription benefit, I \ntried to keep in mind the root of our dilemma. Many make the mistake of \nthinking access to needed pharmaceuticals is the problem. It's not--\naffording the increasing number and cost of prescriptions is the real \nproblem facing seniors today.\n  Mr. President, my plan, the ``MEDS Act of 1999,'' would work like \nthis:\n  Single seniors with incomes of $927 per month or less, will be \neligible to receive their prescription drugs with a 25 percent co-\npayment and no deductible. Married seniors with incomes of $1,244 per \nmonth or less will be eligible for the same co-payment of 25 percent \nwith no deductible.\n  The income figures are the equivalent of 135 percent of the federal \npoverty level.\n  Seniors above the income limits will be protected through a monthly \ndeductible of $150. For amounts over those deductibles, Medicare will \npay 75 percent of the prescription cost.\n\n  Mr. President, rather than using a yearly deductible, which, in the \nfirst months, forces many seniors to use more of their monthly income \non prescription drugs than they can often afford, my plan uses a \nmonthly deductible allowing seniors to budget their drug costs every \nmonth.\n  In addition, it ensures that if a senior, such a your parent or \ngrandparent, is seriously ill in one month, Medicare will cover 75 \npercent of their drug costs with no caps on the benefit. Meaning, they \nget the help they need when they need it.\n  While I understand there will be concerns about how we determine when \na beneficiary has reached their $150 deductible, particularly on a \nmonthly basis, I contend that we have the knowledge and technology \nnecessary to structure the program nearly any way we wish--we simply \nhave to use it.\n  Mr. President, America's seniors understand that if their drug costs \nare $50 a month, it doesn't make sense for them to buy a drug insurance \npolicy for $100 a month. In this case, prescription drug coverage is \nnot the issue. The issue is, can the senior trying to get by an $600 a \nmonth afford the $50 or $75 a month to pay for their medications? And, \nin the event of a major illness, can a senior bear the entire cost of \ntreatment during that particular month?\n  My plan would make sure that person gets relief when the costs become \ntoo much to handle. It is truly a safety net for seniors and especially \nfor those who would not otherwise be able to reap the benefits of \nmodern medicine.\n  I believe this is a responsible, credible plan for America's seniors. \nI hope it will serve as a starting point for an honest, rational and \nresponsible discussion about who needs help and how much.\n  While I applaud the President for putting forward a plan, I believe \nit falls short in one important way--it doesn't help those who need it \nmost.\n  President Clinton's plan requires all seniors to pay $288 in monthly \npremiums and a co-payment of 50 percent up to $2,000. Under the \nPresident's plan, the most benefit any senior could get is $712 and, by \ncapping the benefit at $2,000, it abandons seniors when they need help \nmost.\n  The debate over prescription drug coverage and overall Medicare \nreform may be political for some, but I know seniors in Minnesota who \nhave difficulty paying for their prescriptions don't think much of \npolitical games played by politicians in Washington. They won't care \nwho takes credit for this or that. They just want to know they won't go \nbroke or hungry to pay for the medicines they need to stay alive. The \nplan I introduce today, the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs for \nSeniors (MEDS) Act, will help ensure that they won't.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1536. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend \nauthorizations of appropriations for programs under the Act, to \nmodernize programs and services for older individuals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    The Older Americans Act of 1999\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce The \nOlder Americans Act of 1999--a bill that will reauthorize some of the \nmost important, vital, and successful programs the Federal government \nprovides to senior citizens.\n  The Older Americans Act created and is responsible for:\n  Programs that provide nutrition both at home and at senior community \ncenters;\n  Programs that protect the elderly from abuse, neglect, and unhealthy \nnursing homes;\n  Programs that offer valuable jobs to seniors;\n  Programs that furnish transportation; and\n  Programs that render in-home services such as assistance with house-\nhold tasks.\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\n  As we approach the new millennium, these services and many others \nbecome more and more important--in fact, essential--to the continued \nwell-being and prosperity of our nation's senior community. We are an \naging nation. Today, 12.7% of the United States' population is over the \nage of 65. By the year 2030, that number will grow to 20%, and there is \nno indication that this trend will subside. Americans are living \nlonger; many of them are healthier, wealthier, and better educated than \nAmericans from two generations or even one generation ago.\n  The Older Americans Act is a key component in ensuring not only \nvaluable supportive services to lower-income older Americans, but also \nin establishing new and reliable services from which every older \nAmerican can benefit.\n  First, I want to focus on the services this reauthorization \nguarantees will continue--and for which, we hope, it will secure \nadditional funding. The largest, and one of the most important, \nportions of the Older Americans Act has always been nutrition \nprogramming. There are two essential and equally important parts of the \nAct's nutrition programming: meals served in senior citizens centers, \nand meals delivered to individuals' homes.\n  Providing meals in congregate settings allows people to eat with \nfriends, take advantage of other social or informative opportunities, \nand be assured of a healthy diet.\n  Home delivered meal programs give homebound individuals similar \nassurances of a healthy diet. Additionally, programs such as Meal-On-\nWheels also often give homebound seniors their only contact with the \ncommunity. Those who deliver meals will also often help with minor \nchores and make sure that the senior they are visiting is in good \ngeneral health.\n  Under this reauthorization, congregate meal funding is protected by \nmaintaining the law's language allowing a State to transfer no more \nthan 30% of its congregate meal funding to home-delivered programs. \nLikewise, States will receive increased flexibility, through a waiver \nprocess, to request that any necessary amount be moved from congregate \nmeal funds to meet the growing needs of homebound seniors.\n  Another established service that would be improved by this bill is \nadvocacy and protection. After a hearing that the Subcommittee on Aging \ndedicated to the issue of elder abuse, we made sure to include \nprotection for elders not only from physical abuse and neglect, but \nalso from financial abuse and exploitation. We also tied State and \nlocal advocacy and protection services directly to State and local law \nenforcement agencies as well as to the court system.\n  During another of the Subcommittee on Aging's several hearings, we \ndiscussed the Senior Community Employment Service Program--the only \nFederally funded jobs program geared specifically for older Americans. \nThe bill makes sure that the initial focus of the program, to provide \nseniors opportunities in community service jobs, stays intact. However, \nin light of the changing demographics among many senior communities and \nmore and more seniors staying very active and capable for longer \nperiods of time, the bill creates another focus: employment in the \nprivate sector and in a wider array of jobs.\n  To do this, the bill creates strong links between the recently passed \nWorkforce Investment Act and the Senior Community Employment Service \nProgram. This will allow qualified seniors easy access to their State's \nworkforce investment system and enhance their opportunity to choose \nwhich jobs they want. Likewise, these links will provide seniors in the \nState workforce investment systems easy access to the Senior Community \nEmployment Service Program.\n\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, in addition to highlighting and \nimproving the essential services that the Older Americans Act has \nprovided so well for so long, this reauthorization also establishes new \nand equally reliable services from which every older American will be \nable to benefit.\n  I thank Senator Grassley, and the Senate's Special Committee on \nAging, for all his work, hearings, research, and help in developing two \nsuch services. The first is the National Family Caregiver Support Act, \nand the second is the Older Americans Act's new Pension Counseling \nprogram.\n  The National Family Caregiver Support Act, through a network of Area \nAgencies on Aging and service providers, will provide family members--\nnonprofessional or informal caregivers--valuable information and \nassistance about how to begin and continue caring for an aging \nrelative. During another of our Subcommittee hearings, we heard moving \ntestimony from a woman who decided that instead of placing her mother \nin a costly nursing home that would provide questionable care, she \nwould bring her mother home and give her the care and attention she \nbelieved her mother needed and deserved.\n  She did this at no small cost to herself. She had to discontinue her \ndoctorate program. She had to find a job that had more accommodating \nhours and unfortunately with lower pay. She found that the State agency \non aging and other bureaucratic ``assistance'' were more trouble than \nthey were worth.\n  She needed advice about lifting her mother, feeding her mother, \nmedications, and many other challenges. Most of all, however, she said \nshe just needed a break. The critical part of the National Family \nCaregiver Support Act would give her that break in the form of respite \ncare; someone to take over for her for a weekend, a day, even a few \nhours so she could shop for herself, complete some overtime work, or \njust rest.\n  The Caregiver Support Act also introduces an inter-generational \nelement. During the Subcommittee's field hearing in Cleveland, we heard \nfrom grandmothers who, for any number of reasons, were now caring for \ntheir grandchildren. In some cases, their own children were addicted to \ndrugs or in prison. Rather than relinquish their grandchildren to \nfoster care, they took on the responsibilities of raising them. These \nwomen, and many other older Americans who now are raising children for \nthe second time around, also need help. They need guidance, \ninformation, and respite care. Our bill would do that.\n  Another new initiative is the Pension Counseling program. This \nprogram would provide desperately needed assistance to retirees who are \nin jeopardy of losing their pensions or are having difficulty receiving \ntheir pensions payments. As more and more individuals retire with more \ncomplicated pension, cost sharing, and IRA retirement plans, this will \nbecome an invaluable service.\n  Mr. President, the Older Americans Act of 1999 will accomplish some \nlong overdue changes. Reauthorizing this Act is a key step toward \npreparing this nation for the aging boom of the next few decades. \nHowever, I want to emphasize that as promising as this legislation is--\nand as encouraged as I am by its introduction--it is still a work in \nprogress. There are outstanding issues that need further attention and \nthat require additional compromise. I look forward to working with all \nof my colleagues to resolve these issues throughout the August recess.\n  I would like to thank Senator Milkulski, the Subcommittee's ranking \nmember, for all her work, expertise, and assistance in developing this \nbill. I would also like to thank Senator Gregg for establishing the \nground work as the Subcommittee's previous Chairman and for his \nexpertise and input. Thank you also to Senators Hutchinson, Jeffords, \nMcCain, Kennedy, and Wyden for all they and their staffs have \ncontributed to the bill.\n  I look forward to continuing our work on this bill, to quickly \nresolving any outstanding concerns, and moving on to final passage of a \nnew and long awaited Older Americans Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n\n  S. 1537. A bill to reauthorize and amend the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Superfund \nAmendments and Reauthorization Act of 1999. This bill is based on S. \n1090, the Superfund Program Completion Act of\n\n[[Page S10443]]\n\n1999, a bill that I introduced, along with Senators Smith and Lott, \nearlier this year.\n  Last year, the Committee reported a comprehensive Superfund bill to \nthe Senate. However, gaining a consensus on a comprehensive bill was \nnot possible last year, and the bill was not called up. The most \ncontroversial issues were cleanup standards, paying ``polluters,'' and \nnatural resource damages.\n  In S. 1090, we narrowed the scope of the bill greatly to get relief \nnow for many parties--small businesses, local governments, municipal \nsolid waste contributors--and we did it fairly, while strengthening the \nrole of the states.\n  Our goal was always to report a bill that enjoyed wide support. \nUnfortunately, Senator Smith and I were not able to move S. 1090 out of \nthe committee. We spent several months negotiating with members on both \nsides of the aisle. The bill that Senator Smith and I introduce today \nserves as a record of our progress in trying to craft a broadly-\nsupported Superfund reform bill.\n  The bill contains numerous changes from S. 1090. Some changes were \nmade prior to the markup. Others are based on amendments filed for the \nmarkup, and others in response to negotiations over the last week.\n  Our bills retains the key features of S. 1090. The Brownfields title \nwill provide $100 million in grants for state, tribal and local \ngovernments to identify, assess and redevelop Brownfields sites. It \nprotects prospective purchasers of contaminated sites, innocent owners \nof properties adjacent to the source of contamination, and innocent \nproperty owners who exercised due diligence upon purchase.\n  The bill exempts recyclers, small businesses, contributors of very \nsmall amounts of hazardous waste, and contributors of small amounts of \nmunicipal solid waste. The bill limits the liability of larger \ngenerators or transporters of municipal solid waste. The bill limits \nthe liability of larger generators or transporters of municipal solid \nwaste, as well as owners or operators of co-disposal landfills where \nmunicipal solid waste is disposed. The bill limits the liability of so-\ncalled de minimis parties--generally one percent contributors or less--\nas well as municipalities and small businesses with a limited ability \nto pay.\n  Importantly, this liability relief is provided fairly. EPA is \ndirected to pay for the shares of exempted parties from a $200 million \nannual orphan share instead of merely shifting the liability onto the \nremaining nonexempt parties. Importantly, responsible parties still \nmust proceed with the cleanup if $200 million is insufficient to cover \nall orphan shares in a given year.\n  The bill also requires EPA to perform an impartial fair-share \nallocation at Superfund NPL sites and to give all parties an \nopportunity to settle for their allocated amount. Allocation is \npreceded by a period for EPA-directed alternative dispute resolution. \nParties that do not participate or settle remain liable to Superfund's \nunderlying liability provisions, which remain unchanged.\n  The bill starts the process of bringing the National Priority List \ncleanup program to an orderly end. EPA notes that cleanup is complete \nor underway at more than 90 percent of the sites on the current NPL. \nEPA is cleaning up the sites at a rate of 85 per year, but it has \nlisted only an average of about 26 sites per year. Last year, the \nGeneral Accounting Office surveyed the states and EPA about the \napproximately 3,000 sites identified as possible National Priority List \nsites, but not yet listed. Only 232 of these sites were identified by \neither EPA, a state, or both, as likely to be listed on the NPL. The \nSuperfund NPL cleanup program is closer to the end of its mission than \nto the beginning. The authorized funding levels in the bill, which \ndecrease during the five-year authorization period, are consistent with \nthe expected decrease in Superfund's workload.\n  The ramp-down of the NPL cleanup program has important implications \nfor state cleanup programs. The bill provides $100 million per year for \nstate cleanup programs. Therefore, the bill requires EPA to plan how it \nwill proceed at the 3,000 sites still awaiting a decision regarding NPL \nlisting. Further, under our bill, new listings on the National Priority \nList must be approved by the Governor of the affected state.\n\n  What is most important, the bill provides finality at sites cleaned \nup in state cleanup programs unless a state asks for help, fails to \ntake action, or a true emergency is present. We know that the vast \nmajority of sites not already listed on the NPL will be cleaned up by \nthe states, not EPA. A strong finality provision will give greater \nconfidence to prospective developers that state cleanup decisions will \nnot be second-guessed by EPA. I would note that the bill includes new \nsafeguards, not present in S.1090 as-introduced, to ensure a robust \nfederal safety net if a state fails to meet its obligations.\n  How does this bill differ from S. 1090? In preparation for the \nmarkup, members filed several amendments that Senator Smith and I plan \nto accept. Senator Bond filed several amendments to improve the \nbrownfields provisions and protect law enforcement activities from \nSuperfund liability. Senator Thomas filed an amendment to clarify the \nliability of common carriers and railroad spur track owners. Senator \nInhofe filed an amendment to encourage the recycling of used oil, and \nanother to improve the state cleanup program provisions. Senator Smith \nand I filed an amendment to study the costs of the Superfund program \nover the next ten years. All of these amendments are included in the \nnew bill.\n  Senator Smith and I have also included an amendment that we filed \ncontaining narrow provisions in two areas not originally addressed in \nS.1090: natural resource damages, and remedy. We offered the language \nin our negotiations in order to try to accommodate the concerns of \nRepublicans members who felt that the scope of the bill was too narrow. \nWe felt these provisions would solve most of the concerns that were \nraised without completely reopening the debates on NRD and remedy.\n  The new remedy provisions would accomplish three things. First, it \nmakes improvements to the system of identifying and applying the \napplicable relevant and appropriate requirements of other federal and \nstate laws in Superfund cleanups. Second, the existing statutory \npreference for permanent remedies that use treatment is replaced by a \npreference limited to so-called ``hot spots.'' This comports with EPA's \ncurrent practice, where 70% of all cleanup plans include containment \ninstead of removal of the hazardous substance. Finally, new provisions \nestablish procedures for the use of facility-specific risk assessments \nand the use of science in decision-making. This provision was closely \nmodeled on the recent Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment.\n  The new natural resource damages provision makes four significant \nchanges to the NRD program.\n  First, it provides a clear statement as to what costs a responsible \nparty will be required to bear under a natural resource damage claim. A \nresponsible party will be liable for only for the reasonable costs of \nrestoring the resource--that is for reinstating the human uses and \nenvironmental functions of the resource.\n  Second, it would eliminate recovery for any damages based on the \nnonuse values associated with an injured resource. Proponents of nonuse \ndamages have argued that these damages are an important element of \nrecovery in cases where a resource like the Grand Canyon is injured or \ndestroyed. Our provision addresses this issue more directly. Instead, \nit recognizes that certain resources, such as endangered species, or \nwilderness areas, or certain national monuments are truly unique and \ntherefore warrant special consideration. The language provides that \nwhere a unique resource has been damaged and is irreplaceable, the \ntrustees may seek enhanced or expedited restoration.\n  Third, it set parameters for determining whether the costs associated \nwith a restoration measure are reasonable. Under this bill, the \nreasonableness of the costs will be determined based on four factors: \ntechnical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, the time period in which \nrecovery will be achieved; and whether the response action or natural \nrecovery will reinstate the uses of a resource in a reasonable period \nof time. This provision is not intended to require a cost-benefit \nanalysis. However, it is intended to require that trustees select cost-\neffective restoration measures.\n\n[[Page S10444]]\n\n  Fourth, it clarifies the prohibition against double recovery. It \nwould protect responsible parties against claims under section 107(f) \nif damages have already been recovered for the same injury to the same \nresource under CERCLA, State or Tribal law.\n  It is clear that we have moved a long way to try to reach an \naccommodation on both the right and the left. Perhaps this new bill can \nserve as the rallying-point if prospects for Superfund improve later in \nthe Congress. In closing, I want to thank Senator Smith for his efforts \non Superfund over the years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nin introducing the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1999 \n(SARA). This bill is the result of several months of negotiations in \nthe Committee, and reflects input we received from Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, state and local officials, the Administration, \nenvironmental groups, and the regulated community.\n  My colleagues who are familiar with our original bill, S. 1090, will \nnotice several changes made in this new legislation.\n  Perhaps most significantly, we have added new titles on remedy \nselection and natural resource damages. These new provisions are \nsimilar to those contained in S. 8, the Superfund Cleanup Acceleration \nAct in the 105th Congress. Some may remember that the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee reported S. 8 in May of 1998, but we never were \nable to debate the bill on the Senate floor.\n  Our remedy selection provisions are fairly straightforward. We would \ncodify EPA's policy on the preference for treatment of principal \nthreats, with an exception for sites, such as mining sites, at which \nsuch a preference would be inappropriate. We require remedies to \nachieve a degree of cleanup that complies with applicable Federal and \nState standards. We also set forth requirements for site specific risk \nassessments.\n  On natural resource damages (NRD), we deal with the major issues that \nhave been debated over the last 10 years or more. SARA's NRD \nprovisions:\n  Provide a clear definition of the objective of restoration; require \ncosts assessed against responsible parties to be reasonable, based on \nthe restoration measure's technical feasibility, cost effectiveness, \ntimeliness, and consideration of natural recovery as a restoration \nalternative; prohibit recoveries for so-called ``nonuser'' damages and \nappropriately limit lost use damages; provide for the expedited or \nenhanced restoration of substitute resources where a unique resource \nthat cannot be replaced has been destroyed, lost or damaged; provide \nresponsible parties with the right to de novo review--or a full trial \non all aspects of the claims against them; and, preclude double \nrecovery against responsible parties.\n  In addition to these new titles, we have also made several changes to \nS. 1090 as introduced.\n  First, we have increased authorized funding levels in the first two \nyears of the five-year period covered by the bill and made the ramp-\ndown in funding less severe in the final three years.\n  Second, we deleted the cap on new NPL listings and revised the \nrequirement for removing clean contiguous property parcels from NPL \nlistings.\n  Third, we made extensive changes to the allocation system to provide \nadditional flexibility. We added authorization for early settlements \nwithout an allocation, as well as an expedited allocation based only on \nan estimate of the orphan share.\n  Fourth, we expressly preserve strict, joint and several liability for \nthose parties who choose not to participate in a settlement. We also \nensure that EPA's existing authority to issue orders and engage in \nremoval actions is not unduly limited.\n\n[[Page S10457]]\n\n  Mr. President, these modifications have, in my view, improved the \nbill substantially. We are introducing this new bill for the \ninformation of our colleagues, and in an effort to generate more \nsupport for this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, these revisions to our Superfund bill were not \nsufficient to garner support from a majority of the Members on the \nCommittee. That is disappointing to me, and I would urge my colleagues \nto take a good look at the bill we introduce today. It represents \nstrong reform of the troubled Superfund program. It will accelerate \ncleanup by injecting greater fairness into the system, providing more \nresources for state and local cleanup efforts, and providing finality \nfor decisions made under those state programs.\n\n  Our legislation continues to make major reforms in six areas. \nSpecifically, SARA:\n  Directs EPA to finish the job that was started nearly two decades ago \nby completing the evaluation of the 3,000 remaining sites on the CERLA \nInformation System (CERCLIS).\n  Clearly allocates responsibility between states and EPA for future \ncleanups.\n  Protects municipalities, small businesses, recyclers, and other \nparties from unfair liability--while making the system fairer for \neveryone else.\n  Provides states $100 million per year and full authority for their \nown cleanup programs.\n  Revitalizes communities with $100 million in annual brownfields \nredevelopment grants.\n  Requires fiscal responsibility by EPA and saves taxpayers money.\n  Our legislation will result in more hazardous waste sites being \ncleaned up--and in fewer dollars being wasted on litigation. It will \ngive much-needed and much-deserved liability relief to innocent \nlandowners, contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, \nmunicipalities, small businesses, and recyclers. Unlike EPA's \nadministrative reforms, this bill does not shift costs from politically \npopular parties to those left holding the bag. Instead, it requires \npayment of a statutory orphan share and authorizes the use of the \nSuperfund Trust Fund for those shares.\n  For those left trapped in the Superfund liability scheme, SARA \nrequires an allocation process to determine a party's fair share in an \nexpedited settlement--instead of fighting it out for years in court.\n  In addition to increasing fairness, SARA provides much needed \nguidance and direction to a sometimes wayward EPA. It recognizes and \nbuilds upon the growth and strength of State hazardous waste cleanup \nprograms. It provides new resources to States and localities for their \ncleanup and redevelopment efforts. As many of my colleagues know, the \nfear of Superfund liability has resulted in an estimated 450,000 \nabandoned or underutilized properties, or ``Brownfields,'' that lay \nfallow because private developers and municipalities don't want to be \ndragged into Superfund's litigation quagmire. With new resources and \nappropriate liability protections, our bill will allow the cleanup of \nthose sites, spurring economic redevelopment in cities, towns, and \nrural areas across America.\n  We take a different approach to the brownfields redevelopment issue \nthan the Administration seeks. Along with many of my colleagues, I \nbelieve that economic redevelopment is primarily a State and local \nissue. Our approach provides the resources and freedom States need to \nmake progress on this front, rather than giving EPA new authority to \nget into the commercial real estate and redevelopment business. That is \nnot EPA's role, nor should it be.\n  Where EPA does have a role is in identifying and addressing risks at \nuncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Our legislation ensures that EPA \nregains its focus on that mission.\n  Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that \n``completion of construction at existing sites'' and reducing new \nentries into the program was the Environmental Protection Agency's top \nSuperfund priority. Unfortunately, EPA's narrow focus on generating \nconstruction completion statistics appear to have divested resources \nfrom EPA's fundamental mission--protecting human health and the \nenvironment from releases of hazardous waste.\n  GAO reported last year that 3,000 sites still await a National \nPriorities List decision by EPA. Most of those sites have been in the \nCERCLIS inventory for more than a decade. According to the report, \nhowever, more than 1,200 of them are actually ineligible for listing on \nthe NPL, for a variety of reasons. Some of the sites were classified \nerroneously, while others either do not require cleanup, have already \nbeen cleaned up, or have final cleanup underway. EPA's failure to \nremove the specter of an NPL listing at these sites has likely caused \nsignificant economic and social harm to the surrounding communities. \nEPA needs to focus on that task.\n  In addition, far too many of the sites that are still potentially \neligible for listing have received little or no attention from EPA. EPA \nadmitted taking no cleanup action at all at 336 sites and provided no \ninformation for another 48 sites. The only action taken at 719 sites \nwas an initial site assessment. EPA's inattention may be due to the \nfact that EPA and state officials together identified only 232 of the \nsites as worthy of being added to NPL. In that case, however, the \nappropriate response is to archive the sites while ensuring that any \nnecessary cleanup occurs under some other Federal or State program. EPA \nneeds to focus on that task as well.\n  Unfortunately, there is also disagreement between EPA and state \nofficials about even those 232 sites. EPA identified 132 that may be \nlisted on the NPL in the future, but state officials agreed on only 26 \nof those. Conversely, state officials identified a different group of \n100 sites as worthy of an NPL listing in the future.\n  EPA agreed with GAO's recommendation that it ``develop a joint \nstrategy'' with the States for addressing these sites. After nearly 20 \nyears and $20 billion in taxpayer funded EPA appropriations, it is \ndisturbing that the agency only now is developing such strategy. \nNonetheless, Congress has an obligation to provide direction and \nassistance to EPA in this effort. The Superfund Amendments and \nReauthorization Act provides that direction by:\n  Requiring EPA to finish evaluating and/or archiving old sites stuck \nin the CERCLIS inventory, thus correcting the current imbalance between \nevaluating uncontrolled sites and amassing construction completed \nstatistics.\n  Providing EPA with a schedule of 30 NPL listings per year, to ensure \nthat it and the States appropriately allocate sites for cleanup under \nSuperfund, RCRA, or State response programs.\n  Increasing current law limits on EPA removal actions to provide \ngreater flexibility in responding to sites that, at least initially, \nshould be the responsibility of the Federal government, but ultimately \ndo not require an NPL listing.\n  These provisions will ensure that the limited universe of sites \nremaining in the Superfund pipeline are dealt with quickly and safely.\n  In addition to keeping EPA focused on the task at hand, our bill \nprovides increased resources and authority to the States, in \nrecognition of the progress made by State cleanup programs in the last \ndecade.\n  Superfund is notable among the major Federal environmental statutes \nnot only for its abysmal track record, but also for its heavy reliance \non EPA action rather that state implementation. In other environmental \nprograms--RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--EPA \ntypically sets general program direction and provides technical support \nwhile leaving implementation and enforcement to the states. In the \nSuperfund program, however, EPA takes a direct role in both enforcement \nand cleanup. This leadership role was originally justified by a \nperceived inability or alleged unwillingness on the part of states to \nperform or oversee cleanups. The situation today is far different.\n  The Environmental Law Institute reported last year that States have \nnow completed 41,000 cleanups, with another 13,700 in progress. The \nAssociation of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials \n(ASTSWMO) reports that ``States are not only addressing more sites at \nany given time, but are also completing more sites through streamlined \nState programs. State programs have matured and increased in their \ninfrastructure capacity.''\n  Most now recognize that states have made great strides in their \nprograms,\n\n[[Page S10458]]\n\nand even EPA in May of 1998 released a ``Plan to Enhance the Role of \nStates and Tribes in the Superfund Program.'' Not surprisingly, while \nthat plan appears to provide some increased opportunities for state \nleadership, it also envisions a significant, on-going role for EPA.\n  The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, on the other hand, \nassists, recognizes, and builds on the growth of state cleanup \nprograms. SARA also responds to pleas from ASTSWMO, the National \nGovernors Association, and others to remove the ever-present threat of \nEPA over-filing and third party lawsuits under Superfund when a site is \nbeing cleaned up under a State program. SARA recognizes the fact that \nStates should be the leaders in cleaning up hazardous waste sites by:\n  Providing $100 million annually for State core and voluntary response \nprograms to allow States to build on their impressive record of \naccomplishment in this area.\n  Providing finality, except in cases of emergency or at a State's \nrequest, for cleanups conducted under State law.\n  Requiring EPA to work with the States so that sites listed on the NPL \nare those the Governor of the State agrees warrant an NPL listing.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we introduce today has the strong \nsupport of the nation's small businesses, Governors, Mayors, and state \ncleanup officials. I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1538.

Mr. President, it is going on two years since I first \nsubmitted comments to the Federal Communications Commission regarding \ntheir proposed rules to preempt State and local governments in the \nplacement and construction of telecommunications towers. Close to two \nyears later, I am still working to ensure that the voice of States and \nlocal governments are heard in the continuing fight over \ntelecommunications tower construction.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senators Jeffords, Hutchison, Feingold, \nand Moynihan in introducing legislation which will mandate that states \nand towns cannot be ignored in the spread of telecommunications towers. \nThis bill recognizes that states and towns do have choices in this \ncellular age.\n  I became greatly alarmed two years ago, when the Federal \nCommunications Commission proposed rules which would preempt State and \nlocal governments in the siting of telecommunications towers. This rule \nis still pending, and it has been by no means the only or final \nattempts to minimize the role of State and local governments in the \nclamor to erect telecommunications towers.\n  For instance, some may recall the ```E-911'' bill that was introduced \nlast Congress which would have prohibited State and local governments \nfrom having any say over the placement or construction of \ntelecommunications towers on federal lands. Keep in mind that federal \ncourthouses and post offices are included in this category.\n  I continue to be very concerned that the rights of citizens are being \njeopardized by the interests of telecommunications companies.\n  As I have said before, I do not want Vermont turned into a \npincushion, with 200 foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every \nmountain and in every valley.\n  The state of Vermont must have a role in deciding where \ntelecommunications towers are going to go. Vermont citizens and \ncommunities should be able to participate in the important decisions \naffecting their families and their future.\n  Twenty-nine years ago, Vermont enacted landmark legislation, known as \nAct 250, to carefully establish procedures to balance the interests of \ndevelopment with the interests of the environment, health and safety, \nresource conservation and the protection of Vermont's natural beauty. I \ndo not want Act 250's legacy to be undermined by the interests of \ntelecommunications companies.\n  Another factor that should remain at the forefront of this debate is \nthe existence of alternative communication technologies.\n  For instance, some companies are working to offer phone service \nthroughout the United States that is based on low-earth-orbit \nsatellites. Over time, this will provide a satellite communications \nlink from any place in the world, even where no tower-based system is \navailable. Emergency communications--911 and disaster assistance--will \nbe greatly aided with this development.\n  In addition, I have previously discussed how the towerless PCS-Over-\nCable and PCS-Over-Fiber technology provides digital cellular phone \nservice by using small antennas rather than large towers. These small \nantennas can be quickly attached to existing telephone poles, lamp \nposts or buildings and can provide quality wireless phone service \nwithout the use of towers. This technology is cheaper than most tower \ntechnology in part because the PCS-Over-Cable wireless provider does \nnot have to purchase land to erect large towers.\n  Since there are viable and reasonable alternatives to providing \nwireless phone service through the use of towers, I think that towns \nshould have some say in this matter. And I think that mayors, town \nofficials and local citizens will agree with me.\n  Also, consider this: the Federal Aviation Administration presently \nhas limited authority to regulated the siting of towers, and because of \nthis, airport officials work with local governments in the siting of \ntowers. Silencing local governments will have a direct effect on \nairline safety, according to the representatives of the airline \nindustry that we have heard from.\n  In fact, in a comment letter responding to the FCC's 1997 proposed \nrule at preemption, the National Association of State Aviation \nOfficials stated that preemption ``is contrary to the most fundamental \nprinciples of aviation safety * * * the proposed rule could result in \nthe creation of hazards to aircraft and passengers at airports across \nthe United States, as well as jeopardize safety on the ground.'' I \ncannot think of anyone who would want towers constructed irrespective \nof the negative and potentially dangerous impacts they may have on \nairplane flight and landing patterns.\n  There is also a growing concern about potential health hazards \nassociated with using cellular telephones. Though there was a major \npush by the U.S. federal government to research effects of electric and \nmagnetic fields on biological systems, as is evidenced by the five-year \nElectric and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information \nDissemination Program, there has been no similar effort to research \npotential health effects of radio frequency emissions associated with \nwireless communications and wireless broadcast facilities. This \nomission should no longer be overlooked.\n  As I have said before, I am for progress, but not for ill-considered, \nso-called progress at the expense of Vermont families, towns and \nhomeowners. Vermont can protect its rural and natural beauty while \nstill providing for the amazing opportunities offered by these \ntechnological advances.\n  I am proud to continue in my commitment to the preservation of State \nand local authority over the siting and construction of \ntelecommunications towers. I ask unanimous consent that this \nlegislation be printed the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The placement of Telecommunications Facilities near \n     residential properties can greatly reduce the value of such \n     properties, destroy the views from such properties, and \n     reduce substantially the desire to live in the area.\n       (2) States and local governments should be able to exercise \n     control over the placement, construction, and modification of \n     such facilities through the use of zoning, planned\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\n     growth, and other land use regulations relating to the \n     protection of the environment and public health, safety and \n     welfare of the community.\n       (3) There are alternatives to the construction of \n     facilities to meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, \n     including, but not limited to, alternative locations, \n     colocation of antennas on existing towers or structures, \n     towerless PCS-Over-Cable or PCS-Over-Fiber telephone service, \n     satellite television systems, low-Earth orbit satellite \n     communication networks, and other alternative technologies.\n       (4) There are alternative methods of designing towers to \n     meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the \n     use of small towers that do not require blinking aircraft \n     safety lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree \n     canopies and that are camouflaged or disguised to blend with \n     their surroundings, or both.\n       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications \n     Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, \n     which would preempt the application of State and local zoning \n     and land use ordinances regarding the placement, construction \n     and modification of broadcast transmission facilities. It is \n     in the interest of the Nation that the Commission not adopt \n     this rule.\n       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the memoranda \n     opinions and orders and proposed rules of the Commission with \n     respect to application of certain ordinances to the placement \n     of such towers (WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, \n     RM-8577, and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified in order \n     to permit State and local governments to exercise their \n     zoning and land use authorities, and their power to protect \n     public health and safety, to regulate the placement of \n     telecommunications or broadcast facilities and to place the \n     burden of proof in civil actions, and in actions before the \n     Commission and State and local authorities relating to the \n     placement, construction, and modification of such facilities, \n     on the person or entity that seeks to place, construct, or \n     modify such facilities.\n       (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber, and satellite \n     telecommunications systems, including low-Earth orbit \n     satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-\n     called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of \n     the United States.\n       (8) According to the Comptroller General, the Commission \n     does not consider itself a health agency and turns to health \n     and radiation experts outside the Commission for guidance on \n     the issue of health and safety effects of radio frequency \n     exposure.\n       (9) The Federal Aviation Administration does not have \n     adequate authority to regulate the placement, construction \n     and modification of telecommunications facilities near \n     airports or high-volume air traffic areas such as corridors \n     of airspace or commonly used flyways. The Commission's \n     proposed rules to preempt State and local zoning and land-use \n     regulations for the siting of such facilities will have a \n     serious negative impact on aviation safety, airport capacity \n     and investment, and the efficient use of navigable airspace.\n       (10) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n     be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n     technical information and should therefore be held to the \n     highest standards in terms of their representations, \n     assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n       (11) There has been a substantial effort by the Federal \n     Government to determine the effects of electric and magnetic \n     fields on biological systems, as is evidenced by the Electric \n     and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information \n     Dissemination (RAPID) Program, which was established by \n     section 2118 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law \n     102-486; 42 U.S.C. 13478). This five-year program, which was \n     coordinated by the National Institute of Environmental Health \n     Sciences and the Department of Energy, examined the possible \n     effects of electric and magnetic fields on human health. \n     Despite the success of this program, there has been no \n     similar effort by the Federal Government to determine the \n     possible effects on human health of radio frequency emissions \n     associated with telecommunications facilities. The RAPID \n     program could serve as the excellent model for a Federally-\n     sponsored research project.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local \n     authority regarding the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless service facilities and \n     related facilities as such limitations arise under section \n     332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     332(c)(7)).\n       (2) To permit State and local governments--\n       (A) in cases where the placement, construction, or \n     modification of telecommunications facilities and other \n     facilities is inconsistent with State and local regulations, \n     laws or decisions, to require the use of alternative \n     telecommunication or broadcast technologies when such \n     alternative technologies are available;\n       (B) to regulate the placement, modification and \n     construction of such facilities so that their placement, \n     construction and or modification will not interfere with the \n     safe and efficient use of public airspace or otherwise \n     compromise or endanger public safety; and\n       (C) to hold applicants for permits for the placement, \n     construction, or modification of such telecommunication \n     facilities, and providers of services using such towers and \n     facilities, accountable for the truthfulness and accuracy of \n     representations and statements placed in the record of \n     hearings for such permits, licenses or approvals.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF \n                   TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Limitations on Regulation of Personal \n     Wireless Facilities.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that \n     follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not \n     unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally \n     equivalent services.'';\n       (2) by striking clause (iv);\n       (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n       (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--\n       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``30 days after such \n     action or failure to act'' and inserting ``30 days after \n     exhaustion of any administrative remedies with respect to \n     such action or failure to act''; and\n       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the \n     following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to \n     place, construct, or modify a telecommunications facility is \n     a party, such person shall bear the burden of proof, \n     regardless of who commences the action.''\n       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Preemption of \n     State and Local Authority Over Broadcast Transmission \n     Facilities.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Federal Communications Commission may not adopt as a final \n     rule or otherwise the proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption \n     of State and Local Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on \n     Siting, Placement and Construction of Broadcast Station \n     Transmission Facilities'', MM Docket No. 97-182, released \n     August 19, 1997.\n       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and \n     Modification of Other Transmission Facilities.--Part I of \n     title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 337. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF \n                   TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, no provision of this Act may be interpreted to \n     authorize any person or entity to place, construct, or modify \n     telecommunications facilities in a manner that is \n     inconsistent with State or local law, or contrary to an \n     official decision of the appropriate State or local \n     government entity having authority to approve, permit, \n     license, modify, or deny an application to place, construct, \n     or modify a tower, if alternate technology is capable of \n     delivering the broadcast or telecommunications signals \n     without the use of a tower.\n       ``(b) Authority Regarding Production of Safety and \n     Interference Studies.--No provision of this Act may be \n     interpreted to prohibit a State or local government from--\n       ``(1) requiring a person or entity seeking authority to \n     place, construct or modify telecommunications facilities or \n     broadcast transmission facilities within the jurisdiction of \n     such government to produce--\n       ``(A) environmental studies, engineering reports, or other \n     documentation of the compliance of such facilities with radio \n     frequency exposure limits established by the Commission and \n     compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing the \n     effects of the proposed facility or the health, safety and \n     welfare of the local residents in the community; and\n       ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such facilities \n     with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety \n     standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects \n     effecting navigable airspace; or\n       ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to locate \n     such facilities within the jurisdiction of such government if \n     such person fails to produce any studies, reports, or \n     documentation required under paragraph (1).\n       ``(c) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a \n     State or local government to ensure compliance with or \n     otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or \n     representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an \n     applicant with the State or local government for authority to \n     place, construct or modify telecommunications facilities or \n     broadcast transmission facilities within the jurisdiction of \n     the State or local government.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to stand together today \nwith my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, on a bill that protects the rights of state \nand local governments.\n  Mr. President, the bill that Senator Leahy introduced today addresses \nan egregious affront to state and local authority. Indeed, the Federal \nCommunications Commission's proposed rule on telecommunications tower \nsiting is an explicit transfer of power to the federal government.\n  Mr. President, the FCC would have the American people believe that it \nunderstands state and local land use issues better than the folks back \nhome. It's proposed rule, itself promoted by a special interest group, \nwould preempt state and local zoning and land use restrictions on the \nsiting and construction of telecommunications towers. This is not the \nway the Federal government should be operating.\n  The FCC's proposed rule would set specific time limits within state \nand local governments must act in response to requests for approval of \nthe placement, construction or modification of these towers. In \naddition, the rule would ``remove from local consideration certain \ntypes of restrictions on the siting and construction of transmission \nfacilities.'' And finally, the rule would preempt all state and local \nlaws that impair the ability of licensed broadcasters to construct or \nmodify towers unless the state or local government can prove that their \nregulation is ``reasonable in relation to a clearly defined and \nexpressly stated health or safety objective.\n  Mr. President, the proposal infringes on the rights of states and \nlocalities to make important zoning decisions in accordance with their \nown development objectives. It infringes also on the rights of \nresidents of states and localities to fully enjoy the protection of \nrules requiring notification of adjacent land owners, hearing \nrequirements and appeal periods. Under the proposed rule, the Federal \ngovernment would impose specific time periods during which zoning \ndisputes between entities seeking to build or modify towers and the \nstate or locality must be resolved.\n  The rule also appears to preempt entirely a local or state law \nregarding tower placement even if that law is intended to ensure the \nhealth or safety of the community. The rule would allow health and \nsafety concerns to be overridden by the federal interest in the \nconstruction of transmission facilities and in the promotion of fair \nand effective competition among electronic media. It is unclear why the \nbusiness operations of telecommunications companies should override \nlocal health and safety concerns.\n  State or local zoning or land use laws designed to address historic \nor aesthetic objectives also would be preempted under this rule.\n  Mr. President, states and localities should be able to maintain the \nright to control development within their own jurisdictions without \nundue interference from the Federal government. Federal preemption of \nzoning decisions should be the exception rather than the rule. The \nproposed rule would make federal preemption of legitimate local and \nstate zoning and land use laws commonplace.\n  Why would we allow this end run around state and local authority, Mr. \nPresident? It goes completely against the philosophy of state and local \nautonomy that so many of my colleagues support.\n  To try and get to the bottom of this, Mr. President, I'd like to Call \nthe Bankroll, which I do from time to time during my remarks on this \nfloor. I'm going to offer some information about the political \ndonations that have been made by the telecommunications giants that \nhave a huge stake in the wireless communications industry. That \nindustry has been lobbying hard in favor of the FCC rule, which \nempowers the federal government to overrule local communities that \ndon't want a tower in their town.\n  During the least election cycle, the following telecommunications \ncompanies with a stake in the wireless market gave millions upon \nmillions of dollars to candidates and the political parties:\n   Bell Atlantic gave more than $920,000 in soft money and \nnearly $885,000 in PAC money;\n   Wireless manufacturer Motorola gave $100,000 in soft and \nmoney and nearly $110,000 in PAC money;\n   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the \nlobbying arm of the wireless industry, gave more than $100,000 in soft \nmoney and more than $85,000 to candidates;\n   And AT gave nearly $825,000 in soft money to the parties \nand nearly $820,000 in PAC money to candidates.\n  Certainly, this FCC rule is not the only thing these companies are \nlobbying for, Mr. President. But whenever wealthy interests wants \nsomething, they have the weight of their contributions behind them. \nThose contributions influence what we do, and they deserve to be noted \nin this discussion. I think it's vitally important that we keep \nthese contributions in mind as we evaluate the proposed rule, and we \ntry to understand why the FCC would propose it, and why a Congress full \nof members who support state and local autonomy would stand for it.\n\n  But Mr. President, now I'd like to get to the good news--the bill \nauthored by the distinguished senior senator from Vermont, which would \nrepeal limitations on state and local authority regarding the placement \nof, construction of and modifications to telecommunications towers. It \nwould do so by prohibiting the FCC from adopting as final the proposed \nrule. And the bill does so in a responsible manner.\n  Senator Leahy's bill incorporates aviation industry concerns by \nallowing state and local governments to require tower construction \napplications to be accompanied by documentation showing compliance with \napplicable state and local aviation standards. It acknowledges \nalternative technologies which can be used in place of towers, \nincluding satellite and cable. It authorizes state and local \ngovernments to require evidence from companies showing that the \nproposed tower would comply with federal health and environmental \nstandards. And it maintains the authority of state and local \ngovernments to ensure that companies comply with statements, assertions \nand representations made while applying for permission to locate a \nbroadcast facility.\n  Mr. President, as new telecommunication towers have sprouted up by \nthe thousands from coast to coast, so has the ire of our residents. To \nquote my distinguished colleague from Vermont, I too don't want \nWisconsin turned into a giant pin cushion with 200-foot towers sticking \nout of every hill and valley.\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin will be a leader in the information age, but \nWisconsinites deserve the right to determine where towers are located \nwithin Wisconsin. More than a few Wisconsin communities, large and \nsmall, have voiced their clear opposition to the heavy hand of the \nFederal government on this issue. Various communities and groups, from \nthe city of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Regional Cable Commission to \nthe cities of Fond du Lac and Brookfield to the Dodge County Board of \nSupervisors, the Lincoln County Zoning Committee, and the Oneida County \nPlanning and Zoning Committee have contacted me to voice their \nopposition to the proposed rule.\n  And other communities that have voiced opposition to recent tower \nsiting plans, including Delafield, Fox Point, Bayside, Elm Grove, \nGermantown, Heartland, Mequon, Muskego, St. Francis, and Whitefish Bay.\n  One resident of Cassian, Wisconsin, summed up the feeling of many \nWisconsinites: ``We don't want to become a tower farm.''\n  Mr. President, the FCC clearly has overstepped its regulatory bounds. \nWe should empower state and local governments, not emasculate them. I \nhope my colleagues will support the rights of our states and \nmunicipalities, not more Federal autocracy. I commend my colleague for \nintroducing this important piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1539. A bill to provide for the acquisition, construction, and \nimprovement of child care facilities or equipment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\n                  CHILD CARE FACILITIES FINANCING ACT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator DeWine \nin introducing the Child Care Facilities Financing Act. This bill would \nhelp ease a significant crisis in this country--the shortage of \nadequate child care, particularly in low-income communities.\n\n  The demand for child care is not being met by the current supply, \nespecially for low-income children. Approximately 50% of children from \nfamilies with household incomes of $10,000 or less are enrolled in \nchild care or early education programs, whereas over 75% of children \nfrom families with household incomes over $75,000 are enrolled in such \nprograms.\n  According to the GAO, the child care supply shortage will worsen as \nwork participation rates required under welfare reform increase over \nthe next few years. The situation is particularly troublesome for \ninfant and school-aged care. For example, in Chicago, the percentage of \nthe demand that can be met by the known supply of child care providers \nwill be only 12% for infants and 17% for school-aged children in the \nyear 2002 if a greater supply is not created. The situation is even \nmore dire in poor neighborhoods.\n  One factor contributing to the child care shortage is the difficulty \nthat would-be providers face in financing child care facility \ndevelopment. Child care providers are often viewed by financial \ninstitutions as risky for loans. Child care equipment and facility \nneeds are unique, making for poor collateral. In low-income \nneighborhoods, child care providers face severely restricted revenues \nand low real estate values. In urban areas, would-be child care \nproviders must contend with buildings in poor physical condition and \nhigh property costs. In all areas, reimbursement rates for child care \nsubsidies are generally too low to cover the recovery cost of \npurchasing or developing facilities, especially after allowing for the \ncost of running the program. In addition, new providers often have no \nbusiness training, and may need to learn how to manage their finances \nand business.\n  The Child Care Facilities Financing Act would provide grants to \nintermediary organizations, enabling them to provide financial and \ntechnical assistance to existing or new child care providers --\nincluding both center-based and home-based child care. The financial \nassistance may be in the form of loans, grants, investments, or other \nassistance, allowing for flexibility depending on the situation of the \nchild care provider. The assistance may be used for acquisition, \nconstruction, or renovation of child care facilities or equipment. It \nmay also be used for improving child care management and business \npractices. Additionally, intermediary organizations are required to \nmatch grant dollars with significant private sector investments, \nleveraging federal funding and creating valuable public/private \npartnerships.\n  The added benefit in providing this kind of assistance is that it \nwill spur further community and economic development. When parents can \nwork with the knowledge that their children are adequately cared for, \nthey become more reliable and productive workers. When the economic \nsituation of families improve, distressed communities become \nrevitalized.\n  Let me provide you with an example from my state of how financial \nassistance for child care development has helped alleviate dire \nsituations. In one low-income neighborhood in New Haven, CT, there are \n2500 children under the age of 5, but only 200 spaces in licensed child \ncare facilities. For more than a decade, the LULAC Head Start program \nserved this community by operating a part-day early childhood program \nin a poorly lit church basement. There has been a waiting list of over \n100 children for this program. Recently, however, this basement program \nclosed, and the 54 children it served were moved to an already \novercrowded location.\n  Fortunately for LULAC, Connecticut has a new child care financing \nprogram. The Child Care Facilities Loan Fund Program is a public-\nprivate partnership that provides financial assistance for child care \nfacilities development, targeting school readiness programs in \nunderserved areas. LULAC has finally received desperately needed \nfinancial assistance to develop the Hill Parent Child Center. A new \nfacility is being constructed, specially adapted for child care use. \nThe center will now be able to provide multicultural child care, school \nreadiness, and Head Start services for 172 low-income children in New \nHaven.\n  Although this story had a happy ending, many more children in New \nHaven and other places in Connecticut still need child care. And most \nstates do not have a child care financing system in place.\n  Working parents and their children need adequate child care. \nIncreasing the supply of child care will create a better economy as \nmore parents move from welfare to work, and it will create more choices \nfor parents to gain control over their families' lives. I hope that you \nwill join Senator DeWine and me in taking an important step toward \nlifting our nation out of its current child care crisis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 1540. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to correct \nthe inadvertent failure in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to apply to \nexception for developable sites to Round I Empowerment Zone and \nEnterprise Communities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   empowerment zones and enterprise communities technical correction \n                              legislation\n\n Mr. JOHNSON Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would provide a technical correction to laws governing \nEmpowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC).\n\n  In the second round of EZ/EC designations, language was included to \nallow for investments in `developable sites.' The developable sites \nprovision provides local leaders with needed flexibility to pursue \ncommunity and economic development initiatives that advance the goals \nof the EZ/EC program, but that may include areas adjacent to the local \nEZ/EC boundaries. Unfortunately, the existing language only applies to \nRound II EZ/ECs. My bill would expand the existing `developable site' \ncriteria to Round I EZ/ECs.\n  The addition of the developable site option represents a thoughtful \nimprovement to administering the EZ/EC program. Thoughtful, worthy \ninitiatives should not go unrealized because of restrictions imposed by \na line on a map. The developable site option is a critical tool and it \nshould be applied equally to Round I and Round II awardees. This \nlegislation would not authorize new funding, but it would assist EZs \nand ECs to invest in meaningful projects located adjacently to their \nestablished service area.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort to provide equal \ntreatment for Round I EZ/ECs to pursue comprehensive investments for \ngrowth and prosperity which may include projects encompassing areas \ntangential to the designated EZ/EC service area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 1541. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to require annual informational statements by plans with \nqualified cash or deferred arrangements, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       401 (k) right to know act\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation, the 401(k) Right To Know Act, to require that 401(k) plan \nproviders implement procedures to disclose the administrative fees that \nthey charge their customers. However, I hope the need for the \nlegislation can be effectively eliminated by voluntary action on the \npart of the plan providers to disclose fees.\n\n  I am concerned that millions of American families work and save for \ntheir retirement through 401(k) plans without having an opportunity to \nfully evaluate and compare the costs of such plans. National news \npublications have suggested that some plans may be charging plan \nparticipants up to 2.5% of assets annually to manage their accounts. \nWhile I believe families should be free to choose among competing plans \nand to participate in retirement savings vehicles of their choice, I am \ntroubled that information about fees is not fully disclosed.\n  I believe that we have an obligation to make sure that families have \naccess to basic information about fees. Congress encourages people to \nparticipate in 401(k) retirement plans by providing considerable tax \nadvantages. We should give equal care to making sure that\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\nbusinesses and families have the information necessary to protect their \nnest eggs from excessive, undisclosed fees that threaten to siphon off \nthe rewards of their work and prudence.\n  Recently the Department of Labor, the American Bankers Association, \nthe American Council of Life Insurance, and the Investment Company \nInstitute announced a plan to address these concerns and provide \ninformation about 401(k) fees. I applaud this responsible and important \neffort. The agreements reached should be given fair consideration and \nan opportunity to be implemented. It is my sincere hope, that these \nefforts will be supported by all 401(k) plan providers and that \nconsumers will utilize and benefit from fee disclosure.\n  Nonetheless, I want to go on record to articulate my lingering \nconcern for the lack of disclosure currently provided and make known my \nconviction to pursue legislative action should the industry fail to \nfully implement the goals of disclosure recently agreed upon. Again, I \nwant to reiterate that I believe the recent announcement is an \nimportant step to resolve this issue. My goal is to make sure consumers \nhave accurate and timely information about fees readily available to \nthem. I will be monitoring the progress closely and remain hopeful that \nlegislative action will not be necessary to achieve disclosure of \n401(k) fees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Hollings):\n  S. 1547. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nthe Federal Communications Commission to preserve low-power television \nstations that provide community broadcasting, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madame President, I am very pleased to introduce the \n``Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999,'' along with my \ncolleagues Senator Wyden, Senator Lott and Senator Hollings.\n  This critical legislation was championed last year by my good friend \nand former colleague Senator Ford. The Commerce Committee unanimously \nreported this bill on October 2, 1998 but unfortunately there was not \nsufficient time to complete action on the bill.\n  Low power television stations (LPTV) offer their communities \nsignificant services including valuable local and other specialized \nprogramming to unserved and underserved audiences throughout the United \nStates. As secondary service broadcasters, they remain vulnerable to \ndisplacement and encounter huge problems with capital formation but \nhave significant infrastructure requirements.\n  This legislation has a very simple but important purpose. It provides \nan opportunity for LPTV licensees to convert their temporary licenses \nto permanent licenses. While the opportunity is available to all \nlicensees, the legislation provides that only those who do a \nsignificant amount of local programming in their service areas are \neligible for the class A permanent licenses. To ensure a serious and \nhigh quality level of local broadcasting by all class A licensees, this \nbill also requires that all class A licensees comply with the operating \nrules for full power stations.\n  I would like to emphasize that this bill takes into account the \nhearings that were held last year before the House Subcommittee on \nTelecommunications, during which the Federal Communications Commission \nnoted that the previous bill was not sufficiently flexible to address \nunforeseen engineering-related problems concerning the transition to \ndigital television. The current bill provides that flexibility to \nensure that the Commission can make whatever engineering changes that \nare necessary, even channel changes, to ensure that every full power \nstation in the U.S. can achieve digital television service replication \nof its analog service area.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support on this vital piece of \nlegislation and look forward to seeing it passed by the Senate and into \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Broadcasters \n     Protection Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by \n     the Federal Communications Commission, a number of license \n     holders have operated their stations in a manner beneficial \n     to the public good providing broadcasting to their \n     communities that would not otherwise be available.\n       (2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their \n     stations in a manner consistent with the programming \n     objectives and hours of operation of full-power broadcasters \n     providing worthwhile services to their respective communities \n     while under sever license limitations compared to their full-\n     power counterparts.\n       (3) License limitations, particularly the temporary nature \n     of the license, have blocked many low-power broadcasters from \n     having access to capital, and have severely hampered their \n     ability to continue to provide quality broadcasting, \n     programming, or improvements.\n       (4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has \n     added to the uncertainty of the future status of these \n     stations by the lack of specific provisions regarding the \n     permanency of their licenses, or their treatment during the \n     transition to high definition, digital television.\n       (5) It is in the public interest to promote diversity in \n     television programming formats by encouraging low power \n     television stations that serve foreign language communities. \n     These communities should not lose their access to foreign \n     language programming as a result of the transition to digital \n     television.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF LOW-POWER COMMUNITY TELEVISION \n                   BROADCASTING.\n\n       (a) Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 336) is amended:\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n     (g) and (h), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(f) Preservation of Low-Power Community Television \n     Broadcasting.\n       ``(1) Creation of Class A Licenses. Within 120 days after \n     the date of enactment of the Community Broadcasters \n     Protection Act of 1999, the Commission shall prescribe \n     regulations to establish a class A television to be available \n     to licensees of qualifying low-power television stations. \n     Such license shall be subject to the same license terms, and \n     renewal standards as the licenses for full-power television \n     stations except as provided in this section, and each class A \n     licensee shall be accorded primary status as a television \n     broadcaster as long as the station continues to meet the \n     requirements for a qualifying low-power station in paragraph \n     (2). Within 30 days after the date of enactment of the \n     Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, the Commission \n     shall send a notice to the licensees of all low-power \n     television licenses that describes the requirements for Class \n     A designation. Within 60 days after the date of enactment of \n     the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, licensees \n     intending to seek Class A designation shall submit to the \n     Commission a certification of eligibility based on the \n     qualification requirements of this Act. Absent a material \n     deficiency, the Commission shall grant certification of \n     eligibility to apply for Class A status. The Commission shall \n     act to preserve the contours of low-power television \n     licensees pending the final resolution of a Class A \n     application. Under the requirements set forth in paragraph \n     (2)(A) and (B) and paragraph (6) of this subsection, a \n     licensee may submit an application for Class A designation \n     under this paragraph only within 30 days after final \n     regulations are adopted, except as provided for in Paragraph \n     (6)(A). The Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of \n     an application that is acceptable for filing, award such a \n     Class A television station license to any licensee of a \n     qualifying low-power television station. If, after granting \n     certification of eligibility or a Class A license, unforeseen \n     technical problems arise that require an engineering solution \n     to a station's allotted parameters or channel assignment in \n     the digital television Table of Allotments, the Commission \n     may make such modifications as are necessary to ensure \n     replication of the digital television applicant's service \n     area as provided for in section 622 of the Commission's \n     regulations (47 C.F.R. 602).\n       ``(2) Qualifying low-power television stations.

A bill to establish a program to help States expand the \nexisting education system to include a least 1 year of early education \npreceding the year a child enters kindergarten; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    the early education act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today what I \nthink is a very innovative proposal to move our education system into \nthe 21st century.\n  There has been a growing body of research suggesting that a child's \nearly years are critical to the development of the brain, and that \nearly brain development is an important component of educational and \nintellectual achievement. Yet, in every state in this country, school \ndoes not officially begin until a child is 5 to 6 years old. Many \nchildren are missing some critical years.\n  I submit that as we enter the next century, if we are going to have \nthe best educational system, we must start reaching children at an \nearlier age.\n  Head Start does that. Private preschool does that. But Head Start is \nonly for low-income children, and there are not enough slots for all \nthose children eligible to participate. And private preschools are \noften so expensive that they are out of reach for many middle-class \nworking families.\n  We need to start thinking outside the box. One way to do that is to \nredefine what our educational system is. If education before \nkindergarten--before the age of 5--is so critical, maybe school should \nstart a year earlier.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today--the Early Education \nAct--would begin the process of expanding the existing public education \nsystem to include at least one year of early education preceding the \nyear a child enters kindergarten. My bill would set up a 10-state \ndemonstration program over the next 5 years for states that want to \nmove in this direction. The Federal Government would provide seed money \nof up to 50 percent of the costs for participating states to expand \nelementary school to include at least one year of early education, with \nthat program open to all students in a school district that \nparticipates within the state.\n  A few states, most notably Georgia, are already implementing \nprograms. Several other states, including my state of California, are \nplanning to. In fact, I want to commend our state schools \nsuperintendent Delaine Eastin for all of her work in this area.\n  But even those states that are committed to this idea are finding \nthat resources can be a significant barrier. And so what I want to do \nis to help states out. Let's see if early education--in those states \nthat are interested--really does make a difference.\n  We know what the evidence so far shows. Compared to children with \nsimilar backgrounds who have not participated in early education \nprograms, children who do participate in such programs perform better \non reading and math tests, are more likely to make normal academic \nprogress throughout elementary school, show greater learning retention \nand creativity, and are more enthusiastic about school.\n  If these evaluations are accurate--and that is, in part, what my bill \nis intended to find out--early education has the potential to make \nsignificant improvements in the education of our children.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Bingaman. And I \nwant to recognize Representative Anna Eshoo, who is introducing the \nHouse version of this bill. I encourage my colleagues to join us in \nworking to adapt our educational system for the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Early Education Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1989 the Nation's governors established a goal that \n     all children would have access to high quality early \n     education programs by the year 2000.\n       (2) Research suggests that a child's early years are \n     critical to the development of the brain. Early brain \n     development is an important component of educational and \n     intellectual achievement.\n       (3) The National Research Council reported that early \n     education opportunities are necessary if children are going \n     to develop the language and literacy skills necessary to \n     learn to read.\n       (4) Evaluations of early education programs demonstrate \n     that compared to children with similar backgrounds who have \n     not participated in early education programs, children who \n     participate in such programs--\n       (A) perform better on reading and mathematics achievement \n     tests;\n       (B) are more likely to stay academically near their grade \n     level and make normal academic progress throughout elementary \n     school;\n       (C) are less likely to be held back a grade or require \n     special education services in elementary school;\n       (D) show greater learning retention, initiative, \n     creativity, and social competency; and\n       (E) are more enthusiastic about school and are more likely \n     to have good attendance records.\n       (5) Studies have estimated that for every dollar invested \n     in quality early education, about 7 dollars are saved in \n     later costs.\n\n     SEC. 3. EARLY EDUCATION.\n\n       Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n                       ``PART L--EARLY EDUCATION\n\n     ``SEC. 10995.

A bill to inform and empower consumers in the United States \nthrough a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel or sporting \ngoods made without abusive and exploitative child labor, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill inform and empower consumers in the United States through a \nvoluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made \nwithout the use of abusive and exploitative child labor. I am joined in \nmy efforts by Senators Hollings and Dorgan. I want to thank them for \nworking with me on this important effort.\n  This is the third time I have come to the floor of the Senate to \nintroduce this bill, and I will continue to introduce it until it \nbecomes law.\n  I'd like to ask my colleagues to take a moment to look around. Maybe \nit's the shirt you have on right now. Or the silk tie or blouse. Or the \ntennis shoes you wear on weekends.\n  Chances are that you have purchased something--perhaps many things--\nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. And chances are you \nwere completely unaware that was the case. You will find a label that \ntells you what size it is, how to care for it and what it costs. But it \ndoesn't tell you about the person who made it.\n  Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization (ILO) \nreleased a very grim report about the number of children who toil away \nin abhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over two hundred and \nfifty million children worldwide under the age of 15 are working \ninstead of receiving a basic education. Many of these children begin \nworking in factories at the age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are \npoor, malnourished, and often forced to work 60-hour weeks for little \nor no pay.\n  Now when I speak about child labor, I am not talking about 17 year-\nolds helping out on the family farm or running errands after school. I \nam speaking about children, often under 12 years old, who are forced to \nwork long hours in hazardous and dangerous conditions many as slaves \ninstead of going to school.\n  On September 23, 1993, the Senate appropriately put itself on record \nas expressing its principled opposition to the abhorrent practice of \nexploiting children for commercial gain and asserting that it should be \nthe policy of the United States to prohibit the importation of products \nmade through the use of abusive and exploitative child labor by passing \na Sense of the Senate Resolution I introduced. In my view, this was the \nfirst step toward ending child labor.\n  Americans in Des Moines or Dallas or Detroit may say, ``What does \nthis have to do with us?'' It is quite simple. By protecting the rights \nof workers everywhere, we will be protecting jobs and opportunities \nhere at home. A U.S. worker cannot compete with a 12 year old working \n12 hours a day for 12 cents.\n  In 1998, the United States imported almost 50 percent of the wearing \napparel sold in this country and the garment industry netted $34 \nbillion. According to the Department of Commerce, last year, the United \nStates imported 494.1 million pairs of athletic footwear and produced \nonly 65.3 million here at home.\n\n  As I have traveled around the country and spoken with people about \nthe issue of abusive and exploitative child labor, I have found that \nconsumers--ordinary Americans--want to get involved. They want \ninformation. They want to know if the products they are buying are made \nby children.\n  According to a survey sponsored by Marymount University, more than \nthree out of four Americans said they would avoid shopping at stores if \nthey were aware that the good sold there were made by exploitative and \nabusive child labor. They also said that they would be willing to pay \nan extra $1 on a $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made under \nlegitimate circumstances.\n  Mr. President it is obvious that consumers don't want to reward \ncompanies with their hard earned dollars by buying products made with \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  This issue demands our attention. Our legislation, the Child Labor \nFree Consumer Information Act 1999, will inform and empower consumers \nin the United States through a voluntary labeling system for wearing \napparel and sporting goods made without abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. In my view, a system of voluntary labeling holds the best \npromise of giving consumers the information they want--and giving the \ncompanies that manufacture these products the recognition they deserve.\n  The crux of this legislation is to provide the framework for members \nof the wearing apparel and sporting goods industry, labor \norganizations, consumer advocacy and human rights groups along with the \nSecretaries of Commerce, Treasury and Labor to establish the labeling \nstandard and develop a system to assure compliance that items were not \nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. Thus, ensuring \nconsumers that the garment or pair of tennis shoes they purchase was \nmade without abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  In my view, Congress can't do it alone through legislation. The \nDepartment of Labor can't do it alone through enforcement. It takes all \nof us from the private sector to labor and human rights groups to take \nresponsibility, to come together to end abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. And I am pleased to say there has recently been promising action \nto that end.\n  Mr. President, when the private sector decides to take speak up--it \ncertainly can make a difference. In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Garment \nManufacturers and Exporters Association has agreed to work with the \nInternational Labor Organization to take children out of the garment \nfactories and put them into school--where they belong. As of May 1999, \nmore than 353 schools for former child workers have opened, serving \nnearly 10,000 children. So, if we can do it in Bangladesh, then we can \ndo it elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, companies can choose to use the label \nor not to. This bill is not about big government telling the private \nsector what to do. This bill is centered around this fundamental \nprinciple: Let the Buyer Be Aware. This ``Truth in Labeling'' \ninitiative is based on the principle that a fully informed American \nconsumer will make the right, and moral, choice and vote against \nabusive and exploitative child labor with their pocketbook.\n\n  We have seen such an approach work effectively with the Rugmark label \nfor hand-knotted carpets from India. It is operating in some European \ncountries. Consumers who want to buy child labor-free carpets can just \nlook for the Rugmark label. I visited the Rugmark headquarters in New \nDelhi, India last year. Mr. President, this initiative is working. It \nhas succeeded in taking children out of the factories and putting them \ninto schools while providing consumers with the information they need. \nTo date, 1.25 million of carpets have received the Rugmark label.\n  Mr. President, the progress that has been made on eradicating abusive \nand exploitative child labor is irreversible.\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\nTherefore we must continue to more forward. And I believe my bill \nallows us to do just that. It allows the consumer to know more about \nthe products they buy and give companies that use the label the \nrecognition they deserve.\n  Our nation began this century by working to end abusive and \nexploitative child labor in America, let us close this century by \nending child labor around the world. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1549\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Labor Free Consumer \n     Information Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Labor has conducted at least 5 \n     detailed studies that document the fact that abusive and \n     exploitative child labor exists worldwide;\n       (2) the Secretary of Labor has also determined, through the \n     studies referred to in paragraph (1), that child laborers are \n     often forced to work beyond their physical capacities or \n     under conditions that threaten their health, safety, and \n     development, and are denied basic educational opportunities;\n       (3) in most instances, countries that have abusive and \n     exploitative child labor also experience a high adult \n     unemployment rate;\n       (4) the International Labor Organization (commonly known as \n     the ``ILO'') in 1999 estimated that--\n       (A) approximately 250,000,000 children who are ages 5 \n     through 14 are working in developing countries; and\n       (B) many of those children manufacture wearing apparel or \n     sporting goods that are offered for sale in the United \n     States;\n       (5) consumers in the United States spend billions of \n     dollars each year on wearing apparel and sporting goods;\n       (6) consumers in the United States have the right to \n     information on whether the articles of wearing apparel \n     (including any section of that wearing apparel) or sporting \n     goods that the consumers purchase are made without abusive \n     and exploitative child labor;\n       (7) the rugmark labeling and monitoring system is a \n     successful model for eliminating abusive and exploitative \n     child labor in the rug industry;\n       (8) the labeling of wearing apparel or sporting goods would \n     provide the information referred to in paragraph (6) to \n     consumers; and\n       (9) it is important to recognize United States businesses \n     that have effective programs to ensure that products sold in \n     the United States are not made with abusive and exploitative \n     child labor.\n              TITLE I--CHILD LABOR FREE LABELING STANDARDS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to extend certain Medicare community nursing \norganization demonstration projects; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n legislation to extend certain medicare community nursing organization \n                         demonstration projects\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation \nwhich will extend Medicare funding for Community Nursing Organization \n(CNO) demonstration projects within the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. These CNO programs are intended to reduce the breakup \nin the delivery of health care services, to reduce the use of costly \nemergency care services, and to improve the continuity of home health \nand ambulatory care for Medicare beneficiaries. CNOs are responsible \nfor providing home health care, case management, outpatient physical \nand speech therapy, ambulance services, prosthetic devices, durable \nmedical equipment, and any optional HCFA-approved services appropriate \nto prevent the need to institutionalize Medicare enrollees.\n  In Minnesota, the Healthy Seniors Project provides seniors with \ninformation and services that have provided an extra level of health \ncare and peace of mind. Through various seminars, programs, and other \ninformational services, these seniors have received information on \nlegal and financial matters specifically as they pertain to senior \ncitizens, as well as information on the services available to help them \nfunction and remain in their homes.\n  These CNO projects are consistent with congressional efforts to \nintroduce a wider range of managed care options to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Their authorization needs to be extended in order to \nensure a fair testing of the CNO managed care concept. We need an \nextension of this demonstration project to continue to provide an \nimportant example of how coordinated care can provide additional \nbenefits without increasing Medicare costs. In addition, we need to \nfurther evaluate the impact of the CNO contribution to Medicare \npatients and to assess their capacity for operating under a fixed \nbudget. Finally, this extension will not increase Medicare \nexpenditures. In fact, CNOs actually save Medicare dollars by providing \nbetter and more accessible health care in homes and community settings, \nrather than unnecessary hospitalizations and nursing home admissions.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support these important cost-\nsaving demonstration projects for another three years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Levin, \n        Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1551. A bill to prohibit the importation of goods produced abroad \nwith child labor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   child labor deterrence act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Child Labor \nDeterrence Act of 1999. The bill I am introducing today prohibits the \nimportation of any product made, whole or in part, by children under \nthe age of 15 who are employed in manufacturing or mining. This is the \nfifth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this \nbill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law. I would \nlike to thank Senators Hollings, Dorgan, Levin, Mikulski and Kennedy \nfor joining me in this important effort as original cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that over two \nhundred and fifty million children worldwide under the age of 15 are \nworking instead of receiving a basic education. Many of these children \nbegin working in factories at the age of 6 or 7, some even younger. \nThey are poor, malnourished, and often forced to work 60-hour weeks for \nlittle or no pay.\n  Child labor is most prevalent in countries with high adult \nunemployment rates. According to the ILO, some 61 percent of child \nworkers, nearly 153 million children, are found in Asia; 32 percent, or \n80 million, are in Africa and 7 percent, or 175 million, live in Latin \nAmerica. Adult unemployment rates in some nations runs over 20 percent. \nIn Latin America, for example, about one in every ten children are \nworkers. Furthermore, in many nations where child labor is prevalent, \nmore money is spent and allocated for military expenditures than for \neducation and health services.\n  The situation is as deplorable as it is enormous. In many developing \ncountries children represent a substantial part of the work force and \ncan be found in such industries as rugs, toys, textiles, mining, and \nsports equipment manufacturing.\n  For instance, it is estimated that 65% of the wearing apparel that \nAmericans purchase is assembled or manufactured abroad, therefore, \nincreasing the chance that these items were made by abusive and \nexploitative child labor. In the rug industry, Indian and Pakistan \nproduce 95% of their rugs for export. Some of the worst abuses of child \nlabor have been documented in these countries, including bonded and \nslave labor.\n  Children may also be crippled physically by being forced to work too \nearly in life. For example, a large-scale ILO survey in the Philippines \nfound that more than 60 percent of working children were exposed to \nchemical and biological hazards, and that 40 percent experienced \nserious injuries or illnesses.\n  These practices are often underground, but the ILO report points out \nthat children are still being sold outright for a sum of money. Other \ntimes, landlords buy child workers from their tenants, or labor \n``contractor'' pay rural families in advance in order to take their \nchildren away to work in carpet-weaving, glass manufacturing or \nprostitution. Child slavery of this type has long been reported in \nSouth Asia, South-East Asia and West Africa, despite vigorous official \ndenial of its existence.\n  Additionally, children are increasingly being bought and sold across \nnational borders by organized networks. The ILO report states that at \nleast five such international networks trafficking in children exist: \nfrom Latin America to Europe and the Middle East; from South and South-\nEast Asia to northern Europe and the Middle East; a European regional \nmarket; an associated Arab regional market; and, a West Africa export \nmarket in girls.\n  In Pakistan, the ILO reported in 1991 that an estimated half of the \n50,000 children working as bonded labor in Pakistan's carpet-weaving \nindustry will never reach the age of 12--victims of disease and \nmalnutrition.\n  I have press reports from India of children freed from virtual \nslavery in\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nthe carpet factories of northern India. Twelve-year-old Charitra \nChowdhary recounted his story--he said, ``If we moved slowly we were \nbeaten on our backs with a stick. We wanted to run away but the doors \nwere always locked.''\n  Mr. President, that's what this bill is about, children, whose dreams \nand childhood are being sold for a pittance--to factor owners and in \nmarkets around the globe.\n  It's about protecting children around the globe and their future. \nIt's about eliminating a major form of child abuse in our world. It's \nabout breaking the cycle of poverty by getting these kids out of \nfactories and into schools. It's about raising the standard of living \nin the Third World so we can compete on the quality of goods instead of \nthe misery and suffering of those who make them. It's about assisting \nThird World governments to enforce their laws by ending the role of the \nUnited States in providing a lucrative market for goods made by abusive \nand exploitative child labor and encouraging other nations to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, unless the economic exploitation of children is \neliminated, the potential and creative capacity of future generations \nwill forever be lost to the factory floor.\n  Mr. President, the Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1999 is intended to \nstrengthen existing U.S. trade laws and help Third World countries \nenforce their child labor laws. The bill directs the U.S. Secretary of \nLabor to compile and maintain a list of foreign industries and their \nrespective host countries that use child labor in the production of \nexports to the United States. Once the Secretary of Labor identifies a \nforeign industry, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to \nprohibit the importation of a product from an identified industry. The \nentry ban would not apply if a U.S. importer signs a certificate of \norigin affirming that they took reasonable steps to ensure that \nproducts imported from identified industries are not made by child \nlabor. In addition, the President is urged to seek an agreement with \nother governments to secure an international ban on trade in the \nproducts of child labor. Further, any company or individual who would \nintentionally violate the law would face both civil and criminal \npenalties.\n  This legislation is not about imposing our standards on the \ndeveloping world. It's about preventing those manufacturers in the \ndeveloping world who exploit child labor from imposing their standards \non the United States. They are forewarned. If manufacturers and \nimporters insist on investing in child labor, instead of investing in \nthe future of children, I will work to assure that their products are \nbarred from entering the United States.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I first introduced this bill five years \nago, it is time to end this human tragedy and our participation in it. \nIt is time for greater government and corporate responsibility. No \nlonger can officials in the Third World or U.S. importers turn a blind \neye to the suffering and misery of the world's children. No longer do \nAmerican consumers want to provide a market for goods produced by the \nsweat and toil of children. By providing a market for goods produced by \nchild labor, U.S. importers have become part of the problem by \nperpetuating the impoverishment of poor families. Through this \nlegislation, importers now have the opportunity to become part of the \nsolution by ending this abominable practice.\n  Mr. President, countries do not have to wait until poverty is \neradicated or they are fully developed before eliminating the economic \nexploitation of children. In fact, the path to development is to \neliminate child labor and increase expenditures on children such as \nprimary education. In far too many countries, governments spend \nmillions on military expenditures and fail to provide basic educational \nopportunities to its citizens. As a result, over 130 million children \nare not in primary school.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this legislation places no undue burden \non U.S. importers. I know of no importer, company, or department store \nthat would willingly promote the exploitation of children. I know of no \nimporter, company, or department store that would want their products \nand image tainted by having their products produced by child labor. And \nI know that no American consumer would knowingly purchase something \nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. These entities take \nreasonable steps to ensure the quality of their goods; they should also \nbe willing to take reasonable steps to ensure that their goods are not \nproduced by child labor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1551\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Labor Deterrence Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the \n     Child proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations on November 20, 1959, states that ``. . . the child \n     shall not be admitted to employment before an appropriate \n     minimum age; he shall in no case be caused or permitted to \n     engage in any occupation or employment which would prejudice \n     his health or education, or interfere with his physical, \n     mental, or moral development . . .''.\n       (2) Article 2 of the International Labor Convention No. 138 \n     Concerning Minimum Age For Admission to Employment states \n     that ``The minimum age specified in pursuance of paragraph 1 \n     of this article shall not be less than the age of compulsory \n     schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 \n     years.''.\n       (3) The new International Labor Convention addressing the \n     worst forms of child labor calls on member States to take \n     immediate and effective action to prohibit and eliminate such \n     labor. According to the convention, the worst forms of child \n     labor are--\n       (A) slavery;\n       (B) debt bondage;\n       (C) forced or compulsory labor;\n       (D) the sale or trafficking of children, including the \n     forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed \n     conflict;\n       (E) child prostitution;\n       (F) the use of children in the production and trafficking \n     of narcotics; and\n       (G) any other work that, by its nature or due to the \n     circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm \n     the health, safety, or morals of children.\n       (4) According to the International Labor Organization, an \n     estimated 250,000,000 children under the age of 15 worldwide \n     are working, many of them in dangerous industries like mining \n     and fireworks.\n       (5) Children under the age of 15 constitute approximately \n     22 percent of the workforce in some Asian countries, 41 \n     percent of the workforce in parts of Africa, and 17 percent \n     of the workforce in many countries in Latin America.\n       (6) The number of children under the age of 15 who are \n     working, and the scale of their suffering, increase every \n     year, despite the existence of more than 20 International \n     Labor Organization conventions on child labor and national \n     laws in many countries which purportedly prohibit the \n     employment of under age children.\n       (7) In many countries, children under the age of 15 lack \n     either the legal standing or means to protect themselves from \n     exploitation in the workplace.\n       (8) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment, precarious \n     incomes, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers.\n       (9) The employment of children under the age of 15 commonly \n     deprives the children of the opportunity for basic education \n     and also denies gainful employment to millions of adults.\n       (10) The employment of children under the age of 15, often \n     at pitifully low wages, undermines the stability of families \n     and ignores the importance of increasing jobs, aggregated \n     demand, and purchasing power among adults as a catalyst to \n     the development of internal markets and the achievement of \n     broadbased, self-reliant economic development in many \n     developing countries.\n       (11) United Nations Children's Fund (commonly known as \n     UNICEF) estimates that by the year 2000, over 1,000,000 \n     adults will be unable to read or write at a basic level \n     because such adults were forced to work as children and were \n     thus unable to devote the time to secure a basic education.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to curtail the \n     employment of children under the age of 15 in the production \n     of goods for export by--\n       (1) eliminating the role of the United States in providing \n     a market for foreign products made by such children;\n       (2) supporting activities and programs to extend primary \n     education, rehabilitation, and alternative skills training to \n     child workers, to improve birth registration, and to improve \n     the scope and quality of statistical information and research \n     on the commercial exploitation of such children in the \n     workplace; and\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\n       (3) encouraging other nations to join in a ban on trade in \n     products described in paragraph (1) and to support those \n     activities and programs described in paragraph (2).\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to actively discourage the employment of children under \n     the age of 15 in the production of goods for export or \n     domestic consumption;\n       (2) to strengthen and supplement international trading \n     rules with a view to renouncing the use of under age children \n     in the production of goods for export as a means of competing \n     in international trade;\n       (3) to amend Federal law to prohibit the entry into \n     commerce of products resulting from the labor of under age \n     children; and\n       (4) to offer assistance to foreign countries to improve the \n     enforcement of national laws prohibiting the employment of \n     children under the age of 15 and to increase assistance to \n     alleviate the underlying poverty that is often the cause of \n     the commercial exploitation of such children.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES INITIATIVE TO CURTAIL INTERNATIONAL \n                   TRADE IN PRODUCTS OF CHILD LABOR.\n\n       In pursuit of the policy set forth in this Act, the \n     President is urged to seek an agreement with the government \n     of each country that conducts trade with the United States \n     for the purpose of securing an international ban on trade in \n     products of child labor.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Child.--The term ``child'' means--\n       (A) an individual who has not attained the age of 15, as \n     measured by the Julian calendar; or\n       (B) an individual who has not attained the age of 14, as \n     measured by the Julian calendar, in the case of a country \n     identified under section 5 whose national laws define a child \n     as such an individual.\n       (2) Effective identification period.--The term ``effective \n     identification period'' means, with respect to a foreign \n     industry or host country, the period that--\n       (A) begins on the date of that issue of the Federal \n     Register in which the identification of the foreign industry \n     or host country is published under section 5(e)(1)(A); and\n       (B) terminates on the date of that issue of the Federal \n     Register in which the revocation of the identification \n     referred to in subparagraph (A) is published under section \n     5(e)(1)(B).\n       (3) Entered.--The term ``entered'' means entered, or \n     withdrawn from a warehouse for consumption, in the customs \n     territory of the United States.\n       (4) Extraction.--The term ``extraction'' includes mining, \n     quarrying, pumping, and other means of extraction.\n       (5) Foreign industry.--The term ``foreign industry'' \n     includes any entity that produces, manufactures, assembles, \n     processes, or extracts an article in a host country.\n       (6) Host country.--The term ``host country'' means any \n     foreign country, and any possession or territory of a foreign \n     country that is administered separately for customs purposes \n     (including any designated zone within such country, \n     possession, or territory) in which a foreign industry is \n     located.\n       (7) Manufactured article.--The term ``manufactured \n     article'' means any good that is fabricated, assembled, or \n     processed.

A bill to eliminate the limitation on judicial jurisdiction \nimposed by section 377 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigration Responsibility Act of 1996, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 Legal Amnesty Restoration Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Legal Amnesty \nRestoration Act of 1999.\n  This legislation would repeal the limitation on judicial jurisdiction \nimposed by an obscure, but very lethal provision of the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Tucked \ninto that massive piece of legislation was a provision, Section 377, \nwhich, in effect, stripped the Federal courts of jurisdiction to \nadjudicate legalization claims against the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. Through this limitation, Section 377 has caused \nsignificant hardships, and denied due process and fundamental fairness, \nfor hundreds of thousands of hard working immigrants, including several \nthousand in my home State of Nevada.\n  As a direct result of the 1996 legislation, the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, with its hands tied by the 377 language, issued a series of \nrulings in which it dismissed the claims of class members and revoked \nthousands of work permits and stays from deportation. In Nevada alone, \nup to 18,000 people had been affected. Good, hard-working people who \nhave been in the United States and paying taxes for more than ten \nyears, suddenly lost their jobs and the ability to support their \nfamilies.\n  I say to my colleagues that I have met with many of these people on \nseveral occasions, and I have been, firsthand, the pain that this cruel \nprocess had caused. Men and women who once knew the dignity of a \ndecent, legal wage have been forced to seek work underground in the \neffort to make ends meet. Families who lived in homes have been \ndisrupted by an inability to pay the mortgage. Parents who had \nfulfilled dreams of sending their children to college have seen those \ndreams turn into nightmares. Children who know that something is \ndesperately wrong by the simple fact that Mom and Dad have not been \nworking for almost a year.\n  Mr. President, allow me to add a brief history of what has caused \nthese most unfortunate consequences. During the 99th Congress, we \npassed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This law \nprovided a one-time opportunity for certain aliens already in the \nUnited States who met specific criteria to legalize their status. In \norder to do so, these aliens had to show that they had resided \ncontinuously in the United States since January 1, 1982.\n  The statute established a one-year period from May of 1987 to May of \n1988, during which the INS was directed to accept and adjudicate \napplications from persons who wished to legalize their status. In \nimplementing the congressionally-mandated legislation program, however, \nthe INS created new criteria and a number of eligibility rules that \nwere nowhere to be found in the 1986 legislation. The result was that \nthousands of persons who were in fact eligible for legalization were \ntold they were ineligible or were blocked from filing legislation \napplications.\n  Several class-action lawsuits were initiated, and several federal \ndistrict courts entered interim relief orders blocking deportations \nwhile the additional INS restrictions were debated in the courts. These \norders also typically required the INS to grant class members temporary \nemployment authorization pending a final resolution of the legal cases. \nHowever, by the time the Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that the INS had \nindeed contravened the 1986 legislation, the one-year period for \napplying for legalization had obviously passed.\n  The Court, therefore, divided these people into three different \nclasses for the purposes of determining their standing to sue for the \nopportunity to submit a legalization application. These Classes are \nsummarized as follows:\n  Class I: Class members who actually attempted to file applications \nwith the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but were physically \nprevented from doing so. This policy has led to the term ``front-\ndesked'' class members.\n  Class II: Class members who did not actually attempt to file an \napplication, but for whom the INS's ``front-desking'' policy was a \n``substantial cause'' for their failure to apply.\n  Class III: Class members who were discouraged from even visiting an \nINS office because of the INS's very publicized effort at misinforming \nthem that they were ineligible and should not even apply.\n  While conceding that it had unlawfully narrowed eligibility for \nlegalization, the INS was clearly dissatisfied with the Supreme Court \ndecision. Consequently, the agency employed a different, much more \nclever approach. Rather than affording the people within these classes \ndue process of law, the INS succeeded in slipping an obscure amendment \ninto the massive 1996 Illegal Immigrant Reform and Responsibility Act \nwhich, in effect, stripped the federal courts of their jurisdiction \nover the claims of Class II and Class III\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\nmembers. That provision was Section 377, and is now, unfortunately, the \nlaw of the land.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, my legislation would repeal \nSection 377 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act of \n1996. This course of action would allow the courts, including those \nwith the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals where Nevada is situated, to \nreinstate the work permits which were revoked effective September 30, \n1998. The restoration of these work permits is critical, for it would \nallow those immigrants who satisfy the specified criteria to \nfinancially support themselves and their families through legal \nemployment while they seek legalized status.\n  In order to ensure that the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nimplements the legalization program mandated by the Congress in 1986, \nmy legislation would change the date of registry from 1973 to 1984. \nThose immigrants who were wrongfully denied the opportunity to legalize \ntheir status will finally be afforded that which they deserved thirteen \nyears ago. Ironically, it was also during 1986 that the Congress last \nchanged the date of registry.\n  Making this change, quite simply, just makes sense. We changed the \ndate in 1986 because we recognized that undocumented immigrants who had \nbeen in the United States continuously for more than fifteen years were \nhighly unlikely to leave. Furthermore, illegal, undocumented immigrants \ndo not pay their fair share of taxes. This was precisely the rationale \nconsidered by the 99th Congress when it debated and passed the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986; legislation intentionally \ncircumvented by the INS.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation would extend the date of \nregistry through 1990 for a narrow class of persons who have been \nsubjected to fraudulent or illegal activity on the part of INS \nofficials or employees. This aspect of my bill is very important to the \nimmigrant community in Nevada as several local INS officials have been \nconvicted, indicted and/or accused of illegal activity in the process \nof granting or denying benefits to immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I don't pretend that my legislation will solve all the \nproblems of our immigration and legalization procedures. However, there \ncomes a time when a strong, moral government of the people must make \nevery effort to correct the mistakes of the past. My legislation simply \nrecognizes that the United States government, through the Immigration \nand Naturalization Services, made some serious errors which, in the \nname of due process and fundamental fairness, must be remedied.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1555. A bill to provide sufficient funds for the research \nnecessary to enable an effective public health approach to the problems \nof youth suicide and violence, and to develop ways to intervene early \nand effectively with children and adolescents who suffer depression or \nother mental illness, so as to avoid the tragedy of suicide, violence, \nand longterm illness and disability; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    public health response to youth suicide and violence act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to \nintroduce the ``Public Health Response to Youth Suicide and Violence \nAct of 1999.'' I would also like to thank my colleague Senator Kennedy \nfor joining me as a co-sponsor of this legislation.\n  All too often we read in the paper or see on TV another tragedy \ninvolving our children. These stories about violence, death, and \nsuicide have become all too familiar and commonplace in our nation. \nUnfortunately, the children who commit these acts often suffer from a \nmental illness.\n  As I have said many times before the human brain is the organ of the \nmind and just like the other organs of our body, it is subject to \nillness. And just as illnesses to our other organs require treatment, \nso too do illnesses of the brain.\n  And while we have learned so much more about mental illness and \nmedical science can accurately diagnosis mental illnesses and treat \nthose afflicted, the same cannot be said for children and adolescents. \nUnfortunately, we still know very little about the causes of mental \nillness in children and adolescents and moreover, the appropriate \ntreatment for these illnesses.\n  Before I proceed there is one thing I want to make absolutely clear: \nI am not for one minute saying we should lessen our focus on law \nenforcement or incarceration of convicted offenders. Instead, I am \nsimply saying we might be able to prevent some of the tragedies I have \nmentioned if we knew more about the cause and appropriate treatment for \nmental illness in children and adolescents.\n  Today, suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death among individuals \nbetween the age of 15 to 24 and the 4th leading cause of death in those \n10 to 14 years of age. Estimates show about 1 in 10 children and \nadolescents suffer from a mental illness that is severe enough to cause \nsome level of impairment. Additionally, many parents with a child \nsuffering from a serious mental disorder believe their child will \nbecome violent without appropriate treatment.\n  Beyond the possibility of suicide and violence, children not \nreceiving treatment for mental disorders not only suffer, cannot learn, \nand may not form healthy relationships with peers or family, but face \nan increased likelihood of incarceration as juveniles and adults.\n\n  I have come to the conclusion that we must make a renewed investment \ninto discovering the cause and the appropriate treatment of mental \nillness in children and adolescents. Why is it that certain children \nmay be afflicted with a mental illness and others are not? What is the \nbest course of treatment for a child diagnosed with a mental illness?\n  Everyone acknowledges that there is a critical lack of information in \nthe area of child and adolescent mental illnesses and in particular the \ncauses and appropriate treatment of such illnesses.\n  With this in mind, I cannot think of a better entity to take the lead \nin this endeavor to increase our research and understanding of child \nand adolescent mental illness than the National Institute of Mental \nHealth. The Institute is already at the forefront of mental illness \nresearch and I believe it is uniquely qualified to address the \nconnection between mental illness and youth suicide and violence.\n  The ``Public Health Response to Youth Suicide and Violence Act of \n1999'' simply seeks to reduce incidences of youth suicide and violence \nthrough increased research by the National Institutes of Mental Health \n(NIMH) of children and adolescents suffering from depression or other \nmental illness.\n  By providing for increased research the Bill addresses a critical \nlack of knowledge in the area of child and adolescent mental illnesses \nand in particular the causes and appropriate treatment of such \nillnesses that often lead to youth suicide and violence.\n  The Bill authorizes $200 million for FY 2000 to expand and intensify \nresearch aimed at better understanding the underlying causes of mental \ndisorders that lead to youth suicide and violence.\n  The Bill contains mandatory activities to be carried out by the \nDirector of NIMH that include developing researchers who are trained in \nthe area of childhood mental disorders in order to better understand \nthe development of brain and mental disorders in children, pursue \nresearch into the relationship between mental disorders and youth \nviolence and suicide and to develop effective treatments for these \ndisorders.\n  Additionally, the Director of NIMH will work with the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and other appropriate \nagencies to develop a model to train primary care physicians, nurses, \nschool psychologists, teachers, and other responsible individuals about \nmental disorders in children.\n  The Bill also contains permissible activities the Director of NIMH \nmay carry out that include examining the potential of public health \nprograms that combine individual, family, and community level \ninterventions to address suicide and violence and to identify related \nbest practices. Additionally, the Director may develop and evaluate \nprograms aimed at prevention, early recognition, and intervention of \ndepression, youth suicide, and violence in diverse school and community \nsettings.\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\n  In conclusion, I would simply restate that I believe expanding \nresearch to reduce incidences of youth suicide and violence through \nincreased research of children and adolescents suffering from \ndepression or other mental illness is necessary and I would urge my \ncolleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Response to \n     Youth Suicide and Violence Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young \n     people 15 to 24 years of age, following unintentional \n     injuries and homicide, and is the fourth leading cause of \n     death in those 10 to 14 years of age. Scientific research has \n     found that there are an estimated 8 to 25 attempted suicides \n     to 1 completion, and the strongest risk factors for attempted \n     suicide in youth are depression and alcohol or drug use.\n       (2) There is a critical need for additional research into \n     the underlying causes of youth violence-both suicide and \n     violence against others. 50 percent of parents with a child \n     suffering from a serious mental disorder believe their child \n     would become violent without appropriate treatment and \n     services.\n       (3) A public health model should seek to ascertain ways to \n     identify children and adolescents who are depressed or \n     suffering from other mental or emotional disorders that might \n     result in violent behavior against themselves or others, as \n     well as long-term illness disability, and to intervene before \n     that occurs.\n       (4) Not enough is known about serious mental disorders in \n     adolescents and children, devastating illnesses which often \n     lead to school failure, suicide, and violence. A primary \n     reason for this is the lack of trained scientific \n     investigators in this area of research. It is critical that \n     increased efforts be made to strengthen the scientific \n     expertise and capability in the area of child mental \n     disorders.\n       (5) About 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from \n     mental illness severe enough to cause some level of \n     impairment, but fewer than 1 in 5 of these children receives \n     treatment.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Abraham \nas a sponsor of the INS Reform and Border Security Act. This \nlegislation will remedy many of the problems that currently plague the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. It will ensure strong \nenforcement of our immigration laws, and also ensure that immigration \nand citizenship services are provided expeditiously and with greater \nrespect for dignity of those who benefit from these services.\n  These two missions--enforcement and services--are equally important. \nBoth are suffering under the current INS structure. The services are in \nespecially dire straits. Over two million would-be US citizens are now \ntrapped in an INS backlog. Individuals languish for years waiting for \ntheir naturalization and permanent resident applications to be \nprocessed. Files are lost. Fingerprints go stale. Courteous behavior is \ntoo often the exception, rather than the rule. Application fees \ncontinue to increase--yet poor service and long delays continue as \nwell.\n  On the enforcement side, the immigration laws are being applied \ninconsistently. Detention and parole policies and procedures vary \nwidely from district to district. All too frequently, national \npriorities and directives are ignored at the district level.\n  Many of these problems are not new. During Commissioner Doris \nMeissner's impressive tenure, the INS has made significant progress in \ntrying to address the agency's problems. She has done an excellent job \nunder the current structure. But, that structure has proven to be \nunworkable.\n  The goal of INS Reform and Border Security Act is to put the INS \nhouse in order. It will untangle the overlapping and often confusing \norganizational structure of the agency and replace it with two clear \nchains of command--one for enforcement and the other for services. \nThese two equally important divisions will report, through their \nrespective directors, to an Associate Attorney General who will head \nthe Immigration Affairs Agency. This shared central authority over the \ntwo branches will ensure a uniform and harmonious immigration policy. \nCoordination of the two branches is imperative for the efficient \nfunctioning of the agency, and for maintaining a coherent immigration \npolicy.\n  There is strong bipartisan agreement that the INS must be reformed. \nBut restructuring must be done right. Successful reform must separate \nthe enforcement and service functions while maintaining a strong \ncentral authority for uniform policy-making, clear accountability, and \nfiscal responsibility. The INS Reform and Border Security Act \naccomplishes these aims. The new immigration will be a major \nimprovement over the current INS. I urge my colleagues to join in \nsupporting the INS Reform and Border Security Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, \n        and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1556. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to strengthen the involvement of parents in the education of \ntheir children, and for the other purposes; to the Committee on Heath, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n parental accountability, recruitment, and education national training \n                              act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parental \nAccountability, Recruitment, and Education National Training (PARENT) \nAct of 1999, which seeks to increase parental involvement in the \neducational lives of their children.\n  Mr. President, research, experience, and reason tell us that \nproviding parents with opportunities to play active roles in their \nchildren's schools empowers them to help their children excel. When \nparents are actively involved in their child's education, not only do \ntheir own children go further, but their child's school also improves \nto the benefit of all students. And, as I have witnessed in Rhode \nIsland, and I am sure my colleagues can attest to this in their home \nstates, our best schools are not simply those with the finest teachers \nand principals, but those which strive to engage parents in the \neducation of their children.\n  A recent National PTA survey revealed that 91% of parents recognize \nthe importance of involvement in their children's schools. \nUnfortunately, even as we extol the virtue of parental involvement, we \nmust recognize that reality falls far short of the goal. The National \nPTA survey also found that roughly half the parents surveyed felt they \nwere inadequately informed about ways in which they could participate \nin schools, or even gain access to basic information about their \nchildren's studies and their children's teachers. There are also other \nobstacles to greater parental involvement, such as working parents who \nfind it difficult to get to schools and be involved or parents who have \nhad negative schooling experiences and are wary of entering schools to \nparticipate in their children's education.\n  With 73% of parents favoring a federal effort to help schools get \nparents more involved with their children's education, the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) \nprovides an opportunity to help bring schools and parents together, and \nto ensure parents have the tools to meaningfully and effectively get \ninvolved in their children's education. While the ESEA currently \ncontains parental involvement provisions, they mainly apply to Title I \nschools and students, and have not been fully implemented.\n  That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murray, Kennedy, \nHarkin, and Bingaman and Representative Lynn Woolsey in the other body \nin introducing the PARENT Act. This legislation would amend the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to bolster existing and \nadd new parental involvement provisions.\n  The PARENT Act requires that all schools implement effective, \nresearch-based parental involvement best practices. It also seeks to \nimprove parental access to information about their children's education \nand the school's parental involvement policies; ensure that \nprofessional development activities provide training to teachers and \nadministrators on how to foster relationships with parents and \nencourage parental involvement; utilize technology to expand efforts to \nconnect schools and teachers with parents; and promote parental \ninvolvement in drug and violence prevention programs. In addition, the \nPARENT Act requires any state seeking funding under ESEA to describe, \nimplement, and evaluate parental involvement policies and practices.\n  To succeed in the endeavor of increasing parental involvement, we \nmust depend on parents, teachers, and school administrators throughout \nthe country to work collaboratively to implement effective programs. \nHowever, federal leadership is needed to provide schools, teachers, and \nparents with the tools adequate to this task.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line of federal support for education is to \nincrease student achievement. Parental involvement is an essential \ncomponent to ensuring that our students succeed. This legislation is \nstrongly supported by the National PTA, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin Senators Murray, Kennedy, Harkin, Bingaman, and me in supporting \nthe PARENT Act, and working for its inclusion in the ESEA \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  The being no objection, bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Parental Accountability, \n     Recruitment, and Education National Training Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Parents are the first and most influential educators of \n     their children.\n       (2) The Federal Government must provide leadership, \n     technical assistance, and financial support to States and \n     local educational agencies, as partners, in helping the \n     agencies implement successful and effective parental \n     involvement policies and programs that lead to improved \n     student achievement.\n       (3) State and local education officials, as well as \n     teachers, principals, and other staff at the school level, \n     must work as partners with the parents of the children they \n     serve.\n       (4) Research has documented that, regardless of the \n     economic, ethnic, or cultural background of the family, \n     parental involvement in a child's education is a major factor \n     in determining success in school.\n       (5) Parental involvement in a child's education contributes \n     to positive outcomes such as improved grades and test scores, \n     higher expectations for student achievement, better school \n     attendance, improved homework completion rates, decreased \n     violence and substance abuse, and higher rates of graduation \n     and enrollment in postsecondary education.\n       (6) Numerous education laws now require meaningful parental \n     involvement, including title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), the \n     Goals 2000: Educate America Act (20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.), the \n     Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), and the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), and \n     elements of these laws should be extended to other Federal \n     education programs.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I commend Senator Reed for introducing \nthis important legislation. I am proud to co-sponsor this bill to \nensure that parents have a stronger role in the education of their \nchildren.\n  The first and most important teachers in children's lives are their \nparents. It is parents who help children begin learning about the \nworld. It is parents who provide motivation and encouragement for \nacademic success. And it is parents who provide indispensable lessons \nof character. The central role that parents play in the lives of their \nchildren requires strong parental involvement in education.\n  Involving parents in education increases the achievement of all \nstudents. Research has repeatedly shown that a child with an involved \nparent is more likely to attend school regularly, is less likely to \nengage in violence or substance abuse, and will do better academically \nand on standardized tests. These fundamental principles apply without \nregard to the economic status or ethnic background of the parents.\n  Parental involvement is also a vital part of a child's literacy. \nChildren excel in reading when reading is a regular part of their early \neducation. Students who have a greater array of reading material in the \nhome have higher reading achievement.\n  We know that increased parental involvement works. In Worcester, the \nBelmont Community School has instituted a school-wide reading \ninitiative called ``Books and Beyond,'' which is helping children \nimprove their reading skills and encourage their desire to read. Its \nsuccess is largely due to special workshops and classes for parents, \nwhich emphasizes parental involvement, adult literacy training, and \nstrong parent-school partnerships.\n  The Hueco Elementary School in El Paso, Texas, supports parent \ninvolvement in a number of ways. It offers parenting classes throughout \nthe year, including training for parents to support learning at home. \nIt works to increase communication with parents through a Parent \nCommunication Council that meets monthly. Hueco has also hired a \nsuccessful parent coordinator to help teachers involve parents. This \neffort has paid off. Now parents have a strong role in the school. They \nparticipate in classroom instruction, and they are able to improve \ntheir own education. Average attendance has risen to 97 percent. \nStudents whose parents attend workshops and participate in other \nactivities have more success in school and fewer disciplinary problems.\n  The federal government has a responsibility to be part of the effort \nto enhance parental involvement. The legislation we are introducing \nwill help states and school districts to create strong ties with \nparents. It strengthens parental involvement programs in Title I, and \nencourages schools to use proven techniques for helping teachers and \nparents work together. It also provides support for connecting schools \nand parents through technology, and it increases the role of parents in \nthe Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program.\n  Strong parent involvement will help ensure strong schools. We should \ndo all we can to make sure that federal support for improving public \nschools provides a strong role for parents. By doing so, we help create \nthe brighter future that all the nation's children deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1558. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for holders of Community Open Space bonds the proceeds of \nwhich are used for qualified environmental infrastructure projects, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                 community open space bonds act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Community \nOpen Space Bonds Act of 1999 with my colleague, the senior Senator from \nUtah. This bill is designed to give state and local governments more \nresources to protect open space, preserve water quality, and redevelop \nbrownfield sites. It provides communities with zero-cost financing \noptions for those activities in an entirely voluntary and locally-\ndriven way. There is no Federal land-use planning involved.\n  The demand for these kinds of community-protection and quality of \nlife activities is plain to see. Open space ballot initiatives in last \nyear's elections were hugely successful. States and local governments \nset aside nearly $7.5 billion over the next several years to deal with \nenvironmental issues raised by growth. Smart growth planning ideas are \nsweeping the nation. States are steering their investments to \npreserving open space and encouraging smarter development.\n  These ideas are coming straight from state and local officials and \ncommunity leaders. People are discussing how they want their \ncommunities to look and feel for the first time in decades. Last fall, \na state-wide conference in my home state entitled ``Big Sky or Big \nSprawl'' brought together Montanans from all over the state to exchange \nideas on how to prepare for growth and keep our state ``the last best \nplace.''\n  This new attention to the impacts of growth is happening for many \nreasons. Some claim that transportation planning has not kept up with \ncommunities' needs for choices and access, causing congestion and lost \nproductivity. Some say that building codes and subdivision regulations \nhave encouraged the development of agricultural and open space areas at \nthe expense of existing suburbs. Some maintain that the tax code drives \ndevelopment in outlying areas while urban and downtown business \ndistricts fail. Others suggest that the Federal government's policies \non location of post offices and Federal offices has pushed growth out \nof small and large cities alike.\n  Whatever the cause, growth is exploding across the land. For \ninstance, Los Angeles' land use grew by 300 percent between 1970 and \n1990, while population grew by only 45 percent. In the same period, \nCleveland actually lost 11 percent of its population, but grew by 33 \npercent in size.\n  The problem is not growth per se, but the inefficient way that \ncurrent growth is using today's infrastructure. Some cities like \nBozeman, Montana, have had to resort to impact assessment fees in the \noutlying areas so that the established city's system would not have to \nsubsidize growth away from the already built up areas. The challenge is \nto encourage growth while maintaining open space and other factors that \nmake our communities desirable places to live and work.\n  Because of our quality of life in the West, people are moving there \nin droves. We pride ourselves on having lots of space and we want \ngrowth.\n  But, growth in environmentally sensitive and water restricted areas \nposes some unique problems. We have vast amounts of public land that \nare getting harder and harder to access as growth crowds these areas. \nThat means fewer hunters, fishermen, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts, \ncan use these lands easily.\n  One result of this growth is that the character of the West is \nchanging rapidly. For instance, Montana grew faster than the rest of \nthe nation in the 1990s. That rate of growth, especially when it is \nconcentrated in a small number of areas, concerns people. They start \nturning to their state and local government representatives for action \nto preserve the character of their communities.\n  A recent poll showed that most Americans believe that government at \nall levels could do a better job of protecting and creating parks and \nconserving open space. That same poll showed that they are willing to \npay for such programs and that they view these programs as a relatively \nhigh priority. Leaders at all levels of government should heed these \nresults.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is intended to help \naddress this need. We want to give communities the flexible resources \nthey need to creatively manage growth-related problems at the local \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\n  In developing the Community Open Space Bonds Act of 1999, we started \nwith the proposal included in the Administration's FY2000 budget \nrequest. We have improved upon it to make it more responsive to local \nneeds and to be equitable in its treatment of small and Western \ncommunities.\n  However, the basic idea is still the same. States and local \ngovernments, including tribal governments, can compete for the \nauthority to issue bonds on which the Federal government will pay the \ninterest costs. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds can be used to \nacquire open space, build parks, protect water quality, improve access \nto public lands and redevelop brownfield areas. Up to $1.9 billion in \nbonding authority could be issued over each of the next five years. The \nFederal government would pay the interest costs by giving bondholders a \ntax credit against their income at the corporate AA credit rate.\n  Rather than having Federal agencies making all the decisions about \nwho gets bonding authority, we are establishing a Community Open Space \nBonds Board. This Board will be dominated by non-Federal interest, such \nas Governors, County Commissioners, Mayors, etc. and will be given \nspecific guidance to use in developing application criteria. This \nguidance will stress the need for an equitable distribution of bonding \nauthority to all regions of the country and to all sizes of communities \nand for all the different qualifying purposes. We have also guaranteed \nthat each state or a community in such a state will get at least one \nallocation of bonding authority per year.\n  We think these modifications improve the original proposal and are \nworthy of support by our colleagues from both sides of the aisle. We \nstand ready to work with them to address their concerns and get this \nbill enacted.\n  Mr. President, local governments across the country are looking for \nnew and low-cost ways to maintain and preserve the quality of life in \ntheir area. Community Open Space Bonds are a great opportunity for all \nour citizens to improve the long term health and economic viability of \nour communities. I am hopeful we can pursue this opportunity in a \nbipartisan and constructive way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance the \nsafety of motor carrier operations and the Nation's highway system, \nincluding highway-rail crossings, by amending existing safety laws to \nstrengthen commercial driver licensing, to improve compliance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                    motor carrier safety act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nsave lives on our highways the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999.\n  Every year over 5000 people die due to truck and bus accidents. Since \n1992, violent truck crash fatalities have increased more than 18 \npercent. Large trucks are only three percent of the total national \nvehicle fleet--but 22 percent of all passenger vehicle deaths in \nmultiple-vehicle crashes involve trucks.\n  Whether we share the road with a truck or ride on an interstate bus, \nAmericans need to be sure their nation's roads are safe.\n  Last December in New Jersey, three intercity buses crashed in five \ndays. That accident rate is unacceptable. We can and must prevent these \naccidents with stronger oversight of commercial drivers' licenses and \nthe carriers that operate both bus and truck companies.\n  Mr. President, my legislation addresses our commercial vehicle death \nepidemic with a multi-faceted approach to combating this problem.\n  First, my legislation institutes a strong Commercial Driver's License \n(CDL) program. All convictions for moving violations, whether in a \ncommercial vehicle or not, are put on the truck or bus drivers' record. \nA new applicant must have a alcohol and drug free driving record for 3 \nyears before receiving a CDL. All new drivers would be required to have \nin-vehicle training. It would authorize up to a 5 percent transfer of \nstate's Federal highway funds to motor carrier safety programs if a \nstate does not institute the new CDL program.\n  Second, the legislation focuses on the carriers. All new carriers are \nrequired to have training on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nregulations before they receive authority to operate. To close unsafe \ncarriers, they are required to submit information to target high-risk \noperations and the definition of a hazardous carrier is strengthened.\n  Third, the installation of on-board recorders or other technologies \nto manage drivers' hours-of-service will be required.\n  Fourth, the legislation supports improve data collection and research \nfor safety issues including vehicle safety and driver performance, (2) \nimproved crash data, and (3) driver compensation and safety.\n  Fifth, the legislation funds grassroots safety campaigns to raise \npublic awareness of the importance of motor carrier safety and \ndiscourage drivers from taking safety risks.\n  Finally, the legislation has both incentives for the states to \nimplement motor carrier safety improvements and rewards to the states \nwho improve motor carrier safety fatalities by five percent of the \nprevious year.\n  Mr. President, we must do more to prevent unnecessary deaths caused \nby the lack of oversight of commercial vehicles.\n  With this legislation, citizens will feel more secure about driving \non our roads and highways.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                     TITLE I--MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to establish the Shivwits Plateau National \nConservation Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n\n     SHIVWITS PLATEAU NATIONAL CONSERVATION AREA ESTABLISHMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague Senator \nMcCain to introduce legislation creating a national conservation area \non\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\nthe Shivwits Plateau/Parashant Canyon area of northwest Arizona. I am \nintroducing this legislation to conserve, protect, and enhance for the \nbenefit of present and future generations the existing landscapes, \nnative wildlife and vegetation as well as the prehistoric, historic, \nscenic, and traditional human values of the area. This is a bill about \nthe future, and I think it is important that we recognize the unique \nvalue of this land and its link to our past.\n  I have personally toured this area and was impressed with its vast \nlandscapes and scenic vistas. I came away with the conviction that the \narea deserves additional protective status. The area is remote, yet it \nsupports a few human activities, such as ranching, hunting, \nsightseeing, camping and hiking. I believe those uses can continue \nwithout threatening the natural environment or any historic or \nprehistoric artifacts that may be found in the area.\n  Designation of these lands as a national conservation area will serve \nthese goals by increasing attention to and interest in the area by both \nthe public and the federal government. By spotlighting this area, the \nBureau of Land Management will be compelled, and empowered, to increase \nthe monetary and personnel resources allocated to this area, and better \nfocus its management on preserving and protecting the conservation \narea's unique values.\n  This bill also requires the BLM to develop and carry out forest-\nrestoration projects on both ponderosa pine and pinon-juniper forests \nwithin the conservation area. The goal of these projects will be to \nrestore our forests to their pre-settlement conditions. The forest-\nhealth crisis in our southwestern forests is acute, and efforts are \ncurrently underway by the BLM at Mount Trumbull to address this \nproblem. This legislation builds on those efforts.\n  Designation as a national conservation area may also result in the \nlimiting of some future human activities like mining. There are no \ncurrent threats to the area, so existing traditional human uses can and \nshould be allowed to continue. In this case, protecting the environment \nand continuing existing uses are not mutually exclusive. This bill \npreserves both the land and the traditional lifestyle of the area.\n  Proposals have been made to designate this area as a national \nmonument. Such an action, however, would be done by presidential fiat \nunder the Antiquities Act--that would subvert the public process. We do \nnot want a repeat of the stealthy, election year political maneuver \nthat resulted in the creation of the Escalante/Grand Staircase National \nMonument in 1996. The people of Arizona and Utah, and their elected \nrepresentatives, deserve better. We must have a say in this process, \nincluding the ability to meaningfully review and comment upon any \nproposal to change the management of the area. It is only fair that the \npeople who would be most affected by such a designation have that \nopportunity. I am addressing the need for local input into this process \nby introduction of this bill. The first step in seeking public input is \nthrough the legislative process itself. The legislative process will \nensure that the public has a voice. The next step is the section of the \nbill creating an advisory committee of interested parties to assist the \nBLM in the land-planning process.\n  National monument status for this area would also forever preclude \nany type of mining activity. This would be a totally irresponsible \naction. Let me stress that at this time there are no active mining \nactivities, nor does it appear that any are planned for the foreseeable \nfuture within the proposed conservation area. However, we do not know \nfor certain what mineral deposits may be located in the area, or in \nwhat quantity. We do know that there are some uranium and copper \ndeposits. The nation does not currently need these resources, but \nprudence would dictate that we not lock up these minerals with no \npossibility for future extraction. While we appear to have adequate \nuranium resources for current needs, policy or conditions may change \nand our national interest may be served by allowing them to be \nextracted in the future.\n  This legislation strikes a balance between the desire to preserve the \nland in its present state, and potential future national needs. Under \nthe bill, the lands will be withdrawn from mineral entry under the 1872 \nmining law, but are subject to mineral leasing at the discretion of the \nSecretary of the Interior. This is consistent with the current status \nof other specially designated federal lands such as the Lake Mead and \nGlen Canyon National Recreation Areas. It is also consistent with the \nSecretary of the Interior's segregation of the area. Under the federal \nmineral leasing laws, the Secretary has broad discretion regarding \nwhether to allow mining in a particular area; the amount of royalties \nto charge; the duration of the lease; environmental considerations; and \nreclamation. Thus, authorizing the Secretary to approve mineral leasing \nwithin the conservation area protects the national interest in these \nminerals while also preserving the environment.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this important piece of \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to add gamma \nhydroxybutyric acid and ketamine to the schedules of control \nsubstances, to provide for a national awareness campaign, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   date-rape drug control act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Date Rape Drug \nControl Act of 1999. This legislation will address a growing epidemic \nin our land that is taking too many lives.\n  Mr. President, so-called date-rape drugs are becoming increasingly \ncommon in our nation. These drugs, so named because they are used in \norder to incapacitate women and make them vulnerable to sexual assault, \nare finding their way into nightclubs, onto campuses and into homes. \nThey are being used by sexual predators against young--sometimes very \nyoung--women. The results are terrible and often tragic. Women \nvictimized by drugs like gamma hydroxybutyric acid (or GHB) and \nKetamine may be raped, they may become violently ill, and they may die.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to give just one example of the horrible \nconsequences of drugs like GHB and Ketamine. In January of this year \nthree young girls, none of them yet 16, were at a party given by a 25 \nyear-old man in Woodhaven, Michigan. 15 year-old Samantha Reid drank a \nMountain Dew--a soft drink--and passed out within minutes. She vomited \nin her sleep, and she died. Her friend, Melanie Sindone, also 15, \npassed out and lapsed into a coma, but has fortunately survived. The \nthird young woman, Jessica VanWassehnova, had traces of GHB in her \nblood and only had a minor reaction of nausea. The three teenage boys \nare now facing manslaughter and felony poison charges.\n  These two girls had no reason to believe that they were drinking \nanything dangerous. But they were wrong. Their drinks had been laced \nwith both GHB and Ketamine. Men at the party apparently put these drugs \nin the girls' drinks, to a tragic result.\n  Mr. President, this was a terrible series of events, and one that has \nbeen repeated far too many times. Our young women are being raped and \nkilled by sexual predators using GHB and Ketamine. And that must stop.\n  The Date Rape Drug Control Act will provide law enforcement personnel \nwith the tools they need to fight the date-rape epidemic. It directs \nthat GHB and Ketamine be classified as Schedule I controlled \nsubstances, as drugs like heroin and cocaine are today. In addition, \nthe bill authorizes additional reporting requirements that will enhance \nthe ability of authorities to track the manufacture, distribution and \ndispensing of GHB and similar products. And it directs the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to submit annual reports to Congress \nestimating the number of incidents of date-rape drug abuse that \noccurred during the most recent year for which data are available.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill requires the Secretary, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General, to develop a plan for carrying \nout a national campaign to educate individuals about the dangers of \ndate-rape drugs, the fact that they are controlled substances and the \npenalties involved for violating the Controlled Substances Act, how to \nrecognize symptoms indicating that an individual may be a victim of \ndate-rape drugs, and how to respond when an individual has these \nsymptoms.\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\n  The last provision is crucial, Mr. President, because those who use \ndate-rape drugs depend on stealth in praying upon their victims. Young \nwomen who are on the look-out, who know what to look for and can \nrecognize the signs of date-rape drug use will be at much lower risk of \nfalling victim to GHB or Ketamine.\n  It is time to act, Mr. President, to save young people, and young \nwomen in particular, from these deadly drugs and from the predators who \nuse them. I ask my colleagues to give this important legislation their \nfull support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Date-Rape \nDrug Control Act of 1999 and a section-by-section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Date-Rape Drug Control Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (also called G, Liquid X, \n     Liquid Ecstasy, Grievous Bodily Harm, Georgia Home Boy, \n     Scoop) has become a significant and growing problem in law \n     enforcement. At least 20 States have scheduled such drug in \n     their drug laws and law enforcement officials have been \n     experiencing an increased presence of the drug in driving \n     under the influence, sexual assault, and overdose cases \n     especially at night clubs and parties.\n       (2) A behavioral depressant and a hypnotic, gamma \n     hydroxybutyric acid (``GHB'') is being used in conjunction \n     with alcohol and other drugs with detrimental effects in an \n     increasing number of cases. It is difficult to isolate the \n     impact of such drug's ingestion since it is so typically \n     taken with an ever-changing array of other drugs and \n     especially alcohol which potentiates its impact.\n       (3) GHB takes the same path as alcohol, processes via \n     alcohol dehydrogenase, and its symptoms at high levels of \n     intake and as impact builds are comparable to alcohol \n     ingestion/intoxication. Thus, aggression and violence can be \n     expected in some individuals who use such drug.\n       (4) If taken for human consumption, common industrial \n     chemicals such as gamma butyrolactone and 1.4-butanediol are \n     swiftly converted by the body into GHB. Illicit use of these \n     and other GHB analogues and precursor chemicals is a \n     significant and growing law enforcement problem.\n       (5) A human pharmaceutical formulation of gamma \n     hydroxybutyric acid is being developed as a treatment for \n     cataplexy, a serious and debilitating disease. Cataplexy, \n     which causes sudden and total loss of muscle control, affects \n     about 65 percent of the estimated 180,000 Americans with \n     narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. People with cataplexy often are \n     unable to work, drive a car, hold their children or live a \n     normal life.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nclassify certain franchise operation property as 15-year depreciable \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         Small Business Franchise Property Recovery Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Small Business Franchise Property Recovery Act of 1999.'' This bill \nwould amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to classify certain \nfranchise operation property as 15-year depreciable property.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the recovery period for real estate \nproperty and building improvements was generally extended to 39 years \nin 1984 primarily for revenue reasons. Since that time, growing \nconcerns have been voiced that having such an extended recovery period \nis neither justifiable nor based on sound tax policy. In many cases, 39 \nyears is far longer than the normal use life of the property. Congress \nhas directed the Treasury Department by early next year to provide us \nwith a study and recommendations for overhauling the tax code's \ndepreciation provisions. I look forward to receiving the Treasury's \nreport, but in the interim, I do not believe we should defer addressing \nobvious depreciation inequities. Therefore, I am offering this bill now \nto shorten the depreciation period for real property and buildings for \nall franchisees from 39 years to 15 years.\n  Mr. President, franchisees-such as those who operate quick-service \nfood restaurants generally enter into a franchise agreement with the \nfranchisor that terminates after a set period of time (e.g., 15 or 20 \nyears). There typically is no guaranteed right to renew the agreement. \nFranchisees often must undertake major renovations and improvements to \nthe property at least once during the franchisee period.\n  Under current law, the real estate and buildings owned by franchisees \ngenerally must be written off over 39 years. This extended depreciation \nperiod bears no relation to economic reality and is roughly double the \nnormal use life of the franchise property.\n  The ``Small Business Property Recovery Act of 1999'' would reduce the \n39\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\nyear recovery period for such franchisee property to 15 years. This \nshorter period, which tracks the convenience store precedent, would \nessentially reflect the property's use life. This would be fairer to \nthe small and closely held businesses that operate quick-service \nrestaurants and other franchises. It also would enable them to free-up \nmore capital to expand their businesses and create more jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this \nbill. I would also note that Representative Ramstad recently has \nintroduced a similar bill, H.R. 2451, in the House. I look forward to \nworking with him and others to help secure the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CLASS LIFE FOR FRANCHISE OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 168(e)(3)(E) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1996 (classifying certain property as 15-year \n     property) is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of the \n     clause (ii), by striking the period at the end of clause \n     (iii) and inserting ``, and'', and by adding at the end the \n     following new clause:\n       ``(iv) any section 1250 property which is a franchise \n     operation subject to section 1253.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subparagraph (B) of section \n     168(g)(3) of such Code is amended by inserting after the item \n     relating to subparagraph (E)(iii) in the table contained \n     therein the following new item:\n\n  ``(E)(iv).......................................................15''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to property which is placed in service on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act and to which \n     section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies \n     after the amendment made by section 201 of the Tax Reform Act \n     of 1986. A taxpayer may elect (in such form and manner as the \n     Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) to have such \n     amendments apply with respect to any property placed in \n     service before such date and to which such section so \n     applies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1563. A bill to establish the Immigration Affairs Agency within \nthe Department of Justice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n               ins reform and border security act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the INS Reform and \nBorder Security Act. Today, there is widespread agreement that the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service does not handle either its \nservice or its law enforcement functions well. On the enforcement side, \nthe INS has shown an inability to recruit, hire, and retain the Border \nPatrol agents mandated by Congress. The agency's detention policies are \nat best inconsistent. Its computer systems and methods for tracking and \ndeporting criminal aliens has proven inadequate. And the list could \ncontinue. On the service side, the situation is similarly troubling. \nStories of lost files, misplaced fingerprints, and broken-hearted \napplicants are far too common. Congressional offices are overwhelmed \nwith the number of requests from constituents seeking help with their \ncases at INS. The INS is generally unable to update an individual on \nthe status of his or her case. Any the backlogs have become so lengthy \nat the INS that few can anticipate action on their case, whether for \ncitizenship or adjustment of status, within 18 months. The system is \nbroken.\n  In the February 1999 Government Performance Project report, \nadministered by the Syracuse University, the INS came in dead last \namong 15 federal agencies. INS received an overall grade of C-, while \ngathering grades of D in both management and human resources, and C in \ninformation technology. These grades were perhaps generous. A DOJ \nInspector General report recently concluded that the INS ``still does \nnot adequately manage'' its computer system and expressed concerns that \nmuch money has been wasted on an $800 million computer system.\n  The current structure of the INS--concentrated in District Offices \naround the country that combine service and enforcement functions--is a \ncause of a number of its problems. These offices are run by District \nDirectors who are not required to have law enforcement backgrounds. \nMoreover, they can hold their posts for 15 years or more, resulting in \n``fiefdoms'' that make it difficult to improve service or enforcement, \nor for headquarters to receive adherence from the field for policy \nchanges. By combining the service and enforcement functions in one \nentity, the agency has taken on dual missions that in many ways are \nincompatible. Serious problems have resulted in expecting the INS to be \nthe good service provider by day in facilitating legal immigration and \nnaturalization, and the tough ``cop'' by night combating illegal \nimmigration and criminal aliens. This is a point I made in my first \nspeech as chairman of the immigration subcommittee and it remains my \nview today. Permitting the INS to move forward with its current \nstructure and organization only ensures an endless recurrence of the \nsame problems we have seen for years at the agency.\n  The INS Reform and Border Security Act would represent fundamental \nchange. It would eliminate the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \nThe legislation will create a new Immigration Affairs Agency within the \nJustice Department, led by an Associate Attorney General for \nImmigration Affairs, that will contain two separate bureaus--The Bureau \nof Immigration Service and Adjudication (BISA) and the Bureau of \nEnforcement and Border Affairs (BEBA). This will allow for concentrated \neffort and personnel devoted to improving their respective service and \nenforcement functions. Inspections, which has a combined service and \nenforcement function, will be a separate entity within the Immigration \nAffairs Agency.\n  The legislation would also increase accountability by creating three \nSenate-confirmed positions, one each for the Associate Attorney General \nfor Immigration Affairs, the Director of the Service Bureau and the \nDirector of the Enforcement Bureau. The bill would also create the \nposition of Chief Financial Officer in both the Service and Enforcement \nbureaus, creating additional fiscal accountability.\n\n  The bill will ensure the coordination of important functions. \nSpecifically, by ensuring that an Associate Attorney General for \nImmigration Affairs will be in charge, the formulation and coordination \nof policy between the Service and Enforcement Bureaus will take place. \nThere is a risk that without an individual charged with policy \ncoordination, policy anarchy could ensue.\n  The legislation will provide for enhanced enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. Separating out enforcement will help ensure that \nenforcement is sufficiently supported and that individuals overseeing \nenforcement functions possess a law enforcement background. Moreover, \nthe bill would move the Enforcement Bureau toward the best practices of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is considered a more \neffective law enforcement entity than the current INS. The FBI is \nsuccessful in coordinating activities between the central office and \nfield offices and in supporting agents in the fields, which are vital \nfor sound law enforcement. Finally, the bill would require the addition \nof 1,000 more border patrol in fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004.\n  The INS Reform and Border Security Act should result in important \nservice improvements. Separating service and enforcement will help \nensure that those individuals working in the service side understand \ntheir jobs to include the fair, equitable, accurate, and courteous \nservice. In fact, the legislation requires that all employee \nevaluations include the fair and equitable treatment of immigrants as a \ntop priority. The legislation creates the Office of the Ombudsman, \nwhich will assist individuals in resolving service or case problems and \nidentify and propose changes in the Service Bureau to improve service. \nThe Ombudsman can appoint local representatives to resolve serious \nservice breakdowns. In addition, the legislation models the Service \nBureau's organization on the Social Security Administration by creating \nregional commissioners and area directors charged with service \nimplementation. The bill would place statutory time limits on the \nprocessing of temporary visas and visas for permanent residence and \nseeks to ensure that services are adequately funded.\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\n  To improve the culture of employees, the bill includes a series of \nmeasures, including employee buyouts and the ability to bring in \noutside management executives, that are modeled on those passed by \nCongress in the 1998 IRS reform bill.\n  The legislation has already achieved a great consensus, having been \nendorsed by the U.S. Border Patrol Chief Patrol Agent's Association, \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and \nother organizations.\n  In particular, I would like to thank my cosponsors Senators Kennedy \nand Hagel for working with on this important piece of legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to license America's Private Investment Companies and \nprovide enhanced credit to stimulate private investment in low-income \ncommunities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             america's private investment companies (apic)\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation to establish ``America's Private Investment Companies,'' or \nAPIC. This legislation is part of President Clinton's ``New Markets \nInitiative,'' which I am also pleased to be able to support.\n  The New Markets Initiative, of which APIC is a crucial element, is an \nimportant response to economic problems that persist in many \nneighborhoods and communities in our urban and rural areas. These \ncommunities have been bypassed by the increased investment, job growth, \nand income increases that have characterized this unprecedented period \nof economic expansion. Indeed, the areas that would benefit from the \nNew Markets Initiative are experiencing increased poverty levels, \nincreased isolation, and ongoing joblessness and decay.\n  Yet, research increasingly shows that most of these areas represent \ngood economic opportunities for American business. Michael Porter, a \nrenowned business analyst who has written widely on competitiveness at \nboth the firm and national levels, has written that a\n\n       . . . major advantage of the inner city as a business \n     location is a large, underserved local market. . . . In fact, \n     inner cities are the largest underserved market in America, \n     with many tens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and \n     business demand.\n\n  Another group called Social Compact has done intensive studies of \nbuying power in a number of communities around the country. These \nstudies confirm Porter's earlier work. Social Compact estimated retail \nspending power in two communities in Chicago. Residents in the first \ncommunity have median incomes of over $67,000 million whereas the \nmedian income in the second community is under $30,000. Yet, on a per \nacre basis, the lower income community has more than twice the spending \npower of the wealthier area.\n  Moreover, as labor markets grow tighter and tighter, inner cities \nhave the advantage of an ``available, loyal workforce,'' to again quote \nMr. Porter.\n  However, we need a catalyst to encourage business to take advantage \nof these opportunities. The APIC program provides that push. This bill \ngives the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), together \nwith the Small Business Administration (SBA), authority to provide low-\ncost loans on a matching basis to specially constituted investment \ncompanies, called APICs, that raise private equity capital for \ninvestment in businesses in low-income areas.\n  Individual APICs will operate in a manner similar to Small Business \nInvestment Companies (SBICs), a very successful program that helps fund \nstart up small business. APIC will target its investment funds to \nlarger businesses that locate in these underserved areas, with \nparticular emphasis on those businesses that create good jobs in those \nneighborhoods.\n  The APIC program is essentially a private-sector venture in \npartnership with the public sector. The managers of the individual \nAPICs will make the investment decisions according to the program goals \nand criteria. They will have their money, and the money of their \ninvestors, at risk, making the government's loan much more secure.\n  This program requires a very small federal investment--just $36 \nmillion in credit subsidy--to create an estimated $1 billion in debt \nfinancing available. This debt will, in turn, generate $500 million in \nprivate equity per year, or $7.5 billion over the next five years. \nAPICs would use these funds, for example, to help a business establish \na new back-office facility, factory, or distribution plant in a low \nincome area. APICs could invest in the development of multi-tenant \nshopping centers, or in industrial parks. Combined with the New Market \nTax Credit being introduced by my colleagues Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Robb, APIC will help create important new economic \nopportunities in parts of America that have not yet been touched by\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\nthe economic prosperity most of us enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I ask that letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The letters follow:\n\n                                New York City Investment Fund,\n\n                                                   August 2, 1999.\n     Senator Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We are writing in support of a new \n     initiative proposed by the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the Small Business Administration, known as \n     America's Private Investment Companies Bill. We have provided \n     input into the proposed legislation and believe that this \n     bill could leverage significant new private capital for \n     investment in communities that are not fully participating in \n     our otherwise thriving national economy.\n       We established the New York City Investment Fund in 1996 to \n     stimulate business development and job-generating activities \n     across the five boroughs, with a particular emphasis on low \n     and moderate-income communities. Our investors include many \n     of the city's leading financial institutions, corporations \n     and business leaders, each of whom put up $1 million and \n     committed the resources of their organization to support our \n     work. With $80 million under management, the Fund has already \n     invested some $20 million in projects that will generate more \n     than 4,000 new jobs. Most important, we have mobilized the \n     city's business and financial leadership to become personally \n     involved with our portfolio projects, providing business \n     expertise and strategic alliances that are essential for \n     bringing disadvantaged communities into the economic \n     mainstream.\n       Based on our experience, we can confirm that there is a \n     severe shortage of equity and debt financing for largescale \n     projects in low-income areas. Issues associated with site \n     assemblage, brownfields remediation, high construction costs \n     in urban centers, and low property appraisals in the inner \n     city all contribute to the need for federal incentives to \n     stimulate investment in job-generating development projects \n     targeted to these areas. At the same time, many existing \n     businesses operating in these areas cannot attract \n     conventional financing to modernize or expand. We have seen a \n     number of opportunities where our Fund's resources could have \n     been useful, but only if we could leverage additional risk \n     capital from other sources. The APIC program would be a \n     unique source of capital and partial loan guarantees that our \n     Fund could definitely put to work in the inner city \n     communities of New York for new development and retention/\n     expansion of businesses that may otherwise disappear.\n       We urge you to move this bill forward, in conjunction with \n     the proposed New Markets Tax Credit proposal, and express our \n     willingness to work with the federal government to carry out \n     the mission of APIC once it is enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry R. Kravis.\n     Kathryn Wylde.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Local Initiatives\n\n\n                                          Support Corporation,\n\n                                                    July 30, 1999,\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Committee on Banking and Financial \n         Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Local Initiatives Support \n     Corporation strongly supports the proposed America's Private \n     Investment Companies (APICs) legislation and urges you to \n     make its enactment a priority. We believe that APICs, along \n     with their companion New Markets Tax Credits, offer the most \n     exciting opportunity in a generation for the economic \n     development of low-income urban and rural communities.\n       LISC is the nation's largest nonprofit resource for low-\n     income community development. In almost 20 years, LISC has \n     raised over $3 billion from the private sector to invest in \n     low-income urban and rural areas through nonprofit community \n     development corporations (CDCs). Last year alone, LISC \n     provided over $600 million through 41 local programs and a \n     national rural initiative.\n       Each year more distressed communities are becoming ripe for \n     economic development. For example, LISC is involved in 20 \n     major retail projects, at a total cost of $250 million, in \n     some of the toughest neighborhoods in America. Smart business \n     leaders are beginning to discover that these untapped markets \n     offer profitable opportunities. The expanding economy is one \n     reason. More important, though, have been the many years of \n     painstaking work rebuilding housing, removing blight, \n     reducing crime, and restoring confidence.\n       We know from experience that this progress does not come \n     easily. Assembling land and constructing a modern business \n     facility are costly and time consuming, and arranging the \n     financing is difficult. But the payoff for communities and \n     the nation--in jobs, income, reinvestment, services, and \n     social stability--is well worth it.\n       That's why APICs are the right idea at the right time. They \n     would help experienced community developers to mobilize \n     private capital to seize economic development activities. \n     These new instruments reflect what works--markets discipline, \n     private risk taking and decision making, and genuine \n     partnership among communities, business leaders, and \n     government. APICs would have to raise at least one dollar of \n     private equity investment to attract two dollars of federally \n     guaranteed loans. Moreover, the private investors would have \n     to lose their entire stake before any federally guarantee can \n     be called. This structure will generate prudent underwriting \n     without excessive government interference. The APICs \n     structure permits a modest $37 million in credit subsidies to \n     generate $1.5 billion in economic development--a remarkably \n     cost-effective federal investment.\n       I hope you will enthusiastically support APICs and the New \n     Markets Tax Credits. We would be pleased to work with you on \n     this exciting agenda.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Rubinger,\n                    President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S.J. Res. 31. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States granting the President the authority \nto exercise an item veto of individual appropriations in an \nappropriations bill; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the line-item veto constitutional amendment\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the federal budget is prominent \nright now as we discuss the spending policies that will guide Congress \nthrough the coming fiscal years. In the midst of these discussions, I \nwould like to bring up an important issue that many members have \nsupported in the past. I am here today to introduce a line-item veto \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Prior to my election to the Senate I served in the House of \nRepresentatives. In that body I introduced a constitutional line-item \nveto on several occasions. This was motivated by my view that the \ngreatest threat to our economy was deficit spending which is still \nadding to the accumulated $5.6 trillion national debt. As a Member of \nthe Senate, I introduced this legislation again in 1997. This occurred \njust after a Federal district court declared the enacted statutory \nline-item veto, or more accurately, enhanced rescission authority, to \nbe unconstitutional.\n  In 1996, Congress gave the President what is generally referred to as \nexpanded rescission authority when it passed the Line Item Veto Act. \nAll Presidents, beginning with George Washington, had impoundment \nauthority similar to what the Line Item Veto Act intended until \nCongress limited rescission authority in 1974 under the Impoundment \nControl Act.\n  Ultimately the Supreme Court upheld the district court ruling in \nClinton v. City of New York, where the Line Item Veto Act was ruled \nunconstitutional on grounds that it violates the presentment clause. \nNow a presidential line-item veto can only be provided by amending the \nConstitution, and that is what I seek to do with this legislation.\n  Governors in 43 states have some type of line item veto. This is \nconsistent with the approach taken in most state constitutions of \nproviding a greater level of detail concerning the budget process than \nis contained in the U.S. Constitution. In my view, the line item veto \nhas been an important factor in the more responsible budgeting that \noccurs at the state level.\n  Colorado gives line item veto authority to the governor, and that \npower, along with a balanced budget requirement in the state \nconstitution, has worked well and insured that Colorado has been \ngoverned in a fiscally responsible manner regardless of who served in \nthe legislature or in the governor's office.\n  I believe it is time that we take the approach of the states. In \norder to do this we must enact a Constitutional Amendment. Under \narticle I, section 7 of the Constitution, the President's veto \nauthority has been interpreted to mean that he must sign or veto an \nentire piece of legislation.\n  The Constitution reads: ``Every Bill which shall have passed the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \nLaw, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve \nhe shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to \nthat House in which it shall have originated, *  *  *'' this section \nthen proceeds to outline the procedures by which Congress may override \nthis veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses.\n  The amendment that I am introducing today amends this language as it \npertains to appropriations bills. It specifically provides that the \nPresident shall have the power to disapprove any appropriation of an \nappropriations bill at the time the President approves the bill.\n  This change will make explicit that the President is no longer \nconfined to\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\neither vetoing or signing an entire bill, but that he may choose to \nsingle out certain appropriations for veto and still sign a portion of \nthe bill.\n  A constitutional amendment ensuring that the President has line-item \nveto authority over congressional spending bills is an important tool \nin our continuing efforts to restore fiscal responsibility to the \nFederal government.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to further discussion on this important \nissue. We must seriously consider a constitutional amendment to allow \nthe line item veto, and I hope that my colleagues will support this \namendment or similar language in the Senate.\n\n

Res. 52\n\n       Whereas the Internet has become a highly valued tool for \n     millions of people in the United States and promises to be an \n     integral component of international commerce communications;\n       Whereas the Internet has spurred entirely new industries \n     dominated by the United States and has become critical to the \n     continued growth of our economy;\n       Whereas emerging telecommunications technologies promise to \n     extend the benefits of the Internet to a growing percentage \n     of the world population;\n       Whereas the Internet should remain tax-free;\n       Whereas any global tax collected by the United Nations \n     would present a threat to the sovereignty of the United \n     States and would violate the United States Constitution;\n       Whereas Americans are by far the greatest users of the \n     Internet and would thus be disproportionately affected by any \n     global Internet tax;\n       Whereas the most effective and just way to spread \n     technology and wealth is through the operation of a free \n     market;\n       Whereas the rapidly increasing sophistication and \n     decreasing cost of telecommunications and computing products \n     and services should not be disturbed; and\n       Whereas the United Nations Development Programme's Human \n     Development Report 1999 proposed that a so-called ``bit tax'' \n     be levied on all data sent through the Internet: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress urges the Administration to \n     protect the sovereignty of the United States by aggressively \n     opposing the global ``bit tax'' proposed in the Human \n     Development Report 1999 published by the United Nations \n     Development Programme.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President. I stand before this body today to \nstrongly oppose any attempt made by the United Nations to tax the \nAmerican people. In its recently released Human Development Report, a \nproposal was included that would impose a one cent tax on Internet e-\nmail. This proposed tax would violate every virtue of the American \npeople. The United States should not be subjected to an internationally \nlevied tax.\n  The United States was founded on the principle of ``no taxation \nwithout representation.'' John Locke said, ``If any one shall claim a \npower to lay and levy taxes on the people, . . . without  . . . consent \nof the people, he thereby  . . . subverts the end of government.'' \nConsent, according to Locke, could only be given by a majority of the \npeople, ``either by themselves or their representatives chosen by \nthem.'' Among the first powers that the Constitution gave to the \nCongress, the government's most representative branch, was the power to \ntax. And, notably, bills to raise revenue must originate in the House \nof Representatives. The United Nations does not hold the power, \nauthority or right to levy taxes on the American people. This tax would \nbe in direct violation of American sovereignty.\n  There are currently 150 million Internet users in the world, 80 \npercent reside in the United States. Therefore, the United States would \nbear the biggest burden of this proposed tax. The American people are \nalready overtaxed by the U.S. government, without being subjected to a \ntax imposed by the United Nations. By 2001, this number is expected to \ngrow to approximately 700 million. If imposed, this tax would raise an \nestimated $70 billion in tax revenue annually, in addition to the \nUnited States' share of the UN's regular budget of $298 million. Mr. \nPresident, I firmly believe the Internet should be allowed to progress \nwithout government involvement or taxation. Instead of trying to tax \nthe Internet we should be taking every action necessary to encourage \nits development.\n  Mr. President, the American people are constantly burdened by the \naffects of local, state, and federal taxes. Last week alone, we \nhistorically voted to give the American people a reprieve, cutting \ntaxes by $792 billion. The American people do not deserve this unfair \nand unjust tax. The Internet and e-mail are possibly the greatest \ninventions of modern technological history. They have revolutionized \ncommunication and have changed modern society.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined \nby Senators Boxer, Mikulski, Akaka, Bingaman, and Sarbanes in \nsubmitting a resolution to condemn all prejudice against individuals of \nAsian and Pacific Island ancestry in the United States, and to support \nthe full participation by such individuals in the political and civic \naffairs of the United States.\n  Given some of the recent reactions and media coverage of the Cox \ncommittee report and campaign finance allegations, this resolution \nexpresses the sense of Congress that no individual or institution of \nthe United States should stereotype an entire group of people and that \nall individuals in the United States, including people of Asian and \nPacific Island ancestry, are entitled to the same rights and \nprivileges.\n  Indeed, over the past several months I have grown increasingly \ndisturbed by some of the reactions and media coverage of the \nallegations of espionage at our national labs and illegal campaign \nfinancing that have called into question the loyalty of Americans of \nAsian and Pacific Island descent.\n  Clearly, any individuals who are suspected of engaging in illegal or \nunethical conduct, regardless of their ancestry or heritage, should be \ninvestigated.\n  However, the entire Asian and Pacific Island community should not be \nstereotyped or impugned as a result of the alleged actions of a few.\n  Throughout the history of the United States, Americans of Asian and \nPacific Island ancestry have suffered from unfounded and demagogic \naccusations of disloyalty. Americans of Asian and Pacific Island \ndescent have been subjected to discriminatory laws, such as the 1882 \nChinese Exclusionary Act and a 1913 California law relating to alien-\nowned land.\n  They have also been subjected to discriminatory actions, including \nthe interment of patriotic and loyal Japanese Americans during World \nWar II, the repatriation of Filipino immigrants, and the prohibition of \nindividuals from owning property, voting, testifying in court or \nattending school with other people in the United States.\n  In light of this history, I am appalled that in recent months some \nhave resorted to negative stereotypes to question the integrity of an \nentire community.\n  In an impassioned letter, one of my constituents expressed, ``As a \nChinese American . . . I ask no more than what is due to every citizen \nof this country, namely, to be treated with respect and dignity. I \nresent those who would question the loyalty of Chinese Americans any \ntime a particular Chinese American is suspected of an egregious act. In \ntheir haste to decry the alleged espionage by an individual, not only \nare these public officials and said media guilty of a rush to judgment \nbut of tarring with a broad brush other American citizens who are \nguilty of nothing else other than having the same ethnicity of the \nsuspect.''\n  Another one of my constituents wrote, ``It appears that China has \nbecome Washington D.C.'s latest scapegoat. The accusations coming out \nof Washington severely damage what could be an excellent relationship \nand are dangerously close to spilling over in this country to an anti-\nChinese and anti-Asian bias against solid U.S. citizens.''\n  These comments should not be taken lightly. All Americans should be \nhighly offended by the negative stereotypes and media coverage of \nmembers of our community who have made profound contributions to our \nnation. Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent have made great \ncontributions to the arts, the economy, the sciences, politics, sports, \nand technology, among other areas. They have honorably defended the \nUnited States in times of armed conflict, from the Civil War to the \npresent. By virtue of their membership in American society, they have \njust as much stake in this country as an American from any other ethnic \nbackground, and should not be held to a different standard.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this resolution and join us in \ntaking a firm stand against discrimination and prejudice against \nindividuals of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry in the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10498-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10498-S10499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 54--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  THE AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU STATE MUSEUM IN POLAND SHOULD RELEASE SEVEN \n    PAINTINGS BY AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR DINA BABBITT MADE WHILE SHE WAS \n  IMPRISONED THERE, AND THAT THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND \n  POLAND SHOULD FACILITATE THE RETURN OF DINA BABBIT'S ARTWORK TO HER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Helms): submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S.

Res. 175\n\n       Whereas NATO, the only military alliance with both real \n     defense capabilities and a transatlantic membership, has \n     successfully defended the territory and interests of its \n     members over the last 50 years, prevailed in the Cold War, \n     and continues to make a vital contribution to the promotion \n     and protection of freedom, democracy, stability, and peace \n     throughout Europe;\n       Whereas NATO enhances the security of the United States by \n     embedding European states in a process of cooperative \n     security planning, by preventing the destabilizing \n     renationalization of European military policies, and by \n     ensuring an ongoing and direct leadership role for the United \n     States in European security affairs;\n       Whereas the March 12, 1999, accession of Poland, the Czech \n     Republic, and Hungary to NATO has strengthened the Alliance, \n     and is an important step toward a Europe that is truly whole, \n     undivided, free, and at peace;\n       Whereas extending NATO membership to other qualified \n     European democracies will also strengthen NATO, enhance \n     security and stability, deter potential aggressors, and \n     thereby advance the interests of the United States and its \n     NATO allies;\n       Whereas the enlargement of NATO, a defensive alliance, \n     threatens no nation and reinforces peace and stability in \n     Europe, and provides benefits to all nations;\n       Whereas article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that \n     ``any other European state in a position to further the \n     principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security \n     of the North Atlantic area'' is eligible to be granted NATO \n     membership;\n       Whereas Congress has repeatedly endorsed the enlargement of \n     NATO with bipartisan majorities;\n       Whereas the selection of new members should depend on \n     NATO's strategic interests, potential threats to security and \n     stability, and actions taken by prospective members to \n     complete the transition to democracy and to harmonize \n     policies with the political, economic, and military \n     guidelines established by the 1995 NATO Study on Enlargement;\n       Whereas the members of NATO face new threats, including \n     conflict in Europe stemming from historic, ethnic, and \n     religious enmities, the potential for the reemergence of a \n     hegemonic power confronting Europe, rogue states and nonstate \n     actors possessing weapons of mass destruction, and threats to \n     the wider interests of the NATO members (including the \n     disruption of the flow of vital resources);\n       Whereas NATO military force structure, defense planning, \n     command structures, and force goals must be sufficient for \n     the collective self-defense of its members, but also capable \n     of projecting power when the security of a NATO member is \n     threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members;\n       Whereas this will require that NATO members possess \n     national military capabilities to rapidly deploy forces over \n     long distances, sustain operations for extended periods of \n     time, and operate jointly with the United States in high-\n     intensity conflicts;\n       Whereas NATO's military operations against the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in 1999 \n     highlighted the glaring short-comings of European allies in \n     command, control, communication, and intelligence resources; \n     combat aircraft; and munitions, particularly precision-guided \n     munitions; and the overall imbalance between United States \n     and European defense capabilities;\n       Whereas this imbalance in United States and European \n     defense capabilities undercuts the Alliance's goal of \n     equitable transatlantic burden-sharing;\n       Whereas NATO is the only institution that promotes a \n     uniquely transatlantic perspective and approach to issues \n     concerning the interests and security of North America and \n     Europe;\n       Whereas NATO has undertaken great effort to facilitate the \n     emergence of a European Security and Defense Identity within \n     the Alliance, including the identification of NATO's Deputy \n     Supreme Allied Commander as the commander of operations led \n     by the Western European Union (WEU); the creation of a NATO \n     Headquarters for WEU-led operations; the establishment of \n     close linkages between NATO and the WEU, including planning, \n     exercises, and regular consultations; and a framework for the \n     release and return of Alliance assets and capabilities;\n       Whereas on June 3, 1999, the European Union, in the course \n     of its Cologne Summit, agreed to absorb the functions and \n     structures of the Western European Union, including its \n     command structures and military forces, and established \n     within it the post of High Representative for Common Foreign \n     and Security Policy;\n       Whereas the member States of the European Union at the \n     Cologne Summit pledged to reinforce their capabilities in \n     intelligence, strategic transport, and command and control; \n     and\n       Whereas the European Union's decisions at its June 3, 1999 \n     Cologne summit indicate a new determination of European \n     states to develop a European Security and Defense Identity \n     featuring strengthened defense capabilities to address \n     regional conflicts and crisis management: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD NATO.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) regards the political independence and territorial \n     integrity of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern \n     Europe as vital to European peace and security and, thus, to \n     the interests of the United States;\n       (2) endorses the commitment of the North Atlantic Council \n     that NATO will remain open to the accession of further \n     members in accordance with Article 10 of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty;\n       (3) endorses the Alliance's decision to implement the \n     Membership Action Plan as a means to further enhance the \n     readiness of those European democracies seeking NATO \n     membership to bear the responsibilities and burdens of \n     membership;\n       (4) believes all NATO members should commit to improving \n     their respective defense capabilities so that NATO can \n     project power decisively within and outside NATO borders in a \n     manner that achieves transatlantic parity in power projection \n     capabilities and facilitates equitable burdensharing among \n     NATO members; and\n       (5) endorses NATO's decision to launch the Defense \n     Capabilities Initiative, intended to improve the defense \n     capabilities of the European Allies, particularly the \n     deployability, mobility, sustainability, and interoperability \n     of these European forces.\n       (b) Further Sense of the Senate.--It is further the sense \n     of the Senate that--\n       (1) the North Atlantic Council should pace, not pause, the \n     process of NATO enlargement by extending an invitation of \n     membership to those states able to meet the guidelines \n     established by the 1995 NATO Study on Enlargement and should \n     do so on a country-by-country basis;\n       (2) the North Atlantic Council in the course of its \n     December 1999 Ministerial meeting should initiate a formal \n     review of all pending applications for NATO membership in \n     order to establish the degree to which such applications \n     conform to the guidelines for membership established by the \n     1995 NATO Study on Enlargement;\n       (3) the results of this formal review should be presented \n     to the membership of the North Atlantic Council in May 2000 \n     with recommendations concerning enlargement;\n       (4) NATO should assess potential applicants for NATO \n     membership on a continual basis;\n       (5) the President, the Secretary of State, and the \n     Secretary of Defense should fully use their offices to \n     encourage the NATO allies of the United States to commit the \n     resources necessary to upgrade their capabilities to rapidly \n     deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for \n     extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the United \n     States in high-intensity conflicts, thus making them \n     effective partners of the United States in supporting mutual \n     interests;\n       (6) improved European military capabilities, not new \n     institutions, are the key to a vibrant and more influential \n     European Security and Defense Identity within NATO;\n       (7) NATO should be the primary institution through which \n     European and North American allies address security issues of \n     transatlantic concern;\n       (8) the European Union must implement its Cologne Summit \n     decisions concerning its Common Foreign and Security Policy \n     in a manner that will ensure that non-WEU NATO allies, \n     including Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, \n     Iceland, Norway, Poland, Turkey, and the United States, will \n     not be discriminated against, but will be fully involved when \n     the European Union addresses issues affecting their security \n     interests;\n       (9) the European Union's implementation of the Cologne \n     summit decisions should not promote a strategic perspective \n     on transatlantic security issues that conflicts with that \n     promoted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       (10) the European Union's implementation of its Cologne \n     summit decisions should not promote unnecessary duplication \n     of the resources and capabilities provided by NATO; and\n       (11) the European Union's implementation of its Cologne \n     summit decisions should not promote a decline in the military \n     resources that European allies contribute to NATO,\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\n     but should instead promote the complete fulfillment of their \n     respective force commitments to the Alliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10500-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 176--EXPRESSING THE APPRECIATION OF THE SENATE FOR \n  THE SERVICE OF UNITED STATES ARMY PERSONNEL WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN \n    SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY IN AN ANTIDRUG MISSION IN COLOMBIA AND \n  EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO THE FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES OF SUCH PERSONNEL\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Frist, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Bennett, and Mrs. Hutchison) \nsubmitted the following resolution;

Res. 177\n\n       Whereas alcohol and drug addiction is a devastating disease \n     that can destroy lives and communities.\n       Whereas the direct and indirect costs of alcohol and drug \n     addiction cost the United States more than $246,000,000,000 \n     each year.\n       Whereas scientific evidence demonstrates the crucial role \n     that treatment plays in restoring those suffering from \n     alcohol and drug addiction to more productive lives.\n       Whereas the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     recognized that 73 percent of people who currently use \n     illicit drugs in the United States are employed and that the \n     effort business invests in substance abuse treatment will be \n     rewarded by raising productivity, quality, and employee \n     morale, and lowering health care costs associated with \n     substance abuse.\n       Whereas the role of the workplace in overcoming the problem \n     of substance abuse among Americans is recognized by the \n     United States Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business \n     Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the \n     National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \n     the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of American, the National \n     Coalition on Alcohol and Other Drug Issues, the National \n     Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, and the \n     National Substance Abuse Coalition, and others.\n       Whereas the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy has recognized that providing effective drug treatment \n     to those in need is critical to breaking the cycle of drug \n     addiction and to helping those who are addicted become \n     productive members of society.\n       Whereas these agencies and organizations have recognized \n     the critical role of the workplace in supporting efforts \n     towards recovery from addiction by establishing the theme of \n     Recovery Month to be ``Addiction Treatment: Investing in \n     People for Business Success''.\n       Whereas the countless numbers of those who have \n     successfully recovered from addition are living proof that \n     people of all races, genders, and ages recover every day from \n     the disease of alcohol and drug addiction, and now make \n     positive contributions to their families, workplaces, \n     communities, States, and nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September, 1999, as \n     ``National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat I will soon send to the desk to proclaim September, 1999, as \n``National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month'', and to \nrecognize the Administration, government agencies, and the many groups \nsupporting this effort highlighting the critical role of business and \nworkplace programs in facilitating the recovery efforts of those with \nthis disease.\n  Alcoholism and drug addition are painful, private struggles with \nstaggering public costs. A recent study prepared by The Lewin Group for \nthe national Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, estimated the total economic cost of \nalcohol and drug abuse to be approximately $246 billion for 1992. Of \nthis cost, an estimate $98 billion was due to drug addition to illicit \ndrugs and other drugs taken for non-medical purposes. This estimate \nincludes additional treatment and prevention costs, as well as costs \nassociated with related illnesses, reduced job productivity or lost \nearnings, and other costs to society such as crime and social welfare \nprograms.\n  People who have the disease of addiction can be found throughout our \nsociety. According to he 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse \npublished by SAMHSA, nearly 73 percent of all individuals addicted to \ndrugs in the United States are employed. This number represents 6.7 \nmillion full-time workers and 1.6 million part-time workers. In \naddition to the health problems associated with this disease, there are \nother serious consequences affecting the workplace, such as lost \nproductivity; high employee turnover; low employee morale; mistakes; \naccidents; and increased worker's compensation insurance and health \ninsurance premiums--all results of untreated addiction problems. \nWhether you are a corporate CEO or a small business owner, there are \nsimple, effective steps that can be taken--including providing \ninsurance coverage for this disease, ready access to treatment, and \nworkplace policies that support treatment--to reduce these human and \neconomic costs.\n  Addiction to alcohol an drug is a disease that affects the brain, the \nbody, and the spirit. We must provide adequate opportunities for the \ntreatment of addiction in order to help those who are suffering and to \nprevent the health and social problems that it causes, and we know that \nthe costs to do so are very low. A 1999 study by the Rand Corporation \nfound that the cost to managed care health plans is now only about $5 \nper person per year for unlimited substance abuse treatment benefits to \nemployees of big companies. A 1997 Milliman and Robertson study found \nthat complete substance abuse treatment parity would increase per \ncapita health insurance premiums by only one half of one percent, or \nless than $1 per member per month--without even considering any of the \nobvious savings that will result from treatment. Several studies have \nshown that for every $1 spent on treatment, more than $7 is saved in \nother health care expenses. These savings are in addition to the \nfinancial and other benefits of increased productivity, as well as \nparticipation in family and community life. Providing treatment for \naddiction also saves millions of dollars in the criminal justice \nsystem. But for treatment to be effective and helpful throughout our \nsociety all systems of\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\ncare--including private insurance plans--must share this \nresponsibility.\n\n  In observance of Recovery Month, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices has recognized that the effort business invests in substance \nabuse treatment will be rewarded by raising productivity, quality, and \nemployee morale, and lowering health care costs associated with \nsubstance abuse. Moreover, the Director of the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy has recognized that providing effective drug treatment \nto those in need is critical to breaking the cycle of drug addiction \nand to helping those who are addicted become productive members of \nsociety. The role of the workplace in overcoming the problem of \nsubstance abuse among Americans is also recognized by the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the U.S. Small Business Administration, the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency, the \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of American, the National Coalition on \nAlcohol and Other Drug Issues, the National Association of Alcoholism \nand Drug Abuse Counselors, and the National Substance Abuse Coalition.\n  It has been shown that some forms of addiction have a genetic basis, \nand yet we still try to deny the serious medical nature of this \ndisease. We think of those with this disease as somehow different from \nus. We forget that someone who has a problem with drugs or alcohol can \nlook just like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is \nsitting next to us on the subway or at work. We know from the \noutstanding research conducted at NIH, through the National Institute \non Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism, that treatment for drug and alcohol addiction can be \neffective. Through this treatment, there are countless numbers of \nindividuals who are living proof that people of all races, genders, and \nages recover every day from the disease of alcohol and drug addiction, \nand now make positive contributions to their families, workplaces, \ncommunities, state, and nation.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the month of \nSeptember, 1999, as Recovery Month, and to take part in the many local \nand national activities and events recognizing this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10501-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 178--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 19, \n1999, AS ``NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Robb, Mr. Frist, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Mack, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Lott, \nMr. Specter, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Sessions): submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a \nSenate resolution which authorizes and requests the President to \ndesignate the week beginning September 19, 1999, as ``National \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities Week.''\n  It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the fourteenth \ntime honoring the Historically Black Colleges of our country.\n  Eight of the 105 Historically Black Colleges, namely Allen \nUniversity, Benedict College, Claflin College, South Carolina State \nUniversity, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark Technical College \nand Clinton Junior College, are located in my home State. These \ncolleges are vital to the higher education system of South Carolina. \nThey have provided thousands of young people with the opportunity to \nobtain a college education.\n  Mr. President, these institutions have a long and distinguished \nhistory of providing the training necessary for participation in a \nrapidly changing society. Historically Black Colleges offer our \ncitizens a variety of curricula and programs through which young people \ndevelop skills and talents, thereby expanding opportunities for a \nlifetime of achievement.\n  Mr. President, through passage of this Senate Resolution, Congress \ncan reaffirm its support for Historically Black Colleges, and \nappropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMrs. Marilee Smiley of Fenton, MI in recognition of her service as \nSupreme Guardian of the International Order of Job's Daughters. I \nextend to her my heartfelt congratulations for her service.\n  Marilee Smiley is a woman who has consistently demonstrated her \ncommitment to the ideals of Masonry and the International Order of \nJob's Daughters. This exemplary organization is dedicated to instilling \nin young women, age eleven to twenty, the character traits necessary \nfor success as human beings and citizens of our great land. In this \nquest, Mrs. Smiley has contributed her very best, and the young women \nshe has so ably guided have been the beneficiaries.\n  Marilee Smiley has had tremendous impact not only in MI, but \nnationally and internationally. A woman of high principles, Marilee has \nutilized her intelligence, concern for youth, belief in humanity, and \nleadership abilities to serve others through participation in the \nInternational Order of Job's Daughters for forty-three years. As a \nyouth she held various offices, including Honored Queen of Bethel No. \n30, and the Grand Blanc and Michigan Grand Bethel Representative to \nCalifornia. As an adult leader she also held various offices in Bethel \nNo. 30 of Grand Blanc, Bethel No. 50 of Lansing-Okemos, and Bethel No. \n58 of Lansing, including serving as Bethel Guardian of Bethels No. 1, \n2, 50, and 58.\n  Marilee Smiley has exemplified the character traits taught to her as \na young woman in her continuing association with the International \nOrder of Job's Daughters. As an adult leader, she was awarded the \nTriangle of Honor, the highest honor that the Grand Council of Michigan \ncan bestow an adult leader.\n  This fine lady has also held several positions with the Grand \nGuardian Council of Michigan of the International Order of Job's \nDaughters, serving as Grand Guardian during the 1982-83 year.\n  She has continued her service to the International Order of Job's \nDaughters, holding several positions with the Supreme Council. Her \nservices have included several committee offices, including serving the \nBoard of Trustees from 1992 through 1995, and currently serving as \nSupreme Guardian of the International Order of Job's Daughters, the \nhighest position an adult leader may hold.\n  Along with her work with the International Order of Job's Daughters, \nMarilee raised three wonderful children with her husband Ken.

He has served as a Public Affairs Specialist with the Marshals \nService for 23 years.\n  Mr. Dempsey has more than four and a half decades of experience in \npublic affairs positions with various civilian, government and military \norganizations. For twenty years, from 1955-1975, he served with the \nU.S. Air Force in several positions. During the period 1959-1961 he \nserved as a Public Information Officer with the U.S. Taiwan Defense \nCommand. He later served a tour of duty in South Vietnam as Director of \nInformation for all U.S. rescue and recovery activities. From 1968-1972 \nhe served on the staff of the Secretary of the Air Force.\n  In late 1976, Mr. Dempsey joined the U.S. Marshals Service as a \nPublic Affairs Specialist. In that capacity, he implemented a public \naffairs strategy for the agency, advised senior officials on public \ninformation aspects of major operational matters, and was frequently \nthe agency's spokesman to the media. His extensive experience with \nnational, regional, and local media organizations has benefitted the \nMarshals Service and the American public for more than two decades.\n  Mr. Dempsey graduated from St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, in 1954 with a bachelor's degree in Political Science. He \nalso has completed graduate level study in Public Relations/\nCommunications at Boston University. He resides in Fairfax, Virginia, \nnear the Arlington headquarters of the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  I am honoring Mr. Dempsey on the Senate floor today as a way of \nthanking him for his service to the law enforcement community, the \npublic affairs community, and our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10508-4", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10508-S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HOPE ANDERSON\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Hope \nAnderson. Hope is a constituent of mine and recently graduated as the \nvaledictorian at Lake City High School in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Her \nvaledictory address touched many of those who heard it, so I would like \nto take a minute of the Senate's time to enter the text of her speech \ninto the Record.\n       A pair of laughing teenage boys gunned down fourteen \n     students and one teacher in Littleton, Colorado a few weeks \n     ago. Many of you asked yourselves the question, ``How could \n     such an atrocity occur?'' Now I want you to ponder the \n     question, ``How could this NOT happen?''\n\n       Our nation was founded upon moral principles, but its moral \n     fabric is being ripped apart. Our deviation from basic \n     ethical principles has corroded our very foundations as a \n     country. I believe it is a time to change: when our children \n     are not safe in school; when our society deems it more \n     important to be politically correct than morally correct; \n     when we don't give the needy a hand up and instead force our \n     government to give them a hand out; when the marriage vows \n     ``I do'' mean ``I might''; when the most dangerous place for \n     a baby is in its mother's womb; when political elections are \n     often a choice between the lesser of two evils; when there is \n     no such thing as absolute truth; and when In God We Trust is \n     engraved upon our currency but not on the hearts of the \n     people, that is\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n     when America needs to change. That time is now.\n       I believe that our nation is not in a hopeless downward \n     spiral. If we, as the class of 1999, take a stand and be \n     leaders, replacing the wrong with what is right, we can help \n     to turn the tide in our nation. We must have a vision to know \n     what we desire for our nation, courage to put it into action, \n     and discernment to make the decisions necessary. I have a \n     vision for America: where a person is judged by his character \n     and not the color of his skin; where our politicians are \n     honest and honorable; where our political system encourages \n     hard work; where our people are informed by a media that \n     tells both sides of the story; and where the sanctity of \n     human life is respected as the most fundamental moral value.\n       As graduates, we are nearing a point in our lives where the \n     decision we make will determine the outcome of our lives. As \n     a nation, we are also nearing such a pivotal crossroads. We \n     can transform our society into what it can be, what it should \n     be, and what it will be if we take a stand as leaders to \n     return to our moral heritage and in the words of Winston \n     Churchill, ``Never give up, never give up, never give \n     up.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10509-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 314TH INFANTRY REGIMENT AND 79TH RECONNAISSANCE TROOP, 79TH \n     INFANTRY DIVISION--53RD ANNUAL REUNION, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I speak today to honor the \nSoldiers of the 314th Infantry Regiment, 79th Reconnaissance Troop, \n79th Infantry Division. The 79th Infantry Division landed on Utah \nBeach, Normandy on June 14, 1944 and entered combat on June 19. \nLaunching a 10-month drive through France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, \nthe 79th Infantry Division eventually repulsed heavy German counter-\nattacks and secured Allied positions all the way to the Rhine-Herne \nCanal and the north bank of the Ruhr. As a unit, the 314th Inf Rgmt \nearned the French Fourragere, the Croix de Guerre with Palm Streamer \nembroidered ``Parroy Forest,'' and the Croix de Guerre Streamer with \nPalm embroidered ``Normandy to Paris;'' battalions of the 314th earned \nfour Presidential Unite Citations. Soldiers of the 314th earned a \nCongressional Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Crosses, and Silver \nStar, Bronze Star and Purple Heart Medals, as well as the French Legion \nof Honor in the Grade of Chalier, the Croix de Guerre with Palm, the \nCroix de Guerre with Silver Gilt Star, the Croix de Guerre with Gilt \nStar and the Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star and the British Military \nMedal.\n  Awarding the French Croix de Guerre with Palm to the 79th Infantry \nDivision on July 22, 1946, the President of the Provisional Government \nof the French Republic praised the remarkable unit which displayed \nsplendid endurance and exceptional fighting zeal. . . . In spite of \nheavy losses, it fought stubbornly against a dashing and fanatical \nenemy, preventing it from reappearing in the Vosges. It thus \ncontributed greatly to the liberation of Baccaret, Phalsbourg and \nSaverne.\n  Three years later, the French Minister of National Defense cited the \n79th Infantry Division: [A] splendid unit incited by savage vigor, \nlanded in Normandy in June 1944. Covered itself with glory in the \nbattles of Saint-Lo and at Haye de-Puits. Participated in the capture \nof Fougeres, Laval, and Le Mans, then crossing on the enemy before \nmarching triumphantly into Paris on 27 August 1944. By its bold \nactions, contributed largely to the success of the Allied armies and \nthe liberation of Paris.\n  Most notably,the 79th Infantry Division reinforced the greatest \namphibious assault in modern history in its drive across the continent. \nOn June 6, 2000, the National D-Day museum will open in New Orleans to \nnot only commemorate the landing of America's initial World War II \narmada but celebrate the valiant achievements of subsequent Army \nDivisions. As I see it, the invasion of Normandy in the summer of 1944 \nmade three monumental accomplishments: it marked a critical milestone \nin military strategic history, initiated the Allied victory against \nNazi Germany, and essentially a new era of American military \nleadership.\n  Today, the American soldiers who risked their lives to foment these \nchanges continue to inspire works of artists, authors, film writers, \nsoldiers, and policymakers. In the words of Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright, the United States, has become the ``indispensable \ncountry'' for preserving stability and security in the world. If this \nis true, then certainly these men make up an ``indispensable \ngeneration.'' Most recently, the writings of Tom Brokaw, Steven \nSpielberg, and New Orleans' own Stephen Ambrose have captured the sense \nof American idealism and patriotic fervor invigorating our World War II \nveterans. These men's contributions have persisted decades after V-E \nDay in driving the United States to the forefront of world economic, \npolitical, and technological development. Accordingly, in the post-Cold \nWar era, the United States and its allies have once again faced down \nmass-scale murder in Europe reminiscent of the Holocaust you so bravely \narrested. Our cooperation with Europe has evidently worked once again.\n  As the European Union begins to realize its economic and political \npotential, it is especially essential that we retain our trans-Atlantic \nrelationship which has fostered the most intimate system of inter-state \nsecurity for over fifty years. My state has a particular interest in \nmaintaining ties with the continent from which much of our unique \ncultural and political identity derives. As Louisiana celebrates its \nFrench heritage in its 300th Francofete year, the people of our state \nsalute you, in light of your supreme accomplishments: helping in the \nliberation of France and dismantlement of the Nazi Third Reich, \ninaugurating an era of American preeminence and ultimately, making the \nworld safe for democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10509-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO CHRISTOPHER CUEVA\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nconstituent of mine, Mr. Christopher Cueva of Anchorage, Alaska, for \nhis selection to attend the Research Science Institute's intensive six-\nweek summer program. The program, held at the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology in conjunction with the Center for Excellence in \nEducation, prepares students to be future world leaders, advancing \nscience and technology on every level.\n  Christopher was one of 50 high school students selected for this \nprogram from across the country. All of the students considered for the \nprogram scored in the top one percent of those taking the PSAT exam. He \nshows extremely well rounded extra-curricular activities along with a \nstrong academic background.\n  I am proud to see young people such as Christopher attaining academic \nsuccess at a young age. It gives me hope and faith to see our education \nsystem producing individuals that have the capability to lead our \ncountry into the next millennium.\n  I believe it is important that we congratulate Christopher and all \nthe students selected for this elite program. I also want to \ncongratulate the Center for Excellence in Education and MIT for \ncontinuing their work of advancing our country's work in science and \ntechnology. I am confident that Christopher will take full advantage of \nthe opportunities before him, and again my congratulations to \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10509-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10509-S10510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO AMY BURKE WRIGHT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize \nthe accomplishments of Amy Burke Wright on the occasion of her \ndeparture from the Lake Champlain Housing Development Corporation, \nLCHDC.\n  For 22 years Amy has been working to provide affordable housing to \nlow income and disabled families in Vermont, and she has done it in \nsuch a way as to build respect and self-esteem among those she has \nhelped. Amy has been the lead developer for twenty-five housing \ndevelopments in eleven Vermont communities. I don't know of a single \none of those projects that fit the stereotype for ``low-income'' \nhousing. More than once in attended the ground-breaking or ribbon \ncutting for one of the housing developments Amy has managed, I have \nwished I could live there. From her ground breaking work on the Thelma \nMaples and Flynn Avenue Co-ops in Burlington to the wonderful \nredevelopment of an old school at the Marshall Center in St. Albans, \nAmy has changed the face of affordable housing in Vermont. For that, I \nand the hundreds of people who have benefitted from her work, thank \nher.\n  And it is not just that Amy has brought affordable housing into the \nmainstream, it is how she has done it--\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\nwith a creativity and determination to go where no affordable housing \nprovider has gone before. If a project utilizes an innovative approach \nto ownership, or an organization forms to address affordable housing in \nnew and exciting ways, more likely than not, Amy was there. She \nestablished and directed the first congregate housing project in \nVermont, was a founding member of the Burlington Community Land Trust, \nthe first non-profit in the state to actively promote long term \naffordability and community control of housing, and is a member of the \nBoard of Directors of Richmond Housing Inc. which recently sponsored \nthe first project in Vermont to provide home office space to support \nresident economic development. And these examples only scratch the \nsurface of her work.\n  During one event to celebrate the opening of yet another affordable \nhousing project she had shepherded to completion, Amy gave me a wand \nfor, she said, the magic I had done in bringing some federal financing \nto the project. For all that Amy has done to bring quality affordable \nhousing within reach for countless Vermont families, she deserves a \nsuper hero cape.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10510-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MADELEINE ANNE THOMAS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of a dear \nfriend, Madeleine Anne Thomas, who tragically drowned during a rafting \ntrip on June 22. I also want to pay tribute today to her husband and \nchildren who were with her on that day. I feel extremely fortunate to \nhave known Madeleine as a friend. I know that she will be missed by \nmany.\n  Madeleine Thomas had a propensity for helping people. This desire led \nher to specialize as a lawyer in the areas of domestic relations, small \nbusiness law, and civil and criminal litigation. Her top priorities \nwere cases involving children--she served as the court referee for the \nWexford and Missaukee County Circuit Courts. In this capacity, she \nheard and ruled on all issues concerning child support, child custody, \nvisitation, paternity, and alimony for the Circuit Court.\n  Ms. Thomas was also influential in the advancement of women in her \nfield. She was the first woman president of her local county bar \nassociation and she led the way in promoting equality by showing others \nthat she could accomplish that which no other woman had.\n  Mr. President, I cannot put into words the importance this genuine \nperson had on the people she touched. Her son Christopher's beautiful \nand touching eulogy truly captures the spirit of her loving and \ncompassionate life. I ask to have printed in the Record Christopher's \nheart-felt eulogy, which was printed in the Traverse City Record Eagle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n                         Madeleine Anne Thomas\n\n\n                           Died June 22, 1999\n\n       Traverse City.--The world's greatest mother, most loving \n     wife, kindest daughter and most compassionate lawyer died \n     Wednesday, June 22. Madeleine Anne Thomas drowned in a tragic \n     river rafting accident in Montana during a family trip.\n       Madeleine lived a spirited, sincerely happy life, which \n     started with her birth in Brooklyn, N.Y. on Nov. 2, 1957. \n     After a childhood in which her parents, Jacqueline and Ben \n     Thomas, taught her the essential values of gentle kindness, \n     she graduated from Michigan State University and received her \n     law degree from the University of Detroit. While in college, \n     Madeleine met her soul mate and man of her dreams, Bob \n     Eichenlaub.\n       Throughout their marriage, Bob and Madeleine maintained a \n     constant, fulfilling love. They truly saw each other through \n     sickness and health; in richer and in poorer their was always \n     love.\n       She crafted into being two gentle children to whom she \n     taught the skills of love. Christopher T. Eichenlaub, 17, and \n     Caroline T. Eichenlaub, 12, remember with joy all of the \n     moments of guidance that their mother provided. Whether it \n     was through a heart-to-heart, a philosophical debate, or even \n     an argument, Madeleine always had her children, and their \n     future as individual souls, as her first interest.\n       Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote, ``Give what you \n     have. To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.'' \n     These words sat on Madeleine's desk and this is how she lived \n     her life. She gave all that she could, to any whom she could.\n       During her 15 years in Traverse City, she took in two \n     teens, one as a foster child, and just last year, took a \n     Russian exchange student into her heart. She raised Glen and \n     Stahsy as confidently and as warmly as she did her own, \n     showing them how a family works and how true motherly love \n     feels.\n       While Madeleine consistently showed that her family, \n     friends and spiritual life were her top priorities, she also \n     set up her own law firm with partner Thomas Gilbert and \n     became quite a renowned lawyer. Madeleine served a short \n     period as a rotarian and also spent much time as a Wexford \n     County referee. On her ten year reunion questionnaire form \n     for University of Detroit, Madeleine said that the thing she \n     liked most about her practice was her community involvement.\n       Because of this community involvement, and her work, \n     motivation and persistent work in many fields, Madeleine was \n     recognized and thanked by organizations including: The \n     Michigan Association for Emotionally Disturbed Children, \n     United Way, Women's Resource Center, American Cancer Society, \n     Third Level Crisis Center, State Theatre Group, Traverse City \n     Chamber of Commerce and Crooked Tree Girl Scouts. She wrote \n     articles for both the Business News and the Prime Time News, \n     teaching her readers to be able to negotiate for themselves.\n       Among the many things that she was known for, she will be \n     most missed for her exploding, infectious laughter which \n     brightened any situation, softened any reality and livened \n     any chance encounter. Her laughter brought people in. It was \n     one of her best ways of showing love. Caroline, shortly \n     before her mother's death, said ``Your laughter makes me feel \n     important.'' And that it did.\n       Although a devout Catholic, Madeleine believed in the \n     basics dignities inherent to all religions, races and \n     cultures. She had faith in Christ the Savior, yet \n     acknowledged that many beliefs may be the right belief, while \n     very few could be wrong if the human consciousness was in the \n     right place.\n       Friends may call from 2 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. Sunday at \n     Immaculate Conception Church in Traverse City. A rosary will \n     be recited at 8 p.m. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 2 \n     p.m. Monday at the church. Madeleine was planning to travel \n     to Haiti to set up a medical mission this August. She would \n     be pleased to have donations sent to Mission of Love, 931 \n     Crestwood Drive, East, Evansville, IN 47715 or Women's \n     Resource Center, 720 S.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, July 28, Paul Scott \nHowell of Edmond, Oklahoma was shot and killed as he pulled into the \ndriveway of his parents' home. The apparent motive is carjacking. At \nthe time of his death, Mr. Howell was returning from a shopping trip \nfor school supplies with his daughters and his sister. Fortunately, his \ndaughters and sister were not harmed.\n  On Monday, August 2, the City of Edmond mourned this senseless death. \nIt was clear from the tone of the service and from those who attended \nthat Paul was loved and admired by many. Although I never had the \npleasure of knowing Paul, I suspect that not only have his family and \nfriends suffered a great loss but the entire country has as well \nbecause Paul was one of those people that we all wish we could be like. \nI think Carol Hartzog, the Managing Editor of the Edmond Sun newspaper \nsays it best in a recent column, ``You would have liked Paul Howell.'' \nMr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record Ms. Hartzog's \ntribute to Paul Scott Howell.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                  [From The Edmond Sun, Aug. 3, 1999]\n\n                    You Would Have Liked Paul Howell\n\n                           (By Carol Hartzog)\n\n       Paul Howell's life went full circle.\n       Four-year-old ``Paulie'' was blessed by a security that \n     only a 1950s-era Edmond could provide. It was an idyllic \n     time. Forty years later, Paul was gunned down dead in his \n     boyhood neighborhood last Wednesday. He was a blessed \n     youngster, and through life's trials, has been gifted as an \n     adult. He would in turn bless all who knew him.\n       Despite his death, his testament will live on.\n       Often, the media will make a victim of random violence into \n     a larger-than-life character.\n       But in this case, Paul Howell ministered to so many, young \n     and old. On one hand, he would light up a room with his \n     bounding presence, his boisterous, fun-loving way. On the \n     other hand, in an unassuming way, this 45-year-old man would \n     mentor to those who had fallen victim of the bottle and \n     sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous.\n       Not only was he a recovering alcoholic, but he had such a \n     passion for it that his story will live--and benefit--so many \n     long after his death. He carried the message to other \n     alcoholics, and mentored them through their steps of \n     recovery.\n       ``Paul didn't just use AA,'' his brother Bill told me. ``AA \n     used him to continue to reach out to others. . . . He grabbed \n     hold of it. He was available all the time, and pushed other \n     people into it, and I was so proud of him doing it.''\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\n       ``It takes a special person to let go of that anonymity,'' \n     Bill said. Paul really didn't care. He was so happy that AA \n     had changed his life, he wanted to reach out and change as \n     many people as he could.\n       ``That's the real wonder of Paul.''\n       Paul took AA's philosophy to the ultimate degree--one day \n     at a time. A funeral for an alcoholic often gathers a handful \n     of people. Often, there has been no road to recovery, only to \n     death, either by your own hand or another's.\n       In contrast, Paul Howell's funeral Monday was a \n     celebration--a celebration of one who had triumphed. And with \n     Paul's gifts of an award-winning smile, his sense of humor an \n     his good looks, he helped so many because of his Maker.\n       Because of his hardships, he connected with the youth of \n     his church, relating his failures and his message, ``Don't do \n     to your parents what I did.''\n       Howell's funeral Monday brought people from all the \n     ``walks'' of his life--his boyhood chums, his AA friends and \n     the community of faith that had been there, literally, from \n     the beginning.\n       I never had the pleasure of meeting Paul. But it was \n     evident from the many I visited with that what I have said is \n     true. He and his family touched many lives. His family roots \n     extend to the Land Run here.\n       Sitting next to me was the 80-something year-old retired \n     church organist, who accompanied Paul's mother, Dorothy, and \n     the rest of the choir. The musician watched little Paul and \n     his older brothers grow up.\n       On the other side of me was Larry, a business associate in \n     the insurance industry. Paul would visit Larry's office at \n     least monthly. He has a gregarious nature.\n       ``I expect by now, he's met everyone in heaven and they all \n     like him,'' he said. ``He never met a stranger. Although, \n     last week, he did.''\n       And then there's the teen-ager who was in Paul's ninth- and \n     10th-grade Sunday School class.\n       ``He was really cool,'' Matt said. Paul would occasionally \n     give him tickets to University of Oklahoma ball games.\n       Leroy spoke at Howell's funeral Monday. Leroy is ``A friend \n     of Bill W.,'' as the funeral bulletin would state. That \n     reference is to the founder of AA.\n       Through powerful, audible terms, all those who attended the \n     funeral knew Paul's influence through AA. When Leroy spoke \n     from the pulpit and said, ``Hello, my name is Leroy and I'm a \n     recovering alcoholic. . . .'' I would surmise a third of \n     those in attendance said, ``Hello, Leroy,'' the standard \n     response spoken in unison at AA meetings. You knew Paul was a \n     testament to the power of AA.\n       The diversity of Paul's scope of influence was apparent. \n     The sanctuary was overflowing. There were hundreds lining its \n     walls, in the foyer, the crying rooms and other anterooms--\n     1,200 people in all, it's estimated. The altar area was \n     covered with 25 flower arrangements--the huge kind that would \n     only look small in the setting of a British cathedral. Dozens \n     more lesser arrangements filled in what space was left.\n       Paul's memorial service was also a testament to Edmond--a \n     community coming together to pay its respects to the victim \n     of such a random, senseless act.\n       In the 1950's this then-small town would give Paulie a \n     Rockwell-esque setting in which to grow up. The town's \n     population was 9,000. First Christian Church provided the \n     security that came with that.\n       He and his two older brothers would bound over fences to \n     the neighbors' houses where the Gibsons and the Rices lived. \n     He grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood where many of his \n     playmates remained to adulthood and to adult \n     responsibilities. That's unique in Edmond today, where a \n     third of our population didn't live here five years ago.\n       His youthful years became troubled with normal teen-age \n     problems, drinking being a part of that.\n       Twelve years ago, his life took another turn when he \n     admitted his alcoholism and sought help with AA. That road \n     would take him to a new high, a pinnacle that few reach when \n     struggling with alcoholism.\n       His community of faith at First Christian Church would walk \n     with him. And along that long stretch, he touched so many. He \n     had been given a gift of new life through AA, and he has been \n     giving back over the years.\n       This community has pulled together before--the 1986 tornado \n     that struck our town but miraculously took no lives. The post \n     office massacre that same year that took 15 citizens. And the \n     Murrah Building bombing that took 19 Edmond residents.\n       We don't get any better at coping.\n       But we know, as the Rev. Kyle Maxwell so eloquently stated \n     Monday, that ``suffering got us here (through the crucifixion \n     of Christ on the Cross).''\n       Let's not ``try to make sense out of the senseless crime,'' \n     Maxwell said.\n       ``The `why?' of it is that God created us to be free. \n     Sometimes that's too heavy a burden for some people.'' He has \n     given us the freedom to be compassionate and the freedom to \n     take another's life, Maxwell said.\n       I believe that Christians are to be people of grace and of \n     forgiveness. We are as sinful as the people who took Paul's \n     life. In this case, society places consequences on those sins \n     acted out. But, Jesus said that any sin is just as deadly, \n     even if it is, unspoken and remains in the heart.\n       You are to forgive, for if you don't, anger will literally \n     eat away any energy or beauty that Paul may have placed in \n     your hearts.\n       That's what it's all about. Grace. And if you are not at \n     that point to forgive in your journey, say so. Make a \n     commitment to try.\n       The families of those in jail who are on this side of \n     heaven and going through a worldly hell need your prayers.\n       I believe Paul would have been right there, leading the \n     prayer service for those sinners like himself. He has \n     experienced his own private hell and knew from whence they \n     came.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10511-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10511-S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE MANN GULCH FIRE\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a \nsignificant, but often overlooked historical event in our nation's \npast-Montana's Mann Gulch Fire which occurred 50 years ago today. This \nevent continues to capture the nation's attention because thirteen \nbrave, young men died fighting this fire. LIFE Magazine ran a big story \nshortly after this fire. In 1952, Hollywood made a movie about this \nunfortunate disaster called ``Red Skies of Montana.'' And Norman \nMaclean, who wrote the famous book ``A River Runs Through It'', wrote a \nhaunting bestseller entitled ``Young Men and Fire'' in 1992. But even \nmore remarkable, this single event marked a turning point in the way \nthe federal government fights wildland fires.\n  It was a hot summer day in August 1949, not unlike what we have \nrecently experienced, when a Forest Service Fire Guard, James Harrison, \nreported a small fire in a little, funnel-shaped gulch along the \nMissouri River. The temperature was 97 degrees with a light wind from \nthe north and east. The fire was located 20 miles north of Helena, \nMontana in a roadless area called the Gates of the Mountain. \nParachuting 15 smokejumpers was decided to be the best approach to \nreach this remote area quickly to control this relatively ordinary \nfire.\n  Once on the ground, the smokejumpers joined the Forest Service Fire \nGuard to fight the fire. As they moved down the gulch toward the \nMissouri River, the wind quickly shifted from the south, funneling a \nstrong wind up the gulch. As they got near the Missouri River, a wall \nof fire blocked their access to the river. The fire was getting hotter \nand swiftly moving up the gulch. Retreating back was their only \nsolution, however, it was a hard hike back up the steep rocky slope of \nthe gulch. As the firefighters retreated, dropping their equipment, a \n30 foot wall of fire raced toward them and eventually overcame them.\n  In the end, only three firefighters survived--Wagner ``Wag'' Dodge, \nWalter Rumsey, and Robert Sallee. Thirteen firefighters died as a \ntestament to the power of a fire ``blow up'' which had raced down and \nback up the slopes of Mann Gulch faster than men could travel. Mr. \nPresident, I would like to take a moment to name those thirteen brave \nyoung men who lost their lives that day--Robert Bennett, Eldon \nDiettert, James Harrison, William Hellman, Philip McVey, David Navon, \nLeonard Piper, Stanley Reba, Marvin Sherman, Joseph Sylvia, Henry Thol, \nJr., Newton Thompson, and Silas Thompson.\n  This tragic loss 50 years ago, however, should not be remembered only \nin a somber way. We should remember the many positive changes that have \ncome from this disaster. After investigating the Mann Gulch Fire, the \nfederal government made a stronger investment in fighting wildland \nfires. For example, in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower personally \nopened the Aerial Fire Depot in Missoula, Montana. Understanding how \nwildland fires behave and how to best fight them also increased with \nthe opening of research laboratories in Missoula, Montana and Macon, \nGeorgia. Development of new techniques, such as ``safety zones'' and \nnew technologies, such as reflective ``fire shelters,'' were made to \nincrease the protection of fire fighters in the midst of a fire. These \nchanges were made in large measure due to the sacrifice these thirteen \nbrave men made on August 5, 1949.\n  There is one last step that needs to be taken. Congress needs to \naddress some of the problems in maintaining the high quality of our \nnation's fire fighting crews. Yesterday I introduced legislation which \nwill do that. I trust my colleagues will join with me in supporting \nthis bill to ensure its passage. What could be a more fitting tribute \nto all the brave men and women who have lost their lives fighting \nwildland fires\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\nthan to enact legislation this year to strengthen the quality of our \nnation's firefighting crews.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring these \nbrave men for their dedication, sacrifice, and contributions to protect \nAmerica from wildland fires. To these men who revered honor and honored \nduty, we salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10512-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BRING HOPE TO NATIVE PEOPLE\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to express my support for \nthe 31 Tribal Colleges and Universities that provide hope to America's \nNative communities. The Tribal College movement began some 30 years ago \nand has a proven track record of success as an integral, viable part of \nNative American communities.\n  I believe the Tribal Colleges are the nation's best kept secrets in \nhigher education, and it saddens me to report that the Tribal Colleges \nare the nation's most underfunded institutions in higher education\n  In comparison to the mainstream community colleges and universities \nsystem, the Tribal College movement is still in its infancy. Over a 30 \nyear period, Tribal Colleges have managed to change the social \nlandscape of Indian country, operating on a shoe-string budget while \nmaintaining full national collegiate accreditation standards.\n  Tribal Colleges currently operate on a budget of forty percent less \nthan what mainstream community colleges receive from government \nsources. This is a remarkable feat. Tribal Colleges continue to survive \ndespite these and other difficulties such as problems in the \nrecruitment and retention of faculty due to remote locations and \ninability to offer competitive salaries.\n  Unlike other schools, Tribal Colleges do not receive automatic state \nfunding for non-Indian students since they are located on Indian trust \nlands even though they provide GED, remedial and adult literacy \nprograms for all students, and also doubling as community, cultural and \nchild centers.\n  Enrollment numbers exceed approximately 26,000 students being served, \nwith growth rate averages of approximately eight percent per year. With \nthis growth rate, these institutions must have adequate funding to meet \nthe growing demands being placed on these tribal educational hubs.\n  Tribal Colleges are experiencing an enrollment boom and with steady \nlevel-funding, will actually see the quality of services deteriorate. I \nam supportive of efforts to find and provide additional funds for \nTribal Colleges as are many of my colleagues.\n  Studies have shown that Tribal Colleges significantly decrease \nemployment rates, substance abuse and teen pregnancy in some of the \nnation's poorest communities. More than forty percent of students who \nattend Tribal Colleges transfer to four-year institutions, and a \nmajority of them return to assist their reservations after receiving \ntheir degrees.\n  I would like to cite two examples of many success stories of the \npositive impact of the Tribal Colleges:\n  Justin Finkbonner of the Lummi Nation graduated from Northwest Indian \nCollege in Bellingham, Washington with an Associate Arts Degree. Justin \ncontinued his education by transferring to complete a four-year \nBachelor's Degree in Environmental Policy from the Huxley College of \nEnvironmental Studies at Western Washington University. Currently, he \nis serving as Morris K. Udall Foundation Native American Congressional \nFellow this summer on Capitol Hill experiencing the legislative process \nwith the intention to return to the Lummi Nation, help his people and \none day achieve his goal of becoming a tribal leader.\n  In his own words,\n\n       The Northwest Indian College offered an academic setting \n     and curriculum that no other mainstream institution could \n     offer. For example, one would not receive Lummi tribal \n     history and Lummi language classes at their college, plus the \n     individual attention from faculty and staff to ensure my \n     success. These key differences from mainstream colleges and \n     universities still influence me to this day to aspire to \n     achieve my goals. I had never had that much encouragement and \n     support from this many people to show me that they car about \n     me and my future. I owe a great deal to the Tribal Colleges.\n\n  Another success story: Julie Jefferson of the Nooksack tribe, forty-\nfive years old, a wife, a mother of three, a grandmother of five--she \nhas worked at the Northwest Indian College for twelve years as an \nAdministrative Assistant for Instructional Services. She is currently a \nfull-time college employee working her way through her academic \npursuits. While working in full capacity, she has managed to complete a \ntwo year Associate Arts Degree and still currently working while \npursuing a four-year Bachelor's Degree in Human Services at the \nWoodring College of Education at Western Washington University in \nWashington State. Ms. Jefferson expects to graduate in the Spring of \n2000 with goals to continue her education pursuing a Master's Degree. \nShe is a classic example of the tribal student profile of being a non-\ntraditional female student with dependents from a nearby surrounding \ncommunity.\n  Of the 31 Tribal Colleges, two offer Master's Degree programs, four \noffer Bachelor Degree Programs and many are in the process of \ndeveloping four-year degree programs cooperatively with nearby \nmainstream institutions. Tribal Colleges are awarding more than 1,000 \nAssociate Degrees each year, and these Degrees represent nineteen \npercent of all Associate Degrees awarded to American Indians. This is \nan impressive figure considering the Tribal Colleges enroll only about \nseven percent of all American Indian students.\n  In Academic Year 1996-1997 the Tribal Colleges awarded: 1,016 \nAssociate Degrees, 88 Bachelor Degrees and 7 Masters Degrees. In \nAcademic Year 1995-1996: 1,024 Associate Degrees, 57 Bachelor Degrees \nand 7 Masters Degrees were awarded. Obviously, these statistics from \nthe National Center for Education solidifies the success of the Tribal \nCollege movement by producing graduates--future, productive members of \ntheir communities and of society.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my statement with a quote \nfrom one of two special reports produced by The Carnegie Foundation for \nthe Advancement of Teaching titled, ``Tribal Colleges: Shaping the \nFuture of Native America''. I, again want to reinforce my support of \nthis nation's 31 Tribal Colleges and to encourage my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to offer their support along with me:\n\n       Tribal Colleges offer hope. They can, with adequate \n     support, continue to open doors of opportunity to the coming \n     generations and help Native American communities bring \n     together a cohesive society, one that draws inspiration from \n     the past in order to shape a creative, inspired vision of the \n     future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10512-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10512-S10513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING ANDREW ROTHERHAM\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Andrew Rotherham on his new position in the White House as \nthe Special Assistant to the President for Education Policy. Mr. \nRotherham was formerly the director of the 21st Century Schools Project \nat the Progressive Policy Institute, the think tank of the Democratic \nLeadership Council. Mr. Rotherham has in the past worked closely with \nmy staff on education issues, and I want to wish him success in his new \nendeavor.\n  Mr. Rotherham's appointment also may create an opportunity for the \nAdministration to reform its positions on education. Recently, the \nHouse passed the Teacher Empowerment Act in a bipartisan fashion, 239-\n185. I had the opportunity to participate in a press conference earlier \nthis week at which Senator Gregg unveiled a slightly different Senate \nversion of the Teacher Empowerment Act. Unfortunately, the President \nhas signaled his intention to veto this legislation because it does not \nexplicitly authorize his Class Size Reduction program. I recommend and \nhope that the President will learn what Mr. Rotherham has said recently \nabout that proposal.\n  In his position at the Progressive Policy Institute, Mr. Rotherham \nwrote Toward Performance-Based Federal Education Funding--\nReauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a policy \npaper that in part touched on the merits of the President's class size \nreduction program and the issue of local control of education \ndecisions. In a section of this paper entitled Teacher Quality, Class \nSize, and Student Achievement, he has this to say about the class size \nreduction program,\n\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\n\n       Now a part of Title VI of ESEA, President Clinton's $1.2 \n     billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, \n     illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense \n     of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound \n     policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable \n     and essential; however, mandating localities do it by \n     reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and \n     unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs.\n\n  Mr. Rotherham goes on to state,\n\n       During the debate on the Clinton class-size proposal, it \n     was correctly pointed out that research indicates that \n     teacher quality is a more important variable in student \n     achievement than class size. In fact, this crucial finding \n     was even buried in the U.S. Department of Education's own \n     literature on the issue. The Committee on the Prevention of \n     Reading Difficulty in Young Children stated, ``[Although] the \n     quantity and quality of teacher-student interactions are \n     necessarily limited by large class size, best instructional \n     practices are not guaranteed by small class size.'' In fact, \n     one study of 1000 school districts found that every dollar \n     spent on more highly qualified teachers ``netted greater \n     improvements in student achievement than did any other use of \n     school resources.'' Yet despite this, the class-size \n     initiative allows only 15 percent of the $1.2 billion \n     appropriation to be spent on professional development. \n     Instead of allowing states and localities flexibility to \n     address their own particular circumstances, Washington \n     created a one-size-fits all approach.\n\n  Mr. Rotherham ends this section of the paper by asking the following \ninsightful question,\n\n       Considering the crucial importance of teacher quality, the \n     current shortage of qualified teachers, and the fact that \n     class-size is not a universal problem throughout the country, \n     shouldn't states and localities have the option of using more \n     than 15 percent of this funding on professional development?\n\n  I am hopeful that Mr. Rotherham will prevail upon President Clinton \nto work with Congress to pass education reform legislation that allows \nstates and local communities the flexibility they need to provide a \nquality education for all children, while ensuring that they are held \naccountable for the results of the education they provide. As Mr. \nRotherham states, the federal government should not concentrate on ``. \n. . means at the expense of results . . .'', and should not allow ``. . \n. the triumph of symbolism over sound policy,'' which the President's \nclass size reduction program represents.\n  My best wishes go out to Mr. Rotherham, and it is my sincere hope \nthat he will be able to have some influence with this administration \nand that he is able to convince them that Washington does not know \nbest. It's time we put children first, and change the emphasis of the \nfederal government from process and paperwork to kids and learning.\n  I ask to print in the Record the section from Mr. Rotherham's report \nthat discusses his views on the administration's class size initiative.\n  The material follows:\n\nToward Performance-Based Federal Education Funding: Reauthorization of \n               the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\n\n                         (By Andrew Rotherham)\n\n\n          teacher quality, class size, and student achievement\n\n       Reducing class size is obviously not a bad idea. Quite the \n     contrary, substantial research indicates it can be an \n     effective strategy to raise student achievement. As the \n     Progressive Policy Institute has pointed out, all things \n     being equal, teachers are probably more effective with fewer \n     students. However, achieving smaller class sizes is often \n     problematic. For example, as a result of a teacher shortage \n     exacerbated by a mandate to reduce class sizes, 21,000 of \n     California's 250,000 teachers are working with emergency \n     permits in the states most troubled schools.\n       Now a part of Title VI of ESEA, President Clinton's $1.2 \n     billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, \n     illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense \n     of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound \n     policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable \n     and essential; however, mandating localities do it by \n     reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and \n     unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs.\n       During the debate on the Clinton class-size proposal, it \n     was correctly pointed out that research indicates that \n     teacher quality is a more important variable in student \n     achievement than class size.

While these men clearly are \noutstanding in their home towns, they also have contributed greatly to \nthe freedom of all Americans.\n  These great men put everything aside for their country.

The court may grant injunctive relief to the domain \n     name registrant, including the reactivation of the domain \n     name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name \n     registrant.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate considers legislation to \naddress the serious threats to American consumers, businesses, and the \nfuture of electronic commerce, which derive from the deliberate, bad-\nfaith, and abusive registration of Internet domain names in violation \nof the rights of trademark owners. For the Net-savvy, this burgeoning \nform of cyber-abuse is known as ``cybersquatting.'' For the average \nconsumer, it is simply fraud, deception, and the bad-faith trading on \nthe goodwill of others.\n  Our trademark laws have long recognized the communicative value of \nbrand name identifiers, which serve as the primary indicators of \nsource, quality, and authenticity in the minds of consumers. These laws \nprohibit the unauthorized uses of other people's marks because such \nuses lead to consumer confusion, undermine the goodwill and \ncommunicative value of the brand names they rely on, and erode consumer \nconfidence in the marketplace generally. Such problems of brand-name \nabuse and consumer confusion are particularly acute in the online \nenvironment, where traditional indicators of source, quality, and \nauthenticity give way to domain names and digital storefronts that take \nlittle more than Internet access and rudimentary computer skills to \nerect. In many cases, the domain name that takes consumers to an \nInternet site and the graphical interface that greets them when they \nget there are the only indications of source and authenticity, and \nlegitimate and illegitimate sites may be indistinguishable to online \nconsumers.\n  Despite the protections of existing trademark law, cyber-pirates and \nonline bad actors are increasingly taking advantage of the novelty of \nthe Internet and the online vulnerabilities of trademark owners to \ndeceive and defraud consumers and to hijack the valuable trademarks of \nAmerican businesses. In some cases these bad actors register the well-\nknown marks of others as domain names with the intent to extract \nsizeable payments from the rightful trademark owner in exchange for \nrelinquishing the rights to the name in cyberspace. In others they use \nthe domain name to divert unsuspecting Internet users to their own \nsites, which are often pornographic sites or competitors' sites that \nprey on consumer confusion. Still others use the domain name to engage \nin counterfeiting activities or for other fraudulent or nefarious \npurposes.\n  In considering this legislation, the Judiciary Committee has seen \nexamples of many such abuses. For example, we heard testimony of \nconsumer fraud being perpetrated by the registrant of the \n``attphonecard.com'' and ``attcallingcard.com'' domain names who set up \nInternet sites purporting to sell calling cards and soliciting \npersonally identifying information, including credit card numbers. We \nalso heard examples of counterfeit goods and non-genuine Porsche parts \nbeing sold on a number of the more than 300 web sites found using \ndomain names bearing Porsche's name. The risks posed to consumers by \nthese so-called ``dot.con'' artists continue to escalate as more people \ngo online to buy things like pharmaceuticals, financial services, and \neven groceries.\n  I was also surprised to learn that the ``dosney.com'' domain was \nbeing used for a hard-core pornography website--a fact that was brought \nto the attention of the Walt Disney Company by the parent of a child \nwho mistakenly arrived at that site when looking for Disney's main \npage. In a similar case, a 12-year old California boy was denied \nprivileges at his school when he entered ``zelda.com'' in a web browser \nat his school library, looking for a site he expected to be affiliated \nwith the popular computer game of the same name, but ended up at a \npornography site. Young children are not the only victims of this sort \nof abuse. Recently the Intel Corporation had the ``pentium3.com'' \ndomain snatched up by a cybersquatter who used it to post pornographic \nimages of celebrities and offered to sell the domain name to the \nhighest bidder.\n  The Committee also heard numerous examples of online bad actors using \ndomain names to engage in unfair competition. For example, one domain \nname registrant used the name ``wwwcarpoint.com,'' without a period \nfollowing the ``www,'' to drive consumers who are looking for \nMicrosoft's popular Carpoint car buying service to a competitor's site \noffering similar services. Other bad actors don't even bother to offer \ncompeting services, opting instead to register multiple domain names to \ninterfere with companies' ability to use their own trademarks online. \nFor example, the Committee was told that Warner Bros. was asked to pay \n$350,000 for the rights to the names ``warner-records.com,'' ``warner-\nbros-records.com,'' ``warner-pictures.com,'' ``warner-bros-pictures'', \nand ``warnerpictures.com.''\n  It is time for Congress to take a closer look at these abuses and to \nrespond with appropriate legislation. The bill the Senate considers \ntoday will address these problems by clarifying the rights of trademark \nowners with respect to cybersquatting, by providing clear deterrence to \nprevent such bad faith and abusive conduct, and by providing adequate \nremedies for trademark owners in those cases where it does occur. And \nwhile the bill provides many important protections for trademark \nowners, it is important to note that the bill we are considering today \nreflects the text of a substitute amendment that Senator Leahy and I \noffered in the Judiciary Committee to carefully balance the rights of \ntrademark owners with the interests of Internet users. The text is \nsubstantively identical to the legislation that Senator Leahy and I \nintroduced as S. 1461, with Senators Abraham, Torricelli, DeWine, Kohl, \nand Schumer as cosponsors. In short, it represents a balanced approach \nthat will protect American consumers and the businesses that drive our \neconomy while at the same time preserving the rights of Internet users \nto engage in protected expression online and to make lawful uses of \nothers' trademarks in cyberspace.\n  Let me take just a minute to explain some of the changes that are \nreflected in the bill as it has been reported to the Senate by the \nJudiciary Committee. While the current bill shares the goals of, and \nhas some similarity to, the bill as introduced, it differs in a number \nof substantial respects. First, like the legislation introduced by \nSenator Abraham, this bill allows trademark owners to recover statutory \ndamages in cybersquatting cases, both to deter wrongful conduct and to \nprovide adequate remedies for trademark owners who seek to enforce \ntheir rights in court. The reported bill goes beyond simply stating the \nremedy, however, and sets forth a substantive cause of action, based in \ntrademark law, to define the wrongful conduct sought to be deterred and \nto fill in the gaps and uncertainties of current trademark law with \nrespect to cybersquatting.\n  Under the bill as reported, the abusive conduct that is made \nactionable is appropriately limited to bad faith registrations of \nothers' marks by persons who seek to profit unfairly from the goodwill \nassociated therewith. In addition, the reported bill balances the \nproperty interests of trademark owners with the interests of Internet \nusers who would make fair use of others' marks or otherwise engage in \nprotected\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\nspeech online. The reported bill also limits the definition of domain \nname identifier to exclude such things as screen names, file names, and \nother identifiers not assigned by a domain name registrar or registry. \nIt also omits criminal penalties found in Senator Abraham's original \nlegislation.\n  Second, the reported bill provides for in rem jurisdiction, which \nallows a mark owner to seek the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer \nof an infringing domain name by filing an in rem action against the \nname itself, where the domain name violates the mark owner's \nsubstantive trademark rights and where the mark owner has satisfied the \ncourt that it has exercised due diligence in trying to locate the owner \nof the domain name but is unable to do so. A significant problem faced \nby trademark owners in the fight against cybersquatting is the fact \nthat many cybersquatters register domain names under aliases or \notherwise provide false information in their registration applications \nin order to avoid identification and service of process by the mark \nowner. The bill, as reported, will alleviate this difficulty, while \nprotecting the notions of fair play and substantial justice, by \nenabling a mark owner to seek an injunction against the infringing \nproperty in those cases where, after due diligence, a mark owner is \nunable to proceed against the domain name registrant because the \nregistrant has provided false contact information and is otherwise not \nto be found.\n  Additionally, some have suggested that dissidents or others who are \nonline incognito for similar legitimate reasons might give false \ninformation to protect themselves and have suggested the need to \npreserve a degree of anonymity on the Internet particularly for this \nreason. Allowing a trademark owner to proceed against the domain names \nthemselves, provided they are, in fact, infringing or diluting under \nthe Trademark Act, decreases the need for trademark owners to join the \nhunt to chase down and root out these dissidents or others seeking \nanonymity on the Net. The approach in this bill is a good compromise, \nwhich provides meaningful protection to trademark owners while \nbalancing the interests of privacy and anonymity on the Internet.\n  Third, like the original Abraham bill, the substitute amendment \nencourages domain name registrars and registries to work with trademark \nowners to prevent cybersquatting by providing a limited exemption from \nliability for domain name registrars and registries that suspend, \ncancel, or transfer domain names pursuant to a court order or in the \nimplementation of a reasonable policy prohibiting cybersquatting. The \nbill goes further, however, in order to protect the rights of domain \nname registrants against overreaching trademark owners. Under the \nreported bill, a trademark owner who knowingly and materially \nmisrepresents to the domain name registrar or registry that a domain \nname is infringing is liable to the domain name registrant for damages \nresulting from the suspension, cancellation, or transfer of the domain \nname. In addition, the court may award injunctive relief to the domain \nname registrant by ordering the reactivation of the domain name or the \ntransfer of the domain name back to the domain name registrant. \nFinally, the bill also promotes the continued ease and efficiency users \nof the current registration system enjoy by codifying current case law \nlimiting the secondary liability of domain name registrars and \nregistries for the act of registration of a domain name.\n  Finally, the reported bill includes an explicit savings clause making \nclear that the bill does not affect traditional trademark defenses, \nsuch as fair use, or a person's first amendment rights, and it ensures \nthat any new remedies created by the bill will apply prospectively \nonly.\n  In addition, the Senate is considering today an amendment I am \noffering with Senator Leahy to make three additional clarifications. \nFirst, our amendment will clarify that the prohibited ``uses'' of \ndomain names contemplated by the bill are limited to uses by the domain \nname registrant or his authorized licensee and do not include uses by \nothers, such as in hypertext links, directory publishing, or search \nengines.\n  Second, our amendment clarifies that, like the Federal Trademark \nDilution Act, uses of names that dilute the marks of others are \nactionable only where the mark that is harmed has achieved the status \nof a ``famous'' mark. As reported by the Committee, the bill does not \ndistinguish between famous and non-famous marks. I supported this \noutcome because I believe the bill should provide protection to all \nmark owners against the deliberate, bad-faith dilution of their marks \nby cybersquatters--particularly given the proliferation of small \nstartups that are driving the growth of electronic commerce on the \nInternet. Nevertheless, in the interest of moving the bill forward to \nprovide much needed protection to trademark owners in a timely fashion \nand to build more closely on the pattern set by established law, I \nagreed to support an amendment limiting the scope of the bill to famous \nmarks in the dilution context. Thus, our amendment clarifies that, like \nsubstantive trademark law generally, uses of others' marks in a way \nthat causes a likelihood of consumer confusion is actionable whether or \nnot the mark is famous, but like under the Federal Trademark Dilution \nAct, dilutive uses of others' marks is actionable only if the mark is \nfamous.\n  Finally, our amendment clarifies that a domain name registrant whose \nname is suspended in an extra-judicial dispute resolution procedure can \nseek a declaratory judgment that his use of the name was, in fact, \nlawful under the Trademark Act. This clarification is consistent with \nother provisions of the reported bill that seek to protect domain name \nregistrants against overreaching trademark owners.\n  Let me say in conclusion that this is an important piece of \nlegislation that will promote the growth of online commerce by \nprotecting consumers and providing clarity in the law for trademark \nowners in cyberspace. It is a balanced bill that protects the rights of \nInternet users and the interests of all Americans in free speech and \nprotected uses of trademarked names for such things as parody, comment, \ncriticism, comparative advertising, news reporting, etc. It reflects \nmany hours of discussions with senators and affected parties on all \nsides. Let me thank Senator Leahy for his work in crafting this \nparticular measure, as well as Senator Abraham for his cooperation in \nthis effort, and all the other cosponsors of the bill and the \nsubstitute amendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee last week. I \nlook forward to my colleagues' support of this measure and to working \nwith them to get this important bill promoting e-commerce and online \nconsumer protection through the Senate and enacted into law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \npassing the Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment to S. 1255, the \n``Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.'' Senator Hatch and I, \nand others, have worked hard to craft this legislation in a balanced \nfashion to protect trademark owners and consumers doing business \nonline, and Internet users who want to participate in what the Supreme \nCourt has described as ```a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide \nhuman communication.'' Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997).\n  On July 29, 1999, Senator Hatch and I, along with several other \nSenators, introduced S. 1461, the ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act \nof 1999.'' This bill then provided the text of the Hatch-Leahy \nsubstitute amendment that we offered to S. 1255 at the Judiciary \nCommittee's executive business meeting the same day. The Committee \nunanimously reported the substitute amendment favorably to the Senate \nfor consideration. This substitute amendment, with three additional \nrefinements contained in a Hatch-Leahy clarifying amendment, is the \nlegislation that the Senate considers today.\n  Trademarks are important tools of commerce.--The exclusive right to \nthe use of a unique mark helps companies compete in the marketplace by \ndistinguishing their goods and services from those of their \ncompetitors, and helps consumers identify the source of a product by \nlinking it with a particular company. The use of trademarks by \ncompanies, and reliance on trademarks by consumers, will only become \nmore important as the global marketplace becomes larger and more \naccessible with electronic commerce. The reason is simple: when a \ntrademarked name is\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\nused as a company's address in cyberspace, customers know where to go \nonline to conduct business with that company.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is having a positive effect on the \neconomies of small rural states like mine. A Vermont Internet Commerce \nreport I commissioned earlier this year found that Vermont gained more \nthan 1,000 new jobs as a result of Internet commerce, with the \npotential that Vermont could add more than 24,000 jobs over the next \ntwo years. For a small state like ours, this is very good news.\n  Along with the good news, this report identified a number of \nobstacles that stand in the way of Vermont reaching the full potential \npromised by Internet commerce. One obstacle is that ``merchants are \nanxious about not being able to control where their names and brands \nare being displayed.'' Another is the need to bolster consumers' \nconfidence in online shopping.\n  Cybersquatters hurt electronic commerce.--Both merchant and consumer \nconfidence in conducting business online are undermined by so-called \n``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates,'' who abuse the rights of \ntrademark holders by purposely and maliciously registering as a domain \nname the trademarked name of another company to divert and confuse \ncustomers or to deny the company the ability to establish an easy-to-\nfind online location. A recent report by the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (WIPO) on the Internet domain name process has \ncharacterized cybersquatting as ``predatory and parasitical practices \nby a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register \nfamous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer \nconfusion or downright fraud.\n  Enforcing trademarks in cyberspace will promote global electronic \ncommerce.--Enforcing trademark law in cyberspace can help bring \nconsumer confidence to this new frontier. That is why I have long been \nconcerned with protecting registered trademarks online. Indeed, when \nthe Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted \nthat: ``[A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, it \nis my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of \ndeceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that \nare associated with the products and reputations of others.'' \n(Congressional Record, Dec. 29, 1995, page S19312)\n  In addition, last year I authored an amendment that was enacted as \npart of the Next Generation Internet Research Act authorizing the \nNational Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study \nthe effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names \nand requesting recommendations on inexpensive and expeditious \nprocedures for resolving trademark disputes over the assignment of \ndomain names. Both the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and \nNumbers (ICANN) and WIPO are also making recommendations on these \nprocedures. Adoption of a uniform trademark domain name dispute \nresolution policy will be of enormous benefit to American trademark \nowners.\n  The ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act,'' S. 1461, which formed the \nbasis for the substitute amendment to S. 1255 that the Senate considers \ntoday, is not intended in any way to frustrate these global efforts \nalready underway to develop inexpensive and expeditious procedures for \nresolving domain name disputes that avoid costly and time-consuming \nlitigation in the court systems either here or abroad. In fact, the \nlegislation expressly provides liability limitations for domain name \nregistrars, registries or other domain name registration authorities \nwhen they take actions pursuant to a reasonable policy prohibiting the \nregistration of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar \nto another's trademark or dilutive of a famous trademark. The ICANN and \nWIPO consideration of these issues will inform the development by \ndomain name registrars and registries of such reasonable policies.\n  The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 has been used as I \npredicted to help stop misleading uses of trademarks as domain names. \nOne court has described this exercise by saying that ``attempting to \napply established trademark law in the fast-developing world of the \nInternet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus . . .'' Bensusan \nRestaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, the \ncourts appear to be handling ``cybersquatting'' cases well. As \nUniversity of Miami Law Professor Michael Froomkin noted in testimony \nsubmitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this issue on July \n22, 1999, ``[i]n every case involving a person who registered large \nnumbers of domains for resale, the cybersquatter has lost.''\n\n  For example, courts have had little trouble dealing with a notorious \ncybersquatter, Dennis Toeppen from Illinois, who registered more than \n100 trademarks--including ``yankee stadium.com,'' \n``deltaairlines.com,'' and ``neiman-marcus.com''--as domain names for \nthe purpose of eventually selling the names back to the companies \nowning the trademarks. The various courts reviewing his activities have \nunanimously determined that he violated the Federal Trademark Dilution \nAct.\n  Similarly, Wayne State University Law Professor Jessica Litman noted \nin testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing that those \nbusinesses which ``have registered domain names that are confusingly \nsimilar to trademarks or personal names in order to use them for \npornographic web sites . . . have without exception lost suits brought \nagainst them.''\n  Enforcing or even modifying our trademark laws will be only part of \nthe solution to cybersquatting. Up to now, people have been able to \nregister any number of domain names in the popular ``.com'' domain with \nno money down and no money due for 60 days. Network Solutions Inc. \n(NSI), the dominant Internet registrar, announced just last month that \nit was changing this policy, and requiring payment of the registration \nfee up front. In doing so, the NSI admitted that it was making this \nchange to curb cybersquatting.\n  In light of the developing case law, the ongoing efforts within WIPO \nand ICANN to build a consensus global mechanism for resolving online \ntrademark disputes, and the implementation of domain name registration \npractices designed to discourage cybersquatting, the legislation we \npass today is intended to build upon this progress and provide \nconstructive guidance to trademark holders, domain name registrars and \nregistries and Internet users registering domain names alike.\n  Commercial sites are not the only ones suffering at the hands of \ndomain name pirates. Even the Congress is not immune: while cspan.org \nprovides detailed coverage of the Senate and House, cspan.net is a \npornographic site. Moreover, Senators and presidential hopefuls are \nfinding that domain names like bush2000.org and hatch2000.org are being \nsnatched up by cyber poachers intent on reselling these names for a \ntidy profit. While this legislation does not help politicians protect \ntheir names, it will help small and large businesses and consumers \ndoing business online.\n  As introduced, S. 1255 was flawed.--I appreciate the efforts of \nSenators Abraham, Torricelli, Hatch and McCain to focus our attention \non this important matter. As originally introduced, S. 1255 proposed to \nmake it illegal to register or use any ``Internet domain name or \nidentifier of an online location'' that could be confused with the \ntrademark of another person or cause dilution of a ``famous \ntrademark.'' Violations were punishable by both civil and criminal \npenalties.\n  I voiced concerns at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee that, \nin its original form, S. 1255 would have a number of unintended \nconsequences that could hurt rather than promote electronic commerce, \nincluding the following specific problems:\n  The definition was overbroad.--As introduced, S. 1255 covered the use \nor registration of any ``identifier,'' which could cover not just \nsecond level domain names, but also e-mail addresses, screen names used \nin chat rooms, and even files accessible and readable on the Internet. \nAs one witness pointed out, ``the definitions will make every fan a \ncriminal.'' How? A file document about Batman, for example, that uses \nthe trademark ``Batman'' in its name, which also identifies its online \nlocation, could land the writer in court under that bill. \nCybersquatting is not about file names.\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\n  The original bill threatened hypertext linking.--The Web operates on \nhypertext linking, to facilitate jumping from one site to another. The \noriginal bill could have disrupted this practice by imposing liability \non operators of sites with links to other sites with trademark names in \nthe address. One could imagine a trademark owner not wanting to be \nassociated with or linked with certain sites, and threatening suit \nunder this proposal unless the link were eliminated or payments were \nmade for allowing the linking.\n  The original bill would have criminalized dissent and protest \nsites.--A number of Web sites collect complaints about trademarked \nproducts or services, and use the trademarked names to identify \nthemselves. For example, there are protest sites named ``boycott-\ncbs.com'' and ``www.PepsiBloodbath.com.'' While the speech contained on \nthose sites is clearly constitutionally protected, as originally \nintroduced, S. 1255 would have criminalized the use of the trademarked \nname to reach the site and made them difficult to search for and find \nonline.\n  The original bill would have stifled legitimate warehousing of domain \nnames.--The bill, as introduced, would have changed current law and \nmade liable persons who merely register domain names similar to other \ntrademarked names, whether or not they actually set up a site and used \nthe name. The courts have recognized that companies may have legitimate \nreasons for registering domain names without using them and have \ndeclined to find trademark violations for mere registration of a \ntrademarked name. For example, a company planning to acquire another \ncompany might register a domain name containing the target company's \nname in anticipation of the deal. The original bill would have made \nthat company liable for trademark infringement.\n  For these and other reasons, Professor Litman concluded that, as \nintroduced, the ``bill would in many ways be bad for electronic \ncommerce, by making it hazardous to do business on the Internet without \nfirst retaining trademark counsel.'' Faced with the risk of criminal \npenalties, she stated that ``many start-up businesses may choose to \nabandon their goodwill and move to another Internet location, or even \nto fold, rather than risk liability.''\n  The Hatch-Leahy Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act and substitute \namendment to S. 1255 are a better solution.--S. 1461, the ``Domain Name \nPiracy Prevention Act,'' which Senators Hatch and I, and others, \nintroduced and which provides the text of the substitute amendment to \nS. 1255, addresses the cybersquatting problem without jeopardizing \nother important online rights and interests. Along with the Hatch-Leahy \nclarifying amendment we consider today, this legislation would amend \nsection 43 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. Sec.  11125) by adding a new \nsection to make liable for actual or statutory damages any person, who \nwith bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of another's \ntrademark, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, \nregisters, traffics in or uses a domain name that is identical or \nconfusingly similar to a distinctive trademark or dilutive of a famous \ntrademark. The fact that the domain name registrant did not compete \nwith the trademark owner would not be a bar to recovery.\n\n  Uses of infringing domain names that support liability under the \nlegislation are expressly limited to uses by the domain name registrant \nor the registrant's authorized licensee. This limitation makes clear \nthat ``uses'' of domain names by persons other than the domain name \nregistrant for purposes such as hypertext linking, directory \npublishing, or for search engines, are not covered by the prohibition.\n  Domain name piracy is a real problem. Whitehouse.com has probably \ngotten more traffic from people trying to find copies of the \nPresident's speeches than those interested in adult material. As I have \nnoted, the issue has struck home for many in this body, with aspiring \ncyber-poachers seizing domain names like bush2000.org and trying to \nextort political candidates for their use.\n  While the problem is clear, narrowly defining the solution is \ntrickier. The mere presence of a trademark is not enough. Legitimate \nconflicts may arise between companies offering different services or \nproducts under the same trademarked name, such as Juno lighting inc. \nand Juno online services over the juno.com domain name, or between \ncompanies and individuals who register a name or nickname as a domain \nname, such as the young boy nicknamed ``pokey'' whose domain name \n``pokey.org'' was challenged by the toy manufacturer who owns the \nrights to the Gumby and Pokey toys. In other cases, you may have a site \nwhich uses a trademarked name to protest a group, company or issue, \nsuch as pepsibloodbath.com, or even to defend one's reputation, such as \nwww.civil-action.com, which belongs not to the motion picture studio, \nbut to W.R. Grace to rebut the unflattering portrait of the company as \na polluter and child poisoner created by the movie.\n  There is a world of difference between these sorts of sites and those \nwhich use deceptive naming practices to draw attention to their site \n(e.g., whitehouse.com), or those who use domain names to misrepresent \nthe goods or services they offer (e.g., dellmemory.com, which may be \nconfused with the Dell computer company).\n  We must also recognize certain technological realities. For example, \nmerely mentioning a trademark is not a problem. Posting a speech that \nmentions AOL on my web page and calling the page aol.html, confuses no \none between my page and America Online's site. Likewise, we must \nrecognize that while the Web is a key part of the Internet, it is not \nthe only part. We simply do not want to pass legislation that may \nimpose liability on Internet users with e-mail addresses, which may \ncontain a trademarked name. Nor do we want to crack down on newsgroups \nthat use trademarks descriptively, such as alt.comics.batman.\n  In short, it is important that we distinguish between the legitimate \nand illegitimate use of domain names, and this legislation does just \nthat. Significant sections of this legislation include:\n  Definition.--Domain names are narrowly defined to mean alphanumeric \ndesignations registered with or assigned by domain name registrars or \nregistries, or other domain name registration authority as part of an \nelectronic address on the Internet. Since registrars only register \nsecond level domain names, this definition effectively excludes file \nnames, screen names, and e-mail addresses and, under current \nregistration practice, applies only to second level domain names.\n  Scienter Requirement.--Good faith, innocent or negligent uses of a \ndomain name that is identical or confusingly similar to another's mark \nor dilutive of a famous mark are not covered by the legislation's \nprohibition. Thus, registering a domain name while unaware that the \nname is another's trademark would not be actionable. Nor would the use \nof a domain name that contains a trademark for purposes of protest, \ncomplaint, parody or commentary satisfy the requisite scienter \nrequirement. Bad-faith intent to profit is required for a violation to \noccur. This requirement of bad-faith intent to profit is critical \nsince, as Professor Litman pointed out in her testimony, our trademark \nlaws permit multiple businesses to register the same trademark for \ndifferent classes of products. Thus, she explains:\n\n     [a]lthough courts have been quick to impose liability for bad \n     faith registration, they have been far more cautious in \n     disputes involving a domain name registrant who has a \n     legitimate claim to use a domain name and registered it in \n     good faith. In a number of cases, courts have refused to \n     impose liability where there is no significant likelihood \n     that anyone will be misled, even if there is a significant \n     possibility of trademark dilution.\n\n  The legislation outlines the following non-exclusive list of eight \nfactors for courts to consider in determining whether such bad-faith \nintent to profit is proven: (i) the trademark rights of the domain name \nregistrant in the domain name; (ii) whether the domain name is the \nlegal name or nickname of the registrant; (iii) the prior use by the \nregistrant of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering \nof any goods or services; (iv) the registrant's legitimate \nnoncommercial or fair use of the mark at the site under the domain \nname; (v) the registrant's intent to divert consumers from the mark's \nowner's online location in a manner that could harm the mark's\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\ngoodwill, either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or \ndisparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the \nsource, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the site; (vi) the \nregistrant's offer to sell the domain name for substantial \nconsideration without having or having an intent to use the domain name \nin the bona fide offering of goods or services; (vii) the registrant's \nintentional provision of material false and misleading contact \ninformation when applying for the registration of the domain name; and \n(viii) the registrant's registration of multiple domain names that are \nidentical or similar to or dilutive of another's trademark.\n  Damages.--In civil actions against cybersquatters, the plaintiff is \nauthorized to recover actual damages and profits, or may elect before \nfinal judgment to award of statutory damages of not less than $1,000 \nand not more than $100,000 per domain name, as the court considers \njust. The court is directed to remit statutory damages in any case \nwhere the infringer reasonably believed that use of the domain name was \na fair or otherwise lawful use.\n\n  In Rem Actions.--The bill would also permit an in rem civil action \nfiled by a trademark owner in circumstances where the domain name \nviolates the owner's rights in the trademark and the court finds that \nthe owner demonstrated due diligence and was not able to find the \ndomain name holder to bring an in personam civil action. The remedies \nof an in rem action are limited to a court order for forfeiture or \ncancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to \nthe trademark owner.\n  Liability Limitations.--The bill would limit the liability for \nmonetary damages of domain name registrars, registries or other domain \nname registration authorities for any action they take to refuse to \nregister, remove from registration, transfer, temporarily disable or \npermanently cancel a domain name pursuant to a court order or in the \nimplementation of reasonable policies prohibiting the registration of \ndomain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's \ntrademark, or dilutive of a famous trademark.\n  Prevention of Reverse Domain Name Hijacking.--Reverse domain name \nhijacking is an effort by a trademark owner to take a domain name from \na legitimate good faith domain name registrant. There have been some \nwell-publicized cases of trademark owners demanding the take down of \ncertain web sites set up by parents who have registered their \nchildren's names in the .org domain, such as two year old Veronica \nSams's ``Little Veronica'' website and 12 year old Chris ``Pokey'' Van \nAllen's web page.\n  In order to protect the rights of domain name registrants in their \ndomain names the legislation provides that registrants may recover \ndamages, including costs and attorney's fees, incurred as a result of a \nknowing and material misrepresentation by a person that a domain name \nis identical or similar to, or dilutive of, a trademark.\n  In addition, a domain name registrant, whose domain name has been \nsuspended, disabled or transferred, may sue upon notice to the mark \nowner, to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by \nthe registrant is lawful. The court in such a suit is authorized to \ngrant injunctive relief, including the reactivation of a domain name or \nthe transfer or return of a domain name to the domain name registrant.\n  Cybersquatting is an important issue both for trademark holders and \nfor the future of electronic commerce on the Internet. Any legislative \nsolution to cybersquatting must tread carefully to ensure that \nauthorized remedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of \ninformation on the Internet. In many ways, the United States has been \nthe incubator of the World Wide Web, and the world closely watches \nwhenever we venture into laws, customs or standards that affect the \nInternet. We must only do so with great care and caution. Fair use \nprinciples are just as critical in cyberspace as in any other \nintellectual property arena. I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and I, \nalong with Senators Abraham, Torricelli, and Kohl have worked together \nto find a legislative solution that respects these considerations.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in order to \ncomment on S. 1255, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of \n1999. Through the tremendous help of several of my colleagues, notably \nSenators Hatch, Leahy, Torricelli, McCain, Breaux, and Lott, we moved \nthis bill in little over one month from a concept to final product, \nthrough the Judiciary Committee with unanimous support, and again with \nunanimous support through the Senate floor. I thank all involved for \ntheir help, and I am comfortable in my belief that we have accomplished \na great feat here today: the Senate has taken an important step in \nreforming trademark law for the digital age, and in protecting the \nexpectations and safety of consumers, and the property rights of \nbusiness nationwide.\n  This legislation will combat a new form of high-tech fraud that is \ncausing confusion and inconvenience for consumers, increasing costs for \npeople doing business on the Internet, and posing substantial threat to \na century of pre-Internet American business efforts. The fraud is \ncommonly called ``cybersquatting,'' a practice whereby individuals in \nbad faith reserve Internet domain names or other identifiers of online \nlocations that are similar or identical to trademarked names. Once a \ntrademark is registered as an online identifier or domain name, the \n``cybersquatter'' can engage in a variety of nefarious activities--from \nthe relatively benign parody of a business or individual, to the \nobscene prank of redirecting an unsuspecting consumer to pornographic \ncontent, to the destructive worldwide slander of a centuries-old brand \nname. This behavior undermines consumer confidence, discourages \nInternet use, and destroys the value of established brand names and \ntrademarks.\n  Electronic of ``E'' commerce in particular has been an engine of \ngreat economic growth for the United States. E-commerce between \nbusinesses has grown to an estimated $64.8 billion for 1999. Ten \nmillion customers shopped for some product using the Internet in 1998 \nalone. International Data Corporation estimates that $31 billion in \nproducts will be sold over the Internet in 1999. And 5.3 million \nhouseholds will have access to financial transactions like banking and \nstock trading by the end of 1999.\n  Our economy, and its ability to provide high paying jobs for American \nworkers, is increasingly dependent upon technology--and on e-commerce \nin particular. If we want to maintain our edge in the global \nmarketplace, we must address those problems which endanger continued \ngrowth in e-commerce. Some unscrupulous--though enterprising--people \nare engaged in the thriving and unethical business collecting and \nselling Internet addresses containing trademarked names.\n  Cybersquatting has already caused significant damage. Even computer-\nsavvy companies buy domain names from cybersquatters at extortionate \nrates to rid themselves of a headache with no certain outcome. For \nexample, computer maker Gateway recently paid $100,000 to a \ncybersquatter who had placed pornographic images on the website \n``www.gateway20000''. But rather than simply give up, several \ncompanies, including Paine Webber, have instead sought protection of \ntheir brands through the legal system. However, as with much of the \npre-Internet law that is applied to this post-Internet world, precedent \nis still developing, and at this point, one cannot predict with \ncertainty which party to a dispute will win, and on what grounds, in \nthe future.\n  Whether perpetrated to defraud the public or to extort the trademark \nowner, squatting on Internet addresses using trademarked names is \nwrong. Trademark law is based on the recognition that companies and \nindividuals build a property right in brand names because of the \nreasonable expectations they raise among consumers. If you order a \nCompaq or Apple computer, that should mean that you get a computer made \nby Compaq or Apple, not one built by a fly-by-night company pirating \nthe name. The same goes for trademarks on the Internet.\n  To protect Internet growth and job production, Senators Torricelli, \nHatch, McCain, and I introduced an anticybersquatting bill which \nreceived strong public support. A number of suggestions convinced me of \nthe need\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\nfor substitute legislation addressing the problem of in rem \njurisdiction and eliminating provisions dealing with criminal \npenalties, and I have been pleased to work with Senators Hatch and \nLeahy to that effect.\n  Our final legislative product would establish uniform federal rules \nfor dealing with this attack on interstate electronic commerce, \nsupplementing existing rights under trademark law. It establishes a \ncivil action for registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name \nidentifier that is identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of \nanother person's trademark or service mark that either is inherently \ndistinctive or had acquired distinctiveness.\n  This bill also incorporates substantial protections for innocent \nparties, keying on the bad faith of a party. Civil liability would \nattach only if a person had no intellectual property rights in the \ndomain name identifier, the domain name identifier was not the person's \nlegal first name or surname; and the person registered, acquired, or \nused the domain name identifier with the bad-faith intent to benefit \nfrom the goodwill of a trademark or service mark of another.\n  Just to be clear on our intent, the ``bad-faith'' requirement may be \nestablished by, among others, any of the following evidence:\n  First, if the registration or use of the domain name identifier was \nmade with the intent to disrupt the business of the mark owner by \ndiverting consumers from the mark owner's online location;\n  Second, if a pattern is established of the person offering to \ntransfer, sell, or otherwise assign more than one domain name \nidentifier to the owner of the applicable mark or any third party for \nconsideration, without having used the domain name identifiers in the \nbona fide offering of any goods or services; or\n  Third, if the person registers or acquires multiple domain name \nidentifiers that are identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive \nof any distinctive trademark or service mark of one or more other \npersons.\n  In addition, under this legislation, the owner of a mark may bring an \nin rem action against the domain name identifier itself. This will \nallow a court to order the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain \nname identifier or the transfer of the domain name identifier to the \nowner of the mark. It also reinforces the central characteristic of \nthis legislation--its intention to protect property rights. The in rem \nprovision will eliminate the problem most recently and prominently \nexperienced by the auto maker Porsche, which had an action against \nseveral infringing domain name identifiers dismissed for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction.\n  In terms of damages, this legislation provides for statutory civil \ndamages of at least $1,000, but not more than $100,000 per domain name \nidentifier. The plaintiff may elect these damages in lieu of actual \ndamages or profits at any time before final judgment.\n  The growth of the Internet has provided businesses and individuals \nwith unprecedented access to a worldwide source of information, \ncommerce, and community. Unfortunately, those bad actors seeking to \ncause harm to businesses and individuals have seen their opportunities \nincrease as well. In my opinion, on-line extortion in this form is \nunacceptable and outrageous. Whether it's people extorting companies by \nregistering company names, misdirect Internet users to inappropriate \nsites, or otherwise attempting to damage a trademark that a business \nhas spent decades building into a recognizable brand, persons engaging \nin cybersquatting activity should be held accountable for their \nactions. I believe that these provisions will discourage anyone from \n``squatting'' on addresses in cyberspace to which they are not \nentitled.\n  I again wish to thank my colleagues for their assistance in this \neffort, and I look forward to final passage of this legislation after \ncareful and thoughtful consideration by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill be read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The amendment (No. 1609) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1255), as amended, was read the third time, and passed.\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nissue of the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10520-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10520-S10522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING TECHNICAL, FINANCIAL, AND PROCUREMENT ASSISTANCE TO VETERAN-\n                         OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 254, H.R. 1568.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1568) to provide technical, financial, and \n     procurement assistance to veteran-owned small businesses, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and enthusiasm \nthat I rise in support of the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small \nBusiness Development Act of 1999 (H.R. 1568). This bill is a critical \nbuilding block in our efforts to provide significantly improved help to \nsmall businesses owned and operated by veterans and especially those \nsmall businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. This bill was \napproved by a unanimous vote of 18-0 in the Committee on Small Business \nafter the Committee approved a substitute amendment that I offered with \nthe Committee's Ranking Member, Senator Kerry.\n  Over the past two years, as the Chairman of the Committee on Small \nBusiness, I have brought three bills to the Senate floor that place a \nspecial emphasis on helping veteran entrepreneurs. The need for this \nlegislation became necessary as Federal support for veteran \nentrepreneurs, particularly service-disabled veterans, has declined. \nSignificantly, support for veteran small business owners historically \nhas been weak at the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n  The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of \n1999 seeks to provide assistance to veteran-owned small businesses to \nenable them to start-up and grow their businesses. The bill places a \nspecific emphasis on small businesses owned and controlled by service-\ndisabled veterans and directs SBA to undertake special initiatives on \nbehalf of all veteran small business owners.\n  H.R. 1568 has key provisions that are of particular importance to \nveterans. The bill establishes a federally chartered corporation called \nthe National Veterans Business Development Corporation (Corporation/\nNVBDC), whose purpose is to create a network of information and \nassistance centers to improve assistance for veterans who wish to \nstart-up or expand a small businesses. The Corporation will be governed \nby a board of directors appointed by the President, who will take into \nconsideration recommendations from the Chairmen and Ranking Members \nfrom the Committees on Small Business and Veterans Affairs of the \nSenate and House of Representatives before making appointments to the \nboard. Although funds are authorized during the first four years of the \nCorporation, it is the expectation of the Committee on Small Business \nthat it will become self-sufficient and will no longer need Federal \nassistance after this four year start-up period.\n  In an effort to make its programs more readily available to veteran \nentrepreneurs, the SBA is required to ensure that the SCORE Program and \nthe Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program work directly with \nthe Corporation so that veteran entrepreneurs receive technical support \nand other needed assistance.\n  H.R. 1568 places special emphasis on credit programs at SBA that can \nbe helpful to veterans, and especially service-disabled veterans. The \nbill specifically targets veterans for the 7(a) guaranteed business \nloan program, the 504 Development Company Loan Program, and the \nMicroloan Program.\n  A key component of H.R. 1568 is to make Federal government contracts \nmore readily available to service disabled veterans who own and control\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\nsmall businesses. The bill includes an annual goal of 3% of all Federal \ncontract dollars for these small business owners. This goal is seen as \nan incentive to Federal agencies to undertake a major effort to make \ntheir procurement activities more accessible to veterans who made major \nsacrifices for our Nation.\n  During the markup of H.R. 1568, the Committee approved a requirement \nthat the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) collect data to be \nreported annually to Congress on the number and dollar value of \ncontracts and subcontracts awarded by Federal agencies to veteran-owned \nsmall businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. \nThis new requirement is critical if we are to measure the success of \nFederal agencies in meeting this 3% goal.\n  Last year, the Committee on Small Business approved new initiatives \nto strengthen the mandate that SBA's programs be more responsive to all \nveteran small business owners. The ``Year 2000 Readiness and Small \nBusiness Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998'' (H.R. 3412) directed \nthat veterans receive comprehensive help at SBA. This bill passed the \nSenate unanimously in September 1998; unfortunately, it was not taken \nup by the House of Representatives before the adjournment in the fall. \nThe bill would have elevated the Office of Veterans Affairs at SBA to \nthe Office of Veterans Business Development, to be headed by an \nAssociate Administrator who would report directly to the SBA \nAdministrator. This provision is contained in H.R. 1568.\n  In addition, H.R. 3412 would have established an Advisory Committee \non Veterans' Business Affairs comprised of veterans who own small \nbusinesses and representatives of national veterans service \norganizations. The bill also would have established the position of \nNational Veterans' Business Coordinator within the Service Corps of \nRetired Executives (SCORE) Program. This new position would work within \nthe SBA headquarters to ensure that SCORE's programs nationwide \nincluded entrepreneurial counseling and training for veterans. Both \ninitiatives from H.R. 3412 are included in H.R. 1568.\n  More recently, on June 6, 1999, the Committee approved the Military \nReservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999 (S. 918) to assist \nmilitary reservists called to active duty and the small businesses that \nemploy them. This bill complements the provisions of the Veterans \nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act. Accordingly, the \nCommittee voted unanimously to incorporate the full text of S. 918 into \nTitle III (Technical Assistance) and Title IV (Financial Assistance) of \nH.R. 1568.\n  During and after the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990's, the \nCommittee heard from reservists whose businesses were harmed, severely \ncrippled, or even lost, by their absence. These hardships can occur \nduring a period of national emergency or during a period of contingency \noperation when troops are deployed overseas. To help such reservists \nand their small businesses, H.R. 1568 authorizes a deferral of loan \nrepayments on any SBA direct loan, including a disaster loan, for an \neligible small business. SBA is authorized to reduce the interest rate \non the direct loans.\n  SBA is also directed to publish guidelines within 30 days of \nenactment of the legislation to help its lending partners in the 7(a) \nguaranteed business loan program and the 504 Development Company \nprogram to develop procedures for providing loan repayment relief to \nsmall businesses that have been adversely affected by the departure of \nan essential employee to active military duty. Further, the bill \nestablishes a low-interest economic injury loan program to be \nadministered by the SBA through its disaster loan program. The purpose \nof these loans will be to provide interim operating capital to a small \nbusiness that suffers substantial economic injury as a result of the \ndeparture of its essential employee to active duty and cannot obtain \ncredit elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, I have also introduced a non-controversial amendment \nto H.R. 1568, which would require the President, rather than the SBA \nAdministrator, to appoint the voting members of the board of directors \nof the National Veterans Business Development Corporation. Senator \nKerry has cosponsored this amendment. This change was requested by the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Small Business. \nIt is my understanding that with the adoption of this amendment and \nSenate passage of the H.R. 1568, as amended, that the House of \nRepresentatives is prepared to take up and pass the bill later this \nevening.\n  We have an opportunity today to approve an excellent bill to help \nveteran small business owners, and I urge my colleagues to support both \nmy amendment and the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support this bill. A little more than a \nyear ago, SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez formed a task force to study \nthe needs of veterans with a talent, skill, dream or need to start \ntheir own business. I commend the Administrator for her initiative. And \nthanks to the quick and earnest work of the task force representatives, \nparticularly the Veterans Service Organizations and advocacy groups, a \nreport was drafted in three short months.\n  H.R. 1568 gives life to many of the 21 report recommendations. \nAppropriately, it includes S. 918, the Military Reservists Small \nBusiness Relief Act of 1999--the fourteenth report recommendation--that \nI introduced on March 29th and the full Senate passed by unanimous \nconsent last week, on July 27th. Reservists have been asking for this \nsafety net since 1991 to keep their businesses going while they are \ncalled to active duty. I am glad that we will again put this bill one \nstep closer to enactment for the men and women who--whether deployed in \nIraq, Bosnia or Kosovo--could benefit from the provisions of this bill \nnow.\n  These provisions should already be available for those who need it, \nand I deeply regret that it wasn't enacted earlier, either as S. 918 or \nas part of this bill, H.R. 1568. The nature of the provisions are \nuncontroversial. As S. 918, it passed the Committee on Small Business \nJune 9th, almost 60 days ago, by unanimous consent and has 51 Senators \nco-sponsors--21 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Since then, it has also \npassed the full House and the Senate Committee on Small Business as \npart of this bill before us tonight, H.R. 1568.\n  As much as I am frustrated by the delay, it probably doesn't compare \nto that of reservists who are on active duty and losing sleep over how \nthey are going to keep their businesses going and avoid ruining their \ncredit records. Ask the truck driver who serves in the Missouri \nNational Air Guard and reported to active duty more than four months \nago. He bought a new rig shortly before being called up and has hefty \nmonthly payments to meet. He lined up a replacement to drive his truck \nwhile he was gone to keep money coming in, but the driver backed out of \nthe agreement right before the reservist was to leave.\n  He tried to do the right thing--to implement a contingent plan--and \nyet something beyond his control interfered. It's hard to keep your \ncustomers happy when their merchandise isn't getting delivered. And \nit's even harder to make your loan payments when you're not bringing in \nenough money.\n  Or ask the reservist from Oklahoma who has supported his wife and \nfour children for the past five years with a carpet and upholstery \nbusiness. In 1998, he was called up for eight months, and he's been \nactive this year since May 8th. What made it particularly damaging for \nhis business this year was that he was called up at the beginning of \nthe industry's high season. January to April are slow times, and April \nto December are the money-making months. He called my office a month \nago to find out about this bill and find out how he could get \nassistance.\n  Though this bill was still waiting for action by the full Senate, we \nput him in contact with the SBA office in Oklahoma City to find some \nway to help. After reviewing his options and what it would take to \nresuscitate his business, he called to say that he was closing shop for \ngood: ``I'm just going to close my business down. I'm not going to try \nto get a small business loan. I want to cut my losses now. . . .''\n  I look forward to spreading the message that reservists, such as this \nman from Oklahoma, will soon be able to apply for loan deferrals, \nreductions on interest rates, low-interest disaster loans, and get \ntraining assistance for\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\nthe employee or family left behind to run their businesses.\n  Importantly, this bill goes further, making more comprehensive \nchanges for all veterans. Incorporating other recommendations that are \ndesigned to help service-disabled veterans and veteran form and expand \nsmall businesses, H.R. 1568--\n  Elevates the SBA's Office of Veterans Affairs so that it has more \ncredibility and visibility.\n  Creates a federally chartered corporation to facilitate technical and \nmanagement assistance to veteran entrepreneurs.\n  Establishes a three-percent procurement goal for service-disabled \nveteran-owned businesses.\n  Requires the Federal Procurement Data System to collect data on the \npercentage and dollar value of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded \nto small businesses owned and controlled by veterans and service-\ndisabled veterans.\n  According to the SBA and the Department of Veterans Administration, \nout of the estimated 22 million veterans in this country, 4 million own \ntheir own businesses. I encourage the SBA and the veterans groups to \nuse these tools to make real progress in expanding and strengthening \nsmall businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans so \nthat they can have the dignity and financial benefits of self-\nsufficiency.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for supporting veterans and \nsmall business. It's one vote that will help thousands.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1617\n\n(Purpose: To make amendments with respect to the Board of Directors of \n        the National Veterans Business Development Corporation)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of calendar No. 252, S. 632.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 632) to provide assistance for poison prevention \n     and to stabilize the funding of regional poison control \n     centers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from Ohio for \nhis hard work on this very important bill. The work our nation's poison \ncontrol centers do is absolutely essential to the safety and health of \nour children. Not only do poison control centers save lives, they \nsignificantly reduce our health care costs by helping American families \ndeal quickly, safely, and efficiently with a poisoning emergency.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator from Missouri is exactly right. It is perhaps \ndifficult to imagine just how concerned parents must be when they \ndiscover that their child has been exposed to a substance that might \nhave damaging health effects. They don't know what type of harm might \nhappen to their child--or whether any harm will happen. But the \npossibility is there--and to a parent, that threat can truly be \nfrightening. In these emergency situations, the poison control center \nexperts can quickly help parents determine the appropriate response. \nThey might tell the parents that whatever substance that child has been \nexposed to doesn't pose a health threat at all. Other times, that \nthreat is real, and the poison control center can help parents \nadminister immediate treatment at home or provide treatment advice \nuntil the parents can get the child to the nearest emergency room. \nEither way, the poison control center is absolutely essential in \nresponding to the emergency by providing immediate treatment advice \nwhen the emergency is real and providing peace of mind for the parents \nand reducing unnecessary healthcare and hospitalization when the \nexposure does not pose a health threat to the child.\n  Mr. BOND. Doesn't this bill clarify how the proposed national toll-\nfree number will affect existing, privately funded toll-free numbers?\n  Mr. DeWINE. This bill makes clear that the establishment of a \nnational toll-free number to access poison control centers should not \nbe interpreted as prohibiting the establishment or continued operation \nof any privately funded nationwide toll-free number used by \nagricultural pesticide companies, consumer products companies, \npharmaceutical companies, and other groups who fund their own toll-free \ncustomer service numbers in the event of a poisoning or accidental \nexposure involving one of their own products. We also make clear that \nnone of the funds that this bill authorizes may be used to help private \ncompanies fund their own toll-free numbers. We just want to clarify \nthat this bill neither funds nor prohibits private entities from \nfunding their own toll-free customer service numbers. I thank my \ncolleague for his comments and for his strong support of this bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Res. 48\n\n       Whereas the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum \n     was created ten years ago to promote free and open trade and \n     closer economic cooperation among its member countries, as \n     well as to sustain economic growth and equitable development \n     in the region for the common good of its people;\n       Whereas the twenty-one member countries of APEC account for \n     55 percent of total world income and 46 percent of global \n     trade;\n       Whereas APEC leaders are committed to intensifying regional \n     economic interdependence by going forward with measures to \n     expand trade and investment liberalization, pursuing sectoral \n     cooperation and development initiatives, and increasing \n     business facilitation and economic and technical cooperation \n     projects;\n       Whereas a strong international financial system underpins \n     the economic success of the region;\n       Whereas, given the challenges presented by the financial \n     crisis, APEC leaders last year pledged to work together in \n     improving and strengthening social safety nets, financial \n     systems and capital markets, trade and investment flows, \n     corporate sector restructuring, the regional scientific and \n     technological base, human resources development, economic \n     infrastructure, and existing business and commercial links \n     for the purpose of supporting sustained growth into the 21st \n     century;\n       Whereas the outstanding leadership of New Zealand during \n     its year in the APEC Chair has produced a series of important \n     themes for the annual APEC Leaders meeting in Auckland, New \n     Zealand on September 12-14, 1999, including--\n       (1) expanding opportunities for private sector businesses \n     through the reduction of tariff and nontariff barriers;\n       (2) strengthening the functioning of regional markets, with \n     a particular focus on building institutional capacity, making \n     public and corporate economic governance arrangements more \n     transparent, and guiding regulatory reform so that benefits \n     of trade liberalization are maximized; and\n       (3) broadening support for and understanding of APEC goals \n     to demonstrate the positive benefits of the organization's \n     work for the entire Asia-Pacific community;\n       Whereas the unique and close partnership between the public \n     and private sectors exhibited through the APEC Forum has \n     contributed to the successful conclusion of the GATT Uruguay \n     Round and agreement over other multilateral trade pacts \n     involving information technology, telecommunications and \n     financial services;\n       Whereas APEC member countries have provided helpful \n     momentum, through active consideration of the Early Voluntary \n     Sectoral Liberalization plan, to the next round of \n     multilateral trade negotiations scheduled to begin later this \n     year at the Third WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle, \n     Washington; and\n       Whereas the APEC leaders have resolved to achieve the \n     ambitious goal of free and open trade and investment in the \n     region no later than 2010 for the industrialized economies \n     and 2020 for developing economies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), \n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges the importance of greater economic \n     cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and the key role \n     played by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum;\n       (2) urges the administration fully to support the APEC \n     forum and work to achieve its goals of greater economic \n     growth and stability;\n       (3) calls upon the administration to continue its close \n     cooperation with the private sector in advancing APEC goals; \n     and\n       (4) expresses appreciation to the Government and people of \n     New Zealand for their exceptional efforts in chairing the \n     APEC Forum this year.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will be pleased to join the Chairman \nof the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Bennett, \nin presenting to the Senate what I believe is a very good conference \nagreement on the Fiscal Year 2000 budget.\n  Under the strong leadership of Chairman Bennett, as well as Mr. \nTaylor, the House Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, and Mr. Pastor, \nthe Ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee, we were able to work \nour differences in a way that ensures that the essential functions for \nwhich appropriations are contained in this bill are able to continue \ntheir operations and to carry out their responsibilities efficiently \nand without any diminution of service.\n  In all, the recommendations that we are presenting today total just \nover $2.45 billion, almost $21 million below the Subcommittee's \nallocation. In reaching compromises on the various issues in the \nconference, Chairman Bennett was very careful to ensure that the cuts \ndid not unnecessarily impair the programs where those cut were taken. I \nshared the concerns of the Chairman that these reductions be carefully \nconsidered as to their effects, before they were agreed to.\n  In his statement, Chairman Bennett has already laid out to the Senate \nthe details of the conference agreement, which I will not repeat at \nthis time.\n  I wish to congratulate the Chairman, Senator Bennett, for his hard \nwork throughout the year on this bill. This was my first year to serve \nas the Ranking Member of this important Subcommittee, and Senator \nBennett could not have been more helpful to me and my staff. It has \nbeen a real pleasure to work at his side on this bill and I look \nforward to continuing to work with him on all matters that are in the \njurisdiction of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I thank the staff who have worked so \ndiligently throughout the year in assisting Chairman Bennett and \nmyself--Mary Dewald, who recently left the Committee staff, Edie \nStanley, her successor, and Jim English, as well as Chris Kierig of my \nstaff. They, together with Christine Ciccone, the Majority Clerk of the \nSubcommittee, and Chip Yost of Senator Bennett's staff, have carried \nout their responsibilities in their usual, highly professional manner. \nOur staffs work together, as do Chairman Bennett and I, in a non-\npartisan way so that the decisions that we have made throughout the \nyear have been reached based on objective considerations, rather than \npartisanship.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10527-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10527-S10528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1219) to amend the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act and the Miller Act, relating to \n     payment protections for persons providing labor and materials \n     for Federal construction projects.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to recommend H.R. 1219, the \n``Construction Industry Payment Protection Act of 1999'' to the full \nSenate for passage. This bill, introduced in the House by a bipartisan \nlist of cosponsors, is intended to modernize the Miller Act, one of our \noldest procurement laws. The Committee on Governmental Affairs, with \njurisdiction over Federal procurement laws, recognizes and appreciates \nthe broad and strong support for this measure.\n  The Miller Act is a 1935 law requiring prime contractors with Federal \nconstruction contracts over $100,000 to provide bonds on those projects \nto protect those providing labor and materials. Currently, the Miller \nAct requires two types of bonds on Federal construction contracts: A \npayment bond to guarantee that subcontractors get paid, limited under \nthe 1935 Act to $2.5 million and never adjusted for inflation; and a \nperformance bond to protect the Federal government and ensure that the \nproject gets finished. This bond is equal to the value of the project.\n  H.R. 1219 would amend the Miller Act to require that the payment bond \nbe at least equal to the performance bond. It also establishes \nstandards by which subcontractor rights under the Miller Act can be \nwaived, and it provides for more modern methods by which claims can be \nnoticed.\n  This bill represents an impressive consensus and several years of \nhard work by all the interested parties: the general contractors, the \nsubcontractors, and the surety firms who supply the bonds. In addition, \nthe Administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy in \nsupport of the measure. Earlier this week, H.R. 1219 passed the House \nby a roll call vote of 416-0. I respectfully urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1219) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10530-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10530-S10531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PRIVATE RELIEF\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate \nhas passed legislation that will provide permanent residency in the \nUnited States for 15-year-old Vova Malofienko and his family.\n  In order to understand the importance of this legislation, you need \nto know more about Vova. He was born in Chernigov, Ukraine, just 30 \nmiles from the Chornobyl nuclear reactor. In 1986, when he was just \ntwo, the reactor exploded and he was exposed to high levels of \nradiation. He was diagnosed with lleukemia in June 1990, shortly before \nhis sixth birthday.\n  Through the efforts of the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund, Vova \nand his mother came to the United States with seven other children to \nattend Paul Newman's ``Hole in the Wall'' camp in Connecticut. While in \nthis country, Vova was able to receive extensive cancer treatment and \nchemotherapy. In November of 1992, his cancer went into remission.\n  Regrettably, the other children from Chornobyl were not as fortunate. \nThey returned to the Ukraine and they died one by one because of \ninadequate cancer treatment. Not a child survived.\n  The air, food, and water in the Ukraine are still contaminated with \nradiation and are perilous to those like Vova who have a weakened \nimmune system. Additionally, cancer treatment available in the Ukraine \nis not as sophisticated as treatment available in the United States. \nAlthough Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he continues to need \nmedical follow-up on a consistent basis, including physical \nexaminations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure early \ndetection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate event \nthe leukemia recurs.\n  Because of his perilous medical condition, Vova and his family have \ndone everything possible to remain in the United States. I tried to \nhelp by supporting their visa applications to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, and by sponsoring this legislation. The passage \nof this measure is the culmination of many years of hard work by Vova, \nhis family, and members of the Millburn community.\n  Throughout all of these struggles, Vova has been an inspiration to \nall. An honors student at Milburn Middle School, he has been an \neloquent spokesperson for children with cancer. He has rallied the \ncommunity and helped bring out the best in everyone. His dedication, \ngrace, and dignity provide an outstanding example, not just to young \npeople, but to all Americans.\n  I am pleased to have been able to help Vova and his family. I want to \nthank the House sponsors of this legislation, Representatives Rothman \nand Franks, for their efforts in support of this legislation. I also \nwant to thank Senators Abraham, Hatch, Leahy, and Kennedy for moving \nthis bill through the legislative process. It has been an honor to work \non Vova's behalf, and I hope that he and his family enjoy great success \nand much happiness in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10531-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10531-S10532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RETURN OF ZACHARY BAUMEL, A U.S. CITIZEN, AND OTHER ISRAELI SOLDIERS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Zachary Baumel, a United States citizen serving in the \n     Israeli military forces, has been missing in action since \n     June 1982 when he was captured by forces affiliated with the \n     Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) following a tank \n     battle with Syrian forces at Sultan Ya'akub in Lebanon;\n       (2) Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman, Israeli citizens serving \n     in the Israeli military forces, have been missing in action \n     since June 1982 when they were also captured by these same \n     forces in a tank battle with Syrian forces at Sultan Ya'akub \n     in Lebanon;\n       (3) these three soldiers were last known to be in the hands \n     of a Palestinian faction splintered from the PLO and \n     operating in Syrian-controlled territory, thus making this a \n     matter within the responsibility of the Government of Syria;\n       (4) diplomatic efforts to secure the release of these \n     individuals have been unsuccessful, although PLO Chairman \n     Yasser Arafat delivered one-half of Zachary Baumel's dog tag \n     to Israeli Government authorities; and\n       (5) in the Gaza-Jericho agreement between the Palestinian \n     Authority and the Government of Israel of May 4, 1994, \n     Palestinian officials agreed to cooperate with Israel in \n     locating and working for the return of Israeli soldiers \n     missing in action.\n\n     SEC. 2. ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO MISSING SOLDIERS.\n\n       (a) Continuing Communication with Certain Governments.--The \n     Secretary of State shall continue to raise the matter of \n     Zachary Baumel, Yehuda Katz, and Zvi Feldman on an urgent \n     basis with appropriate government officials of Syria, \n     Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and with other \n     governments in the region and elsewhere that, in the \n     determination of the Secretary, may be helpful in locating \n     and securing the return of these soldiers.\n       (b) Provision of Economic and Other Assistance to Certain \n     Governments.--In deciding whether or not to provide United \n     States economic and other forms of assistance to Syria, \n     Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and other governments in \n     the region, and in deciding United States policy toward these \n     governments and authorities, the President should take into \n     consideration the willingness of these governments and \n     authorities to assist in locating and securing the return of \n     the soldiers described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTS BY SECRETARY OF STATE.\n\n       (a) Initial Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     prepare and submit to the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate a written report that \n     describes the efforts of the Secretary pursuant to section \n     2(a) and United States policies affected pursuant to section \n     2(b).\n       (b) Subsequent Reports.--Not later than 15 days after \n     receiving from any source any additional credible information \n     relating to the individuals described in section 2(a), the \n     Secretary of State shall prepare and submit to the committees \n     described in subsection (a) a written report that contains \n     such additional information.\n       (c) Form of Reports.--A report submitted under subsection \n     (a) or (b) shall be made available to the public and may \n     include a classified annex.\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1620\n\n(Purpose: To amend H.R. 1175, a bill to assist in locating and securing \n   the return of Zachary Baumel, a United States citizen, and other \n                  Israeli soldiers missing in action)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) for Mr. Leahy \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1620.\n       In H.R. 1175, replace subsection (b) of Sec. 2 with:\n       On page 3 strike lines 11-20 and insert the following:\n       (b) Provision of Assistance to Certain Governments.--In \n     deciding whether or not to provide United States assistance \n     to any government or authority which the Secretary of State \n     believes has information concerning the whereabouts of the \n     soldiers described in subsection (a), and in formulating \n     United States policy towards such government or authority, \n     the President should take into consideration the willingness \n     of the government or authority to assist in locating and \n     securing the return of such soldiers.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support this Resolution, which \nseeks to hasten the return of Zachary Baumel, a United States citizen, \nand other Israeli soldiers missing in action.\n  My staff met with Mr. Baumel's mother, and she described a heart-\nwrenching account of over 17 years of trying to obtain information \nabout her son, Zachary, who in 1982, while serving in the Israeli \nmilitary, was captured after a tank battle with Syrian forces in \nLebanon. He has not been heard from since, and the only evidence she \nhas recovered is half of Mr. Baumel's dog tag which was delivered by \nYasser Arafat to the Israeli Government.\n  According to the Department of State, the Palestinian Authority has \nprovided information which could lead to locating and securing the \nreturn of Mr. Baumel. This contrasts with the total lack of cooperation \nfrom either Syrian or Lebanese authorities. The fact remains that Mr. \nBaumel's whereabouts remains a mystery.\n  I hope this Resolution gives some solace to the families of Mr. \nBaumel and the two other Israeli soldiers who are missing. Their \ndisappearance is unquestionably a matter of deep concern to the \nCongress. It is unconscionable that these families have yet to be told \nof the fate of their loved ones.\n  The amendment I have offered, which modifies one provision in HR 1175 \nthat is of particular interest to the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nof which I am Ranking Member, has been approved by both the House and \nSenate sponsors of the bill and the family of Mr. Baumel, and is \nsupported by the State Department. It was drafted in a sincere effort \nto make it more likely that this Resolution leads to the result that \nthe families intend, and to preserve the role of the United States \nGovernment as an honest broker in the Middle East peace process.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of the pending legislation, H.R. 1175, a bill to help locate \nand secure the return of Zachary Baumel, a citizen of the United \nStates, and two other Israeli soldiers who have been missing in action \nfor more than sixteen years. I introduced the Senate version of this \nlegislation, S. 676, which has gathered the support of 34 Senate \ncosponsors, and in June, the House passed H.R. 1175 by a recorded vote \nof 415-5.\n  Although information concerning the whereabouts of Sgt. Baumel and \nhis comrades has been reported since their disappearance after a battle \nin Northern Lebanon in 1982, Palestinian cooperation on this situation \nhas come to a halt as no new information has been forthcoming. This \nlegislation requires the State Department to raise this issue with the \nPalestinian Authority and the Syrian government and requires \ncooperation on this issue to be considered in future aid to the \nPalestinian Authority.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Helms, the Chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, for his leadership in moving this \nlegislation to the full Senate. The passage of this legislation is a \ncritical step in helping the families of these soldiers who have been \nforced to live with the pain and uncertainty of this loss for more than \n16 years. Resolving the issue of these Israeli MIAs can only strengthen \nAmerican efforts to make Middle East peace into a reality.\n  I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1620) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1175), as amended, was read the third time, and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10532-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10532-S10533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 800), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nissue of the Record.]\n\n\n                           E-911 ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nunanimously passed the ``e-911 Act of 1999.''\n  The e-911 bill is simple--it makes 911 the universal emergency \nnumber. This bill will help save lives and is supported by a broad \nrange of public safety, emergency medical, consumer and citizen groups. \nThese groups represent the operators and users of the 911 system, those \nwith direct experience with the problems with today's system.\n  Over seventy million Americans carry wireless telephones. Many carry \nthem for safety reasons. People count on those phones to be their \nlifelines in emergencies. In fact, 98,000 people are counting on their \nwireless phones in emergencies everyday. That is how many wireless 911 \ncalls are made a day, 98,000. But there's a problem. In many parts of \nour country, when the frantic parent or the suddenly disabled older \nperson punches 911 on the wireless phone, nothing happens. In those \nlocations, 911 is not the emergency number. The ambulance and the \npolice won't be coming. You may be facing a terrible emergency, but \nyou're on your own, because you don't know the local number to call for \nemergencies.\n  ``The e-911 Act of 1999'' will help fix that problem by making 911 \nthe number to call in an emergency--anytime, everywhere. The rule in \nAmerica ought to be uniform and simple--if you have an emergency, \nwherever you are, dial 911.\n  More and more, wireless communications is the critical link that can \nhelp get emergency medical care to those in the ``golden hour'' when \ntimely care can mean the difference between life and death.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work in passing this critical \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/05/senate-section/article/S10533-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDER FOR FILING LEGISLATIVE MATTERS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe injunction of secrecy be removed from the following convention \ntransmitted to the Senate on August 5, 1999, by the President of the \nUnited States, that being Convention No. 182 for Elimination of the \nWorst Forms of Child Labor, Treaty Document 106-5. I further ask that \nthe convention be considered as having been read the first time, that \nit be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, and the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification of the Convention (No. 182) Concerning the Prohibition and \nImmediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, \nadopted by the International Labor Conference at its 87th Session in \nGeneva on June 17, 1999, I transmit herewith a certified copy of that \nConvention. I transmit also for the Senate's information a certified \ncopy of a recommendation (No. 190) on the same subject, adopted by the \nInternational Labor Conference on the same date, which amplifies some \nof the Convention's provisions. No action is called for on the \nrecommendation.\n  The report of the Department of State, with a letter from the \nSecretary of Labor, concerning the Convention is enclosed.\n  As explained more fully in the enclosed letter from the Secretary of \nLabor, current United States law and practice satisfy the requirements \nof Convention No. 182. Ratification of this Convention, therefore, \nshould not require the United States to alter in any way its law or \npractice in this field.\n  In the interest of clarifying the domestic application of the \nConvention, my Administration proposes that two understandings \naccompany U.S. ratification.\n  The proposed understandings are as follows:\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\n  --The United States understands that Article 3(d) of Convention 182 \n    does not encompass situations in which children are employed by a \n    parent or by a person standing in the place of a parent on a farm \n    owned or operated by such parent or person.\n  --The United States understands that the term ``basic education'' in \n    Article 7 of Convention 182 means primary education plus one year: \n    eight or nine years of schooling, based on curriculum and not age.\n  These understandings would have no effect on our international \nobligations under Convention No. 182.\n  Convention No. 182 represents a true breakthrough for the children of \nthe world. Ratification of this instrument will enhance the ability of \nthe United States to provide global leadership in the effort to \neliminate the worst forms of child labor. I recommend that the Senate \ngive its advice and consent to the ratification of ILO Convention No. \n182.\n                                                  William J.
