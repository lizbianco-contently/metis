Mr. President, I give my thanks to Dr. Ogilvie, our \nSenate Chaplain, for arranging the visit of my good friend, Father Norm \nElliott. He was the pastor of the All Saints Episcopal Church in \nAnchorage and has been a close personal friend since the 1950s. We were \nboth, at that time, residents of Fairbanks, AK.\n  In 1980, our guest chaplain officiated at my marriage when Catherine \nand I were married. He has also officiated at the wedding of my \ndaughter Susan, my son Ted and my son Ben. In addition to that, he has \nchristened my daughter Lilly and my granddaughters and my grandson \nJohn.\n  He has been more than a close friend. He also performed the memorial \nservice for my first wife Ann and assisted at the dedication of the Ann \nStevens Red Cross Building in Anchorage.\n  Father Elliott was born in England and came to Detroit as a child. He \ncame to Alaska in 1951 at a time when our church considered service in \nAlaska as overseas duty. For half a century, he has ministered to the \npeople of our State. He has spent time in many small towns and villages \nin Alaska, such as Nenana, Eagle, Venetie, Beaver and Point Hope, just \nto name a few. In 1980, at my request, he was appointed to serve on the \nCommission of Alaska Natives. Members of that Commission were appointed \nby President Bush and Alaska's Gov. Wally Hickel. Father Elliott and \nmembers of that Commission spent 3 years traveling through Alaska to \nhelp our native people identify solutions to unique problems they face.\n  Norm is also chaplain of the Port of Anchorage, and he is the \nCivilian Episcopalian Chaplain for our Armed Forces in Alaska.\n  He is truly a dedicated man, dedicated to the word of God and to \nhelping others. I know that some, such as our distinguished President \npro tempore, would recall that Father Elliott visited us once before \nwhen he gave the opening prayer in 1981.\n  I am delighted that a cherished personal friend and advisor has been \nable to visit us today. Again, I thank my good friend, the Chaplain of \nthe Senate, for arranging that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/22/senate-section/article/S3027-6", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the American people should realize and \nunderstand that in his press conference just 2 days ago, President \nClinton talked about the justification for United States-led airstrikes \nagainst Serbian troops in Kosovo and that today we are apparently \nwithin hours--within hours--of going to war. He acknowledged that our \nU.S. pilots would be put at risk. And last week, the Pentagon's top \nmilitary commanders also warned those of us on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that there could be U.S. casualties if NATO launches \nairstrikes in an effort to pressure President Milosevic to accept the \npeace agreement that has been drafted by the U.S. and its allies and \napparently signed by the Kosovar Albanians.\n  General Michael Ryan, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said this:\n\n       There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in \n     trying to penetrate those defenses.\n\n  Our Marine Corps Commandant Charles Krulak said:\n\n       It is going to be tremendously dangerous. Serbian air \n     defenses are mobile, the terrain is very tough and the \n     weather cannot be underestimated.\n\n  General Krulak also said there were some bottom-line questions that \nstill need to be answered: What is the end game? What happens if the \nSerbs do not come to the table after the first airstrike? How long will \nthe strikes go on? Will our allies stay with us?\n  General Dennis Reimer, the Army Chief of Staff, also discussed the \nprobability--and I emphasize the word ``probability''--of sending 4,000 \nU.S. troops as part of the NATO peacekeeping force. He said:\n\n       The current commitment on the ground remains a still-\n     elusive peacekeeping argument. However, our troops earmarked \n     for that are prepared.\n\n  General Reimer agreed with the chairman of the committee, Senator \nJohn Warner, who warned of the massing of Serbian troops on the border \nof Kosovo preparing for extensive ground operations.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and the American public should \nunderstand, notwithstanding yet another round of last-minute diplomatic \nefforts by the administration's special envoy and the architect of U.S. \npolicy in the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, who is meeting with Mr. \nMilosevic as of today, the United States is preparing to go to war \nagainst the sovereign country of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \nand this air attack is very likely to be followed by U.S. ground \ntroops.\n  As former Senator Bob Dole said on ``Meet the Press'' yesterday, it \nis time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait in the Balkans.\n  Compounding the situation is the fact that the Russian Prime \nMinister, Mr. Primakov, a staunch opponent of airstrikes and an ally of \nMilosevic, will be in Washington tomorrow, and I think his visit really \npresents a unique problem. An attack during Primakov's visit would \ncertainly not help repair frayed U.S. and Russian relations. However, \nhe is not due to leave until Friday. In a real paradox, by meeting with \nMr. Primakov this week and delaying the attack, the administration may \nwell give Mr. Milosevic additional time to launch an offensive, an \noffensive, by the way, which is also happening now.\n  General Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, has warned time and again \nthat if no accord is reached, the Serb forces will resume fighting on a \nvery large scale, and that is happening.\n  As the debate showed in the House of Representatives several weeks \nago, and as the debate also continues in this body as of today and \ntomorrow, many in the Congress are concerned and frustrated and torn. \nSome support airstrikes and some do not. Some support ground troops; \nmore do not. But we all agree, I think, that the Congress and the \nAmerican people certainly deserve a better explanation of the \nadministration's policy in the Balkans.\n\n  It is not that we have not asked the administration for \nclarification. Last July, I offered an amendment to the defense \nappropriations bill that required the President to come before the \nAmerican people and the Congress before he committed the U.S. to a \nmilitary involvement in Kosovo. The amendment was not prejudicial. It \nsimply required the President to make the case as to why intervention \nin Kosovo was in our vital national security interest.\n  The language contained in section 8115 of Public Law 105-262--and it \nis the law of the land--unambiguously states that none of the funds \nappropriated or otherwise made available under the act may be obligated \nor expended for any additional deployment of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States unless and until the President, in consultation with the \nleadership of the Congress, transmits to Congress a report that \nincludes the following:\n  No. 1: certification that the presence of those forces to be deployed \nis necessary to the national security interests of the United States;\n  No. 2: the reasons why the deployment is in the national security \ninterest;\n  No. 3: the number of military personnel to be deployed;\n  No. 4: the mission and objectives of forces to be deployed;\n  No. 5: the expected time schedule for accomplishing the objectives of \nthe deployment;\n  No. 6: the exit strategy;\n  No. 7: the costs;\n  And lastly,\n  No. 8: the anticipated effects on the morale, the retention and the \neffectiveness of United States forces.\n  Mr. President, although our United States pilots are about to take \npart in an air attack that will put them in harm's way, to be followed \nby some 4,000 ground troops, that report--that report--required by \nlaw--has not been submitted to the Congress.\n  Last week, in the briefing that was conducted by Secretary of State \nAlbright, National Security Council Chairman Berger, and Secretary of \nDefense Cohen, I again asked if the report would be forthcoming. I \nasked if the latest briefing--requested, by the way, by our Majority \nLeader Lott--served in lieu of the report. The response of Mr. Berger \nwas unclear to me, but in past conversations in previous briefings he \nsaid the administration should and could answer all the questions \ninvolved, and that the report would be made ``at the appropriate \ntime.''\n  With the attack imminent, it would seem now is the appropriate time. \nAs a matter of fact, with all due respect to the administration, \nsubmitting such a report would not be difficult and it would be \nhelpful. If the administration thinks--and they apparently think--that \nthis is the case, that threats of military action may alter the \nbehavior of the Serbs, of Milosevic, what clearer signal of intent to \nforcibly stop the violence against the Albanians than the President of \nthe United States laying out the issues to Congress and the American \npeople?\n  Perhaps we can do the administration a favor today. In answering \nthese questions, required by public law, let us simply take public \nstatements from the President and his Cabinet officers, as well as \nstatements made in briefings to the Congress that have been reported in \nthe public press.\n  As a Member of both the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees, I want to emphasize there should not and cannot be any \ndisclosure of military details of any proposed action, the timing of \nthe action or the types or selection of various weapon platforms.\n  Let's take the reporting requirements--1, 2, and then 4. They ask the \nPresident to describe why deploying to Kosovo is in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States as well as\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nwhat specific objectives our forces will have once on the ground in the \nprovince.\n  They are of particular importance because it will be these goals for \nwhich our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines will be risking their \nlives. Let me put it another way. Should a father, a mother, a husband \nor a wife--or any family member--have to ask, ``For what did my son or \ndaughter, husband or wife, mom or dad die for?'' the answers to these \nquestions will have to suffice.\n  Questions Nos. 1 and 2:\n  Certify the presence of forces to be deployed is necessary to the \nnational security interests of the United States and the reasons why \nthe deployment is in the national security interest.\n  Here is the answer that I am suggesting to the Clinton \nadministration. President Clinton, taken from President Clinton's press \nconference last Friday: It could be in the report. I am quoting the \nPresident:\n\n       A part of my responsibility is to try to leave to my \n     successors, and to our country in the 21st century, an \n     environment in Europe that is stable, humane and secure. It \n     will be a big part of America's future.\n\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       As we prepare to act, we need to remember the lessons \n     learned in the Balkans. We should remember the horror of the \n     war in Bosnia, the sounds of sniper fire aimed at children, \n     the faces of young men behind barbed wire, the despairing \n     voices of those who thought nothing could be done. It took \n     precious time to achieve allied unity there, but when we did, \n     our firmness ended all that. Bosnia is now at peace.\n\n  I continue to quote the President:\n\n       Make no mistake, if we and our allies do not have the will \n     to act, there will be more massacres. In dealing with \n     aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill. \n     But, action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.\n\n  And then the President goes on to specifically talk about why he \nthinks this is in our national interest. And it should be made part of \nthe report, if he would simply submit it to the congressional \nleadership. He said:\n\n       We must also understand our stake in peace in the Balkans \n     and in Kosovo. This is a humanitarian crisis, but it is much \n     more. This is a conflict with no boundaries. It threatens our \n     national interests. If it continues, it will push refugees \n     across borders, and draw in neighboring countries. It will \n     undermine the credibility of NATO, on which stability in \n     Europe and our own credibility depend. It will likely \n     reignite the historical animosities, including those that can \n     embrace Albania, Macedonia, Greece, even Turkey. These \n     divisions still have the potential to make the next century a \n     truly violent one for that part of the world that straddles \n     Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n       Unquestionably, there are risks in military action, if that \n     becomes necessary. U.S. and other NATO pilots will be put in \n     harm's way. The Serbs have a strong air defense system. But, \n     we must weigh those risks against the risks of inaction. If \n     we don't act, the war will spread. If it spreads, we will not \n     be able to contain it without far greater risk and cost. I \n     believe the real challenge of our foreign policy today is to \n     deal with problems before they do permanent harm to our vital \n     interests. That is what we must do in Kosovo.\n\n  Finally, the President said this:\n\n       One of the things that I wanted to do when I became \n     president is to take advantage of this moment in history to \n     build an alliance with Europe for the 21st century, with a \n     European undivided, strong, secure, prosperous and at peace. \n     That is why I have supported the unification of Europe \n     financially, politically, economically. That is why I've \n     supported the expansion of NATO and a redefinition of its \n     missions.\n\n  Here is another answer that the administration could include in the \nreport to the Congress as justification for an attack on Serbia and \nwhether or not this is in our vital national interest.\n  Secretary of State Albright: This is taken from press accounts of \ncongressional briefings. Six reasons:\n  No. 1: the Balkans represent a bridge between Europe and the Middle \nEast and therefore are of strategic interest.\n  No. 2: unless we stop this conflict, it will spin into Albania, \nMacedonia, Greece and Turkey. The First World War started there. \nAnother could again.\n  No. 3: we have a humanitarian obligation to stop massacres and \nrefugee flight.\n  No. 4: what we do in Kosovo has a direct bearing on what has been \nachieved in Bosnia.\n  No. 5: what we do in Kosovo represents our leadership role in NATO, \nthe credibility of NATO; both relevant to the future of NATO into the \nnext century.\n  And lastly, No. 6: it is in our national interest to oppose Serb \naggression.\n  One more answer: Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, February 25, 1999:\n\n       First, we have a clear interest in protecting stability in \n     a key part of Europe and our investment in Bosnia. If we \n     don't stop the conflict in Kosovo, it could draw in \n     Albania and Macedonia, potentially threaten our NATO \n     allies in Greece and Turkey and thereby divide the \n     alliance.\n       Second, We have an important interest in averting another \n     humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo. Continued conflict also \n     would create new opportunities for international terrorists, \n     drug smugglers and criminals.\n       Third, America has a clear interest in ending years of Serb \n     repression by strengthening democracy, upholding the rule of \n     law including the valuable contribution of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and protecting \n     human rights.\n       Finally, persisting conflict in Kosovo would undermine \n     NATO's credibility as the guarantor of peace and stability in \n     the Balkans and U.S. credibility as one of the leaders of \n     NATO.\n\n  Now, there, I have submitted the administration's report as to why \nthis is in our national interest, a report that has not been \nforthcoming, by simply quoting the President, the Secretary of State, \nand the Undersecretary of State. Whether or not you think that adds up \nto a rationale as to why we should be going to war is another question, \nbut at least it is there.\n\n  Question No. 3 that is required by public law: Please provide the \nnumber of military personnel to be deployed.\n  Answer: In numerous press reports, President Clinton and various \ndefense officials have stated the United States will commit up to 4,000 \ntroops for deployment to enforce a peace agreement. However, the number \nof U.S. personnel who provide intelligence, logistical support, \nextraction capability, and offshore platforms is not available.\n  Question No. 4: What are the mission and objectives of the forces to \nbe deployed?\n  Answer: In regard to the airstrike, the press reports as of today \nstate:\n\n       NATO plans call first for a short, sharp demonstration \n     airstrike consisting mainly of cruise missiles. [Casualty \n     avoidance--those are my words not the press commentary.] If \n     Mr. Milosevic does not submit, NATO, after additional \n     consultation, [with our allies] plans to launch a sustained \n     and rigorous bombing campaign that could last as long as a \n     week.\n\n  The report went on to say:\n\n       A combination of U.S. cruise missiles and up to 400 \n     American and European fighter jets would attempt to take out \n     Serbia's command and control structures and its air defense \n     system and also to strip Serbia's military in Kosovo of its \n     ability to attack Kosovo fighters.\n\n  Just for the record again, the same press reports stress senior U.S. \nmilitary officers have warned the Congress the air mission over Serbia \nwould be tremendously dangerous with a high risk of NATO casualties.\n  Question No. 5, as required in the report: The expected schedule for \naccomplishing the objectives of the deployment.\n  Answer: It is not available--or at least it is not available on all \nthe press reports, the briefings, and the information I have been able \nto obtain in regard to this weekend and in many previous months.\n  Question No. 6: The exit strategy for the United States forces \nengaged in the deployment.\n  I want all of my colleagues to pay attention to this response; this \nis the exit strategy.\n  Answer: American negotiator Christopher Hill, in discussing the \nnegotiated peace agreement, has stated in the press that under the \nagreement, Serbia would remain sovereign over Kosovo for the next 3 \nyears. Under the NATO peacekeeping force, including the 4,000 \nAmericans, the Kosovo Liberation Army would disband and the Serbs would \nwithdraw all but security forces.\n  That is certainly not the case as of today. However, Under Secretary \nof State Thomas Pickering, again, in a very cogent and a very \ncomprehensive briefing in response said before the committee February \n25:\n\n       With respect to our exit strategy, we have learned from our \n     experience in Bosnia that we should not set artificial \n     deadlines. Rather, we should seek to create the conditions \n     for self-sustaining peace so that the timing and \n     circumstances for the reduction and ending of the presence of \n     an international military force is well defined. There are a \n     series of core conditions--apparently what will\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n     have to take place in regard to Kosovo before the 4,000 \n     troops--or how many would be deployed there as peacekeepers--\n     could exit:\n\n  One, military stability including the swift and orderly departure of \nall Serb forces except those required for border security; two, \nreplacement of Serb security forces with a functioning, local, \nrepresentative police force; elections that meet international \nstandards; and establishment of legitimate political institutions that \nwould provide for substantial and sustained Kosovar autonomy.\n  That is a pretty tall order. That is a pretty tall order. We have \nseen the situation in Bosnia where we were to be there for 1 year; we \nhave been there for 4 so far. It is now $10 to $12 billion. As we \nlearned in the Balkans, time limits don't mean too much.\n  Question No. 7, as required by the amendment in the defense \nappropriations bill in regard to a report that has not been \nforthcoming: The costs associated with the deployment and the funding \nsources for paying these costs.\n  Answer: Assistant Secretary of Defense Kenneth Bacon on February 29: \nWe have calculated or estimated the cost of what it would be to send \nthe U.S. portion of a peacekeeping force into Kosovo. That would be \nabout $1.5 to $2 billion a year but no decision will be made on sending \npeacekeepers in until there is a peace agreement.\n  Again, the Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, who has been \nvery candid before the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``An additional \nimportant element''--now, just stop here for a minute. It will be $2 \nbillion a year at least for 3 years and perhaps more.\n  Then, Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering in a very candid \nstatement said:\n\n       An additional important element in ensuring an effective \n     and sustainable agreement will be international assistance \n     for Kosovo. The U.S. plans to make a substantial contribution \n     to bolster European Union efforts. We have requested $50 \n     million as part of the 2000 fiscal year budget request. We \n     anticipate identifying additional funds needed to support the \n     civilian implementation aspects of the agreement including \n     funds to:\n       Repair damaged infrastructure--\n\n  The thought has just occurred to me, if we have airstrikes in Kosovo \nand Serbia and we destroy the infrastructure, we are now making the \npromise to send funds to repair the damaged infrastructure--\n\n       Stimulate economic growth in Kosovo through microlending;\n       Support free elections;\n       Assist in the establishment both of communal police units \n     and an independent Judiciary system.\n\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that will add up to a great deal more \nmoney than the $2 billion a year. I can find no statement by the \nadministration as to how they will request these funds. I assume they \nwould come under an emergency supplemental, very similar to the one we \nare discussing on the floor today.\n  Finally, question No. 8: The anticipated effects of the deployment on \nthe morale, retention, and effectiveness of the United States forces.\n  While I think this is certainly needed, there is no answer that is \navailable.\n  So that is it. Albeit, with very limited time and access to \ninformation over this weekend, and probably with some degree a lack of \nexpertise, I have tried to piece together the response that the \nadministration could make within a consultation requirement--a \nrequirement again stated in public law--that would certainly help in \nthe debate we are having today in regard to U.S. policy in the Balkans.\n\n  I have to say, with all due respect to the rationale behind this \npolicy, I believe there are a great many more questions that remain \nthat should have been answered before now, before, once again, U.S. \ncredibility is on the line. As a matter of fact, last Friday the \nsituation was summed up aptly by Mr. Fred Hiatt, a columnist with the \nWashington Post. The column was entitled ``The Credibility Factor.'' I \nask unanimous consent to have the full article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 21, 1999]\n\n                         The Credibility Factor\n\n                            (By Fred Hiatt)\n\n       ``It's well known,'' an administration spokesman said last \n     week, that the President is ``a tactician and not a \n     strategist, and maybe looks to the next day and not the day \n     after.''\n       The official was talking about Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic. But the description seemed oddly apt for President \n     Clinton, too. When the two face off, as they are now doing \n     over Kosovo, that puts the United States at a disadvantage. A \n     tactician with a free totalitarian hand will always have the \n     initiative over one operating in a democracy.\n       This isn't to say that Clinton is the moral equivalent of \n     Milosevic, one of the reprehensible war criminals of this \n     decade. But Clinton is always inclined toward the easy, \n     short-term win, the half-way solution; and he has been \n     willing to sacrifice truth and to slight principle to achieve \n     his daily victories.\n       Now, when he should be building support in Congress and \n     among the public for a difficult but necessary confrontation, \n     he is paying a price for that record. With good reason, many \n     voters do not believe he has thought out the consequences of \n     his Kosovo policy; in the post-impeachment era, many members \n     of Congress do not believe him, period.\n       The tactical victories Clinton has achieved with deception \n     are considerable. During the impeachment trial, it became \n     almost a cliche to attack the President for not having come \n     clean as soon as Ken Starr began nosing around. If he had \n     just 'fessed up in the first place, went the refrain, the \n     country would have been spared this long trauma.\n       As a matter of principle, of course that was true. But \n     tactically Clinton was right and his critics were wrong. If \n     Clinton had said back in January 1997 that, yes, he had been \n     using the Oval Office for sexual encounters with an intern \n     and, yes, he had lied about this under oath during a civil \n     deposition and, no, he didn't consider oral sex to be sex--he \n     might not have survived the week. But he lied about ``that \n     woman'' and survived the week, and the next week, and the one \n     after that.\n       You could say his tactical dissembling has paid off in \n     foreign policy, too. When he was dispatching troops to Bosnia \n     in 1995, he promised they'd be there for only one year. The \n     promise helped him win acquiescence from a reluctant \n     Congress, and there wasn't much Congress could do when one \n     year rolled into another and the troops did not come home.\n       Sending troops was the right thing to do, and keeping them \n     there beyond a year was right, too. Any maybe, given doubts \n     in Congress and the country, Clinton's way was the only one \n     that would have worked. Maybe honest leadership wouldn't have \n     carried the day. We'll never know.\n       What we do know is that his method of operation--his search \n     for the risk-free alternative, his reluctance to spend \n     political capital, to fully confront or explain the long-term \n     consequences of policy--has a cumulative, corrosive effect. \n     Clinton wouldn't push for U.S. troops to arrest war criminals \n     or assist in the return of refugees, so Bosnia is farther \n     from real peace than it should be--and the troops will have \n     to stay longer as a result.\n       Among foes such as Milosevic, Clinton's credibility \n     diminishes with each unbacked threat, each inflated claim of \n     success for pinprick bombings, each recall of military force \n     even once dispatched. Diminished credibility means, in the \n     long run, a greater likelihood that force will have to be \n     used.\n       Now all these chickens--the diminished credibility abroad, \n     the skepticism at home, above all the unwillingness to \n     fashion a strategy--are coming to roost in Kosovo. Clinton \n     has threatened to bomb Milosevic yet again. Maybe this time \n     he means it. But then what? Clinton also has promised that \n     U.S. troops will not be sent into a ``non-permissive'' \n     environment. They will enter Kosovo, in other words, only \n     when Milosevic welcomes them in.\n       ``These are incompatible objectives,'' Sen. Gordon Smith \n     said in an interview. A freshman Republican from Oregon who \n     chairs the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Europe, \n     Smith is no isolationist; he has said he would support a \n     dispatch of U.S. troops to Kosovo under the right \n     circumstances. But he worries that Clinton has no credible \n     plan.\n       Perhaps a round of U.S. bombing will compel Milosevic to \n     call off his war against Kosovo civilians, sign a peace \n     treaty and admit NATO troops. But what it if doesn't? What if \n     Milosevic responds, instead, with a bloody crackdown in \n     Pristina and villages through the province? Clinton, to \n     assuage his fretful military commanders, has already promised \n     not to follow air power with troops. But air power can't \n     solve every problem.\n       If NATO bombs, Smith said, it should no longer pretend to \n     be neutral. ``The problem is Milosevic,'' he said. ``If you \n     go along that path, go to win.''\n       Is Clinton prepared to see it through? On Friday he made a \n     case for bombing, but did not explain what might come next, \n     nor why those next steps would be worth the risk to U.S. life \n     and treasure? Time enough tomorrow, or maybe the day after.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. In part he stated:\n\n       Among foes such as Milosevic, Clinton's credibility \n     diminishes with each unbacked threat, each inflated claim of \n     success for pinprick bombings, each recall of military force \n     even once dispatched.

Maybe \n     this time he\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\n     means it. [I think he does.] But then what? Clinton also has \n     promised that U.S. troops will not be sent into a ``non-\n     permissive'' environment. They will enter Kosovo, in other \n     words, only when Milosevic welcomes them in.\n       ``These are incompatible objectives.'' [He is quoting my \n     colleague and my friend from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith, \n     who said in an interview--and, by the way, Senator Smith is \n     the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \n     Europe] [he] is no isolationists; he has said he would \n     support a dispatch of U.S. troops to Kosovo under the right \n     circumstances.

But air power can't solve every \n     problem.\n       If NATO bombs, [Senator] Smith said, it should no longer \n     pretend to be neutral. ``The problem is Milosevic,'' he said. \n     ``If you go along that path, go to win.''\n\n  I certainly associate myself with the comments of Senator Smith.\n\n       Is Clinton [is this Congress and are the American public] \n     prepared to see it through? On Friday, he made a case for \n     bombing [and the intervention] but did not explain what might \n     come next, nor why those next steps would be worth the risk \n     to U.S. life and treasure. Time enough tomorrow, or maybe the \n     day after.\n\n  That was the conclusion of the editorial.\n  I have questions, but I am not going to take too much time to go over \nall the questions I have as a result of the statements that have been \nmade. But in regard to Kosovo, what is the end state? What do we want \nto see in Kosovo once we are done doing whatever it is we plan to do?\n  If we don't want to support the independence and secession of the \nKosovars, why are we serving as their air force?\n  How do we know we have ever attained our aims?\n  What are the measures of merit?\n  How long might it take?\n  We have talked about an exit strategy. I think we should focus on \nstrategy; that is, on what we are trying to achieve, through what \nmeans, and how do we know we are done?\n\n  I don't accept the argument in regard to NATO credibility, or that \nNATO credibility is on the line, as an answer to why we should go \nthere. NATO's credibility is sky high. Just ask all the nations who \nwant to get in.\n  How is bombing conducive to peaceful conflict resolution? Have we \never been able to bomb a country into submission so that they would \nagree with our point of view? What if initial strikes don't attain the \ndesired effect? How far are we willing to go to compel the Serbs to \nbend to our will? What are the risks? Why send peacekeepers when there \nis no peace to be kept and neither side wants to compromise? It seems \nthat is the case.\n  Why are we seeking to compel a sovereign nation--by the way, \nYugoslavia was a founding member of the U.N.--to cede its territorial \nsovereignty to a guerrilla movement? What message does this send to \nother secessionists worldwide?\n  How do you explain supporting Yeltsin in fighting to keep Chechnya \nwithin the Russian Federation, at a cost of about 50,000 casualties--\nindeed, comparing the Russian action to the American Civil War and, by \nimplication, Yeltsin to Lincoln--and bombing the Serbs for trying to \nkeep their country together? That is a point of view.\n  Which of the many Kosovar factions are we supporting? How much top-\ndown control and professional discipline do we expect from all sides \ninvolved?\n  The mission order for Bosnia, which has been referred to as a good \ncase study for Kosovo, was, ``Attack across the Sava River,'' and we \nwent in with overwhelming force, which we then scaled down as the \nthreat receded. We are doing it the other way regarding Kosovo. Why \naren't we following that model? Remember the strategic insight of an \n18-year-old Marine in Beirut: ``If we are here to fight, we are too \nfew; if we are here to die, we are too many.''\n  All of these questions I have mentioned--some of which I share with a \ngreat deal of support from others--I think certainly should be debated, \nshould certainly come to the floor. That has not been the case. I do \nhope the administration will submit their report soon. I hope they \ndon't submit the report after the President has given the order and the \ntroops are there, for at that time every Member of the Senate and House \nwill certainly want to support our troops.\n  I worry about this, Mr. President. We are going to war. The President \nhas spoken to the issue, other Cabinet officials have spoken to the \nissue, but many questions remain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/22/senate-section/article/S3031-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3031-S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TOBACCO SETTLEMENT FUNDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nvital to improving health care in America--specifically, whether the \nStates are actually going to use a portion of the billions of dollars \nthey received in tobacco settlement funds to keep America's youngsters \nfrom starting to smoke. The Senate has discussed this issue over the \nlast few weeks, but I think it may be appropriate to have a new context \nas we go forward with these discussions.\n  To get an indication of how the tobacco industry believes it is doing \nand why the Senate ought to be concerned about this issue, you can take \na look at how the tobacco industry assesses its executives' job \nperformance. Recently, the public got a look at information concerning \nthe 1998 compensation packages for several of the CEOs of the major \ntobacco companies. The combined compensation package for the CEO of \nPhilip Morris and the CEO of RJR equals $36 million.\n  Last week, Mr. President, you and I marked up the Federal budget in \nthe Budget Committee with our colleagues, but even when you spend a \nweek dealing with the Federal budget, $36 million certainly sounds like \na lot of money.\n  I am not against CEOs being compensated for their work. My guess is \nthat the CEOs, in this case, earn their salaries. I don't think they \nwould be pulling down $36 million a year unless they were doing a \npretty good job of keeping the ashtrays filled in America.\n  Now, the combined compensation packages for just these two CEOs is \nmore than 39 of our States and the District of Columbia would have \nreceived under the legislation Congress voted on last week. Let me be \nclear. Two of the tobacco CEOs were making more money in 1998 than the \nvast majority of our States would have received for programs to keep \nyoung people from getting started with tobacco.\n  For example, my home State of Oregon would receive just over $15 \nmillion under the legislation which was considered last week. That is \nless than half of the CEOs' compensation. The State of Wyoming would \nhave received $3.61 million, 10 percent of the combined compensation \npackages. I believe that the traditional targets of tobacco in \nharvesting new smokers--women, children, and minorities--are certainly \nworth 10 percent of the combined compensation for 1 year of these two \nexecutives.\n  Let us also remember that it is not just the money the tobacco \nindustry is spending on high-priced executives that the Congress should \nbe concerned about. There is another threat to our children, and that \ncomes from the $5 billion the tobacco industry spent last year on \nadvertising and marketing. That is $96.2 million every week, or $13.7 \nmillion every day. Again, that is far more than many of our States \nwould have received to protect young people from smoking.\n  Last year, in the Senate Commerce Committee, I wanted to make sure \nthat the individuals who had historically been targeted by the tobacco \ncompanies would have been eligible to receive funds for tobacco control \nand prevention programs. I wanted to make sure that just as the tobacco \ncompanies have poured billions of dollars into advertising in the inner \ncities and for ads targeted to children, the Federal Government would \nmake a special effort to prevent smoking in those communities.\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\n  I continue to believe the Federal Government needs to play an \nactivist role in assuring that populations which historically have been \ntargeted by the tobacco industry would be armed with good information \nand good preventive kinds of services, so that the tobacco companies \nwould know that our communities are fighting back.\n  Let me give you an example of some of the steps that the tobacco \ncompanies may be pursuing in the days ahead to circumvent efforts by \nthe Federal Government such as those we discussed last week.\n  We know the tobacco companies are now test marketing cigarettes which \nproduce less smoke so that individuals around the smoker will not be \nbothered in the same way as they were so often in the past. Yet, one of \nthe cigarettes, the Eclipse, made by RJR, is showing even more signs of \nbeing dangerous to the smoker. With the Eclipse, the evidence shows \nthat smokers may actually be breathing in glass fibers in addition to \nother carcinogens.\n  I think it is important that the Senate understand this as we go \nforward with further discussions about how the tobacco settlement funds \nare going to be used. If the Federal Government wishes to waive its \nportion of the billions of dollars involved in the tobacco settlement, \nlet's make sure that at least a portion of this money--at least a \nmodest portion--is used to protect future generations of Americans \nagainst the tobacco industry.\n  I hope the Congress won't pass up another opportunity to protect \nAmerica's youngsters. I urge my colleagues to continue to try to assure \nthat some portion of the dollars secured in the tobacco settlement are \nactually used for health services for American's children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart prepared by the \nNational Center for Tobacco-Free Kids which compares the compensation \npackage of just two of the tobacco CEOs with the money that would have \nbeen received by the States under the Senate legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCOMPARISON OF AMOUNT STATES WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SPEND ON TOBACCO\n  PREVENTION UNDER THE SPECTER-HARKIN AMENDMENT WITH CEOS' COMPENSATION\n                       FROM RJR AND

Mr. President, this week we will have the budget for the \nNation before the Senate for consideration. I want to speak now on that \nbudget, and give special focus and attention to the concerns I have \nabout how that budget was put together and its particular implications \nwith regard to Social Security and to Medicare, and also with regard to \nother domestic priorities. Then I will express my concern on the \npriority that the Republican budget has given to tax cuts and how that \nrelates to the Nation's priorities and to the Nation's needs.\n  Mr. President, the Republican FY2000 budget resolution fails to meet \nthe nation's priorities.\n  It claims that it will extend the solvency of the Social Security \nTrust Fund. In reality, it would prevent President Clinton's proposed \ntransfer of surplus funds to protect this important program for future \ngenerations.\n  The Republican budget claims that it will set aside money for \nMedicare. In reality, it squanders those funds to pay for a tax cut for \nthe rich.\n  The Republican budget claims that it will improve education. In \nreality, it slashes funds for critical programs like Head Start, job \ntraining, and student aid to pay for increases in education.\n  On the subject of Social Security, the Republican budget is an \nexercise in deception. The rhetoric surrounding the budget itself \nconveys the impression that the majority have taken a major step \ntowards protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to \nstrengthen Social Security. Their budget would not provide one \nadditional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees, nor would it \nextend the life of the trust fund by even one day. It merely recommits \nto Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund \nunder current law. That is all their so-called ``lockbox'' does.\n  By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 \ntrillion new dollars of the budget surplus to Social Security over the \nnext 15 years. By doing so, his budget would extend the life of the \ntrust fund by more than a generation--to beyond 2050.\n  Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide the new revenue to \nextend the life of the Social Security trust fund, it does not even \neffectively guarantee that the existing payroll tax revenue will be \nused to pay Social Security benefits. In essence, there is a trapdoor \nin the Republican lockbox. Their plan would allow Social Security \npayroll taxes to be used to finance unspecified ``reforms''. This \nloophole opens the door to schemes to privatize Social Security by \nturning it over to the tender mercy of the private insurance industry. \nSuch a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's \nfinancial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep \nbenefit cuts.\n  A genuine ``lockbox'' would prevent any such diversion of funds. A \ngenuine ``lockbox'' would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars \nwould be used to protect Social Security, not undermine it.\n  While the Republicans claim that they, too, support using the surplus \nfor debt reduction, they are still unwilling to use it in a way that \nwill help save Social Security for future generations. There is a \nfundamental difference between the parties on how the savings\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nwhich will result from debt reduction should be used. The Federal \nGovernment will realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As \na result, billions of dollars which would have been required to pay \ninterest on the national debt will become available each year for other \npurposes. President Clinton believes those debt savings should be used \nto strengthen Social Security. I wholeheartedly agree. But the \nRepublicans refuse to commit those dollars to Social Security. Their \nbudget does nothing to increase Social Security's ability to pay full \nbenefits to future generations of retirees. Again, they are short-\nchanging Social Security while pretending to save it.\n  Currently, the Federal Government spends more than 11 cents of every \nbudget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By \nusing the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next 15 \nyears, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of every \nbudget dollar by the year 2014 and to zero by 2018. Such prudent fiscal \nmanagement now will produce an enormous savings to the Government in \nfuture years. Since it is payroll tax revenues which made the debt \nreduction possible, those savings should, in turn, be used to \nstrengthen Social Security when it needs additional revenue to finance \nthe baby boomers' retirement.\n  Rather than paying interest to bond-holding investors today, our plan \nwould use that money to finance Social Security benefits tomorrow. This \nis analogous to the situation of a couple with young children and a \nmortgage. They know they will have a major expense 15 years down the \nroad when their children reach college age. They use their extra money \nnow to pay down their home mortgage ahead of schedule. As a result, in \n15 years the mortgage will be greatly reduced or even paid off. Thus, \nthe dollars that were going to pay the mortgage each month will be \navailable to finance college for their children. In the same way the \nFederal Government is reducing its debt over the next 15 years so that \nit can apply the savings to Social Security in the future.\n  That is what the President's budget proposes. It would provide an \nadditional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most of it in debt service \nsavings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the current level of \nSocial Security benefits would be fully financed for all future \nrecipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently reasonable \nplan, but Republican Members of Congress oppose it.\n  The budget Republicans have brought to the floor does not provide one \nnew dollar to finance Social Security benefits. What it does provide is \nnearly 800 billion new dollars for tax cuts over the next decade. Tax \ncuts, not strengthening Social Security, is their first priority. \nBudgets speak louder than words. The actual Republican budget tells us \nmuch more candidly than their rhetoric about the GOP's goal of tax cuts \nat the expense of Social Security.\n  Mr. President, in addition to claims of extending the solvency of the \nSocial Security trust fund, this budget would prevent the President's \nproposed transfer of surplus funds to protect important programs for \nfuture generations. The Republican budget claims that it will set aside \nmoney for Medicare, but in reality it squanders those funds to pay for \na tax cut. This is unacceptable. Even worse is the Republican attempt \nto privatize Medicare--or use the crisis in Medicare financing that \ntheir budget will create as an excuse to promote their extreme agenda \nof slashing Medicare benefits and turning over the program to private \ninsurance companies.\n  This is the same agenda that Republicans pursued unsuccessfully in \n1995 and 1996, and it was the agenda rejected by President Clinton and \nDemocrats in Congress and the American people. But now our Republican \nfriends are at it again.\n\n  According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if \nwe do nothing else, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25 years will \nrequire benefit cuts of almost 20 percent--massive cuts of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. The President's plan makes up that shortfall, \nwithout any benefit cuts, by investing 15 percent of the surplus in the \nTrust Fund. This investment avoids the need for any benefit cuts for at \nleast the next 21 years. It also gives us time to develop policies that \ncan reduce Medicare costs without also reducing the health care that \nthe elderly need and deserve.\n  But Republicans in Congress have a different agenda. They want to use \nthe surplus to grant undeserved tax breaks to the wealthiest \nAmericans--and then use the Medicare shortfall as an excuse to slash \nthe program and turn it over to private insurance companies.\n  Republicans on the Budget Committee had a clear opportunity to \npreserve, protect and improve Medicare. All they had to do was to adopt \nthe President's proposal for investing 15% of the surplus in Medicare. \nInstead of protecting Medicare, they use the surplus to pay for \nbillions of dollars in new tax breaks for the wealthy. You don't need a \ndegree in higher mathematics to understand what is going on here.\n  Because the Republican budget does nothing to preserve and protect \nMedicare, their proposals add up to billions of dollars in Medicare \ncuts.\n  Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren \nknow, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are \nalready stretched to the limit--and sometimes beyond the limit--to \npurchase the health care they need today. Because of gaps in Medicare \nand high health care costs, Medicare now covers only about 50% of the \nhealth care costs of senior citizens. On average, senior citizens spend \n19% of their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need--\nalmost as large a proportion as they had to pay before Medicare was \nenacted a generation ago. Many senior citizens have to pay even more as \na proportion of their income. By 2025, if we do nothing, that \nproportion will have risen to 29%. Too often, even with today's \nMedicare benefits, the elderly have to choose between putting food on \nthe table, paying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need.\n  The typical Medicare beneficiary is a single woman, seventy-six years \nold, living alone, with an annual income of approximately $10,000. She \nhas one or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. \nThese are the women whose benefits Republicans want to cut to pay for \nnew tax breaks for the wealthy. These are the women who will be unable \nto see a doctor, or will go without needed prescription drugs, or who \nwill go without meals or heat, so that wealthy Americans earning \nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year can have additional thousands \nof dollars a year in tax breaks.\n  This is the wrong priority--and Americans know it is the wrong \npriority, even if Republicans in Congress do not.\n  We all recall that four years ago, Republicans in Congress also tried \nto cut Medicare to pay for new tax breaks for the wealthy. They sought \nto cut Medicare by $270 billion to pay for $240 billion worth of tax \ncuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations. Under their \nproposals, senior citizens would have seen their premiums skyrocket--an \nadditional $2,400 for senior couples over the budget period. The \ndeductible that senior citizens pay to see a physician would have \ndoubled. The Medicare eligibility age would have been raised to 67. \nProtections against extra billing by doctors would have been rolled \nback. Under the guise of preserving Medicare, Republicans also proposed \nto turn the program over to private insurance companies, and force \nsenior citizens to give up their family doctors and join HMOs. But \nPresident Clinton and Democrats in Congress stood firm against these \nregressive proposals, and they were not enacted into law.\n  Now, Republicans on the Finance Committee and House Ways and Means \nCommittee are at it again. They are already drafting new Medicare \n``reform'' plans. No details have been revealed. But the funds already \nearmarked for tax breaks for the wealthy under the Republican budget \nproposal means that there is no alternative to the harsh cuts in \nMedicare. No wonder so many senior citizens believe that G.O.P. stands \nfor ``Get Old People.'' The Republican elephant never learns.\n  As we debate these issues this week, the Republican response is \npredictable. They will deny that they have any plans to cut Medicare. \nBut the American people will not be fooled. They know that the \nPresident's plan will put Medicare on a sound financial footing for the \nnext two decades--without benefit cuts, without tax increases, and\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nwithout raising the retirement age. They also know that the Republican \nplan will take the surplus intended for Medicare and squander it on new \ntax breaks for the wealthy. They know that the Republican plan for \nMedicare is benefit cuts and additional burdens on the elderly, not the \nhonest protection our senior citizens deserve.\n  This week, Democrats will offer amendments to assure that this year's \nbudget protects Medicare, rather than destroying it. Under our \nproposals, all of the funds the President has proposed to devote to \nMedicare will be put into the Medicare Trust Fund. Our amendments will \nassure that Medicare will be solvent for the next 21 years, without \nbenefit cuts or tax increases or raising the retirement age. \nRepublicans will have a chance to vote on whether they are sincere \nabout protecting Medicare--and the vote on our amendments will test \nwhether they care more about senior citizens or the wealthy.\n  The choice is clear. The Congress must act to preserve the benefits \nthat senior citizens have earned, instead of granting new tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest Americans.\n  Just as important as preserving and protecting Medicare is improving \nit. And the most important single step we can take to improve Medicare \nis to provide prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. Medicare \nis a compact between workers and their government that says, ``Work \nhard, pay into the system when you are young, and Medicare will provide \nhealth security in your retirement years.'' But that commitment is \nbeing broken every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription \ndrugs.\n  When Medicare was enacted in 1964, coverage of prescription drugs by \nprivate insurance was not the norm--and Medicare followed the standard \npractice in the private insurance market. Today, ninety-nine percent of \nemployment-based health insurance policies provide prescription drug \ncoverage--but Medicare does not. Medicare is caught in a 35 year old \ntime warp--and too many senior citizens are suffering as a result.\n  Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or \ndon't fill needed prescriptions--because they simply cannot afford the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs. In 1983, before the most recent surge \nin drug costs, one in eight senior citizens said they sometimes had to \nchoose between prescription drugs and food on the table. Too many \nelderly Americans are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs \nthey need, because they are forced to pay the full price, while other \nAmericans pay less because their health plans grant discounts.\n  As a result, too many senior citizens are ending up hospitalized--at \nimmense cost to Medicare--because they are not receiving the drugs they \nneed or are not taking them correctly. As we enter the new century, \npharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures \nfor more and more diseases--but senior citizens will be left out and \nleft behind if we do not act.\n  The 21st century may well be the century of life sciences. With the \nsupport of the American people, Congress is on its way to the goal of \ndoubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health to support \nadditional basic research, so that scientists can develop new therapies \nto improve and extend the lives of senior citizens and all citizens.\n  These miracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by \npreventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. All \npatients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, \nthe nation's largest insurer, does not cover out-patient prescription \ndrugs, and senior citizens and persons with disabilities pay a heavy \nprice for this glaring omission.\n  Up to 19 million Medicare beneficiaries are forced to fend for \nthemselves when it comes to purchasing these life-saving and life-\nimproving therapies. They have no prescription drug coverage from any \nsource. Other Medicare beneficiaries have some coverage, but too often \nit is inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable.\n  Prescription drugs are the single largest out-of-pocket cost to the \nelderly for health services. The average senior citizen fills an \naverage of eighteen prescriptions a year, and takes four to six \nprescriptions daily. Many elderly Americans face monthly drug bills of \n$100 to $200 or more. Some of the newer drugs that can produce \nmiraculous results for those who can afford them cost $10,000 a year or \nmore.\n  Misuse of prescription drugs results in preventable illnesses that \ncost Medicare an estimated $16-$20 billion annually, while imposing \nvast misery on senior citizens. What are needed are effective ways to \nencourage proper use. Large savings to Medicare will result if \nphysicians, pharmacists and senior citizens are better educated about \nidentifying, correcting, and preventing these problems.\n  Too often, elderly Americans skimp on their medicine--they take half \ndoses or otherwise try to stretch their prescription and to make it \nlast longer. This is not right. And it doesn't have to happen. If the \nprescription drugs they need are covered by Medicare, needless \nhospitalizations will be avoided and physician visits will be reduced.\n  The Senate Budget Committee recognized the need for prescription drug \ncoverage by adopting a reserve fund for this coverage. But the \nCommittee reserve fund is hedged with unacceptable conditions that \ncould retard rather than enhance the cause of ensuring a meaningful \ndrug benefit. The Congress can do better--and it must.\n  The provision in the budget resolution does not actually provide \nfunds for a prescription drug benefit. Instead, it allows a \nprescription drug benefit to be enacted if certain conditions are met, \nbut those conditions are far too limited.\n  Senior citizens need a drug benefit more than the wealthy need new \ntax breaks. Every senior citizen understands that--and so do their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Finally, it is vital that we continue to make investments in \neducation programs that serve Americans of all ages. The Republican \nbudget claims it will improve education. In reality, it slashes funds \nfor critical programs like Head Start, job training, and student aid to \npay for increases in education. It is vital that we continue to make \ninvestments in education programs which serve Americans of all ages. \nThe Nation's children and families deserve the opportunity for a good \neducation throughout their lives.\n  Student performance is rising across the nation by many indicators. \nThe federal-state-local partnership is working--we shouldn't do \nanything to undermine it. Instead, we should do more to accelerate \npositive change.\n  Student achievement is improving. Performance on the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress has increased, particularly in \nreading, math, and science--critical subjects for success in learning. \nAverage reading scores increased from 1994 to 1998 in 4th, 8th, and \n12th grades. U.S. students scored near the top on the latest \ninternational assessment of reading, with 4th graders outperforming \nstudents from all other nations except Finland. Average performance in \nmath has improved since 1978, with the largest gains made by 9-year-\nolds. Between 1992 and 1997, the combined verbal and math scores on the \nSAT increased by 15 points.\n  Students are taking more rigorous subjects than ever--and doing \nbetter in them. The proportion of high school graduates taking the core \ncourses recommended in the 1983 report, A Nation At Risk, had increased \nto 52 percent by 1994, up from 14 percent in 1982 and 40 percent in \n1990. Since 1982, the percentage of graduates taking biology, \nchemistry, and physics has doubled, rising from 10 percent in 1982 to \n21 percent in 1994. With increased participation in advanced placement \ncourses, the number of students who scored at the highest levels on AP \nexams has risen nearly five-fold since 1982, from 132,000 in 1982 to \n636,000 in 1998.\n\n  But too many students in too many schools in too many communities \nacross the country fail to achieve that standard. More children need to \ncome to school ready to learn. More children need modern schools with \nworld-class teachers. More students need opportunities for after-school \nprograms. And more qualified students should be able to afford to go to \ncollege.\n  The Republican budget proposal is a welcome improvement over past \nyears. Previous Republican plans drastically cut funding for education. \nIn one of their first acts as the majority party in 1995, Republicans \nrescinded education funding by $1.7 billion and proposed to abolish the \nDepartment of Education.\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\nIn subsequent years, they proposed to cut education by $3.9 billion and \n$3.1 billion. With the strong leadership of President Clinton, these \ncuts were never enacted, and Federal funding for education has steadily \nincreased.\n  Republicans have finally begun to listen to the American people on \neducation. The Senate Republican FY2000 Budget Resolution increases \nfunding for elementary and secondary education by $2.6 billion over a \nfreeze. But that increase in elementary and secondary education comes \nat an unacceptable and irresponsible cost. The Republicans proposed a \nreasonable increase in funding for elementary and secondary education, \nbut at the same time they cut funding for critical programs like Head \nStart, job training, and aid for college students by at least 10 \npercent in FY2000 and by more than 20 percent in FY2004.\n  It is wrong to rob Peter to pay Paul, and it is wrong for the \nRepublicans to propose this irresponsible budget.\n  It is irresponsible to increase funding for elementary and secondary \neducation programs in order to improve the Nation's public schools and \nslash funding that helps young children and college students.\n  It is irresponsible to deny 100,000 children Head Start services that \nhelp them to come to school ready to learn.\n  It is irresponsible to eliminate 73,000 summer jobs and training \nopportunities for low-income young people.\n  It is irresponsible to jeopardize funding that helps make college \nmore accessible and affordable for all qualified students.\n  It is irresponsible to ignore the needs of communities that need help \nin modernizing their school buildings. Schools across the nation face \nserious problems of overcrowding. Antiquated facilities are suffering \nfrom physical decay, and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern \neducation. Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the \nnation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the \nschools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It \nwill take over $100 billion just to repair existing facilities \nnationwide.\n  It is irresponsible to do nothing to see that key education \npriorities will be met, such as reducing class size, improving teacher \nrecruitment and training, expanding after-school programs, and ensuring \nstrong accountability for how federal education dollars are spent.\n  Mr. President, a nation's budget is a reflection of its priorities. \nThe nation's children and families deserve a budget that invests in \ntheir priorities--not the priorities of the right wing. Clearly, this \nRepublican budget contains the wrong priorities for the nation's \nfuture. It gives priority to large tax cuts for the wealthy, instead of \nsaving Social Security and Medicare, and at the expense of programs for \ncollege students, young children, and young adults.

Mr. President, I remember the day when we had truth in \nbudgeting. I will never forget when we promulgated in 1985, almost 15 \nyears ago, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. At that time, we realized \nthat Reaganomics was going up and away with respect to the growth of \nthe debt and the accelerated interest costs upon that debt, not just \nnecessarily the growth of the economy.\n  We got together on a bipartisan basis and, under the auspices of \ntruth in budgeting, we came to the floor, and even though we had \nopposition on both sides early on--President Reagan opposed it, \ncertainly over here the majority leader, the whip, and the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee opposed it--on this side of the aisle, on 14 up-\nor-down votes, we got a majority of the Democrats on the basis of truth \nin budgeting.\n  Fifteen years later, we have gone to fraud in budgeting. It is all a \npolitical exercise that will bring us later in the year to what one \nmight call a Mexican standoff. Then both sides will probably get \ntogether, hopefully, and, since the media will be covering them and \nthey are moving into an election, do some saving of Social Security or \nat least some paying down of the debt. But I have a bill today, Mr. \nPresident, that actually requires us to save Social Security.\n  Let me mention that, once the government receives the moneys from the \npayroll tax under section 201 of the Social Security Act, it \nimmediately buys special securities, 30-year T-bills. With those 30-\nyear T-bills, of course, Social Security has the bond, or the IOU, the \nGovernment has the money, and obviously they have been spending that \nmoney for either increased spending or for tax cuts, but not for any \npaying down of the debt. The debt continues to go up.\n  Under section 201 in that particular instance, it is like having two \ncredit cards. You have a Visa card and a MasterCard, and you want to \npay off your MasterCard with your Visa card. So you pay down the public \ndebt. Herein, let's say the Visa card is Social Security and the \nMasterCard is the public debt or Wall Street credit card. That is the \ncrowd that does not want the sharp elbows of Government coming in and \ncrowding out finance, running up interest costs and disturbing \ncorporate finance.\n  When you take the Social Security credit card to pay down public \ndebt, it is simply a transaction of increasing your Social Security \ndebt. At the present time, the deficit in Social Security is some $730 \nbillion in the red.\n  Mr. President, we did not intend that in 1983. In 1983, what we did \nwas say: We are going to put in an inordinately high payroll tax in \norder to build up a surplus to take care of the baby boomers in the \nnext generation.\n  That is exactly what we are not doing. We are crowding around on the \nfloor saying, ``Beware, beware, beware, the baby boomers, baby \nboomers.'' It is not the baby boomers, it is the adults on the floor of \nthe Senate looting the fund if we keep the money in, as was intended in \nsection 201 of the Social Security Act.\n  As Mr. Greenspan said, take Social Security outside the unified \nbudget, do not have any unified budget and growth deficit, just have \nthe national debt and the national deficit, one accounting, not two \nsets of books. That is what we called for. We wrote it into law under \nPresident Bush in November 1990. It is constantly disobeyed and is \nbeing disobeyed with the two budget proposals of the President and the \nRepublicans now.\n\n  President Clinton's budget came to us. And I call it a fraud because \neveryone else has called it a fraud. What it did was say we are going \nto hedge a way against this so-called tax cut move on the Republican \nside politically, so we are going to save Social Security, we are going \nto take care of Medicare, and pay down the debt. They mean public debt. \nThey know they can easily do that with the Social Security money.\n  Incidentally, we had a motion on President Clinton's budget in the \nBudget Committee, so I speak advisedly. The record will show it did not \nget a single vote, Democratic or Republican, for that President's \nbudget.\n  Along comes the Republican budget, and you can see exactly what is \ngoing on. They are meeting with the candidate for President, Mr. \nKasich, who knows better. He is the one, incidentally--I do not know if \nhe is running as a Democrat or a Republican--he said if the 1993 tax \nincrease and spending cut and paring down the size of Government, \ncorporate downsizing, Government downsizing some 300,000--he said if \nthis thing works, ``I will change parties.'' I have not seen the \ndistinguished Congressman recently, but I am waiting to, because I am \ngoing to ask him how he is running, as a Republican or Democrat. He \npromised to change parties and become a Democrat if it worked. It is \nworking.\n  The Republican budget comes in now and they say, ``We have to do \nbetter. We have the House and Senate. We\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\nwant to take over the White House, so we want to give them a tax cut.''\n  How do they do it? With a fraudulent budget. They go up and above, \nand my distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee on the Senate \nside, the Senator from New Mexico, knows better. I have worked with \nhim. We are the two original members since 1974 of the budget process \nand the Budget Committee.\n  He comes in and he adds on almost $800 billion to the debt. In \naddition to adding to the debt, he comes around and says now, ``We are \ngoing to direct in reconciliation that the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the Finance Committee itself, come out with a tax cut.'' \nThis is an absolute adulteration and fraud of the budget process. We \nintended--and it is right in the reconciliation provisions--that if you \nget to the end of the road--and you are always slightly over--you can \nincrease some revenues here, there, or yonder, or you can cut some \nspending here, there, or yonder. You reconcile spending and revenue so \nyou do what you say and say what you do to balance items in the budget.\n  Instead, now the Republicans are going to use reconciliation to cut \nthe revenues. Here we are spending $100 billion more this fiscal year \n1999 than we are taking in. Under current policy, it would be $90 \nbillion more, but you can see already with this particular monkey shine \nin the face of reality, there is no chance of a tax cut and having a \nreal budget. We have already come in with caps.\n  Last year we exceeded the caps by $12 billion. We exceed the caps $21 \nbillion this year. Then we come and pass an $18 billion increase for \nmilitary pay. That is $50 billion we ought to be looking for in either \nincreased revenues or spending cuts. Rather, the wonderful Budget \nCommittee, on a partisan basis--the Republican budget is a fraud--comes \nforward and says, Here it is--and we are amending the reconciliation in \nthis particular process--and sends it to the floor directing the \nFinance Committee--and the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nincidentally, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, said: If we do \nnot have a tax cut, it would be highway robbery. We've got money \nsloshing around up here.\n  Unfortunately, they also repeal the pay-go rule. This means they will \nnot need an off-set to pay for their tax cut. When we debate the budget \nthis week, the Republicans are going to ram it through the Senate--10 \nhours, 10 hours, and 10 hours. They can get it through in three days \nand back up all the roll calls. And they already have it greased on the \nRepublican side to send it through. Instead of a Budget Committee \nexercising its responsibility to promote fiscal responsibility, this \nbudget here is a fraud and promotes irresponsibility.\n  To those who say, Mr. President, what are you going to do if you pass \nthe Hollings bill that sets aside the money in Social Security? It does \nnot just sit there; it earns the highest amount allowed by law, just as \nit did for 33 years--from 1935 until 1968. The Social Security trust \nfund was sound. That is a requirement for all corporate endeavors, in \nthat we make it a felony if you try to pay down the company debt with \nthe pension fund.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, he heard me speak of Denny \nMcLain the other afternoon. So I keep harping on it. Here we say in \ncorporate America, if you engage in that kind of nefarious activity, it \nis a felony, and off you go to jail. But here you get the ``Good \nGovernment Award.'' It is totally fraudulent what is going on. Neither \nside is giving. Both sides are out of reality and they are going \nmerrily down the road as they are with the census, with no \nreconciliation. But be that as it may, there isn't any question that we \ncan pay down the debt under current policy if we just stay the course.\n  That was my motion in the Budget Committee. You say, ``All that big \ntalk, Hollings. What then would you do?'' Look at the particular budget \nwe have. Look at the economy we have. If you were the mayor of a city, \nif you were the Governor of a State, you would immediately say, ``Well, \nlet's stay the course. We don't want to let go of the firemen or the \npolicemen. We don't want to start any new endeavors right now. Let's \nkeep this economy growing.''\n  All we have to do, as Mr. Greenspan finally testified, is do nothing, \njust hold the line, generally speaking, taking this year's budget for \nnext year. By 2006, by that time, above Social Security surpluses, we \nwould have regular surpluses, true surpluses. And that money could be \nused to pay down the debt.\n  I am not for the gamesmanship about public debt and the interest \ncosts going down. That is a story out of the whole cloth. That is not \ngoing to happen. Right now, we owe $730 billion to Social Security. By \nthe year 2013, we will owe Social Security $3 trillion--$3 trillion.\n  We are supposed to have, under the Greenspan Commission report and \nlaw as it now stands, $3 trillion in the bank. I know my distinguished \nfriend from North Dakota is waiting to come here, but I want to make \nsure we understand the fiscal cancer this country has.\n  When Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget, we only had to pay $16 \nbillion in interest costs on the national debt--today, we pay $357 \nbillion each year--almost $1 billion each day. And the interest costs \ngo up, just like the price of energy and gas is going up now, as \nindicated in the morning paper. If those little interest costs go up, \nit will be over a billion dollars a day.\n  With the money we would save in interest costs on the national debt, \nI could give my Republican friends an $80 billion tax cut. I could give \nmy Democratic friends $80 billion in increased spending. I could give \nSocial Security $80 billion. I could give paying down the debt $80 \nbillion. That is only $320 billion. We are going to spend that each \nyear--next year and more. This country has fiscal cancer. That is the \nstate of the Union. And in the best of times that we are all enjoying \nnow, if we cannot get some kind of discipline in reality out of the \nprocess here in the Congress, I do not know how we are ever going to \nsave it.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/22/senate-section/article/S3036-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3036-S3039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SPRING PLANTING LOANS FOR FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the agenda for the Senate this week is to \ncontinue on the supplemental appropriations bill. Then at some point \nthis week we will go to the budget bill. My hope is that we will finish \nwork on the supplemental appropriations bill. I understand that we are \nheading towards a vote tomorrow on cloture on a Kosovo amendment to the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. So we are off on a range of \nother issues, that being a foreign policy issue. We already had votes \non tobacco and tobacco proceeds from the settlement, and so on.\n  But my hope is that one way or another we will get through the \nsupplemental appropriations bill in order to provide the resources in \nthat legislation for spring planting loans for family farmers. There \nare not very many weeks until our family farmers will be in the fields, \nand they need some operating loans to buy the seed and the fuel and to \npay the expenses to do spring planting. And we have many farmers in \nNorth Dakota who are not, under current circumstances, going to be able \nto get loans from the Farm Service Agency unless we pass this \nsupplemental bill.\n  So if we do not pass the supplemental appropriations bill this week, \nand we go home, then we are not in session the next 2 weeks, we are \ngoing to be leaving these farmers in pretty tough circumstances. Then \nthis supplemental has to go through the House, the Senate, and go to \nthe President for his signature. Frankly, the fate of a lot of family \nfarmers rests on our ability to get this done.\n  Last week, a friend of mine announced that he was quitting farming, \nwhich I suppose is not such unusual news these days. A lot of farmers \nare quitting farming. This friend happens to be Elroy Lindaas, who is a \nState senator. Elroy is a wonderful fellow. He\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\nfarms near Mayville, ND. I have been to the barn dance on his farm a \ngood many times. I guess the last time was about 5 months ago. The barn \ndances that Elroy has are held up in the hayloft of a very large white \nbarn.\n  Elroy and his wife have gone to various garage sales in and around \nMayville over the years, and they would pick up a davenport here or a \ncouch or a chair. So up in the hayloft of his barn he has this large \nexpanse lined with very comfortable old chairs.\n  He has built himself a little stage. He plays guitar and he has \nneighbors that play musical instruments, as well. At this barn dance \nthat he holds every year, they get a little band together. They hang \nsome crepe paper. They get a couple hundred people who come up and fill \nthe hayloft at the Lindaas barn.\n  On this farmstead, they have planted 120 consecutive crops. For 120 \nyears they have planted crops on the Lindaas farm. But this year, the \n121st year they won't be planting a crop because he is selling his farm \nthis June.\n  Here is a farm that has been in that family for 120 years, passed \nfrom granddad to dad and son. Why does that farm at this point cease \noperation? Why does the family decide it cannot make it any longer? \nHere is a family farmer trying to do business, with prices for wheat \nand other grains at Depression-era prices. In constant dollars, the \nprice they get for a bushel of wheat today is no different than it was \nduring the Great Depression.\n  What does all this mean and what do we do about it all? The chart \nwith this map shows what is happening in our country as we talk about \nthe choices and priorities we will make in the supplemental \nappropriations bill and then the budget bill. This map shows those \ncounties, which are marked in red, where we have had an outmigration of \npeople. You will see the outmigration from the middle part of America, \nup and down the farm belt and especially in North Dakota. Up and down \nthe entire farm belt in the Great Plains, we have an entire region of \nAmerica that is being depopulated. People are leaving, not coming. Look \nat all of these counties, each of these in red are rural counties in \nwhich the population is leaving. These are the counties that have lost \nfifteen percent or more of their population in a fifteen-year period.\n  My home county, Hettinger County, ND, is probably a good example. \nHettinger County, ND, is right here in Southwestern North Dakota. It, \ntoo, is marked in red. When I left Hettinger County there were 5,000 \ncitizens living there. Now there are 3,000 citizens. The next county is \nSlope County. Both my home county and the next county are the size of \nRhode Island, individually. Slope County has 900 people. A year ago or \nso they had seven babies born in the entire county.\n  What is happening with the depopulation of rural areas, with people \nmoving out, not moving in? Elroy Lindaas, after 120 years of planting \ncrops and making a family farm work, is saying, ``I can't do it \nanymore.''\n  What is happening? A lot of things. The Presiding Officer will not be \nsurprised when I mention the current farm bill, which in my judgment, \nis a disaster. In fact, it is interesting that in 1995 when we \ndiscussed the Budget Act on the floor of the Senate, that budget bill \nprovided the framework for changing the farm bill. The budget that year \nframed the requirements under which a new farm bill had to be \ndeveloped. It was developed into what was called the Freedom to Farm \nbill.\n  Freedom to Farm had two parts to it. One part made a lot of sense. It \ngave farmers the freedom to plant what they chose to plant, not what \nthe Federal Government allowed them to plant.\n  Second, it cut the tie between farm prices and government payments. \nThe bill's sponsors said because farm prices were so good and so robust \nand healthy at that time, we would give a transition payment on top of \nthe current strong market prices, and then farmers would be on their \nown. That payment would decrease over a number of years after which \nfarmers would be on their own. That was essentially the theory of the \nprogram. It was called transitioning-the-farmers-out-of-a-farm program.\n  The problem is, farm prices didn't stay healthy and family farmers \ndiscovered very quickly that as commodity prices for wheat, feed grains \nand others began to collapse, there wasn't much of a price support for \nthem. There wasn't a government program that said, ``You are important. \nSo, when commodity prices collapse, somehow we will build a bridge over \nthat pricing valley to see if we can help you get across.''\n  We have our farm people looking 2 years, 5 years, 7 years ahead. They \nhear the economists say prices aren't going to improve much. They say \nif that is the case and if the Federal Government is not going to help \nand doesn't care whether there are family farmers left, they will \nleave. That is what is creating the depopulation of a rural area.\n  It is also true that the ability to raise grain here and ship it to \nAsia has diminished, as the Asian financial crisis took away our export \nmarkets. It is true that this administration has not been nearly as \naggressive as it should have been on the Export Enhancement Program. It \nis also true that, frankly, the Congress did not provide what the \nadministration asked for on EEP. The administration, Congress, and the \nmarkets shaped the circumstances that now conspire in ways that say to \nfarmers there is not much hope for you out here.\n  As we watch the depopulation of a major part of our country, let me \nmake another observation. Those farmers that stay in business will \nharvest a crop this fall and receive a price that is pretty anemic. \nWhen the farmers get in the truck and haul the grain to the elevator, \nthey will be told the food they produce doesn't really have much value. \nThe farmers will scratch their heads and say, ``I don't understand \nthat.''\n  This world adds a New York City in population every single month. \nEvery single month another New York City in population appears on the \nface of this globe. At least a half billion people and probably far \nmore than that go to bed every single night with an ache in their belly \nbecause they don't have anything to eat. Yet, we are telling our \nfarmers that what they produce has no value. There is something \nfundamentally wrong with that.\n  Working on a bipartisan basis as a Congress, we have to find a way in \nthis budget mechanism to say to family farmers that their presence in \nthis country matters to America. It strengthens our country to have our \nfood production produced by a network of broad-based economic owners, \nby our family farmers. It strengthens our country to have the family \nfarm system existing in America.\n  We must decide and decide quickly that the current farm bill doesn't \nwork. It must be changed. People say, ``Do you want to go back to the \nold support prices?'' I don't know. I am willing to discuss that. If \nyou have a better idea, let me know. But, do you really want to go to \nany community in this area and say our nation's policy is more of the \nsame? Do we want to keep seeing outmigration, and collapsed farm \nprices? Do we want to keep transitioning farmers out of farming?\n  Whatever ideas exist in this Chamber, I am willing to discuss. I have \nan idea for the first step. Let's take the caps off the price support \nloan rates and at least give farmers what the big print said it was \ngoing to give them in the farm bill, and what the fine print took away. \nLet's take the caps off the loan rates, and get the loan rates up to \nwhere they ought to be. That is the first step.\n  We have all the farm organizations around town who purport to support \nfamily farmers. I assume that is who is financing them. Yet, every \nsingle one has a different message about what ought to be done. Some do \nnot support taking the cap off the loan rates. They don't have ideas, \nbut they oppose those who do have ideas.\n  At some point, if we are going to save family farming for this \ncountry, we have to get together and find some kind of approach that \nwill reconnect a decent income to those who produce.\n  This isn't the fault of family farmers. This is not their doing. They \ndidn't cause the markets to collapse. They didn't cause the financial \ncrisis in Asia. They didn't cause the unfair trade from Canada that \nallows a massive quantity of spring wheat and durum wheat to flood into \nour marketplace. They didn't cause that, and they ought not be victims.\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\n  They didn't cause the foreign policy problems that require us to have \nsanctions against other countries, or the foolish notion that we ought \nto have any sanctions at all on food and medicine. Farmers didn't cause \nthat.\n  That is another step we ought to take. I don't say this suggesting \nthat it will solve the farm problem, because it won't. We ought to \ndecide all sanctions on food and medicine anywhere in the world ought \nto be ended. I may offer that to the budget resolution this week. Does \nanyone think Saddam Hussein or Fidel Castro missed a meal because we \ncan't ship food to Cuba or Iraq? Not hardly. All that sanctions hurt \nare our farmers here in this country and poor people and hungry people \nabroad.\n  My point is we must pass this supplemental bill in order to allow \nsome of these family farmers to get into the field this spring. Without \nit, many of them won't get into the field. Then we must fix this farm \nprogram because this farm program doesn't work. We must work on a range \nof other issues, including trade to deal with the unfair trade problems \nour farmers face. There are a whole series of other steps that we can \nand should take.\n  I want to mention this issue of priorities. I come from one of the \nmost rural States in America, and our family farmers are in desperate \ntrouble. Even as we debate these issues, we are told there is limited \nmoney available and we just can't do all of these things. If that is \nyour priority, then farmers don't matter much.\n\n  I mentioned that in 1995 the genesis of the current farm bill \noriginated here on the Senate floor in the Budget Act that was brought \nfor a vote to the Senate. And so better farm policy could start this \nweek here in the budget resolution that is brought to the Senate later \nthis week.\n  Let's talk about what the priorities are. The majority party will \nbring a domestic budget mark to the floor this week that decreases \ndomestic spending by slightly over $20 billion. The proposed mark of \nthe Budget Committee will have a $9.1 billion increase for defense over \nthat which was assumed in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. So, in \ndefense, their budget will provide $290 billion, a $9 billion increase. \nBut, in other domestic discretionary spending, their budget would take \n$20 billion in cuts.\n  Now, last year in the fall, we passed some emergency aid for farmers. \nIn that omnibus appropriations bill Congress provided aid for a range \nof things, including agriculture. $1 billion was added for the national \nmissile defense program. $1 billion. It was money that wasn't asked for \nby the Defense Department. This money wasn't needed by the Defense \nDepartment. The Defense Department said it was spending money as \nrapidly as it could to find the technology and the solutions to hitting \na bullet with a bullet, which is what the national missile defense \nprogram is.\n  The Defense Department said it really didn t have the capability of \nusing any more money. The Congress said it didn't matter to them and \ndemanded that they have $1 billion more. So $1 billion more emerged. I \ntried to get a few thousand dollars, a few hundred-thousand-dollars, or \na few million dollars to deal with the emergencies in Indian housing \nand Indian health care. I couldn't do it. But $1 billion, which the \nDepartment of Defense didn't want, didn't ask for, and didn't need \nemerged mysteriously. In fact, it turns out that they could not even \nspend it.\n  Of the $1 billion, the Department of Defense could only find $150 \nmillion in uses in fiscal year 1999. Do you know what that was for? A \nthird of it, amounting to $56 million was used for contract transition \nand rebaselining. Does anybody know what that is? Does that sound as if \nyou are building a weapon? Contract transition and rebaselining. They \nare going to allocate another $50 million in the next fiscal year \nbecause they could not use it in the last fiscal year. They want to use \n$400 million on things other than national missile defense because they \ncould not find a use for it in national missile defense.\n  This priority comes from a Congress that says that we don't have \nenough money and we can't help these farm folks. It doesn't matter that \nthese farmers aren't doing very well. They say we can't help them much \nbecause we don't have the money.\n  My point is that this is about making choices. We have a \nresponsibility to make thoughtful choices, good choices, choices that \nwill strengthen our country. I find it more than a bit disappointing to \ndiscover that there is plenty of money for someone else's priorities, \nbut not enough money to deal with what I think is a priority for this \ncountry such as the long-term economic health of family farming.\n  I want to also mention one contributing factor to the farm troubles \nin this country of ours. I mentioned trade just a moment ago. I want to \ngo back to it because our prices have collapsed for a range of reasons. \nThese are the prices that our farmers receive for grain when they haul \nit to the elevator. One of the reasons is that we have a trade policy \nin this country that is a terrible trade policy. We say to the rest of \nthe world that we are for free trade, open trade, come and trade with \nus. Yet, we refuse to stand up and have any backbone at all to stand \nfor our producers when we are the victims of unfair trade.\n  Let me give you an example. The Canadians continue to flood our \ncountry with their durum wheat and their spring wheat, undercutting our \nfarmers' prices. Our nation can't seem to do a thing about it. For \nyears now, it has gone on. I acknowledge that our Trade Ambassador and \nthis President have taken some action, which is more than previous \nPresidents have done. Previous Presidents would not give the time of \nday to this issue. But this President's action and the action of the \nTrade Ambassador is far short of what it should be, and they know it.\n\n  I found it interesting when I was in Europe a few months ago and I \npicked up the paper. I read that we are going into a trade war with \nEurope over bananas. I am sitting there in Europe thinking, gee, that \nis strange. Let's see, where do we produce bananas in the United \nStates? I guess maybe we produce a few bananas in Hawaii. But by and \nlarge, we don't produce bananas in the United States. So why do we have \na Trade Ambassador prepared to go into a trade war over bananas, \nsomething we don't produce? I guess it is because U.S. corporations \nproduce bananas in Latin America and they are trying to sell them to \nEurope. Europe won't let the bananas in, so we get all exercised and we \nare going to have a trade war over bananas.\n  I want to ask the Trade Ambassador this: If you are willing to go \ninto a trade war over bananas, which we don't produce, would you be \nwilling to take some reasonable action against countries that inundate \nour markets and cut our prices on something we do produce, such as \nspring wheat, durum, and barley? Why is it that we are willing to go to \nbat here and ratchet up a big trade dispute with Europe over bananas \nwhen we don't produce any real bananas. Yet, we seem unable, or \nunwilling, to take action against the Canadians, who clearly are \nviolating our trade laws and who are causing massive dislocation in the \ncenter part of our country by undercutting our grain markets and \nhurting our family farmers.?\n  Oh, I have thought from time to time about getting a truckload of \nbananas and dumping it on the front steps of the USTR s office to say \nat least here you can see some bananas when you walk out. You won't see \nany in the fields and you won't see any banana trees anywhere you look \nin the continental United States. You have this big trade dispute going \non over bananas, which you won't be able to find in most corners of \nthis country. That would at least give our trade office a chance to see \nbananas. But I decided I could not afford to do that, and it would \nprobably be a stupid stunt anyway.\n  Somebody needs to say: You are not thinking straight. If you want to \nstand up for the economic interests of this country, then stand up for \nthings we produce. Then someone will say to me: Mr. Senator, you know \nthere are some agricultural groups that support action against Europe \non the banana issue? Yes, I am sure there are. We have dozens of farm \norganizations in this country who say they speak for farmers, and they \nwouldn't know a pair of coveralls from an oil rag. I mean, they \nwouldn't know a pickup truck from a razorback hog. In fact, they don't \nknow much about farming. They are about agribusiness. They lobby under \nthe\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\nname of farmers, but they really represent the agrifactories of this \ncountry.\n  I say to them: You are off supporting this dispute about bananas, and \nyou are probably all upset that I am undercutting you. No, all I am \ninterested in doing is getting the limited resources of the U.S. Trade \nAmbassador's office to start fighting for the economic interests of \nwhat we produce in this country. Things like wheat and steel? Sure, we \nhave people concerned about steel. I will join them. How about focusing \non wheat coming in from Canada at secret prices, sent to us by a state \ntrading enterprise that would be illegal in this country? We send \nauditors up to Canada and they say, ``We want information about what \nprice you are selling for.'' They say, ``We are sorry, we don't intend \nto give you any information at all.'' That is violative of our trade \nlaws, and we ought to have a Trade Ambassador who will do something \nabout that and a President who will join her to say it is time to stop \nthat kind of unfair trade.\n  Well, Mr. President, my time is about over. I know that, as we begin \nthe budget process this week and as we complete, hopefully, action on \nthe supplemental this week, we will have a discussion about choices. I \nhave talked a great deal about agriculture and the farm program.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying that one of the most significant choices we \nwill make, in addition to those I have described, will be the issue of \nthe broad choices of what we are able to do with the future surplus. \nOne of the major choices will be to determine whether there will be \nreserves left from that surplus to invest in Social Security and to \nprotect Medicare. I am especially concerned with the issue of Medicare, \nwhich is the major issue that represents the difference between the two \nbudget resolutions that will be brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  That, I think, will be an aggressive and healthy debate and an \nappropriate one.\n  There are those who stood on this floor some 35 or so years ago and \nsaid that the Medicare Program would make sense for this country for \nsenior citizens who had no health care. They found that insurance \ncompanies were not lining up to ask if they can insure older folks. \nThey didn't run around looking for older folks to insure, because old \nfolks aren't the kind of people you make money from. You insure young, \nhealthy people, and make money from those folks.\n  Sixty percent of the senior citizens of this country had no health \ninsurance, and we passed Medicare over the objections of many. Now, 99 \npercent of the senior citizens in this country have health care. They \ndon't go to bed at night worried about whether their health \ncircumstance will change in a way that will cause them very substantial \ntrouble because they won't have the money to deal with their health \ncare needs. Medicare relieves them of that kind of anxiety.\n  We must, it seems to me, commit ourselves, in the context of choices \nthat we make in the budget this year and in future years, to the long-\nterm financial future and solvency of both Social Security and \nMedicare. I think in the next 2 or 3 days we will have a robust, \nhealthy, and aggressive debate on this. Perhaps the debate will include \nsome who never liked Medicare in the first place, and who wouldn't vote \nfor it now, if they had a chance. I have heard a couple of people \nsuggest as much in recent years. But, there are those on that side and \nperhaps many of us on the other who believe very strongly that this is \na program that has been very, very healthy for tens of millions of \nAmerican people and who believe that we ought to continue to provide \nsolvency for it in the long term.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But \nwhat I think we must talk about today is what happens if he is not.\n  What happens if Mr. Milosevic says, ``No, I am not going to allow \nforeign troops in my country,'' and if he says he is going to move \nforward with whatever he intends to do in the governance of that \ncountry? I think we have to step back and look at the situation and the \ndilemma which we face, because there is no question, this is not an \neasy decision. What comes next?\n  Basically, the President has committed the United States to a policy \nin NATO to which he really does not have the authority to commit. The \nconsequences are that we have to make a decision that would appear to \nwalk away from the commitment he made without coming to Congress, and \nthat is not a good situation. I do not like having to make such a \nchoice, because I want our word to be good. When the United States \nspeaks, I want our word to be good. Whether it is to our ally or to our \nenemy, they need to know what we say we will do.\n  But the problem here is, the President has gone out with a commitment \nbefore he talked to Congress about it, and now we have really changed \nthe whole nature of NATO without congressional approval. We are saying \nthat we are going to bomb a sovereign country because of their \nmistreatment of people within their country, the province of Kosovo, \nand we are going to take this action, basically declaring war on a \ncountry that should not be an enemy of the United States and in fact \nwas a partner at the peace table in the Dayton accords on Bosnia.\n  So now we are taking sides. We are turning NATO, which was a defense \nalliance--is a defense alliance--into an aggressive, perhaps, declarer-\nof-war on a country that is not in NATO. Mr. President, I just do not \nthink we can take a step like that without the Congress and the \nAmerican people understanding what we are doing and, furthermore, \napproving of it.\n  There is no question that Mr. Milosevic is not our kind of person. We \nhave seen atrocities that he has committed in Kosovo. But, in fact, \nthere have been other atrocities committed by the parties with whom we \nare purporting to be taking sides. The Albanians have committed \natrocities as well, the Kosovar Albanians. So we are now picking sides \nin a civil war where I think the U.S. security interest is not clear.\n  I think it is incumbent on the President to come to Congress, before \nhe takes any military action in Kosovo, to lay out the case and to get \ncongressional approval. What would he tell Congress? First of all, \nbefore we put one American in harm's way, I want to know: What is the \nintention here? What is the commitment? What happens in the eventuality \nthat Mr. Milosevic does not respond to bombing, that he declares he is \ngoing to go forward without responding to an intervention in his \ncountry? What do we do then? Do we send ground troops in to force him \nto come to the peace table? And if we did, could we consider that is \nreally a peace? What if NATO decides to strike and an American plane is \nshot down? What if there is an American POW? What then? What is our \ncommitment then?\n  My concern here is that the administration has not looked at the \nthird, fourth, and fifth steps in a plan. They have only addressed step \n1, which is, we are going to bomb because they will not come to the \npeace table and accept the agreement that we have hammered out. I just \nsay, before we go bombing sovereign nations, we ought to have a plan. \nWe ought to know what steps 3, 4, and 5 are, because I believe Congress \nhas a right to know what this commitment is. How many people from the \nUnited States of America are going to be put in harm's way? What is it \ngoing to cost and where is the money going to come from? Is it going to \ncome from other defense accounts, so other places in the world where we \nhave troops are\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nput at risk? Is it going to come at the risk of our Strategic Defense \nInitiative? Just where is the money going to come from? Most of all, \nmost important of all, what is the mission? How much are we going to be \nrequired to do and what is the timetable?\n\n  Mr. President, I would support a plan that would say when the two \nparties come to a real peace agreement, we would put our troops, along \nwith our European allies in NATO, together in a peacekeeping mission of \na short duration which would make sure that things settle down until we \ncould have others rotate in and take our place. I would support a plan \nthat went that far.\n  I would also support a plan of helping the Kosovars, but without \nputting American troops in harm's way. You know, the difference between \nthe Clinton doctrine and the Reagan doctrine is that President Reagan \nwould support freedom fighters with arms, with monetary contributions, \nwith intelligence--many, many forms of support for freedom fighters--\nbut he would never put a U.S. military person in the middle of a civil \nwar. He would help, but he would not make that commitment.\n  Under the Reagan doctrine, therefore, we could help Afghan rebels and \nNicaraguan freedom fighters. At the same time, we could also continue \nto remain strong in Europe and Asia because we could allocate our \nresources and we would not drain our resources in small civil conflicts \nin chosen places around the world.\n  What bothers me about what has been happening in the last 3 or 4 \nyears is that we have been putting troops into civil conflicts in \ncertain parts of the world but not all parts of the world. So every \ntime we do it, it makes the decision not to do it somewhere else a \nlittle harder. We practically invaded Haiti and we still have 500 \ntroops in Haiti today. We had 18 Army Rangers killed in Somalia in a \nmission that was ill-defined and was actually mission creep. The \noriginal mission of feeding starving people had been accomplished, but \nwe didn't leave. We decided to capture a warlord, something our \nmilitary is not trained to do and, therefore, the miscalculation cost \nus the lives of 18 great young Americans.\n\n  We have inserted ourselves into places like Haiti, Somalia and \nBosnia, but we have not inserted ourselves into Algeria, where there \nare just as many atrocities as there have been in any place in the \nBalkans. We have not inserted ourselves into Turkey, where there is \nmistreatment of the Kurds. We aren't getting involved in the Basque \nseparatist movement in Spain. We didn't step into Iran when the \nAyatollah took over from the Shah and was assassinating almost every \nmilitary leader that couldn't get out of the country, plus the \nreligious minorities that were still there and their leadership. It is \nvery difficult, when you start choosing where you are going to involve \nyourselves, to extricate yourself when there is no clear policy.\n  That is why so many of us in Congress are concerned and why we \nrealize the dilemma. We understand that this is not an easy black and \nwhite decision. We are talking about a commitment that the President \nhas made. I do not like stepping in and saying that we shouldn't keep a \ncommitment the President has made. Overriding that great concern is the \nconsequence of not requiring the President to have a plan and a policy \nthat will set a precedent for the future. I think we could explain it \nby sitting down with our European allies and saying, first of all, if \nwe are going to change the mission of NATO, this must be fully debated \nand fully accepted by every member of NATO within their own \nconstitutional framework. If we are going to turn NATO from a defense \nalliance into an affirmative war-making machine, I think we need to \ntalk about it.\n  I will support some affirmative action on the part of NATO, if we are \nable to determine exactly what would trigger that and not go off on one \nmission without having a precedent for a different mission and, \ntherefore, creating expectations among more and more people that we \nwill step in to defend the autonomy of a country such as Kosovo or \nBosnia. We must not allow the expectations to be such that we are drawn \ninto every conflict, because we will not be able to survive with the \nstrength that we must have when only the United States will be the one \nstanding between a real attack from a ballistic missile or a nuclear \nwarhead or an invasion of another country where we do have a strategic \ninterest. We cannot allow there to be so many questions because there \nis so little policy. That is the responsibility of Congress, to work \nwith the President.\n  We will work together. Congress will work with the President to \nhammer out a new mission for NATO. We will always do our fair share in \nthe world. We will never walk away from that. We have to determine what \nis our fair share, what is our allocation. I submit that the United \nStates will always be the leader in technology, and we will create a \nballistic missile defense that will shield not only the United States \nand our troops wherever they may be in any theater in the world, but we \nalso will protect our allies, if we have the strength to go forward. We \nwill not have the strength to go forward if we continue to spend $3 and \n$4 billion a year on conflicts that do not rise to the level of a U.S. \nsecurity interest.\n  We must be able to choose where we spend our defense dollars so that \nwe will all be protected, ourselves and our allies, from a rogue nation \nwith a ballistic missile capability that can put a chemical or \nbiological or nuclear warhead on it and undermine the integrity of \npeople living in our country.\n  Mr. President, the consequences are too great for us to sit back and \nlet the President commit U.S. forces in a situation that I can't \nremember us ever having before; that is, to take an affirmative \nmilitary action against a sovereign nation that has not committed a \nsecurity threat to the United States. Before we would sit back and let \nthe President do that, I cannot in good conscience say, well, he has \nmade the commitment, even though he didn't have the right to do it, so \nwe have got to let him go forward. Perhaps if we aren't lucky and if \nMilosevic does not come to the table, we would have more and more and \nmore responsibilities because of the potential consequences that could \noccur if he does not come to the table.\n\n  We must know what those consequences are and what we are prepared to \ndo in the eventuality that an American plane is shot down, that we have \nan American prisoner on the ground or that we bomb and bomb and bomb \nand bomb and he still does not do what we have asked him to do. We have \nto determine what we do in that eventuality. I certainly hope that we \nwill consult with the Russians so that this war does not escalate into \nsomething that we haven't thought about. If Russia decides to step in \non the side of Serbia, we could have grief beyond what anyone is saying \nright now.\n  I hope the President will work with Congress to fashion a new mission \nfor NATO that will have the full support of Congress and the American \npeople. I believe we could do that, because I don't think we are far \napart at all. We cannot do it on an ad hoc basis. We cannot all of a \nsudden attack another country on an ad hoc basis and call that a \npolicy.\n  I hope the President will come together with Congress and have \nhearings. Let's hear from the American people on just what they believe \nis the role of the United States. Let's hear from Congress about what \nour commitments should be and what is a ready division of \nresponsibility for keeping the world as safe as we can make it, given \nthat 30 countries have ballistic missile technology, some of whom are \nrogue nations. Let us step back with our European allies and determine \nif this is the right decision to make, or are there other ways that we \ncould be helpful to the Kosovar Albanians.\n  I remember hour after hour after hour, over a 2-year period, talking \nabout letting the Muslims have a fair fight in Bosnia, because they \ndidn't have arms when two of their adversaries did. We never took that \nstep. Now there is a cease-fire in Bosnia, but there are also many \nyears to go before we will know what the cost is and if it can be \nlasting, because today, Bosnia is still as ethnically divided as it \never was because it is not safe for the refugees to move back in.\n\n  One can say there is disagreement on just how successful was the \nBosnian mission. We do not see fighting, but NATO has just toppled a \nduly elected president of one of the provinces. It is pretty hard to \nunderstand. I think it is\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\ntenuous that we would go in and forcibly remove an elected president \nwhile we are touting democratic ideals.\n  There was a way to go into Bosnia, but Kosovo is very different. \nKosovo is a civil war in a sovereign nation. There are atrocities. \nThere have been atrocities on both sides. We are picking one side, and \nwe are doing it without a vote of Congress. I do not think we can do \nit. I do not think the President has the right to declare war, and \nunder the Constitution, he certainly does not. And under the War Powers \nAct, it takes an emergency. This is not an emergency. We are not being \nattacked. United States troops are not in harm's way at this point.\n  We can take the time to talk about it, and the consequences are so \ngreat I think it is worth the time to set a policy that allows us to \nhave some continuity for the next 25 years, so that our enemies and our \nallies will know what the greatest superpower in the world is going to \ndo and they will not have to guess.\n  Mr. President, it is a dilemma, and I realize it is. I do not feel \ncomfortable with the choice. I do not feel comfortable at a time when \nwe have gone out on a limb, through our President who made a commitment \nfor us, even though we were not part of it. Nevertheless, I would like \nto give the President that support, but it is worth it to take the time \nand do it right and ask the President to come forward to give us his \nplan, to tell us what happens when American troops are prisoners of war \nor on the ground or shot down. We need to know what we would do in that \neventuality before we send them there. That is the least that we can \nexpect.\n  I hope we can debate this resolution. I hope people will give their \nviews. I have heard great debates already on it, not on the Senate \nfloor, though. The time has come for us to have this debate, and let's \nvote up or down. There will be people voting on both sides in good \nconscience, seeing it a different way but with the same goal. So let's \nhave that debate. Let's do it right. Let's don't haul off bombing an \nindependent nation before the Senate and the House of Representatives \nhas a plan and approves it or disapproves it. That is what our Founding \nFathers intended when they wrote the Constitution, and it is more \nappropriate today than ever.\n  I hope we will do that, because then the American people will know \nwhat is going on and they will support it or not support it. If we are \ngoing to have a long-term commitment, which I hope we do not, but if we \ndo, at least it will be with the support of Congress as Desert Storm \nwas. That was a tough debate. People spoke from the heart on both \nsides. They took a vote, and Congress supported the President going \ninto Desert Storm. That is the way it should be, Mr. President. That is \nthe way it should be under our Constitution, under our democracy. That \nis the way our Government works. I hope it will again as we face the \ncrisis today that could have very long-term consequences for our \ncountry and for every one of our young men and women in the field \nwearing the uniform of the United States of America. Their lives are \nworth a debate and a policy, and that is what we are going to try to \ngive them in the next 24 hours.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Texas and, \nI must say, there are many Members of the Senate who have concerns \nabout a range of these issues. But I will also say that one of my \nconcerns is that as sensitive negotiations occur in Belgrade today with \nMr. Holbrooke and others, a resolution that says ``The United States \nnational security interests in Kosovo do not rise to a level that \nwarrants military operations'' seems not to be the best of timing.\n\n  I understand all the points the Senator made. As she knows, we have \nhad some discussions about NATO in the past. I am someone who voted \nagainst expanding NATO for a number of reasons. But NATO does exist. \nThis country is a part of NATO, and NATO has indicated to Mr. Milosevic \nthat there are consequences to his actions. The actions he has taken \nobviously include the slaughter of innocent civilians.\n  I am troubled, I guess, by having a resolution on the floor of the \nSenate at this moment. There will be a time and should be a time for a \nrobust and aggressive discussion about what exactly is in our national \nsecurity interest.\n  I was someone who was nervous about Bosnia. I would characterize the \ncircumstances in Bosnia differently than the Senator from Texas did. \nThere is not just a cease-fire there, there is a peace agreement in \nBosnia, and this country went to Bosnia as a peacekeeper, not a \npeacemaker. We did not send American troops into Bosnia to create a \npeace that did not exist. We sent American troops in as part of a NATO \ncontingent in Bosnia to keep a peace that already existed. Those of us \nwho were watching what happened in Bosnia understood genocide was \noccurring in that area. We got involved through NATO. Frankly, it has \nworked to this point in a manner that has undoubtedly saved the lives \nof many in that region.\n  The Kosovo issue is, in many ways, as difficult and perhaps more \ndifficult, and I do not know that airstrikes will have any impact at \nall. I honestly do not know. The Senator from Texas indicates that the \nPresident should consult with Congress, and she is absolutely correct \nabout that. I know that there was a meeting on Friday. I was invited to \na meeting at the White House on Friday, as were a number of my \ncolleagues. I believe a bipartisan group of Members of Congress were at \nthe White House on Friday when the President discussed the \ncircumstances in Kosovo.\n  I, too, think consultation on these matters is required. Also \nrequired is a significant and robust debate about exactly what is in \nthis country's national interest. The Senator from Texas has been very \nconsistent on raising these questions over a long period of time.\n  However, it bothers me some that the timing of this particular \namendment comes at exactly the moment that there are these discussions \ntoday in Belgrade with President Milosevic about the consequences of \ncontinuing to do what he is doing. Obviously, anybody has a right to \noffer any amendment. But I was, frankly, surprised to see the amendment \nthat has been offered as a second-degree amendment. I understand that \nthere will be a vote on a cloture motion tomorrow at 2:15 on this \nsecond-degree amendment. And this is a very difficult time for us to be \nessentially sending this message to Mr. Milosevic.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I just say to the Senator from North Dakota that I \nunderstand the concern about timing. And I could not agree with him \nmore about the timing. But I will just point out that the amendment I \noffered was actually offered early last week as an amendment that I \nthought should be considered in a supplemental appropriations bill \nbecause, of course, it will require a supplemental appropriation. As \nyou know, after the bill was laid down and other amendments were \nconsidered, this second-degree amendment was put on Friday. And now so \nmuch has happened in the last 48 hours that the timing is not perfect; \nthere is no question about it.\n  I just say to the Senator from North Dakota that we have been trying \nto talk about this for quite a while. And the House took up an \namendment 2 weeks ago that now is totally obsolete, because the Serbs \nhave refused to come to the table. So I concede that the timing is bad, \nbut I do not know when it gets better. We certainly are not going to \ninfluence Mr. Milosevic right this minute in that Mr. Holbrooke is \ntalking to him right this minute.\n  But I do think that we have to have this debate, because if we do \nstart an action before we have had this debate, and before the American \npeople fully understand what the issues are and can weigh in, I do not \nthink that would be acceptable, particularly if it is a long-term \ncommitment. So I do not disagree at all with what seems to be very bad \ntiming. I just do not know when it gets better.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might reclaim my time, the timing here is more than \n``less than perfect,'' as the Senator suggested. If I were involved in \nnegotiations this afternoon in Belgrade with Mr. Milosevic, the Lott \namendment would be of great concern to me, because I would expect that \nsomeone sitting across the table from me would\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nsay, ``Well, you are offering threats of airstrikes, but I can tell you \nthat at this moment there is legislation pending in the U.S. Senate to \nprohibit those very strikes you're suggesting represent the threat to \nme.''\n  I only say that I wish at this point we could have found a way--or \ncould still find a way--to have the kind of debate about what is in the \nnational security interest, what is the role of NATO, all of the kinds \nof discussions that the Senator suggests. Clearly, those are \ndiscussions we should and will have. But I rose simply to say I think \nthe timing of this amendment detracts from the ability of our \nnegotiators to express the threat of NATO action.\n  If I were negotiating for our side, debating this amendment is \nprobably the last sort of thing I would want to see happen, because I \ndon't think it serves our negotiating interests.\n  I do not say that personally in terms of anybody who offered this. \nThe Senator from Texas indicated that she introduced this discussion in \nthe Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member. She is correct \nabout that. But this most recent amendment was laid down, I believe, \nFriday, and a cloture motion filed on Friday; and that is what I am \nconcerned about.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator is correct, it was laid down Friday. But \nthis amendment does not prohibit the airstrikes. It just says that we \nmust come to Congress first, that the President must come to Congress \nand present a full plan first. And I think that is warranted before \nthis type of action would be taken in this very unusual circumstance.\n\n  But as the Senator said, it is coming to a head very quickly. This \namendment was offered last week. The second-degree was also offered \nlast week. So we are trying to have a clear plan, certainly, before we \nget into a situation which could be very long term, with very dire \nconsequences. And I think the full debate is what we are looking for, \nnot necessarily a cutoff, but certainly having all the facts before us \nbefore we make such an important decision.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would just point out, sending American men and women \ninto harm's way is something I think no President wants to do. We've \nhad ill-fated incursions and actions taken by Republican Presidents and \nDemocratic Presidents alike. The perfection of foreign policy is not \nthe province of any one party.\n  I was sitting here--the Senator from Texas was talking about \nPresident Reagan--and I was recalling that I was in Congress when \nAmericans in Beirut were killed by a truck bomb. There have been a lot \nof circumstances where we had to learn exactly how and when we involve \nourselves. It is a lesson that is very hard to learn.\n  The folks who feel very strongly about American and NATO involvement \nin Kosovo will make the case that if the situation is not contained \nthere, it will spread very quickly and we will have a very substantial, \nbroader problem on our hands in Europe. My colleague from Delaware is \nwaiting to speak. He knows a lot more about these issues and has been \ninvolved with them much longer than the combined service of myself and \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  But I think all of us are probably nervous about these issues. We do \nnot know exactly what the right approach might be. I only rose today to \nsay that I am concerned about the timing of this debate. Just this \nafternoon sensitive negotiations are occurring in Belgrade with Mr. \nMilosevic. I hope Mr. Milosevic will hear at least one voice coming \nfrom this Congress, perhaps many voices, saying that the slaughter in \nthat region of the world must stop--one way or the other.\n  With that point, let me yield the floor. I know my colleague, Senator \nBiden, is waiting to speak.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend.\n  I want to begin by saying to Senator Hutchison, I think she is \nperforming a valuable service. This debate needs to be undertaken. She \nand I have had very different views on the Balkans from the very \noutset. She, along with a majority of my colleagues, 3, 4, 5, 6 years \nago, told me that bombing would not work in Bosnia and we should not be \ninvolved in Bosnia and they asked, ``Why are we getting involved?'' \nThey were legitimate, real questions. And she could have turned out to \nbe as right, though I think she and others have proved to be wrong.\n  No one knew then. I could not answer some of those questions then. I \ncould not answer in 1992, when I came back from Bosnia and there was \nthe report about what was happening in death camps, about the support \nof Milosevic across the Drina, with the VJ involved with the Serbs in \nBosnia. I could not prove or convince people that there were massive \nmassacres that had taken place and would be taking place. I could not \nconvince anyone--either NATO or the President initially--that the \nlonger we waited, the more the situation would deteriorate, and the \nharder it would be to put back together.\n  But the question I was always asked then is the one I am asked now as \na vocal supporter of using force, along with NATO, to bomb Milosevic; \nand that is, people say to me now, ``Well, Biden, tell me what the last \nstep is. You tell me the first step now. Tell me what the last step is. \nYou've got to have an end game here, Biden. If you're talking to the \nPresident of committing to a lift-and-strike policy in Bosnia''--that \nwas 6 years ago, or more than that now, 7 years ago--``you've got to be \nable to tell us, if you lift the embargo and you engage in airstrikes, \nwhat happens?'' The following are the contingencies--if you list them, \nthey are all reasonable questions.\n\n  I say to my friend, the Presiding Officer and former Governor of \nOhio, the truth of the matter is the world has changed so fundamentally \nthat this calculus of what the last step will be is no longer relevant, \nespecially if we try to answer it before the first step is taken. It \nleads to a policy of paralysis.\n  I remember arguing then with a man I had great admiration for then \nand do now, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin \nPowell. I remember him making the argument that unless we could submit \nfront-end to put 300,000 troops in Bosnia, then we shouldn't put \nanybody in there. My argument was then and it is now that that thinking \nis an absolute policy for paralysis. I guarantee you that the world we \nare entering in the 21st century doesn't lend itself to that kind of \ncalculus.\n  When there were two superpowers and we decided whether or not to go \ninto Czechoslovakia when the Prague Spring was crushed, or when we \ndecided whether or not we were going to invade the counteroffensive in \nHungary when the Russian tanks rolled in, the calculus then was pretty \nclear. We could say if we responded, then there was a likely \nprobability the Soviet Union would respond to our response, and there \nwould be a likely possibility this would lead to World War III.\n  It was a reasonable calculus. We could do a cost-benefit analysis and \nask if the cost of involvement was worth the possible payoff. And we do \nthis balance, this calculus. We did this under Democrats and \nRepublicans for 50 years and did it pretty darn well. Indeed, we won \nthe cold war.\n  We are dealing with a different world now. We are not dealing with a \ngroup of people who are essentially cautious, who are part of a great \nempire, and who had scores of divisions along the Fulda Gap ready to \nroll into Western Europe if, in fact, war broke out. We are dealing now \nwith a group of tin-armed dictators--malevolent, dangerous dictators.\n  In Iraq we are dealing with a man named Saddam Hussein. I heard when \nI urged, along with others, that we should bomb Saddam Hussein, ``If \nyou bomb Saddam Hussein, what is the second, third, fourth and fifth \nstep you are likely to take?'' We couldn't say then because these guys \ndon't operate under the same rational basis that we do. They are \ncunning. They are smart. But they have fewer cards to play, and their \ncards are less obvious.\n  I approach things a little differently these days. I have been a \nSenator for 27 years, and I have been involved in foreign policy, \ndeeply involved, for the bulk of that time here. I approach it this way \nnow: Do we know what will happen if there is inaction? What happens if \nwe don't act?\n  In Iraq, if we don't act, we know for certain Saddam Hussein acquires \nweapons of mass destruction. We know this because he has used poison \ngas before. We know he has used chemical weapons. We know he has \ninvaded other\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\ncountries. We know that he has been willing to sacrifice tens of \nthousands of his people in a war with Iran. So we know where this guy \nis likely to go if we do nothing.\n  We have a different calculus now. In a superpower world, the calculus \ninvolved fairly cautious actors. We did not have Russian troops \ninvading Latin America. We did not have Russian troops, in the wake of \nthe Cuban missile crisis, storming into Cuba. We did not have Russians \nlooking for opportunities to have a Russian soldier confronting an \nAmerican soldier. It was a pretty cautious group of folks we dealt \nwith. Dangerous, bad, an evil empire, but pretty cautious.\n  How about today? What is the downside of not acting? I will argue in \na moment that it is immense. It is immense and it is clear, as clear as \nanything you can prognosticate in international affairs.\n  We must remember that we are a European power. Whenever I am asked \nwhy we would consider keeping 4,000-7,000 troops in Bosnia to protect \n100,000 people from being massacred, I respond by saying that for 54 \nyears we have kept as many as 365,000 troops in Europe to prevent the \nsubjugation of people. We now have 100,000 soldiers currently deployed \nin that theater. Why is the idea of using 2,000-4,000 of them to keep \npeople of Kosovo from being subjugated and massacred such a radical \nintellectual breakthrough?\n\n  Were the United States of America not deeply involved in the affairs \nof Europe, how many in this Chamber think Europe would be able to avoid \nthe instability that has characterized it for 300 years? Who is going \nto step to the fore? France? England? Germany? They are all great \nnations, all great allies, but they suffer from disabilities we do not. \nThey have lived on the continent for an eternity. They have old and \ndeep animosities and differences and allegiances. All of Europe has a \nhistory of dealing with Serbs and Moslems, Albanians, Kosovars, \nBosniacs, Croats, and it affects significantly their latitude.\n  What might happen were America to leave? Ask the French whether they \nwould like to see us pull up stakes and leave Europe, bring the boys \nand the women home. Ask anyone who has spent a lot of time dealing with \nEuropean affairs what happens if the United States disengages.\n  As a student of history and a participant in history, I ask whether \nAmerica has ever been able to keep its distance from an unstable \nEurope. Lucky Lindbergh thought it was a good idea. A lot of other \npeople who were more deeply involved in the conduct of foreign affairs \nthought it was a good idea. This questions represents an historic \nisolationism versus internationalism debate we have had in this country \nfor over 200 years. Internationalists are characterized as \nadventuresome by their critics, and isolationists are characterized as \nnarrow and self-interested by their critics. But it is a healthy, long-\nterm debate.\n\n  My friend asks whether or not I would be happy to yield for \nquestions. I am always happy to yield for questions from the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I am not always able to answer them, but if he has a \nquestion, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I broach this subject gingerly, as we \nhave shared many hours together on the train ride from Washington to \nWilmington, where he departs. He should go to Philadelphia, but he gets \noff at Wilmington. I sent the Senator a note, as he was in the middle \nof his discourse and I would not want to interrupt him if he chose to \nproceed with the line he had. However, there are a number of subjects \nthat I think would be useful to discuss with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware because he and I have discussed foreign policy, as well \nas many other subjects, on many occasions. We have agreed on many \nsubjects--not always--and on many of our judgments.\n  The first subject that is on my mind is on the use of force in \nKosovo. Specifically, the level of public understanding and support \nwhich is present at the moment. Senator Biden and I, along with 29 \nothers, attended a meeting in the Oval Office on Friday to discuss the \nsituation in Kosovo. The general concern uniformly present, was the \nlevel of public understanding of this issue and the level of public \nsupport, and the question of how much public support we needed in order \nto undertake these airstrikes. That would be the first subject on which \nI would be very interested in the views of the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond.\n  I think the Senator and I agree that there has hardly been any public \nknowledge or discussion of Kosovo. One of the reasons I am speaking on \nthis matter is that I feel obliged to lay out the background on this \nissue: what is going on, what is at stake, why we must act, and the \nconsequences of our action. I agree with what is implicit in the \nSenator's question: The American public has not been given sufficient \nfacts to allow them to be informed as to whether or not the course of \naction the President wants to take is, in fact, wise.\n  I was telling my staff as I walked over here that, this weekend, I \ncame out of a 5 o'clock mass, and a friend of mine--a very informed \nfellow, who is, I think, a supporter--pulled me aside on the steps of \nthe church and said, ``Joe, look, you may be right, and I tend to trust \nyour judgment in foreign policy; but I have tried my best to read \neverything I could.'' I listened, and he used this phrase: ``I listen \nto MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour every night, and I am waiting to hear \nsomebody explain to me this deal in Kosovo. I know you spent a lot of \ntime, Joe, on the Bosnia thing, but isn't this different? Explain it to \nme.''\n  Then, the Wednesday before, I was at a St. Patrick's Day function \nwhere we raised money for a fund in the name of a deceased mayor, and a \nvery intelligent fellow, a graduate of Annapolis named Healy, a \npremiere builder in our State, said, ``Joe, I'm a Republican''--I hope \nI am not going to get him in trouble--``but I've been liking you for a \nwhile. Joe, for God's sake, don't go down this bombing route.'' Then I \nstarted to explain some things to him and didn't change his mind, but \nhe said, ``I didn't know that.''\n  These are two illustrations, and I think you could probably canvas \nthe gallery here and ask them how much they have heard about Kosovo and \nwhat do they know, and whether they believe what we are apparently \nabout to undertake makes any sense. The very sure answer to your short \nquestion is that, no, the public is not sufficiently informed.\n  At our recent meeting at the White House, you will recall that I, and \nI think the Senator from Pennsylvania and others, stood up repeatedly \nand said, ``Mr. President, ultimately, you must educate the public.'' \nThe President told us that in his first news conference he was going to \nlead with Kosovo.\n  But I have said to him and to the national security adviser, as well, \nthat I believe the President has to address the Nation. I think the \nPresident should go on television at prime time, and take a half hour \nand literally, with a map and a pointer, sit there and say: This is \nKosovo, this is why it is important, this is what happens if we don't \nact. When we act, if we do, we think we will bring about the following \nresult. American forces probably will be killed, but possibly not. None \nwere in Bosnia, but this is a much more sophisticated air defense \nsystem in possession of the VJ. They are much more sophisticated \nmilitarily than we faced anywhere with a bombing campaign in Bosnia, \nand it is possible that American forces will be hurt.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield for a follow-up question, \nwhen the Senator from Delaware spoke at the meeting last Friday, he \nreferred to the issue of the likelihood of casualties. When I had an \nopportunity to speak, I did, too. We both made the same point, although \nyou made yours with more emphasis, which is not uncharacteristic.\n  I suggested to the President----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will take that as a compliment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is a compliment.\n  I suggested to the President that he be very direct on the problems \nand the risks, because if there is to be public understanding, the \npublic ought to be informed about the risks.\n  When the Senator from Delaware spoke, and he has repeated it today so \nit is not something I am telling out of\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\na quasi-private meeting, he used the word ``probably,'' as opposed to \nthe word ``possibly.'' The Senator and others including myself all \nemphasized the point that there had to be public awareness as to what \nwas going on in Kosovo.\n  The President has made a start. He led off his news conference with \nthe topic, but he did not give a 30-minute speech in detail. That would \nbe a short speech considering the complexity of this subject. This \nwhich raises the question as to what is the level of public \nunderstanding, which I think is a very important factor in letting me \ngo to a second subject, if I may.\n  The first part of this is hypothetical. If the President knew he \nwould get an affirmative vote in a resolution from Congress on the use \nof force in Kosovo would he be wise to seek it? Would it strengthen his \nhand to have an affirmative vote? I, as the Senator from Delaware, do \nnot like to deal with hypotheticals, but we have to on some occasions. \nSo I ask my colleague about his view as to whether the President would \nwelcome an affirmative vote if he knew he would get one, and would his \nhand be strengthened if he had congressional authorization before he \ntook military action.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond by saying two things. I will \nanswer the second part of his question first, which is very easy. \nClearly, his hand would be strengthened if he had one.\n  Second, the first part of the question: Would President support it?\n  I also said in my statement to the President and our colleagues that \nI believe the Congress should--should--be confronted with a specific \npiece of legislation authorizing the use of force. I think it is \nconstitutionally wise and politically necessary that be done.\n  Mr. President, such a congressional vote will spark the very debate \non this floor that I think is needed to further inform the American \npublic about what is at stake.\n  By the way, I called the White House after we had our meeting with \nthe President and reiterated that I hoped he would send up a \nresolution. He did not. So I wrote one. I was prepared to attempt to \namend Senator Hutchison's amendment. But, in the meantime, as is his \nprerogative, the majority leader came in and offered a second-degree \namendment to Senator Hutchison's. So I now have no ability to amend her \namendment.\n  I am told that we are going to vote on cloture. If we get cloture--\nand I hope we will get cloture--then there will be an up-or-down vote \non the Lott-Smith amendment. That amendment says that the President \ncan't take any action in Yugoslavia until funds are authorized. I would \nprefer having an up-or-down vote on that notion.\n  My resolution says, ``The President is authorized to use the United \nStates Armed Forces for the purposes of conducting air operations and \nmissile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and \nMontenegro, pursuant to a decision of the North Atlantic Council Treaty \nOrganization in order to achieve the objectives in section 2.''\n  Through my resolution, I want us to step right up to our \nconstitutional task of deciding whether or not to authorize the use of \nforce.\n  I am the guy, by the way, who, in a very contentious meeting with \nPresident Bush, insisted that we have hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on a resolution for the use of force in the Persian Gulf war. \nI believe that is a congressional prerogative.\n  One might argue that the President doesn't need congressional \nauthorization. I think he does. In my view, a President is always \nbetter equipped and better advised to go into a risky operation if the \nAmerican people know what is at stake.\n  My experience, Mr. President, is that Senators and Congressmen do not \nlike to be counted. Keep in mind that I have been here for six \nPresidents. We in Congress don't like to be counted on issues of war \nand peace--Democrats or Republicans--because if, in fact, the risky \nbusiness the President wishes to undertake succeeds, we all want to be \nable to say, ``Good idea, Mr. President. I was with you.'' If it fails, \nCongress wants the luxury of saying, ``I told him. He never should have \ndone that. Bad idea.''\n  I came out of the so-called Vietnam war generation. The only thing \nmost everybody in my generation can agree on is that a foreign policy \nof this great nation cannot be sustained very long without the informed \nconsent of the American people.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield again, first, I \ncan confirm the contentious meeting. In fact, I can confirm that the \nSenator from Delaware was present in many contentious meetings, not \nonly with President Bush but others. Those were the meetings where some \nlight was shed.\n  I was interested to note the generational difference by the Senator \nfrom Delaware, and he indeed associated himself with the Vietnam war. I \nwould choose to associate myself with the Persian Gulf war.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think that is appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't want to move to a generation older. I would like \nto move to a generation younger.\n  When my colleague talked about submitting a resolution, he was very \nartful, as he always is. He said it will be constitutionally wise and \npolitically necessary. Then he moved on to say that he believes the \nPresident has a constitutional duty, although an argument could be made \non the other side. As usual, the Senator from Delaware anticipated the \nnext line of inquiry as to whether this military action is an act of \nwar. I believe this is a subject which really could use some \nelaboration and some discussion between not only the Senator from \nDelaware and myself but others in this not totally filled Chamber.\n\n  When the Senator from Delaware refers to the pending amendment \noffered by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and the second-\ndegree amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator \nSmith, I believe the Senator from Delaware will be interested to know \nthat the majority leader had looked for an approach where a substitute \nmight be offered by the leader of the Democrats and where a substitute \nmight be offered by Senator Lott.\n  It may well be that Senator Lott would be interested and perhaps \nagreeable--obviously, I cannot speak for Senator Lott --to having the \nBiden amendment proposed as he has articulated. There might be an \nagreement by the majority leader, which I would certainly endorse, to \nhave an up-down vote without a two-stage procedure and without having \nto go to a cloture vote.\n  For the people who are watching on C-SPAN II, a cloture vote means \nthat there would be a vote to try and limit the debate. It requires a \nsupermajority of 60. This would enable us to vote on the resolution, \nhowever it is articulated.\n  There are three items on which I would like the response of the \nSenator from Delaware. Let me name them and then come back to the one. \nLet me name them in inverse order.\n  Should we have the vote strictly on a resolution without a two-step \nprocedure, as the Senator from Delaware articulates it?\n  Question No. 2: What are the considerations?\n  What is the argument that he doesn't have to come to Congress, that \nwe are not implicating a constitutional requirement for congressional \nauthorization to undertake this military action, if it is an act of \nwar?\n  Let me deal with the most immediate question; that is this business \nof a cloture vote. I am, frankly, a little surprised to see the \nnecessity to go to a cloture vote, although I do not question anybody \nwho seeks to. I really do question this particular cloture vote. It \nmight be something that is worth discussing, whether it is appropriate \nto have a filibuster over the issue of the use of force. A matter of \nthis magnitude which involves a Constitutional authority, separation of \npowers, a provision of the Constitution of which there is none any more \nimportant.\n  So let me specify the question for the consideration of the Senator. \nIs it appropriate for a filibuster to be staged to bar the Senate from \nvoting on whether to authorize or deny the President authority to use \nforce?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me be precise. It is legally \npermissible but unwise. Let me explain what I mean.\n  I think the reason for the cloture vote is not because the majority \nleader expects anyone to filibuster. It is a tool\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nthat he has learned and has sharpened and honed very well to gain \ncontrol and maintain control of the agenda and provide for the \ninability of anyone to amend whatever he wishes us to vote on. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  This has nothing to do with anyone filibustering. Indeed, I have not \nheard a single person suggest a filibuster. It has to do with the \nleader using, skillfully, as he does, the tools to be able to control \nthe agenda of the Senate and determine what we will vote on, how long \nwe will debate, and if we will debate.\n  If the Lott-Smith amendment prevails and is attached to the \nsupplemental, I predict that the entire supplemental will fail. If that \nhappens we will never have any action on Kosovo or the supplemental for \nthe near term. That is my guess.\n  There is some confusion in the House, because they thought, as the \nPresident thought, that there would be an agreement between the \nKosovars and the Serbs as a consequence of the meetings in France. They \nconcluded that they should debate whether or not we would place \nAmerican forces on the ground, as offered by the President, if there \nwas a peace agreement.\n  But there is no peace agreement. So someone introduced an amendment--\na freestanding bill on the House side--thinking they could pass a \nprohibition on the use of any American forces to implement any peace \nagreement signed. That was voted down.\n  Again, the public and a lot of our colleagues are not adequately \ninformed on this. The headlines when the House voted were: House \nSupports Use of American Forces In Kosovo. That is not quite true. The \nHouse said it would permit a deployment in a permissive environment.\n  Now we are going to vote in the Senate on something completely \ndifferent, something that may produce a very ambiguous result. The \nLott-Smith amendment bars all funding for the purpose of conducting \nmilitary operations by Armed Forces of the United States in Serbia and \nMontenegro.\n  What does that mean? Does that mean that, under our Constitution, if \nthis passes with the supermajority necessary to overcome a sure \npresidential veto, that airstrikes are not permissible because bombs \ncost money and they are going to be dropped on parts of Serbia? I \nsuspect it does. Rather than take such an ambiguous vote, we should not \nshirk our responsibility here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I sure will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator has gone through a discussion as to what \nSenator Lott may have intended by the cloture motion, by the amendments \npending, and by--as the Senator from Delaware characterizes it--our \narcane procedure.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I could be wrong, but that is my reading of it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It may be we can move ahead and structure a freestanding \nresolution which has been discussed, maybe two resolutions, one by \nSenator Daschle on behalf of the Democrats, one by Senator Lott on \nbehalf of the Republicans, and vote.\n  But let me come to the question that I think is by far the most \nimportant, which the Senator from Delaware had broached. That is the \nquestion about whether there is a constitutional requirement for \ncongressional authorization.\n  As I look at the proposed military action, what has been described \nconstitutes an act of war. The Constitution gives the President \nextensive authority, as Commander in Chief, but gives the Congress the \nsole authority to involve the United States of America in war--to have \na declaration of war. That constitutional authority by Congress has \nbeen very, very significantly eroded.\n  Korea is perhaps the best example. I had occasion recently to pick up \nMargaret Truman's biography on President Truman and, seeing at least \nher version as to what President Truman faced in 1950, I wondered if \nthe positions I have taken have been correct. But I stand by them, that \nthere ought not to be the use of force without congressional \nauthorization. The use of force was authorized prior to the Gulf war in \na historic debate which occurred on this floor back on January 10, 11 \nand 12 of 1991.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Delaware when he says the \nMembers of Congress like to avoid votes on these issues. We faced an \nimminent airstrike last February in Iraq, February of 1998, and we \nchose not to decide the issue. At that time airstrikes were not made. \nIn December of 1998, the Congress had ample opportunity to decide the \nquestion about airstrikes which did occur in mid-December over Iraq. \nAgain, the Congress decided not to take up the issue. When we took up \nthe issue of use of force in 1991, it came in a very unusual procedure, \nwhere the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, raised a procedural point \nthe day we swore in Senators who were elected or reelected in November \nof 1990, so we took up the question.\n\n  So my view--and I have expressed it a number of times on this \nsubject--is that however the matter is resolved, it ought to be \nresolved by the Congress. This subject has not really had the \nappropriate kind of discussion and debate.\n  So, I now ask the question in a specific form to the Senator from \nDelaware. What are the arguments in favor of the President's position \nnot to require congressional authority? Does the Senator from Delaware \nagree with the proposition that I have articulated, that the \nConstitution does require Congressional authority before military force \nis used in bombing in Kosovo?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, you can tell the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand I are friends because I am happy to have his extended questions, \nbecause his questions always shed light on the subject.\n  I agree with everything he said so far. Let me be specific. When \nthere is a Republican President, the Republicans argue the President \ndoesn't need congressional authority. When there is a Democratic \nPresident, all of a sudden the Democrats support the President's \nunilateral war-making power.\n  Let me give you the argument that could be made by scholars as to why \nthe President has the constitutional authority to act absent our \napproval.\n  They would argue that our actions in Kosovo are not an act of war. \nBut as the Senator knows, the war clause does not require an act of \nwar; it requires a use of force, a use of force that constitutes an \noffensive action. They would argue that this is defensive in nature. \nPresidents do that all the time. Remember why President Reagan invaded \nGrenada. To save medical students. That was the reason. That was the \nthin reed upon which he held his entire rationale, because everyone \nacknowledges that if it is an emergency or it is to defend American \ncitizens and their property, it could be done.\n\n  In Kosovo, the argument could be made that there are U.S. personnel \non the ground who would be in harm's way. If we do not take action, the \nroughly 40,000 Serbian troops near Pristina could threaten the small \nnumber of American forces in Macedonia. I can picture the argument \nbeing put together by the President's legal counsel. Because the \nAmericans forces in Macedonia are now in jeopardy, there was a \nrequirement to act to save them.\n  There also could be an argument made that airpower would be used for \nthe purpose of protecting American personnel in Belgrade. The President \ncould argue that Milosevic, with a long history of genocidal acts and \nacts of brutality, is about to move on American personnel. That is the \nnature of the argument that could be made.\n  There is also an argument, which I think is totally specious, that \nthis qualifies as an emergency. The Founding Fathers, in this Senator's \nview, clearly contemplated emergency situations where the President \nwould have to use force. That is why they gave Congress the power to \n``declare'' war rather than ``make'' war. They did not want to tie the \nPresident's hands in the context of an emergency.\n  Another argument being made, which is not accurate but is made all \nthe time by people justifying Presidential action in an area of making \nwar or using force, is that there are 200 years of precedent. They will \nlist hundreds of times where American forces were used without prior \ncongressional authorization. It is a specious argument, in my view, but \nit is one that has credibility only as a consequence of its repetition. \nThat is the other argument that will be used.\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\n  People will cite Libya. Did the President have a right to go in? I \nfound Senator Hutchison's rendition of history fascinating, because her \nmemory of Reagan and my memory of Reagan were fundamentally different. \nI don't mean it critically. I mean it factually. She said Reagan never \nput American forces in harm's way. Well, hell, they flew all the way \nfrom England, all the way across the Iberian Peninsula, and bombed the \nliving devil out of Libya. Was that a declaration of war? Most Senators \nsaid it basically worked. It cowed the Libyan dictator for a while, and \nno American got hurt.\n  I cite that not to be critical of anything President Reagan did, but \nto point out that we often hear the precedence argument used. They say \nthe Congress didn't do anything then. Therefore, that makes it \nconstitutional. Yet there is a seamless fabric to the Constitution. \nAction, no matter how often repeated, cannot make an unconstitutional \nundertaking constitutional. That argument has been put forward by this \nadministration and at least six other Presidents.\n  I might point out that the Lott proposal, the very thing we are going \nto vote on, may also be unconstitutional. It bars Defense Department \nfunds for the purpose of conducting military operations by the Armed \nForces of the United States. The only exceptions to the funding \nrestrictions are (1) intelligence activities, including surveillance; \n(2) the provision of logistics support; and (3) any measure necessary \nto defend U.S. Armed Forces against immediate threat. Note that this \nthird exception would give the President the excuse I just mentioned.\n  So the Lott proposal is flawed in two respects. First, as a \nconstitutional matter, it is unnecessary. The Constitution already bars \noffensive military action by the President unless it is congressionally \nauthorized. If Congress adopts the Lott amendment, it would imply that \nthe President has carte blanche to take offensive action anywhere \nunless Congress makes a specific statement to the contrary.\n  We are telling the President he can't do something that \nthe Constitution already says he can't do. Then we build in exceptions, \nexceptions that give him authority beyond what, in my view and the view \nof most constitutional scholars, he is entitled to as a matter of \nconstitutional law.\n\n  Let me repeat the exceptions he builds. The amendment provides for \nproviding intelligence activities. As the Senator knows, that can \ninvolve U.S. personnel. They may be all sitting up in Rhein-Main Air \nForce Base, or sitting in Italy. They may be on AWACS aircraft at a \ndistance that can't be shot down. I do not know. It also could include \nspotters. It can include people on the ground. It could include U.S. \nmilitary aircraft flying in Kosovo airspace, but not participating in \nthe actual strikes.\n  Secondly, it provides for a provision of logistical support. That \ncould include logistical support in the theater. If I were the \nPresident's lawyer on this one, I would say, Mr. President, don't worry \nabout this sucker passing. You are OK. You can work this one out. You \ndon't have to fight Congress on whether using force is constitutional. \nWith this amendment, you can do what you want.\n  Thirdly, it excludes any measure necessary to defend forces against \nan immediate threat. Well, I guarantee you the argument will be made \nthat once NATO decides to move, all those forces in Macedonia are in \nharm's way. Not only there, but American forces a little bit across the \nDrina River in Bosnia would also be in harm's way.\n  I guarantee you that the argument will be made, if this were to \nbecome law, that the Lott amendment gives the President the authority \nto bomb and use force.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield on this point.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When the Senator goes over the sections, they are so \ncomprehensive as to make any prohibition meaningless.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think so.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Which is one of the grave difficulties of having a \nresolution which prohibits Presidential action, but tries to \naccommodate to some special circumstance. In the articulation of the \ncircumstances, it renders it absolutely meaningless and gives such \nlatitude to the President, which may well be more latitude than he has \nunder the Constitution.\n  I come back for purposes of a question, which I am about to ask, what \nthe Senator from Delaware has had to say about the many occasions where \nforce has been used, where acts of war have been undertaken. I agree \ntotally that simply a recitation of those occasions does not establish \na constitutional norm. One of the grave difficulties is that as the \nCongress sits silent, the Senate sits silent again and again and again. \nThere has been such a total erosion of the constitutional requirement \nthat the Congress has the authority to declare war. The situation as to \nemergency, which is used so frequently to justify Presidential action, \nis totally absent here.\n  This may be the clearest kind of case which we have seen where there \nhas been time for a Congress to deliberate, to consider, and to act. I \nbelieve that the missile strikes in December of 1998 against Iraq \nshould have required prior congressional authorization. But an argument \ncan be made, tenuous as it is, that we are still operating under the \nresolution for the use of force from January of 1991. I think it is \nwrong, but one can make that argument.\n  When you talk about Libya, you may talk about the element of \nsurprise, injecting some element of emergency. I do not want to get \ninvolved as to whether that is justifiable or not. But if you take the \npresent circumstance, where the situation of Kosovo has been building \nup for days, weeks, and months, and where there has been ample \nopportunity for the issue to be considered by the Congress and where \nthe President has not taken the case to the American people, and where \ndebate in the Senate only draws three Senators--we are honored the \nSenator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nhas joined us.\n  I join what the Senator from Delaware has had to say about the debate \nwe had on the War Powers Act in 1983, where I asked then-chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Percy, a series of questions \nas to whether Korea was an act of war, or Vietnam was an act of war, \ndeveloping at that time a requirement for constitutional authorization.\n  We then had a very spirited debate with the Senator from Virginia, \nthe Senator from Delaware, the then-Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, \nand many others on January 10 and 11 in 1991. That is the kind of \nconsideration we ought to have now.\n  I believe it is possible we can articulate a resolution like the \nresolution of the distinguished Senator from Delaware so you do not \nhave the prohibition and all these exceptions clauses where we do not \nknow what we are talking about. If you have a resolution denying the \nuse of funds and then exceptions, it is totally unintelligible.\n  If we have to delay the budget resolution, this matter is of \nsufficient importance that we can do the budget resolution next week. \nWe might impede upon the recess. We can get that done and have the kind \nof debate we need.\n  I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding and for the erudition \nwhich he has brought to this subject, as he teaches constitutional law \nand talks about this substantive matter to acquaint the American people \nas to what the constitutional law requires. I yield back to him so he \ncan go on with his speech. I want to hear the substance as to why he \nthinks we ought to be undertaking these military strikes as a matter of \nnational security, as a matter of national policy, as a matter of vital \nnational interest, especially in the context where he says that the \nAmerican people are not really informed, they are not really in a \nposition to be supportive of this matter at this time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I will respond----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I can interpose a question to \nboth my colleagues.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would be delighted to do that, but I want \nto warn anybody who comes to the floor, I came to the floor to deliver \nwhat I thought to be, if not enlightened, a comprehensive rationale for \nwhy I think we should act. I am happy to stay here as long as possible, \nand I am happy to delay giving that speech, but as long as the Senator \nrealizes that when we finish our discussion, it is going to take me 20 \nto 25 minutes to deliver this speech.\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\n  One of the arguments here that no one has laid out sufficiently--I am \nnot sure I am capable of it--is why we should do what the President is \nseeking to do, why we should do what NATO has voted to do, and why we \nshould be either for or against doing that.\n  We did discuss here a very important subject about whether or not it \nis constitutionally permissible to use force absent congressional \nconsent.\n  All I am suggesting is that the President and those of us who support \nthe use of airpower in conjunction with NATO should lay out why that \naction is in America's interest. What are the costs, what are the \nrisks, what are the benefits, and why should we do it? Those who \ndisagree with our position should lay out in one place, where people \ncan go to the Record, why they think we should not do that. There are \nlegitimate arguments in opposition beyond the constitutional arguments \nin opposition to the use of force in Kosovo.\n  As long as the Senator understands that, I am happy to yield for \nquestions. I do not want to keep him here to have to listen to my \nspeech. When we conclude this colloquy, if I do not lose the floor, I \nwill be delivering that speech.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to take 1\\1/2\\ minutes to pose \na question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator should take as much time as the \nSenator wants.\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, we all draw on our experiences in life. I served \noverseas in Korea with an air unit, as a combat officer, I might say. \nRight now, I am trying to put myself--and I hope my colleagues put \nthemselves--into a cockpit and we are strapped in, as these young \nAmericans are right now, strapped in waiting for an order, which could \ncome in the next hour.\n  Having met with the President the other day with my two colleagues \nhere on the floor, I am convinced that he is going to join other NATO \nleaders and give that order at an appropriate time if the current \nmission of diplomacy by another courageous man, Mr. Holbrooke, is not \nsuccessful.\n  I hope we can start to focus pretty quickly, not so much on all the \nhistorical parts of this important issue, like sovereignty and \nconstitutionality, but on what we are going to do to support our \nmilitary. It seems to me that this body at this time has to look itself \nin the eye and say these men and women are about to fly, about to take \nrisks with our allies, and I think it is essential that the Congress of \nthe United States be on record as supporting them. I will address that \nin such opportunity as I may have following my distinguished \ncolleague's speech.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's question, for \ntechnical purposes, I agree with him 100 percent. I am an admirer of \nthe Senator from Virginia, in no small part because he was in combat, \nbecause he was in the military and because he knows, I suspect, what it \nfeels like sitting there, figuratively speaking, strapped in waiting \nfor an order.\n  I am always very reluctant to argue a position that may get somebody \nkilled, may get somebody maimed, may get someone put in a prison camp. \nAnd men like Senator Kerrey, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and \nSenator McCain, who argued against my position for years on Bosnia--not \nKosovo; Bosnia--when men who are brave like that, men like Danny \nInouye, Senator Chafee, and Senator Hollings, my seatmate, when they \nhave questions about this, I take it very, very seriously.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would allow me to make one clarification \nto your statement. I want to make it clear I said I served with others \nwho were in combat. I was a ground officer who helped strap them in, \nwho checked their radios and their communications. Occasionally, I did \nget to ride along with them in a back seat, but I never put myself in \nthe combat category with those brave men who, day after day, were \nstrapped in to fly combat. But I lived with them, slept there in the \nsame tents, ate in the same mess, used to go up and observe what they \nhad to do.\n  But let me tell you, I think we have to put ourselves in that cockpit \nright now as if we were qualified to be in combat and show that the \nCongress of the United States wants to support them. I think that is \nabsolutely essential.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I did not mean to misrepresent. I have \ngreat respect for the Senator. I know he was Secretary of the Navy. He \nalso is more informed in a personal sense about this--not, I am \nreluctant to say, not the issue; I think I am as informed as he is, or \nquite frankly, as anybody on the floor--but in terms of all that goes \ninto a young man's or woman's head as they are about to take off the \ndeck of that carrier or off that piece of concrete, or whatever the \nmission.\n  But let me suggest that I will lay out for you why I personally am \nwilling to do something that I am not happy about doing; and that is, \nvote to support asking the brave young women and men of our military, \nin this case the fliers--Navy, Marine, Air Force--to risk their lives. \nAnd it is a real risk. There is a probability someone is going to get \nhurt.\n  Mr. WARNER. I look forward to listening very tentatively to hopefully \nmost of it. I think it is important we do lay out the case. I will \nallude to, I think, much the same case that you do. But I do believe it \nis essential to this Senate to pass on the Smith amendment, if that is \nwhat is before us at this time; and then it seems to me that someone \ncould possibly come on with a resolution like, as I understand, the \nSenator from Delaware, which clearly focuses on the issue: Do we or do \nwe not support the use of force by the U.S. military together with our \nallies in this frightful situation in Kosovo?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, let me begin my more formal remarks by referring to \nthe concluding remarks I made on this floor on October 14, 1998, \nimmediately after the agreement between Ambassador Holbrooke and the \nPresident of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, was made public.\n  I said at that time:\n\n       [W]e must never again allow racist thugs like Milosevic to \n     carry out their outrages while the alliance dawdles.\n\n  Referring to the just concluded agreement, I further stated:\n\n       [W]e must brook no more opposition from Milosevic on its \n     implementation. To use a domestic American term, we must \n     adopt a policy of ``zero tolerance'' with [this] Yugoslav \n     bully.\n       Many of us had hoped that the mistakes that enabled the \n     Bosnian horrors to take place would teach us a lesson.\n       Unfortunately, we have repeated many of those errors and \n     have thereby allowed Milosevic and his storm troopers to \n     repeat their atrocities in Kosovo.\n       Twice is enough. There must not be a third time.\n\n  I do not cite that to suggest any air of erudition, Mr. President. I \ncite that to say my position--right or wrong--has been consistent since \nthe day this agreement has been signed.\n  Mr. President, from the bottom of my heart, I regret to report that \nthere has been a third time. There have been more massacres, have been \nviolations of the agreement, and both the massacres and the violations \nare continuing as we speak; indeed, as I speak at this moment. Let's \nlook at the disgraceful record.\n  Everybody forgets that we are operating in the context of Holbrooke-\nMilosevic agreement, an agreement that has been signed on by our allies \nand our friends. The President has been saying for the last month and a \nhalf that if Milosevic does not sign on to an agreement, assuming that \nthe Kosovars do sign on, we will bomb. For an unusual thing, NATO \nalready acted. NATO got together and debated this issue. And NATO \nmembers all voted unanimously to use airpower if in fact one side or \nthe other did not--did not--agree. So what happened here is, there is \nan agreement. The context of this whole debate is that agreement in \n1998.\n  Immediately following the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, machinery \nwas set in place to prevent a recurrence of massacres that had already \noccurred in Kosovo and in Bosnia the previous years and to move toward \nan interim agreement on the future status of Kosovo.\n  On October 25, 1998, the Yugoslav Government and the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization fleshed out the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, \nauthorizing exact numbers--exact numbers--of troops, the so-called VJ, \nand Serbian Interior Police, so-called MUPs, who are a bunch of thugs, \nwould\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nbe able to be in Kosovo province. The agreement also specified the \ngarrisons to which they were to be restricted.\n  That was signed by NATO and Milosevic, and a cease-fire took effect, \nmonitored by unarmed NATO aircraft, and international compliance \nverifiers were allowed into Kosovo.\n  Like his ideological model earlier in this century, Milosevic has \ntreated most of this agreement as a ``scrap of paper.'' The Yugoslav \nGovernment has flagrantly violated the limits stipulated in the October \nagreement. Rather than the 12,500 regular army troops and the 6,500 \nspecial police called for--a total of 19,000--there are presently \n40,000 Yugoslav soldiers and Serbian special police forces in the \nprovince of Kosovo, in clear violation of the agreement.\n  As for the cease-fire called for--it is a total joke. Milosevic was \nafraid to refuse entry of the international verifiers or to shoot down \nNATO planes. So as a result, we have a documented ongoing pattern of \nwarfare, both against units of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but \nespecially against Kosovar civilians.\n  There have been countless massacres, but the most widely publicized \none was perpetrated by the Serbs on January 15, 1999, in the village of \nRacak. There 45 Kosovar Albanian civilians--women and children--were \nslaughtered. The Serbs, of course, asserted that they all had been KLA \nfighters who had either been killed in combat or shot while fleeing.\n  Unfortunately for the Serbs, a Finnish-led team of forensic experts \nthat examined the bodies reported unequivocally that the victims had \nbeen forced to kneel and had been executed by being riddled with small-\narms fire.\n  They got down on their knees. These bullet wounds were in the back of \ntheir heads. They were executed, just like they did in Bosnia, just \nlike Hitler did in World War II.\n  Just yesterday, Mr. President, 10 Kosovars were massacred by Serbs in \nthe village of Srbica. During the past 10 days, the Yugoslav Army and \nthe Serbian special forces have gone on the offensive, seizing the high \nground above roads and railroads, moving in their most modern weaponry, \nincluding M-72 and M-84 tanks, and conducting a search and destroy \nmission against Kosovar villages suspected of harboring KLA \nsympathizers.\n  The net result is a new flood of refugees so great that their number \nis now approaching 450,000--450,000 the number reached last fall.\n  I might remind my colleagues, the only difference was, last fall when \nit reached that number, folks were able to flee to the mountains \nbecause they were not full of snow, they were able to hide. One of the \nreasons for the urgency that was being argued in the negotiations by \nMr. Holbrooke was--and we all seem to agree--was that winter was coming \nand all these folks would die. Well, it is winter there now.\n  Mr. President, the tragic events of Kosovo have a clear historical \ncausality which I will summarize now. Kosovo is considered by Serbs to \nbe the heartland of their civilization. There, in the year 1389, on the \nso-called Blackbirds Field near present-day Pristina, the medieval \nSerbian knights were defeated by the Ottoman Turks, which led to more \nthan five centuries of Turkish domination of the Balkans.\n  It was a courageous fight. They saved Christianity and the rest of \nEurope, but the bottom line was, they lost. And the bottom line was \nthat the Balkans for 500 years were dominated by Turkey and many parts \nbecame Moslem.\n  The Albanians, however, also claim Kosovo as their own and, in fact, \ncan trace their habitation there even further back than the south \nSlavs, the Serbs.\n  As a result of the policies of the Communist dictator of the former \nYugoslavia, Marshal Tito--whom I had the interesting pleasure of having \nlunch with in his private residence in Split, Yugoslavia, with now \ndeceased Ambassador Averell Harriman, one of the most interesting \nencounters I ever had in my career--the former Yugoslavian dictator, \nMarshal Tito.\n  In 1974, the Kosovar Albanians were granted the status of an \nautonomous region within the Republic of Serbia because of this \nhistory. Basically, the Albanians were allowed local control, while \nborder security and foreign relations remained under the control of \nBelgrade. In the next 15 years, the percentage of Serbs in the Kosovo \npopulation dropped from approximately one-quarter to less than one-\ntenth. At the time this agreement was reached--this autonomy was \ngranted by Tito in 1974--one out of four people living in the province \nof Kosovo were Serbs; three out of four were Albanians living within \nSerbia. They were basically Moslem, and the others were Orthodox \nChristians. Since that time, it has become 10-1; only 1 in 10 are \nSerbs.\n  Now, this has occurred for several reasons: A much higher birth rate \namong the Kosovar Albanians than among local Serbs; ``buyouts'' of many \nSerbian homesteads by Kosovars, some of whom earned hard currency \nabroad; and some harassment of Serbs by Kosovars, although nothing \napproaching the ethnic cleansing that is now being carried out by the \nSerbs.\n  Meanwhile, in Serbia proper, an ambitious young Communist politician \nnamed Slobodan Milosevic engineered a coup against the communist \nleadership of Serbia. He needed a vehicle to consolidate his power, and \nthe time-honored vehicle used by most rogues is rabid nationalism. He \nneeded to be able to spread his newly consolidated power to the Serb-\ninhabited regions of Yugoslavia outside of Serbia. So in a famous \nspeech in 1989--he would have done proud any demagogue who has ever \narrived on the political scene, and I am not referring to anyone here, \nI am referring to those folks who don't make it usually--in 1989, on \nthe 600th anniversary of the Battle of Blackbirds Field, to which I \nearlier referred, Milosevic traveled to Kosovo and delivered a rabble-\nrousing speech in which he promised that no Serb would ever be pushed \naround by anyone again anywhere in the world, notwithstanding the fact \nthat it was a hard case to make that that was happening.\n  On March 23, 1989, without the consent of the people of Kosovo, \nMilosevic amended the Constitution of Yugoslavia, revoking the \nautonomous status that they had had for roughly the past 15 years.\n  The following year, the parliament and the government of Kosovo were \nabolished by further unlawful amendments to the Constitution of \nYugoslavia.\n  A thoroughgoing purge of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo followed. \nThousands of hard-working citizens were summarily fired from their \ncivil service positions, and the Serbian Government denied funding to \nbasic institutions of Kosovo society.\n  It is absolutely necessary to note the reaction of the Kosovars to \nthese massive violations of their human and civil rights. What was that \nreaction initially? Under the leadership of Dr. Rugova, the Kosovars--\nand he is a Kosovar--the Kosovars set up a parallel, unofficial system \nof governance. They set up schools, hospitals, and other institutions \nthat make society run. Mr. President, under Dr. Rugova's leadership, \nthe Kosovars held to a policy of nonviolence for nearly seven years. I \ndo not know any other example elsewhere of such self-restraint anywhere \nin recent years.\n\n  The United States recognized that Kosovo was a tinderbox that could \nexplode at any time. For that reason, former President George Bush sent \na warning to Mr. Milosevic at Christmas 1992, the so-called Christmas \nwarning. Keep in mind, the Kosovars had not used violence; they were \nstill peacefully trying to piece together their society. On Christmas \nof 1992, the three Senators in this Chamber at the moment were all here \nat the time--not in the Chamber--and President Bush, a Republican \nPresident, issued the Christmas warning that said the United States was \nprepared to intervene militarily if Serbia attacked the ethnic \nAlbanians in Kosovo.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is that the quote from President Bush's statement?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No; it is not a quote; it is a paraphrase.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge the Senator to quote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As a matter of fact, I am about to come to that quote.\n  President Bush's warning was contained in a letter delivered to \nMilosevic and General Panic, the commander of the Yugoslavian Army. The \nNew York Times and the Associated\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\nPress quoted Bush's letter as saying: ``In the event of conflict in \nKosovo caused by Serbian action, the United States will be prepared to \nemploy military force against the Serbians in Kosovo and in Serbia \nproper.\n  Let me read it again: ``In the event of conflict in Kosovo caused by \nSerbian action, the United States will be prepared to employ military \nforce against the Serbians in Kosovo and in Serbia proper.''\n  Perhaps because of this Christmas warning, Milosevic refrained from \nan all-out military assault on the Kosovars, contenting himself with \nthe legal repression that I described earlier.\n\n  The Kosovars waited in vain for the West to help. They hoped that \ntheir plight would be placed on the agenda of the Dayton peace \nnegotiations in November of 1995, but having been warned by Milosevic \nthat he would walk out if Kosovo were brought up, the West, under this \nPresident, President Clinton, and our NATO allies, restricted the talks \nto Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  So, finally, in late 1996, armed Kosovar resistance began on a small \nscale under the loosely organized Kosovo Liberation Army, abbreviated \nUCK in Albanian, but as KLA in the West. Gradually, the KLA escalated \nto larger attacks by February of 1998. Let me review the bidding again \nhere, and I will get the letter, or the news accounts quoting the \nletter, if I can, for my friend from Alaska, and I will enter it into \nthe Record.\n  Now, what happened? In 1989, this genocidal leader of Yugoslavia, \nnamed Milosevic, had seized power and attempted to consolidate Serbs \nthroughout the former Yugoslavia. He made a speech on the 600th \nanniversary of Blackbirds Field near Pristina to enrage and bring up \nthe blood of every Serbian living in the region. It worked very well in \nBosnia. It got them going in Bosnia and, as well, in Kosovo. Then he, \nunder the Serb Constitution, by most accounts, unconstitutionally \namended the Constitution, taking away the autonomy that Tito had \ngranted to Kosovo in 1974. But even when that was done, the Albanian \nSerbs did not use force or violence. They were headed by a guy named \nDr. Rugova, who said they would, by nonviolent means, attempt to \nreestablish their societal institutions, allowing them their dignity \nand their right to work.\n  In the meantime, Milosevic comes in and he heads down from Belgrade \nand the orders are essentially: fire them all. Fire them all. All of \nthe civil service jobs were eliminated, all of the schools were shut \ndown, the language was not allowed, and so on. Still, the Kosovars did \nnot use force. Still, they attempted, through peaceful means, to regain \ntheir autonomy. And with the help of President Bush--I can only surmise \nthis, I can't read Milosevic's mind, but knowing what a coward he is, \nbased on what he has done in the past, I expect that the Christmas \nwarning by President Bush kept him from using the force he wanted to.\n  Dr. Rugova came to me and others and said, ``Get us into Dayton. \nWhile this is being discussed, get us on the agenda.'' We made a \nmistake, in my view. We said, ``No; you are not on the agenda; this is \njust about Bosnia. This is about Bosnia and nothing else.'' And so when \npeaceful means began to fail, and had clearly failed in late 1996, \nseven years later, the Kosovar resistance called the Kosovo Liberation \nArmy--the UCK or the KLA, whatever you would like to call it--began to \nengage in larger attacks, a la the IRA.\n  Milosevic then saw an opportunity. Having been humiliated in his \naggressive wars against Slovenia in the spring of 1991, and Croatia in \nthe summer of 1995, and having seen the Bosnian Serb puppets routed in \nthe fall of 1995 and forced to accept a compromise settlement in \nDayton, the Yugoslav dictator needed another crisis to divert the \nSerbian people's attention from the massive failure of his \nauthoritarian, Communist economic and political policies.\n  So what did he do? He did what is often done. He found a common \nenemy. He appealed to this naked, rabid nationalism and used the \nsuppression of the KLA as a justification, as his vehicle, attempting \nin the process to drive the ethnic Albanian population out of large \nareas of Kosovo. What have been the results?\n  To date, approximately 2,000 Kosovar Albanians and Serbian civilians \nhave been killed. More than 400,000 Kosovar Albanians have been driven \nfrom their homes, including tens of thousands during the past 10 days. \nThousands of homes in hundreds of villages in Kosovo have been razed to \nthe ground. One-quarter of Kosovo's livestock has been slaughtered and \n10 percent of its arable land burned. A food blockade has been imposed \nupon large segments of the Kosovar population.\n\n  The world has taken note of this. The United Nations Security Council \nhas passed two important resolutions--Nos. 1160 and 1199--in 1998, \ndecrying the repression and calling for an end to it. Milosevic \npublicly agreed to the U.N. demands and has cynically continued his \nstate terrorism.\n  Mr. President, why should we be surprised by this? We saw it repeated \nand repeated in Bosnia, until we had the nerve to act.\n  What is at stake for the United States in all of this? In the \ninterest of time, I will come back to the floor at a more appropriate \ntime to enlarge upon this. But I will say that our entire policy in \nEurope since the end of World War II has been to promote stability \nthrough the spread of democracy. In order to create the security \nconditions for this development in Western Europe, we created NATO in \n1949, and for 50 years this alliance has provided an umbrella under \nwhich our allies have survived and prospered.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, it has been our policy to extend this \nzone of stability eastward in Europe by three methods.\n  First, we have agreed to a well-conceived, measured enlargement of \nNATO, which has already brought Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \ninto the alliance.\n  Second, NATO has entered into partnerships with many countries in the \nregion, which in time will probably yield additional alliance members, \nwhich also in the short run has created productive relationships with a \ngreat power like Russia.\n  Third--and here is where Kosovo comes in--we have determined to \noppose directly the aggressive policies of demagogues like Milosevic \nwho are trying to foment ethnic and religious hatred.\n  We know, as NATO knows, that its credibility is on the line in \nKosovo. We have warned Milosevic countless times to halt his fascist \naggression. We have cooperated with our NATO allies, and with Russia, \nin fashioning a fair interim settlement for Kosovo.\n  We know that if Milosevic's scorched-earth policy of ``ethnic \ncleansing'' is allowed to continue, the inevitable result will be a \nmassive tide of refugees, which would destabilize fragile democracies \nin Macedonia and Albania. We also know that Milosevic is itching for \nthe excuse to overthrow the democratic and reformist government of \nMontenegro, which is a direct challenge to his authoritarian communist \nrule in Yugoslavia.\n  We also know that the ultimate nightmare--which is not impossible by \nany means--is a widening of the hostilities to include NATO members \nGreece and Turkey, who have different interests in this outcome.\n  Mr. President, the national interests of the United States are \ndirectly threatened by the continued aggressive actions of the Yugoslav \nGovernment in Kosovo.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I think we should do what I said \nearlier, which is, introduce a resolution authorizing air operations, \nin conjunction with the Activation Order voted on by the North Atlantic \nCouncil of NATO.\n  I urge my colleagues to support that resolution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader and Senators \nHutchison and Smith for bringing this matter to the Senate floor today. \nWith fighting escalating in Kosovo, with the Serbs refusing to sign a \npeace agreement, and with U.S. military air units, together with those \nof our allies, poised to strike, it is important, if there is time, for \nthe Senate to address this situation.\n  Under most contingencies, the U.S. military should not be sent into \nharm's way without the support of the American people and the Congress. \nOur nation has learned, from recent contingencies that, without such \nsupport,\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\nwhen casualties occur, a clamor could begin to ``bring our troops \nhome.'' We witnessed that in Somalia; we could see that again in \nKosovo. Our military deserves our support. I say to my fellow Senators, \nif you were sitting in a cockpit, ordered to carry out strikes against \nthe Serbian military, you would like to know that the Congress, the \nelected representatives of the people, is with you, supporting your \nmission and concerned for the risks you are taking.\n  I first visited Kosovo in August of 1990 on a delegation headed by \nSenator Robert Dole. I commend this brave veteran for his mission to \nthe Balkan region in the past few weeks in the cause of peace. His \nefforts contributed to the securing of signatures by the Kosovar \nAlbanian delegation on a peace agreement.\n  During my visit to Kosovo in 1990, I saw first-hand the oppression of \nthe Kosovar Albanians by the Serb authorities. I returned to the region \nmost recently in September of 1998, traveling through Kosovo with \nAmbassador Christopher Hill and elements of a courageous international \nobserver group called KDOM.\n  Since last March we have all closely followed developments--indeed \nthe humanitarian tragedy--in this troubled region. And since last \nSeptember, when NATO first threatened the use of force against \nMilosevic, NATO credibility has been on the line. We are now at a \ndefining moment in this crisis.\n  Since September, I have been outspoken in my support for the use of \nU.S. ground troops as part of a NATO-led force to implement a peace \nagreement that is in place relative to Kosovo. In my view, such a \nmilitary force is necessary--once a peace agreement is reached--if the \nparties to the agreement are to have the confidence necessary to be \nbound by the provisions of such a peace agreement. And I believe U.S. \nparticipation in such a force is necessary if we are to maintain our \nstatus as the leader of the NATO Alliance.\n  My greatest concern has been and continues to be that a deterioration \nof the situation in Kosovo could undermine the modest gains we have \nachieved in Bosnia--at a cost of over $8 billion to date to the \nAmerican taxpayer; and could lead to problems in neighboring Macedonia, \nMontenegro, Albania, and perhaps Greece and Turkey.\n  In addition, I share with all Americans concern for the humanitarian \ntragedy we have witnessed--are now witnessing--in that troubled land.\n  But what happens if a peace agreement remains elusive, which is now \nthe situation with which we are faced. It is one thing to deploy troops \ninto a permissive environment for the purpose of overseeing the \nimplementation of a peace agreement. It is quite another to use \nmilitary power--air--to compel a sovereign nation to sign an agreement \nto end what is essentially an internal civil war.\n  There are many questions that must be addressed. The most important \nquestion is, what happens if bombing does not succeed? There are very \nfew operations, historic examples, where air power alone has \nsucceeded in meeting our military objectives. Some have made the \nargument here today that air strikes were the key to bringing the \nBosnian Serbs to the peace table in Dayton. I had the opportunity to \nvisit with two people last week who were intimately involved in the \nBosnia crisis--former British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and \nformer U.N. High Representative in Bosnia, Carl Bildt. Both of these \nmen told me that air strikes were an important part, but not the \ndecisive factor in ending the fighting in Bosnia. History records that \nthe Croatian offensive against the Serbs, and the fact that the parties \nwere all exhausted from fighting were of equal significance to the \nimportant air campaign by the United States and our allies. Today, that \nis not the case in Kosovo--the parties there are, regrettably, ready to \nfight.\n\n  My point is,--there is risk in relying on air strikes, alone, to stop \nthe fighting in this crisis. We must know what our next steps will be \nand how far we are ready to go with other initiatives to stop the \nfighting in Kosovo. If this first military action is taken--which in my \nview this contingency is tantamount to an act of war--what comes next \nand how far we are willing to go? We must have in mind not simply our \nfirst step, but our second, third or fourth steps before we commit U.S. \ntroops.\n  While one of my main concerns in this is the credibility of NATO now \nthat we have threatened military action for many months, we must ask \nourselves what happens to NATO credibility if the air strikes fail to \naccomplish their objectives? That would be a devastating blow to the \nAlliance if we take the drastic step of attacking a sovereign nation, \nand are not successful in the ultimate objective.\n  What of the credibility of the United States and our leadership on \nthe continent of Europe, in military as well as economic or diplomatic \npartnerships? What of the credibility of the U.S. military as a partner \nin other actions? There are important issues that can be debated in the \ncontext of the pending amendment.\n  The Smith amendment provides that the Congress must be on record as \nsupporting this operation before we commit the U.S. military to the \ncrisis in Kosovo. I agree. We owe it to the men and women of the Armed \nForces to act on this issue.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 124\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The present business is amendment No. 124 \noffered by the majority leader.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment to the Hutchison amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Kosovo question is the pending issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have listened with interest at the \nstatements made by the distinguished Senator from Delaware. And he has \nsome very good points. My memory of the conversations that were held at \nthe time President Bush made the statement that the Senator from \nDelaware referred to was that the President was talking about racial \ncleansing, or genocide, on the part of the Serbs versus the Kosovo \npopulation--not just a military incident, but an act of genocide, but \nan act of racial cleansing in the magnitude of a national aspect.\n  There is no question that there is a dispute here. And the Senator \nfrom Delaware has heard my comments that I made to the President. I \nbelieve that article V of the NATO agreement does not authorize bombing \nin Serbia.\n  I was very interested over the weekend to listen to people talk on \nthe radio and television about Yugoslavia. It seems that we are \nslipping back now, that it is a Yugoslav question, not just a Serb-\nKosovo question, that is being raised now by the media. But in any \nevent, I think this would be the first time in the history of NATO that \nNATO has taken offensive action against a nation that has a dispute \nwithin its borders. I think it is a horrendous proposition that the \nSerbs are presenting to Kosovo. ``Either leave, or be exterminated.''\n  But the question really is, What is the proper justification for this \naction\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\nat the present time? If it is genocide, then I think we have really \nample cause to be involved. If it is a matter of relocation of people \nwithin a nation, based upon whatever power the nation claims to \nrelocate people within their boundaries, it is a different issue.\n  I must admit to being torn, as one who has attended the NATO meetings \nmany, many times in the past, of what will be the future of NATO, if \nthis action is taken.\n  I think the threat that President Bush made is the threat that all \nAmericans would support; that is, that we would use military force to \nretaliate against a nation that instituted a process of racial \ncleansing, racial extermination within its borders, to the extent that \nit was contemplated at the time.\n  But I have to also raise the question: Where were we in Cambodia? \nWhere were we in Ethiopia? Where are we going to be as this type of \nprocess continues in Africa? And we are reading more and more about \nthat. Even this last weekend, juxtaposed to the story about Kosovo, is \nthe story about the new racial cleansing commencing once again in \nEthiopia.\n  It is not an easy issue. And I think it is one that we ought to \npursue, because, from the point of view of this Senator, I do not like \nto set the precedent that an administration informs a foreign nation to \nsign an agreement, or, if you do not sign the agreement, we are going \nto bomb until you do. That to me is a precedent of which I don't want \nto be a part.\n  If we make a statement, as President Bush made, that if you engage in \na process that is really against a whole concept of humanity, we are \ngoing to be first in line to punish you for doing it. Somehow or other, \nthere is a place here where we can find a common position and support \ntaking action as a nation. But, for myself, I just revolt at the \nconcept that we are going to send people out to negotiate peace \nagreements, or whatever other kind of agreement it is, and authorize \nthem to say, ``Unless you agree with us, we are going to bomb you, and \nwe are going to bomb you until you change your mind, and, if you do not \nchange your mind, within our period of time, we are going to bomb you \nagain.'' In this instance, the process would require taking down the \nair defenses of another nation in order that we might attack the forces \nthat are on the ground.\n\n  I assume that most Members of the Senate have been there now and know \nwhat they are talking about. This is the most mountainous country of \nEurope. It is a place where, as I recall, some 20-odd divisions under \nthe command of Adolf Hitler got just absolutely tied down by the \nactions of the people there on the ground. Of course, they didn't have \nthe precision bombing we have now. They didn't have the automated \nsystems that we have now and unmanned systems that can wreck havoc on \nany nation.\n  The question, really, to me is, ``Are we to offer the use of military \npower to carry out a threat of a negotiating team based upon their \ninterpretation of the reasons behind a foreign nation's unwillingness \nto enter into an agreement that we sponsor?'' Or, are we going to take \naction, as I said, on behalf of humanity to prevent the extermination \nof a race? To me, there is a great gulf between those two positions.\n  I intend to continue to raise the question with the President and his \nrepresentatives about the constitutional power to make these threats, \nand then carry them out as threats as opposed to making a national \nstatement--as President Bush did, as I understand it--that if there is \na process of extermination going on, or racial cleansing going on, we \nwill not stand idly by and watch that process, and we will use our \nmilitary power.\n  I don't know whether the Senator from Delaware sees the difference in \nthe two circumstances. But, as far as I am concerned, we are still on \nthe first base. And that is we are asked to support the concept of \nusing force--our force, mainly unmanned--to coerce the Serbs into \nsigning an agreement. They have refused to sign that. As a sovereign \nnation, they have that right. If they take the action that is \ncontemplated, and that many people feel they are going to take--that \nis, to enter into a process of racial extermination--then it is an \nentirely different question. I do hope that the Senate will remember \nthat as we are considering the majority leader's amendment tomorrow.\n  It does seem to me that we are still on the question of should we use \nforce to coerce the Serbs into signing the agreement that they do not \nwant to sign. It is perhaps a distinction without a difference to some \npeople. But it is a great difference to me.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I respond, Mr. President?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think the way that the Senator phrased it, I can \nunderstand how he arrives at this issue as he does. I would argue that \nit is a distinction without much of a difference.\n  For example, the distinguished chairman talks about extermination \njustifying our action but relocation not. Historically, that is a \ndistinction without a difference in terms of genocide. Historically, \nthat is a distinction without a difference. In Bosnia, it was a \ndistinction without a difference. This guy has a track record. The \ntrack record is clear. The track record is documented. The track record \nis obvious. So it is not a significant leap from President Bush's \nletter, which said: If they move against the Kosovars. We could argue, \nand President Bush could enlighten us what he meant by that, but the \ntruth of the matter is he has moved against the Kosovars, and he is \nmoving as we speak against the Kosovars. And a half-million people up \nin the mountains is a pretty big deal.\n\n  Second, with regard to this notion of forcing a peace agreement on \nsomeone by saying, ``If you don't sign, we will in fact bomb,'' that \nwould make sense, I would argue, if in fact we were arguing about a \nborder dispute, if we are arguing about whether or not they were to pay \nreparations, if we were arguing about whether or not they are going to \nsell oil or whatever. It is not about that. It is about genocide and \nethnic cleansing. The whole purpose of the agreement, the only reason \nwhy the rest of Europe--of NATO--agrees with us that there is a need \nfor force on the ground in Kosovo, is to prevent--prevent--prevent \nethnic cleansing; prevent the systematic isolation of Albanians, Moslem \nKosovars, Moslem Serbs.\n  So I understand the technical point the chairman is making. I do not \nunderstand the practical difference. This agreement that was signed \nonto relates to a framework that will assure the international \ncommunity that this thug is not going to engage in the genocide he \nalready has, the ethnic cleansing he has been promoting since 1989, and \nthe thing for which we have a tribunal in the Hague. His military \nleadership, his puppets, are on the indictment list of the people \nengaged in this.\n  I acknowledge that it has not reached the proportions it did in \nBosnia. I acknowledge that 43 men and women forced to kneel down and \nhave guns pointed to the backs of their heads and have their brains \nblown out is not enough to say it is genocide countrywide. But it sure \nis enough, in my view anyway, to get the tickler file moving a little \nbit and saying: Wait a minute, what happened after that when they did \nthat in Bosnia? What happened after that when the intercepted \ncommunications we have between Milosevic and Karadzic and others in \nBosnia said, ``Go get them, boys.'' Do we wait for Srebrenica to recur \nin Pristina? Do we wait for that?\n  What the international community said, I say to my friend from \nAlaska--international? Let me be more precise. The contact group in \nNATO--they said, ``We do not. We learned a lesson here. We are not \ngoing to wait until he does that in Kosovo. We are going to work out an \nagreement.'' So they went outside Paris in some fancy old castle and \nthey sat down and negotiated. And the idiot KLA, like the IRA, scuttled \nit initially because they threatened the Kosovar negotiators who were \nup there negotiating this agreement.\n  But keep in mind the purpose of the negotiation. The only reason to \nput international forces on the ground in Kosovo--the only reason, none \nother--is to guarantee personnel and institutions that will prevent \nMilosevic from being able to do what President Bush was worried he \nwould do and threatened him that, if he did do it, he would use force. \nSo there is a distinction, I acknowledge, between preemptively making \nthis case based upon recent historical record and waiting until it \nhappens.\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\n  But I will just say only one thing to my friend, who has forgotten \nmore--and I mean this sincerely--he has forgotten more about our \nnational defenses, has forgotten more about the conduct of war and the \nway to pursue it, than I am going to learn; and I acknowledge that. I \nmean that sincerely. But the one thing I am prepared to bet--prepared \nto bet my career on it --is if we do not act, I will bet my colleagues \nanything they wish to, within two years--within I think eight months, \nby the time the snows fall next winter--there will be genocide, \ndocumented, on a large scale, in Kosovo.\n  My only argument is I think NATO is correct and the President is \ncorrect. I believe President Bush was correct in saying that we are \ngoing to stop you from doing that.\n\n  The mechanism picked by the community, by NATO, was this peace \nagreement. That is the purpose of it. It was not to extract from \nMilosevic money, commitment, borders--anything else. It was to say: We \nare setting these folks in place to guarantee that you keep your \npromise that you are not going to eliminate these folks.\n  I understand the difference. I have enormous respect for my friend \nfrom Alaska, but that is the basis upon which the Senator from Delaware \nbelieves we should act, knowing full well what he says. I do not say it \nlightly, and never having been in combat myself, as my friend from \nAlaska has been, I want him to know I do not say lightly risk these \nyoung women and men. Because it is a risk. He was there in the room. We \nwere both there with the President. I indicated that I thought the \nPresident, based on the intelligence community reports and also based \nupon the briefings I have received from the military, that it is \nprobable--not possible, probable--that some American flier is going to \nlose his or her life. So I do not say it lightly, but I think it is \nbalanced off against whether or not we set a chain reaction in place, \nagain, where we watch genocide. Either we have to act at a higher price \nor don't act and see it spread.\n  I thank my colleague for his time. I know he has other business he \nwants to get to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, Mr. President, this is the pending business. If the \nSenator is finished?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will go on a little bit and let him know my fears, as \nI expressed to the President, if we go after those air defenses. I hope \nSerbia knows if we go after them we will get them. There is no question \nin my mind we have absolute capability to totally destroy the air \ndefenses of Serbia. After having done so, though, I wonder how are we \ngoing to get him to sign the agreement. If he doesn't sign the \nagreement, then I assume we are going to carry out the threat, and we \nare going to bomb his tanks. And we can do that, too. And then, if he \ndoesn't sign the agreement, we can start bombing his people. And we can \ndo that, too. All without involving our airmen yet. We can do all that \nwithout involving our airmen.\n  But the time is going to come when we are going to have to use \nmanpower in the air or on the ground, and that is war. We ought to make \nup our mind. What the President is deciding is to commit an act of war. \nIt is not covered by article V. I do not think there would be any \nhesitancy in President Bush, that he was threatening war. If you are \nthreatening war in this country, that means you get a resolution, you \nget approval of the Congress. Only Congress can declare war.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I agree with you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I hope you do. But what is more, as I see it, once you \ndo that, once you lay down the air defenses of a country, once you \ncripple their military--remember who is around them, a bunch of people \nwho would like to find them crippled. Pretty soon you are going to have \nother people coming in there. We will be protecting the Serbs, before \nthis is over.\n  People just do not understand. We are finally going to have to put \npeople on the ground and when we get people on the ground--how long \nhave they been in Germany since we conquered Germany? We still have men \nand women in uniform in Germany pursuant to a peace agreement that was \nentered into 50 or more years ago. That is what I told the President. \nMr. President, these people are going to be there 50 years if you do \nthis. If you are going to do it, you better have the support of the \nAmerican people before you do it. And the way you get the support of \nthe American people is to have their Representatives here in Congress \nstand up and say yes, I am ready to vote for a declaration of war.\n  I told the President, if he can show me that there is a concept of \ninhumanity, of absolutely racial cleansing, ethnic extermination, I \nwill introduce his resolution of war. I told him that. But short of \nthat, I do not see we should authorize a negotiator to go over to a \nforeign conference and say: Tell them if they don't agree with what you \ntell them to do, we will bomb them. If they do not agree after that, we \nwill bomb them again. That is using our Armed Forces as a process of \nnegotiation, not for the purpose that we maintain our military. We \nmaintain our military to defend this Nation and to carry out our \nnational interests abroad, not as an arm of negotiators and not to give \nthe Presidency a feeling that all they have to do is enter into a \nseries of negotiations, and if they fail, then use the military and \nbomb away. There is more to it than just bombing. There is more to it \nthan just using Tomahawks or unmanned weapons. There is the concept of \nwhat is the followup. I say if we do that, if we take out their air \ndefenses, we will be involved in trying to manage the Serbian military \nfor the rest of my lifetime. I think I am going to live a little while, \nMr. President. It does seem to me that it is wrong the way we are \napproaching this.\n\n  We ought to look at what is in our national interest. If our national \ninterest requires us to use military power, Congress should authorize \nthem to use it. But the Presidency should not use our military power to \ncarry out negotiations. That is wrong. I still maintain that the way it \nis being approached this time is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Stevens for \nthe statement he just made. I think he is exactly right.\n  I want to follow those comments and read from the paper what the \npurpose of this proposed bombing strike is. This is the front page of \nthe New York Times quoting Secretary Albright. She says:\n\n       Mr. Milosevic has a stark choice. That choice was for him \n     to agree to the settlement signed in Paris last week by the \n     ethnic Albanians who make up most of Kosovo's population or \n     face NATO air strikes.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Milosevic has to agree to the peace settlement, \nand he never has agreed to it, but if he doesn't agree to it, he is \ngoing to be bombed.\n  Bombing is an act of war. So our Secretary of State and our President \non Friday have said they support this agreement. The Serbs agree to \nthis settlement that NATO has negotiated and that the Kosovars have now \nsigned, or else they are going to be bombed.\n  I made the comment Sunday, I said that is a crummy way to start a \nwar. I look at that as us starting the war. Are the Serbians right now \nat war against Kosovo? No, Kosovo is actually part of Serbia. It has \nbeen for hundreds of years. Is there a lot of fighting, a lot of \ntension? Yes. The Kosovo Liberation Army, for a little over a year, has \nbeen attacking Serbian forces for the purpose of independence for \nKosovo. As a matter of fact, there was a celebration in one of the \ntowns that was attacked in the last 2 days, a celebration recognizing \nthe fact that about a year ago in February was the first martyr for the \nKLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n  The goal of the Kosovo Liberation Army isn't autonomy. The goal of \nthe Kosovo Liberation Army is independence. They have been fighting for \nindependence. They have been attacking Serbian police in the process, \nand they have been killing some. Then Serbia usually responds with a \nlot more force. They have a lot more force. They have a bigger army. \nThey have tanks, and they have killed a lot of people. I am not saying \nany of this is right. I am just saying this shouldn't be a purpose for \nthe United States to go to war, to initiate bombing, because Serbia has \nnot yet signed on to a peace accord that we think is the right thing to \ndo.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n  I, for one, have serious reservations about it. What is the peace \nagreement that we have decided they have to accept? It is autonomy for \nKosovo, and the second part of it is stationing 28,000 foreign troops \nin Kosovo.\n\n  Again, Kosovo is part of Serbia. We are telling them, you must agree \nto this or you are going to be bombed. I think that is using NATO's air \nforce as a bargaining tool to try to bomb them into submission to a \npeace accord that they do not want to sign. Most sovereign nations \nwouldn't want to sign onto a deal that would put 28,000 foreign troops \non its soil.\n  I think the administration is wrong in this area. Don't get me wrong. \nI think Milosevic is a tyrant. I think he is guilty of a lot of bad \nthings. That still doesn't mean that I think we should go to war with \nSerbia. If we start a massive bombing campaign, we are going to war.\n  I think Senator Stevens is right. The Constitution says Congress \nshall declare war. Our forefathers showed great wisdom. They did not \nwant to get involved in a lot of wars. They knew that the elected \nrepresentatives--the Congress, House Members and Senate Members--would \nbe very reluctant to do so because we would be sending our constituents \nthat we represent into war, so we wouldn't do it lightly. Granted, we \nalso say in the Constitution the President is Commander in Chief, and \nhe has the authority, and we give him that authority, to respond if \nU.S. lives, U.S. interests are at stake, but that is not the case. And \nsomething has to happen before Congress has a chance to convene and \npass a declaration of war. We have all kind of assumed that.\n  Frankly, this President has tried to expand that power and I think \neven abused that power in saying he has the right to agree to an \ninternational force that is going to conduct a war.\n  NATO has never done that. Senator Stevens is exactly right. NATO is a \ndefensive alliance, and it has been successful. It was formed to make \nsure that if Soviet aggression against our European allies would \nhappen, that we would all work together to repel that aggression. The \nvery fact that we had significant forces in training and integrated \ntraining, demonstrates it has been a successful alliance. Never has \nNATO gone in to say we are going to go into another country that is not \nthreatening neighboring countries, not threatening part of the \nalliance, and conduct military affairs to quell a civil war.\n  If we conduct bombing, if NATO conducts bombing into Serbia, we are \ngoing to be on the side of the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army. I said \nbefore, their goal is not autonomy; their goal is independence.\n  I will tell my colleagues, there are some of our allies who have very \nserious problems about that happening. The Greeks primarily have \nserious reservations about the wisdom of that. I just wonder how well \nthought out this has been, or if we conduct the bombing, what happens?\n  I have heard President Clinton say we want to restore stability in \nthe Balkans. It may be just the opposite result. We may start bombing \nand the Serbs may really escalate their attacks. I will read a comment \nfrom an article in today's New York Times:\n\n       The Yugoslav foreign minister told CNN, ``We are not \n     looking for confrontation,'' but his country considers any \n     NATO force dispatched to Kosovo to be an aggression against \n     sovereign territory, Yugoslavia.\n\n  Other reports were that if the NATO forces would strike into Serbia, \nthey would use that as an excuse to be more aggressive against the KLA. \nThey might try to strike against the United States, but they hopefully \nwon't have very much success against our airplanes. U.S. planes are \ngoing to be too high and too fast, too sophisticated to attack. They \nwill see the United States is now taking sides with the Kosovars and so \ninstead of attacking the United States, where they can't really be \nsuccessful, they will be attacking the Kosovars. Instead of stopping \nviolence and bringing stability and peace to the region, we might be \nescalating the war. We might be starting the war.\n\n  I mentioned that to President Clinton. I do not want to see us start \nthe war, but if we start bombing we may turn a guerrilla effort, that \nis going on right now between the KLA and Serbs, into a full-fledged \nwar between the Serbs and Kosovo and see the loss of life greatly \nescalate, yet still not be successful. Just because we bomb does not \nmean that Serbia is going to say, OK, fine, you can bring the 28,000 \ntroops in and station them in Kosovo. They may not agree with that. \nThey may escalate their warfare. You may have a greater loss of life.\n  Then we are going to have another decision. Are we going to go after \nthat 40,000 Serbian military force that is in Kosovo? Are we going to \nbe attacking those tanks? Are we going to be attacking the platoons? \nAre we going to be going after those people? You can do only so much, \nas we all know, with airpower. How deeply engaged in this civil war are \nwe going to become? Again, if our purpose was to bring about peace and \nstability, can that really happen, if we ignite that type of warfare \nthroughout Kosovo and into Serbia?\n  I am afraid we may be starting something we can't get out of; I am \nafraid we might be there for years and years and years.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say, wait a minute, President Bush \nwas for this. I haven't heard President Bush say that he was for this. \nIn December of 1992, President Bush issued a warning to Mr. Milosevic: \nDon't you dare go in and start genocide against the Kosovars or there \nwill be a price to be paid.\n  Frankly, I supported that. It worked. It worked for one reason--\nbecause I think Mr. Milosevic respected President Bush, which is more \nthan what I can say at the present time on U.S. leadership, or even \nNATO leadership. That is regrettable. But also I didn't hear President \nBush, in December of 1992, saying he wanted to have a multinational \npeacekeeping force stationed in Kosovo, occupying Kosovo. He didn't say \nthat.\n  He just let him know that if he started a very significant genocide \nin Kosovo, there would be a price to be paid. I do not mind if this \nPresident lets Mr. Milosevic know that. If he started slaughtering a \nlarge number of people, yes, there would be a military action against \nhim. It does not mean we are going to be occupying Kosovo with 28,000 \ntroops. I think that signal can be sent.\n  That is not what I am reading in the paper. Today I read in the paper \nthat Mr. Milosevic must agree to the settlement signed in Paris last \nweek by ethnic Albanians that make up most of Kosovo's population or \nface NATO airstrikes. In other words, we are going to be striking if \nthey do not agree to a peace agreement, and that calls for autonomy for \nKosovo and calls for stationing 28,000 troops in their country.\n  I believe that is unrealistic. I do not think that is the right \nnegotiation. I do not think you can bomb another country into \nsubmitting to a peace plan. If they did, we would be putting 28,000 \ntroops, in my opinion, into very hostile territory. They would be \nvulnerable to sniper fire, and that is not a very good situation \neither.\n  I have very, very strong reservations about deploying U.S. ground \nforces into Kosovo. I have told that to the President. I think that is \na serious mistake. I hope we will not do it. That is part of the peace \nplan.\n  A lot of people are not aware of it. They seem to think we are trying \nto bring Milosevic to the peace table. I want him to come to the peace \ntable. I want him to sign a peace agreement. I want him to have peace \nin Kosovo. But what this administration is saying is, unless he agrees \nto the plan that has already been agreed to by NATO and the Kosovars, \nincluding the deployment of 28,000 troops, we are going to begin \nbombing him.\n  Are we going to keep on bombing him until he agrees to the stationing \nof 28,000 troops in Kosovo? I do not think that is realistic. Then if \nwe station 28,000 troops there, one, they are vulnerable to attack \nbecause it is a hostile area and, two, they will have to be there for a \nlong, long time.\n  This area does have a history of fighting that goes back for many, \nmany centuries. The Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburg Empire, 1389, the war \nin Kosovo--they have been fighting for centuries. There is real ethnic \nviolence there. There are real problems, and I understand that.\n  I do not think you can station U.S. peacekeeping forces everywhere in \nthe world where there is violence. There are reports that 80-some-odd \npeople\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nwere killed in the last few days in Borneo; 50-some were killed in \nRussia by 1 bomb. I heard my colleague from Delaware say in 1 village, \n40-some people were assassinated, murdered, or they were killed. I do \nnot know that we have seen the autopsy reports. We do not know whether \nthey were carrying guns or not. They were shot point blank. We heard \nthat. I do not know that to be the case.\n  There are lots of atrocities when you start fighting, and we know \nthat. I know we had a civil war in this country 130 years ago, and we \nhad hundreds of thousands of Americans who were killed. I am glad we \ndid not have other countries intervening in our Civil War. I just think \nthat would have been a mistake. I know both sides were trying to get \nthe French and the British involved, but I am glad they did not get \ninvolved.\n  I seriously question the wisdom of us getting involved in this war, \nor if we are going to get involved in this one, why we are not getting \ninvolved on behalf of some of the Kurds in Turkey, where the loss of \nlife has been some 37,000 in the last several years. Or what about in \nSudan, where there have been over a million people massacred in the \nlast 10 years? What about in Burundi, where 200,000 people have been \nmurdered? I could go on and on.\n\n  We have to be very, very cautious when we start deploying U.S. forces \naround the world. In some cases, we have done it with very noble \nintentions, but it has not worked. It did not work in the early \neighties in Lebanon. It did not work in Somalia. We had to bring our \ntroops back and, unfortunately, we brought back a lot of our troops in \nbody bags.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to think seriously about what we are \ndoing. For crying out loud, let's not be threatening bombing because \nthe Serbs have not signed on to a peace accord that we somewhat \narrogantly say, ``This is what you have to do, and if you don't agree, \nyou're going to be bombed.'' I do not think you can bomb a country into \nsubmission to sign a peace agreement, especially one that also says \nthey have to agree to foreign troops stationed on their soil for an \nindefinite period of time. That is a mistake.\n  I compliment my friend from Alaska for his statement. Also, Mr. \nPresident, I reiterate that Congress needs to assert its constitutional \nprerogative, and that is that Congress has the right under article I, \nsection 8, of the Constitution to declare war. Our forefathers did not \nwant to make it easy for us to be involved in foreign entanglements, \nand they wanted Congress, i.e., the support of the American people, to \nbe involved before we would ever do so. I think they were exactly \nright.\n  If President Clinton wants to initiate this effort, he should be \nasking Congress for a declaration of war. I think we, as leaders in \nCongress, should cooperate to bring that resolution to the floor and \nhave a debate, a discussion, and have a vote.\n  Right now we have been talking about an amendment: No funds will be \nused for this combat or airstrikes or stationing troops until or unless \nCongress authorizes it. That may be the most expedient way of getting \nthis up for a vote.\n  I personally would like to see a straight resolution, just like we \nhad in the Persian Gulf war, which we voted on in January of 1991, \nwhich authorized the use of force in the Persian Gulf. We had a very \nsignificant debate. Most of my colleagues who were here at the time \nsaid that probably was the most important vote they ever cast.\n  I would like for us to have that. That resolution, I say to my \ncolleagues, passed by a vote of 52 to 47, but it was significant, it \nwas intense. We knew what we were talking about. We had significant \ndebate on it. It was a healthy debate, and Congress supported the \nresolution. Airstrikes, I tell my friends and colleagues, started \nshortly after that resolution.\n  I do not think we are ready for that in this case in Kosovo today. \nThe administration needs to make their case. They then should request a \nresolution of authorization--we should prepare one or they should \nprepare one--and we would vote on it. I hope we will do that before \nhostilities are initiated by NATO; i.e., the United States.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Alaska for his \nindulgence, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be removed from the list at the desk: Senator \nDurbin's Medicaid recoupment amendment, Senator Kohl's bankruptcy \ntechnical correction amendment, and Senator Lott's rules amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that we may consider other amendments that \nare in order under the previous order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know Senator Feingold wishes to make a \nstatement, and I wish to accord him that privilege.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my thoughts to this \ncritical debate about the potential deployment of United States troops \nto Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping mission. I commend the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, for her commitment to ensuring that the \nMembers of this body have the opportunity to fully debate this \nimportant issue.\n  I also commend the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, for his \nwork on this issue, and I share his contention that the President \nshould seek congressional authorization prior to ordering a deployment \nto Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, like all of us, I am gravely concerned about the \nsituation in Kosovo. More than 2,000 people, including women and \nchildren, have been killed since the fighting between ethnic Albanians \nand Serb security forces escalated just over a year ago. Hundreds of \nthousands of people have been forced to flee from their homes and hide \nin the woods during the cold winter months. Those that are able to \nreturn to their villages often find their possessions looted and their \nhomes burned. Recent television news reports have shown Serb police \nshamelessly waiving to the cameras as they steal televisions and other \nvaluables from the deserted homes of ethnic Albanians before setting \nthe homes on fire.\n  Even today, as peace talks have adjourned without an agreement, the \nviolence continues in Kosovo. I am pleased that four representatives \nfrom the Kosovar Albanian delegation last week signed the so-called \nRambouillet agreement. However, I am alarmed that the government in \nBelgrade continues to offer ultimatums and to deploy troops and tanks \nin Kosovo. The continued defiance of President Slobodan Milosevic and \nother Serb leaders is very troubling. Once again, NATO has threatened \nairstrikes against Belgrade if the Milosevic government does not comply \nwith the will of the international community. Once agains, Belgrade has \nrefused.\n  Last week, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \nevacuated its observers from Kosovo in anticipation of possible NATO \nairstrikes. The violence in Kosovo has continued, with the aggression \nfrom both sides of this conflict.\n  As we debate this important issue, United States Special Envoy \nRichard Holbrooke is again in Belgrade attempting one last time to \nconvince President Milosevic to cease his operations against the \nKosovar Albanians and embark on a path to peace. Although I commend Mr. \nHolbrooke for his efforts, and hope, of course, that he is successful, \nI am skeptical.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that it is critical for Congress to \ntake an active role in the debate and decision to send our men and \nwomen in uniform into any potentially hostile situation. As our \nconstituents' voices in matters of policy, we in Congress must fully \ndebate this important issue and vote up or down on whether or not to \nauthorize such a deployment.\n  While I am pleased that the European members of NATO are taking the \nlead on the proposed deployment to Kosovo to implement the Rambouillet \nagreement, I have serious concerns about the United States \nparticipation in the form of U.S. troops in that mission.\n  No matter how one feels about the conflict in Kosovo or about the \nfuture of that province, under current American policy Kosovo is \nconsidered part of\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nSerbia, comprising, along with Montenegro, the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had made it \nabundantly clear that NATO troops are not welcome on what he refers to \nas ``Serb territory,'' and he has begun to amass troops along the \nborder with Macedonia, where approximately 12,000 NATO troops are \nalready currently deployed.\n  In addition, for the moment, there is no peace to be kept by the \npeacekeeping force. While the Kosovar Albanian delegation in France has \nsigned the Rambouillet agreement, the Serbs remain adamant that they \nwill not sign the agreement unless the Kosovar Albanians and the \nContact Group accept their latest demands. Many observers see this as a \nstalling tactic on the part of the Serbs, since they are demanding \nchanges to text that already has been agreed upon.\n  It is into this very uncertain situation and environment that the \nPresident has proposed to deploy 4,000 United States troops.\n  Mr. President, with great regret, I have concluded that I must oppose \nthe deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo at this time. I am compelled to \ndo so for several reasons.\n  First, the potential for harm to our men and women in uniform is too \ngreat, and there is too much uncertainty surrounding the proposed \ndeployment. The continuing violence in Kosovo, coupled with the \nmobilization of Serb troops in the area, fosters a volatile environment \ninto which our troops should not be deployed. The fact that the Serbs \nare not presently willing to sign the Rambouillet agreement or allow \nNATO troops into Kosovo makes it hard to believe that there will be any \npeace at all for foreign troops to keep.\n  Second, since 1995, I have vigorously opposed the deployment of U.S. \ntroops to Bosnia. One can draw disturbing parallels between the \ndeployment to Bosnia and the proposed deployment to Kosovo. The \nadministration, in my opinion, has again failed to make the case to the \nAmerican people and to the Congress for the deployment of U.S. ground \ntroops in the Balkans. As with the Bosnia mission, there is no clear \nset of goals beyond ``maintaining'' a currently nonexistent peace, \nthere is no timetable for withdrawal, no cost estimate, and no exit \nstrategy.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate many times in \nthe last 3 years to talk about the U.S. deployment to Bosnia. I have \nconsistently opposed that deployment and have supported a number of \nattempts to end it. I cannot help but think that this proposed \ndeployment to Kosovo is another in the long line of ill-fated and \nseemingly unending peacekeeping missions that this administration has \nchosen to undertake without the explicit authorization of the Congress.\n  Last week in the Washington Post, columnist David Broder wrote, \n``Sending in the military to impose a peace on a people who have not \nyet settled ancient quarrels has to be the last resort, not the \nstandard way of doing business.'' I agree with Mr. Broder. Peacekeeping \nshould be the exception, not the rule. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull text of Mr. Broder's column be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am seriously concerned that the \nadministration has cited the Bosnia mission as some kind of positive \nprecedent for a deployment to Kosovo--or anywhere else. In my view, the \nmission to Bosnia should not be a precedent for anything. The \ndeployment to Bosnia has resulted in, of course, some real benefits for \nthe people of that region, but it has resulted in less favorable \nconsequences for the United States. However, the lack of clear goals \nand a timetable for U.S. withdrawal, and the glaring absence of an exit \nstrategy, now more than 3 years later, and more than $9 billion after \nthe initial deployment, remain troubling.\n  Let me repeat that. We were promised that the troops would be out of \nBosnia in 1 year, that the troops would be home by December of 1996; \nand after we were promised that, we would spend at the most $2 billion. \nOur troops are still there, and it has cost over $9 or $10 billion. And \nnow they do not even talk about getting out on any date certain. Any \nnew deployment to the Balkans must not unduly add to the spiraling cost \nAmerican taxpayers are being asked to bear for our already very, very \nexpensive mission in Bosnia.\n  I do not want to see the mistakes of Bosnia repeated in Kosovo at the \nexpense of our men and women in uniform. Our armed services have served \nvery admirably in the Balkans. They and their families and fellow \ncitizens have a right to know the details of the proposed deployment \nbefore it happens.\n  Third, I am concerned that the proposed deployment to Kosovo could \nset a new precedent for international peacekeeping. As we prepare to \nmark NATO's 50th anniversary, the topic of continued out-of-area NATO \ndeployments for peacekeeping is a valid point of concern. How do we \njustify United States participation in NATO missions in Bosnia and \nKosovo but not in international deployments in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, or \nthe Congo, where many of the same tragic types of occurrences have been \noccurring for several years? Violent civil wars have shredded the \nfabric of civil society around the globe, but it doesn't seem to me, \nafter observing this for over 6 years, that we have a clear principle \nfor deciding where and when to intervene. No such principle emerges \nfrom the observation and the justifications for both the Bosnia and \nKosovo proposed intervention.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the deployment of our men and women in \nuniform to Kosovo because our troops are already stretched too thin \naround the globe. Currently, there are more than a quarter-million \nAmerican troops deployed in foreign areas, from Haiti, to Bosnia, to \nthe Persian Gulf, to the Korean peninsula. When I talk to my \nconstituents, they are startled to hear that there is something like a \nquarter-million American troops, approximately 250,000 American troops, \nstationed around the world at this time.\n  I commend again our men and women in uniform for their service to our \ncountry. I cannot, however, support a policy that overcommits our \nAmerican troops abroad, especially when the situation into which they \nwould be sent in Kosovo is so very uncertain. Again, there will be more \ndebate on this, and I think that is terribly important.\n  I conclude my remarks by thanking the Senators from Texas and New \nHampshire for their work on this issue. I am also pleased that the \nHouse of Representatives took an opportunity to debate this extremely \nimportant issue and that the Senate has followed suit today.\n  Again, I regret that I am unable to support the deployment of U.S. \ntroops to Kosovo at this time.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 1999]\n\n                   Before We Send in the Troops . . .\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Last Saturday, two days after the House of Representatives \n     had narrowly defeated a resolution opposing the deployment of \n     U.S. troops as part of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, \n     The Post's Douglas Farah reported some disquieting news about \n     a previous peacekeeping mission to Haiti.\n       The chief of the U.S. Southern Command, Gen. Charles E. \n     Wilhelm, had told a closed session of a House subcommittee \n     last month he wanted the troops removed from Haiti because \n     the continuing instability of that poverty-stricken island \n     nation put them at too grave a risk, according to a \n     transcript of the hearing obtained by Farah.\n       You may be forgiven if you are surprised to learn the Army \n     is still in Haiti. It has been more than four years now since \n     the September day in 1994 when President Clinton sent a force \n     of 20,000 troops onto the island. There was immense relief \n     when last-minute negotiations cleared the way for their \n     arrival; when they left their bases, they expected to have to \n     fight their way ashore. But the brutal generals running the \n     country backed down, and soon were replaced--thanks to U.S. \n     force--by elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n       Neither Aristide nor his successor, Rene Preval, has been \n     able to bring peace or democracy to Haiti. Factional fighting \n     has immobilized the government and stymied efforts at \n     economic recovery. And now that the factionalism has provoked \n     assassinations and bombings reminiscent of the bad old days, \n     the 500 U.S. troops still in Haiti spend much of their energy \n     just trying to protect themselves against those they came to \n     help.\n       It would be difficult for the Clinton administration to \n     accept the general's call for a pullout, for it would concede \n     the failure of a peacekeeping mission regularly touted as one \n     of the signal achievements of recent years.\n       It would be especially embarrassing at the very moment when \n     the administration is\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\n     trying to squelch opposition in Congress--fed by such foreign \n     policy luminaries as Henry Kissinger--to sending 4,000 U.S. \n     troops to Kosovo in a new peacekeeping mission.\n       Two days before peace talks resumed between the Serb forces \n     occupying Kosovo and the rebel forces who claim to speak for \n     the 90 percent Albanian population of the province, bombs \n     planted by unknown persons killed at least seven people--a \n     reminder of how far from peace Kosovo is.\n       During House debate, the question repeatedly raised was \n     what assurance the administration could give that once the \n     troops were sent into Kosovo, they would ever be able to get \n     out. The response was that without NATO troops on the ground, \n     the killing would go on, and without U.S. participation, our \n     European NATO allies would not go it alone.\n       This was the latest manifestation of what might be called \n     the Wilsonian conundrum. It was Woodrow Wilson, in the \n     aftermath of World War I, who most boldly asserted the \n     doctrine that the United States would not only use its might \n     to protect its national interests against any external \n     threats but would aid the struggle for democracy, freedom and \n     self-determination of oppressed people wherever it was being \n     fought.\n       Wilson's ambitions were almost instantly repudiated by the \n     Senate in the debate over the League of Nations, but his \n     ideas have influenced almost all his successors from FDR \n     through Clinton. Under the slogans of human rights, \n     liberation of captive nations or peacekeeping, they have \n     tried--with only intermittent success--to lift American \n     foreign policy beyond the crass calculations of power \n     politics and into the exalted realm of morality and justice.\n       What we have learned, I think, is that all those good \n     values cannot be imposed at the point of a gun--even if the \n     gun is held by an American soldier who wants nothing in \n     return but a safe trip back home.\n       Peace cannot be built unless and until the warring parties \n     have exhausted themselves with bloodshed and are ready to \n     take the responsibility on themselves to turn a new page. No \n     better example can be found this Saint Patrick's Day than \n     Northern Ireland, where decades of sectarian violence \n     blessedly have given way to a shaky peace.\n       The United States, led personally by Clinton, played an \n     honorable and vital role in bringing about that change. But \n     it did so at the conference table, using diplomats, not \n     troops.\n       The lesson is not that we should never be peacekeepers; \n     rather, that there has to be a peace to keep. Sending in the \n     military to impose a peace on people who have not settled \n     ancient quarrels has to be the last resort, not the standard \n     way of doing business.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in view of the posture taken by the other \nside of the aisle, as I understand it, we will not take up any other \namendments until we dispose of this amendment, which I understand. I \nwill pursue the closing arrangement for the Senate so that we might put \nSenators on notice that there will be no other amendments considered \ntoday and that we will close.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/22/senate-section/article/S3056-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

A bill to locate and secure the return of Zachary Baumel, a \ncitizen of the United States, and other Israeli soldiers missing in \naction; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I continue to voice my support for \nthe Middle East peace process and my work on behalf of soldiers Missing \nin Action and Prisoners of War. During the last Congress, I introduced \nthe Missing Service Personnel Act, provisions of which were signed into \nlaw to restore critical Department of Defense procedures for \nidentifying and recovering POW/MIAs. The Act ensures that our \ngovernment is and will do everything in its power to return those lost \nduring times of conflict. Last month, I introduced S. 484, the ``Bring \nThem Home Alive Act of 1999'' which creates a significant incentive for \nforeign nationals to return any possibly surviving American POW/MIAs.\n  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that continues my \nsupport for POW/MIAs and assists our Israeli allies in their efforts to \nlearn the fate of several soldiers who were overtaken by Syrian forces \nin June 1982. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators \nTorricelli, McCain, Kerry of Massachusetts, Smith of New Hampshire, \nLugar, Coverdell, Lieberman, Lautenberg, Ashcroft, Kennedy, Schumer, \nAllard, and Santorum. This bill is a companion to legislation which \nCongressmen Lantos, Gilman, and 65 other members introduced in the \nHouse.\n  Reports indicate that three soldiers of an Israeli tank crew were \ncaptured by Syrian forces at the 1982 battle of Sultan Yaqub in \nnorthern Lebanon. These men were later paraded through the streets of \nthe Syrian capital of Damascus. They were never seen nor heard from \nagain. Zachary Baumel, an American citizen and sergeant in the Israeli \nDefense Forces was one of those men. For over sixteen years, the Syrian \ngovernment and the leadership of the PLO have failed to cooperate in \nthe effort to determine their fate. In 1993, Yasser Arafat produced the \nmost tangible link to the missing men, returning half of Baumel's \nidentification dog tag. For the last five years, however, no additional \ninformation has been forthcoming.\n  The bill I introduce today requires the State Department to raise \nthis issue with the Syrian government and leaders of the Palestinian \nAuthority and provide the Congress with a report on the information \nthat has been uncovered. It also requires that Palestinian and Syrian \ncooperation in this effort be a factor in the consideration for future \nU.S. assistance.\n  This legislation is a targeted approach to address the unique and \ncompelling merits of this case in which an American-born Israeli \nsoldier and his comrades remain unaccounted for in a time of war. As \nAmericans know all too well, the bitter legacy of missing soldiers and \nPOWs can haunt a nation and interfere with efforts to build better \nrelations between former enemies. Clearly, resolving the issue of the \nMIAs can only strengthen American efforts to make Middle East peace \ninto a reality.\n  This is the first week of the Jewish month of Nissan--the month of \nthe Jewish holiday of Passover--the ancient festival that celebrates \nfreedom. I can think of no time that is more appropriate to propose \nthis legislation, and to hopefully begin a process that will help to \nresolve the fate of Zachary Baumel and his comrades after so many \nyears.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record and I \nurge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Zachary Baumel, a citizen of the United States serving \n     in the Israeli military forces, has been missing in action \n     since June 1982 when he was captured by forces affiliated\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\n     with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) following \n     a tank battle with Syrian forces at Sultan Ya'akub in \n     Lebanon.\n       (2) Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman, Israeli citizens serving \n     in the Israeli military forces, have been missing in action \n     since June 1982 when they were also captured by these same \n     forces in a tank battle with Syrian forces at Sultan Ya'akub \n     in Lebanon.\n       (3) These three soldiers were last known to be in the hands \n     of a Palestinian faction splintered from the PLO and \n     operating in Syrian-controlled territory, thus making this a \n     matter within the responsibility of the Government of Syria.\n       (4) Diplomatic efforts to secure their release have been \n     unsuccessful, although PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat delivered \n     one-half of Zachary Baumel's dog tag to Israeli government \n     authorities.\n       (5) In the Gaza-Jericho agreement between the Palestinian \n     Authority and the Government of Israel of May 4, 1994, \n     Palestinian officials agreed to cooperate with Israel in \n     locating and working for the return of Israeli soldiers \n     missing in action.\n\n     SEC. 2. ACTIONS BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\n\n       (a) Responsibility of Secretary of State.--The Secretary of \n     State shall raise the matter of Zachary Baumel, Yehuda Katz, \n     and Zvi Feldman on an urgent basis with appropriate \n     government officials of Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian \n     Authority, and with other governments in the region and other \n     governments elsewhere which in the Secretary's view may be \n     helpful in locating and securing the return of these \n     soldiers.\n       (b) Cooperation as a Factor in Determinations of \n     Assistance.--Decisions with regard to United States economic \n     and other forms of assistance to Syria, Lebanon, the \n     Palestinian Authority, and other governments in the region, \n     and United States policy towards these governments and \n     authorities, should take into consideration the willingness \n     of these governments and authorities to assist in locating \n     and securing the return of these soldiers.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\n\n       (a) Initial Report.--Ninety days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report in writing to Congress detailing the Secretary's \n     consultations with governments pursuant to section 2(a) and \n     the changes in United States policies made pursuant to \n     section 2(b). The report shall be a public document and may \n     include a classified annex.\n       (b) Subsequent Reports.--After the initial report to \n     Congress, the Secretary of State shall submit a report in \n     writing to Congress within 15 days whenever any additional \n     information from any source relating to these individuals \n     arises. The report shall be a public document and may include \n     a classified annex.\n       (c) Congressional Recipients of Reports.--The reports to \n     Congress identified in subsections (a) and (b) shall be made \n     to the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and to the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 677. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide a limited waiver of a requirement for reimbursement of local \neducational agencies for the costs of foreign students' education in \ncertain cases; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        Limited Waiver of Cost Requirements for Foreign Students\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \npermit local school officials the opportunity to waive the cost \nrequirements of foreign students studying in our public high schools in \nthe United States on F-1 visas. The law now mandates that all foreign \nstudents who are not in a government-funded exchange program pay or \nreimburse the local school district the cost of their education.\n  In those public school districts flooded with foreign students who \npay no taxes, this requirement makes good sense. However, in those \nschool districts which enroll a small number of foreign students or \nexperience little or no burden, there may be no desire for tuition \nreimbursement. The decision to enroll and to require cost reimbursement \nshould be made at the local level. Current law, however, does not \npermit this local discretion. The bill I am introducing today will \nallow local school districts the chance to waive the requirement that \nforeign students pay for the cost of their education. The decision to \nwaive or not waive this requirement should be made at the grassroots \nlevel where the problem, if any, exist, not in Washington. My bill \nseeks to preserve this principle. It would amend the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA).\n  Foreign exchange students bring knowledge, cultural exposure and \nunderstanding to American students, schools and communities. I have \nbeen a proponent of cultural and educational exchanges and have \nsupported most international exchange programs over the years--both \nthose which bring foreign visitors here and those which send American \nstudents, scholars and practitioners abroad. Most recently, my office \nparticipated in the Congress-Bundestag program. An intern from Germany \nworked in my office for several weeks and learned about how a Senate \noffice functions. I remain committed to these exchange programs. They \nbring enormous benefits to our country as well as to the individuals.\n  In 1996, I supported the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act. This law states that as of November 30, 1996, \nIIRIRA prohibits any alien from receiving an F-1 student visa to attend \na public elementary school, grades K-8, or a publicly-funded adult \neducation program unless they pay the unsubsidized, per capita cost of \ntheir education in advance. My bill would not change current law \nrelating to elementary schools or adult education. It would not pertain \nto students on formal, government-funded international exchanges such \nas those managed by the State Department, the USIA and many other \nfederal government agencies. It would simply allow high school \nofficials to waive the cost of the education of high school-level \nforeign students if that was their own choice.\n\n  Several municipalities have ``Sister City'' arrangements between \nAmerican cities and cities in foreign countries. One valuable component \nof these arrangements is an exchange program for high school students \nenabling American youth to spend a year in a foreign high school while \nstudents from abroad spend a year in a high school here. No tuition is \ngenerally exchanged under the sister city agreement, but current U.S. \nlaw states that visitors to our country must pay the unsubsidized cost \nof their education, even though American students attending schools \nabroad are exempted from the cost requirement.\n  Along the Alaska-Yukon, Alaska-British Columbia and U.S.-Mexican \nborders there are schools serving very remote communities on both sides \nof the border. After enactment of the 1996 law, Canadian or Mexican \nstudents were no longer eligible to enter the United States to attend \nlocal public schools even though governments and the local school \ndistricts agreed to enroll the students.\n  Many school districts choose to enroll one or two exchange students a \nyear. Reciprocal exchange agreements are beneficial and host families \nenjoy these students in their homes. American exchange students \nattending schools in Germany, for example, are not subjected to the \nsame tuition requirements for their schooling, yet they gain an \nunderstanding of German history and culture and benefit from their \ntravels. Currently, U.S. law requires foreign students to pay their \ntuition before they arrive in the United States. The extra paper work, \nthe up-front costs and the extra burden these requirements place on \nforeign students tend to undermine the purpose of cultural exchanges.\n  I remain mindful to past abuses of F-1 visas and am sympathetic to \nthe burden that large enrollments of foreign students place on American \npublic schools. My purpose in introducing this bill today is not to \nweaken the law as it currently reads, but to provide an outlet for our \nschools to have an opportunity for enrolling international exchange \nstudents.\n  Last year, I was successful in getting similar legislation passed in \nthe Senate. Unfortunately, it was dropped in conference. This bill has \nthe support of many Senators, of the Department of Education, \nDepartment of State and the USIA as well as most U.S. non-governmental \norganizations interested in immigration, student exchanges, public \neducation. It is my hope that the Senate will once again pass this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be included in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITED WAIVER OF REIMBURSEMENT REQUIREMENT FOR \n                   CERTAIN FOREIGN STUDENTS.\n\n       Section 214(l)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1184(l)(1)), as added\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n     by section 625(a)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3009-699), is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by redesignating clauses (i) and \n     (ii) as subclauses (I) and (II), respectively;\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (3) by striking ``(l)(1)'' and inserting ``(l)(1)(A)''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) The Attorney General shall waive the application of \n     subparagraph (A)(ii) for an alien seeking to pursue a course \n     of study in a public secondary school served by a local \n     educational agency (as defined in section 14101 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     8801) if the agency determines and certifies to the Attorney \n     General that such waiver will promote the educational \n     interest of the agency and will not impose an undue financial \n     burden on the agency.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url":

Res. 71\n\n       Whereas the President's fiscal year 2000 Federal budget \n     proposal to impose a tax on the interest, dividends, capital \n     gains, rents, and royalties in excess of $10,000 of trade \n     associations and professional societies exempt under section \n     501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 represents an \n     unjust and unnecessary penalty on legitimate association \n     activities;\n       Whereas at a time when the Government is projecting on-\n     budget surpluses of more than $800,000,000,000 over the next \n     10 years, the President proposes to increase the tax burden \n     on trade and professional associations by $1,440,000,000 over \n     the next 5 years;\n       Whereas the President's association tax increase proposal \n     will impose a tremendous burden on thousands of small and \n     mid-sized trade associations and professional societies;\n       Whereas under the President's association tax increase \n     proposal, most associations with annual operating budgets of \n     as low as $200,000 or more will be taxed on investment income \n     and as many as 70,000 associations nationwide could be \n     affected by this proposal;\n       Whereas associations rely on this targeted investment \n     income to carry out exempt-status-related activities, such as \n     training individuals to adapt to the changing workplace,\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\n     improving industry safety, providing statistical data, and \n     providing community services;\n       Whereas keeping investment income free from tax encourages \n     associations to maintain modest surplus funds that cushion \n     against economic and fiscal downturns; and\n       Whereas corporations can increase prices to cover increased \n     costs, while small and medium-sized local, regional, and \n     State-based associations do not have such an option, and thus \n     increased costs imposed by the President's association tax \n     increase would reduce resources available for the important \n     standard-setting, educational training, and professionalism \n     training performed by associations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should reject the President's proposed tax increase on \n     investment income of associations as defined under section \n     501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Crapo \nin introducing a Sense of the Senate Resolution rejecting a new tax \nproposed by the Clinton administration. As part of the administration's \nfiscal year 2000 budget proposal, this tax would be levied on the \ninvestment income earned by nonprofit trade associations and \nprofessional societies. This proposal, which would tax any income \nearned through interest, dividends, capital gains, rents and royalties \nin excess of $10,000, imposes a tremendous burden on thousands of \nsmall- and mid-sized trade associations and professional societies \ncurrently exempt under 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The administration would like us to believe that this tax is targeted \nto a few large associations, affecting only those ``lobbying \norganizations'' which exist as tax shelters for members and to further \nthe goals of special interests. Mr. President, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  This new tax would affect an estimated 70,000 registered trade \nassociations and professional societies. The bulk of these associations \noperate at a state and local level, many of whom perform little, if \nany, lobbying function. In fact, associations rely on investment income \nto perform such vital services as education, training, standard \nsetting, industry safety, research and statistical data, and community \noutreach. Through association-organized volunteer programs, Americans \ncontribute more than 173 million volunteer hours per year, at a value \nestimated at over $2 billion annually.\n  These organizations already contribute millions in taxes for any \nactivities which place them in competition with for-profit businesses. \nYet the administration would like to impose a new tax on income earned \noutside of the competitive business environment, income which is used \nto fund functions serving the public welfare. Unlike for-profit \ncorporations, investment income does not go to shareholders, \nindividuals, or other companies. Associations do not have the liberty \nof simply raising prices, as do ordinary corporations, to cover \nincreased costs.\n  Mr. President, faced with an additional increase in taxes of $1.44 \nbillion over the next five years, many associations will be forced to \ncut back on important services, and some may not survive an economic \ndownturn without the small cushion their investments provide.\n  Without such services provided by associations, the Government will \nbe forced to step in, increasing expenditures and creating additional \nGovernment programs and departments.\n  During a time when the Government is projecting on-budget tax \nsurpluses of more than $800 billion over the next 10 years, it is \nunconscionable that we allow the administration to levy a new tax on \nthese nonprofit organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/22/senate-section/article/S3060-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                    committee on government affiars\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. John \nRamney, a fellow Montana, who has spent 37 years in public service as \nan Agriculture Extension Agent for Yellowstone County, Montana. Over \nthis period he has helped farmers, downtown business folks and the \nmedia with agricultural-related questions, in a professional manner \nthat is a role model for exemplary public service today.\n  Mr. Ramney's career served Montana's agriculture industry with a \nunique quiet dedication not usually seen today. He began his career as \na county agent in training in Thompson Falls and Great Falls, Montana. \nHe then became a 4-H Agent with the Yellowstone County Extension Office \nin 1961. After serving as an assistant county agent in training in \nBillions for six years, he became a full fledged County Agent for \nYellowstone County.\n  His job has involved educating the agricultural producers in \nYellowstone County, Montana to enhance their productivity. He has done \nthis primarily by providing information from research done at Montana \nState University or other experiment stations. He has also conducted \nnumerous meetings and workshops to strengthen the farmers' knowledge \nand capabilities as Yellowstone County moved from a rural to a more \nurban county. In addition, he tirelessly maintained personal contacts \nwith local farmers to ensure their understanding about crops, \nlivestock, farm machinery, and land leases were up to date.\n  Over his almost 40 years as a County Agent, Mr. Ramney always acted \nin a positive and helpful manner. He said that even though he has \nanswered many, many questions over the years, he has learned that \neveryone who calls or stops by teaches him something. For example, he \nnoted that a lot more calls were looking for information that people \nheard about from other universities and experimental stations in other \nparts of the country. With the advent of better communications, farmers \nknew more about what was happening in Oklahoma, North Dakota, South \nDakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska. As Mr. Ramney said, ``They ask for it \nand I hunt for information wherever it might be.'' Ms. Mary Zartman, \nPersonnel Director of the Montana State University Extension Service \nstated, with the news of Mr. Ramney's retirement, ``He'll be a hard act \nto follow.''

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Small \nBusiness Investment Improvement Act of 1999. I am pleased to report the \nbill received unanimous support of my colleagues on the Committee on \nSmall Business, when we voted to report the bill on February 5, 1999. \nThis is important legislation for one simple reason: it makes more \ninvestment capital available to small businesses that are seeking to \ngrow and hire new employees.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business \nowners obtain investment capital. Forty years later, small businesses \ncontinue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment capital from \nbanks and traditional investment sources. Although investment capital \nis readily available to large businesses from traditional Wall Street \ninvestment firms, small businesses seeking investments in the range of \n$100,000-$2.5 million have to look elsewhere. SBIC's are frequently the \nonly sources of investment capital for growing small businesses.\n  Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our \nNation's best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at \ncritical points in the early growth period for many companies that are \nfamiliar to all of us. For example, Federal Express received a needed \ninfusion of capital from two SBA-licensed SBIC's at a critical juncture \nin its development stage. The SBIC program also helped other well-known \ncompanies, when they were not so well-known, such as Intel, Outback \nSteakhouse, America Online, and Callaway Golf.\n  What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\nprovides to Main Street America Small businesses. These are companies \nwe know from home towns all over the United States. Main Street \ncompanies provide both stability and growth in our local business \ncommunities. A good example of a Main Street company is Steelweld \nEquipment Company, founded in 1932, which designs and manufactures \nutility truck bodies in St. Clair, MO. The truck bodies are mounted on \nchassis made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Steelweld provides \ntruck bodies for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., Texas Utilities, \nParagon Cable, GTE, and GE Capital Fleet.\n  Steelweld is a privately held, woman-owned corporation. The owner, \nElaine Hunter, went to work for Steelweld in 1966 as a billing clerk \nright out of high school. She rose through the ranks of the company and \nwas selected to serve on the board of directors. In December 1995, \nfollowing the death of Steelweld's founder and owner, Ms. Hunter \nreceived financing from a Missouri-based SBIC, Capital for Business \n(CFB) Venture Fund II, to help her complete the acquisition of \nSteelweld. CFB provided $500,000 in subordinated debt. Senior bank debt \nand seller debt were also used in the acquisition.\n  Since Mr. Hunter acquired Steelweld, its manufacturing process was \nredesigned to make the company run more efficiently. By 1997, \nSteelweld's profitability had doubled, with annual sales of $10 million \nand 115 employees. SBIC program success stories like Ms. Hunter's \nexperience at Steelweld occur regularly throughout the United States.\n  In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the \nfuture of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the \nCommittee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business \nAdministration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure \nthe future of the program. Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly \nin an effort to meet the growing demands of small business owners for \ndebt and equity Investment capital.\n  Last year, the Senate unanimously approved a bill similar to the bill \nthat is now before the Senate. Today's bill includes two technical \nchanges in the SBIC program. The first change removes a requirement \nthat at least 50 percent of the annual program level of the approved \nparticipating securities under the SBIC Program be reserved for funding \nwith SBIC's having private capital of not more than $20 million. The \nrequirement became obsolete following SBA's imposition of its leverage \ncommitment process and congressional approval for SBA to issue 5-year \ncommitments for SBIC leverage.\n  The second technical change requires SBA to issue SBIC guarantees and \ntrust certificates at periodic intervals of not less than 12 months. \nThe current requirement is 6 months. This change will give maximum \nflexibility for SBA and the SBIC industry to negotiate the placement of \ncertificates that fund leverage and obtain the lowest possible interest \nrate.\n  The Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999 clarifies the \nrules for the determination of an eligible small business or small \nenterprise that is not required to pay Federal income tax at the \ncorporate level, but that is required to pass income through to its \nshareholders or partners by using a specified formula to compute its \nafter-tax income. This provision is intended to permit ``pass through'' \nenterprises to be treated the same as enterprises that pay Federal \ntaxes for purposes of SBA size standard determinations.\n  The bill would also make a relatively small change in the operation \nof the program. This change, however, would help smaller, small \nbusinesses to be more attractive to investors. SBIC's would be \npermitted to accept royalty payments contingent on future performance \nfrom companies in which they invest as a form of equity return for \ntheir investment.\n  SBA already permits SBICs to receive warrants from small businesses, \nwhich give the investing SBIC the right to acquire a portion of the \nequity of the small business. By pledging royalties or warrants, the \nsmall business is able to reduce the interest that would otherwise be \npayable by the small business to the SBIC. Importantly, the royalty \nfeature provides the smaller, small business with an incentive to \nattract SBIC investments when the return may otherwise be insufficient \nto attract venture capital.\n  Lastly, the bill increases the program authorization levels to fund \nparticipating securities. In fiscal year 1999, the authorization level \nwould increase from $800 million to $1.2 billion; in fiscal year 2000, \nit would increase from $900 million to $1.5 billion. The two increases \nhave become necessary as the demand in the SBIC program was growing at \na rapid rate. Higher authorization levels are necessary if the SBIC \nProgram is going to meet the demand for investment capital from the \nsmall business community.\n  Mr. President, this is a sound bill, which has the unanimous support \nof all 18 members of the Committee on Small Business. On February 2, \n1999, a similar version of this legislation passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 402-2. I strongly urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to vote in favor of the Small Business Investment \nImprovement Act of 1999.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread for the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 364) was read the third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Small \nBusiness Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 68, \nand that the Senate proceed to its consideration. I further ask \nunanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken and \nthe text of S. 364 be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill then be \nread for the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to this \nlegislation appear at appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 68), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 68) entitled ``An Act to amend section 20 of the Small \n     Business Act and make technical corrections in title III of \n     the Small Business Investment Act.'', do pass with the \n     following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.
