Mr. President and my revered mentor, the Senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, in his life, George Washington did two things \nwithout equal in the history of Government.\n  The American Colonies having revolted against the rule of King George \nIII, Washington assumed command of a makeshift army and in 6 years \nfought his way to victory, whereupon he resigned as Commander in Chief \nand turned over the army to the civil authorities, such as they were. \nFourteen years later, having served two terms as President of a new \nGovernment, he announced he would retire, although his reelection was \nnot in doubt. These two actions, said George III, ``placed him in a \nlight the most distinguished of any man living, the greatest character \nof the age''--looking back, we might say ``the greatest character of \nthe ages''--for these two actions laid the foundations of republicanism \nwhich in his Farewell Address he presciently foresaw and fervently \npredicted would strengthen and grow across the world.\n  And now to the address proper.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\nTo the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\nthat retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength \nof my inclination to do this, previous to the last election, had even \nled to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature \nreflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs \nwith foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to \nmy confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nderive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between \nthemselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied \ntogether by the same government, which their own rivalships alone would \nbe sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, \nattachments, and intrigues would stimulate and embitter. Hence \nlikewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military \nestablishments, which under any form of government are inauspicious to \nliberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to \nrepublican liberty. In this sense it is, that your Union ought to be \nconsidered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one \nought to endear to you the preservation of the other.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\nalso to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges denied to \nothers, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\nfervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which \nthey may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will \nnever cease to view them with indulgence and that, after forty-five \nyears of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the \nfaults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as \nmyself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Mr. President, I was deeply distressed with the news \nover the weekend of China's new ultimatum regarding Taiwan and the \nfront-page, above-the-fold story in the Washington Post today. I think \nthe headline summarizes the situation:\n\n       China Issues New Taiwan Ultimatum: Delay in Reunification \n     Would Spur Use of Force.\n\n  It seems that mainland China cannot stand democracy. It is almost as \nif they have a visceral antipathy to freedom. I went to Taiwan last \nmonth--the Presiding Officer accompanied me on that visit to the \nPacific rim--and had the opportunity to visit with the President of \nTaiwan and numerous officials. One of the things that struck me as we \ndisembarked the plane and I looked off the tarmac was a whole press \ncontingent, more than we had seen in, say, Japan or South Korea; a \nmedia contingent--cameras, reporters--shouting questions at us. I \nthought, even as we walked toward them, democracy has certainly arrived \nand democracy has blossomed in Taiwan because one of the signal \nsignposts, I believe, of democracy is an independent and a vigorous and \naggressive media. That was certainly evident in Taiwan.\n  One of the first questions shouted to our delegation, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming will remember, was: Will China attempt to disrupt our \nPresidential elections as they did before?\n  My answer was: I certainly hope not because it did not succeed before \nand it won't succeed this time.\n  Four years ago, China launched missiles off the coast of Taiwan, \nhoping to disrupt a cornerstone of democracy in Taiwan, its \nPresidential elections. That effort failed both because of American \naircraft carriers and the determination of the Taiwanese people not to \nbe intimidated out of their freedom.\n  Next month, on March 18, the thriving democracy of Taiwan will once \nagain hold Presidential elections, and once again it seems that the \nChinese Government hopes to disrupt those elections.\n  Just yesterday, China issued a new threat to democratic Taiwan. In an \nofficial new white paper on Taiwan, the Chinese Government stated that:\n\n       If the Taiwan authorities refuse, sine die, the peaceful \n     settlement of cross-Straits reunification through \n     negotiations, then the Chinese government will be forced to \n     adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of \n     force.\n\n  In other words, ``Negotiate or face invasion'' was effectively the \nultimatum issued by the Chinese Government.\n  No longer is the bar set at a declaration of independence or \noccupation by a foreign power; now it includes refusing to negotiate \nreunification--a dialog that was broken off by the Chinese Government. \nThis is, in effect, a blank check that the Chinese Government has \nwritten themselves, making a subjective judgment on this new, ambiguous \nstandard they have established.\n  Taiwan is not a military threat to China, and no one in the world \nbelieves it is. If it is a threat, it is an ideological threat. A \nburgeoning Chinese society, less than 100 miles across the Strait, with \nincreasing freedoms of religion, speech, and press--freedoms that are \nstifled on the mainland--the Chinese Government can't stand this \nshining contrast to its own totalitarian system. That is why China is \npulling down the threshold for invasion and building up its arms \npointed at Taiwan.\n  I suggest it is no accident that earlier this month the first of four \nRussian Sovremenny-class guided missile destroyers sailed into Chinese \nwaters. I suggest it is no accident this destroyer is equipped with \nsurface-to-surface missiles designed specifically to destroy American \nAegis ships and aircraft carriers, America's ships that would come to \nthe defense of Taiwan.\n  It is no accident that China has ordered Kilo-class submarines \nequipped with torpedoes designed to evade detection. It is no accident \nthat China has deployed short-range ballistic missiles in the provinces \njust across the Taiwan Strait. It is no accident that China has flown \nover 100 sorties over the Taiwan Strait, many with Russian-bought SU-\n27s.\n  We must not tempt intimidation with ambiguity. We must not tempt \naggression with weakness.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1838, the Taiwan Security \nEnhancement Act.\n  Opponents of this act have held this out as being somehow bellicose, \nsomehow threatening. I suggest to all my colleagues in the Senate they \nsimply read what the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act says. Our \ncolleagues in the other body passed this legislation by an overwhelming \nvote of 341-70 earlier this month. The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act \nwill bring greater clarity to our relations with Taiwan and China by \nincreasing military exchanges with Taiwan, by establishing a direct \nmilitary communications link with Taiwan, and by reestablishing \nCongress as a consultant in the annual arms sales process--as intended \nand required by the Taiwan Relations Act--which at least, supposedly, \ngoverns our relations with Taiwan.\n\n  Just last month, General Xiong Guangkai, the Deputy Chief of the \nGeneral Staff of the People's Liberation Army and a former head of \nChinese intelligence said, ``. . . we will never commit ourselves to \nrenouncing the use of force.'' The irony is that this general did not \nmake this statement while he was in China. He said this right here in \nWashington while he was being hosted by the Clinton-Gore \nadministration.\n  This reveals the irony of the situation. We have greater military \nexchanges with a country that points ballistic missiles at us than we \ndo with a democratic ally. The State Department prohibits our senior \nmilitary officers from meeting with their Taiwanese counterparts. \nInstead, the focus is on their Chinese counterparts.\n  Isn't it ironic. I was visiting--I will not mention their names--with \nleading Army officials, some of whom had served in Taiwan many years \nago, and they pointed out to me the irony that while they can hold \ntalks with leading Communist Chinese military leaders, they cannot so \nmuch as go to Taiwan\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nand meet with the military leadership in Taiwan, a democratic entity.\n  It is only a matter of common sense that in the event of a crisis--a \ncrisis now more likely--we should be able to communicate with the \nTaiwanese military--the people we may be called to defend.\n  Opponents of this bill claim that ambiguity is good. But there is \nnothing ambiguous about the Chinese position. The Chinese White Paper \neven specifically opposed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.\n  I suggest we should not be ambiguous about our support for democracy \nin Asia, nor should we apologize to China for helping Taiwan to defend \nitself.\n  I believe China has made itself clear on the Taiwan issue. So should \nwe.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S655-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JEANNE SIMON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today on the floor of the Senate to \npay tribute to a great friend who passed away on Sunday. Her name was \nJeanne Simon, the wife of my friend and former colleague in the House, \nmy predecessor in the Senate, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. Jeanne \nSimon passed away in the early morning hours on Sunday in her home in \nMakanda, IL, in the southern part of our State.\n  She had been suffering for several months from a brain tumor, and the \nend was obvious when I last saw her a few weeks ago. As Paul Simon told \nme when I called and asked if we could get together: Her spirits are \ngood. He was certainly right. We laughed over dinner and reminisced \nover old political experiences and had a great time, as we did for over \n30 years in similar meetings and dinners.\n  Jeanne Simon was an extraordinary person. She was one of the first \nwomen to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives. She was a \ngraduate of Northwestern Law School and served as an assistant State's \nattorney when very few women were involved in the profession, let alone \nas prosecutors.\n  She met another young legislator when she served in Springfield, IL, \na State representative named Paul Simon. The two hit it off and decided \nto get married in 1960. Jeanne Simon put her legislative and \nprofessional career aside to become a wife and a mother and to become a \nhelp mate, not just at home but in the political career of her husband, \nPaul Simon.\n  President Clinton was wont to say when he was elected: America got \ntwo--buy one, get one free--in terms of the First Lady and her \ncontribution to the Nation. We felt the same in the State of Illinois. \nWhenever we looked at the Simon package, it was Paul and Jeanne Simon \nand the kids wrapped up in a very attractive package with a polka dot \nbow tie. Time after time, election after election, the people in \nIllinois turned to Paul Simon as Congressman, as Lieutenant Governor, \nand finally as Senator and bought the package.\n\n  Politics is a game of individual statistics. We talk about who won, \nwho lost. In sports we talk about team statistics, but when it came to \nthe Simons, we were dealing with a team statistic. We knew that \nwhenever Paul Simon was there fighting for Illinois and the causes in \nwhich he believed, Jeanne Simon was right at his side.\n  She had special passions and commitments to literacy and to \neducation. She served as chair of the National Commission on Libraries, \nand one of the last things I ever heard from her was a call late in the \nsession last year: Check on that appropriation for libraries. She was \ncommitted to it.\n  Jeanne Simon was the kind of person, too, whom I trusted in terms of \nher judgment. She was honest and forthright and you knew when she stood \nup for a cause it was because she really believed in it.\n  How many people, men and women, in Illinois political life were \ninspired and encouraged by Jeanne Simon over the years. She has left a \ngreat legacy. I consider myself to be one of the beneficiaries of that \nlegacy. Now that she has passed away, we can reflect on the fact that \neven as a wife and mother of a great politician like Paul Simon, she \nleft an enduring contribution to the State of Illinois and to the \nNation.\n  Jeanne Simon will be missed, and many in this Chamber who knew her \nand worked with her on so many important issues will appreciate, as I \nhave, what a great and enduring legacy she left with her life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S655-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S655-S656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BIENNIAL BUDGETING\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the administration \nreleased its budget for fiscal year 2001--its last and its biggest, \ntotaling $1.8 trillion and proposing a whole host of new programs.\n  So begins our annual budget process.\n  From now until September 30, Congress will conduct dozens of hearings \nand hold countless meetings, while members of both Houses deliver \ninnumerable speeches and spend long hours of debate over every subtle \nnuance of the Federal budget process.\n  Over the next 8 months, Congress will consider a budget resolution, a \nbudget reconciliation package and as many as 13 separate appropriations \nbills--the latter only if we do not combine those appropriations bills \ninto one massive spending bill, as has been the practice in recent \nyears.\n  By the time Congress adjourns--currently scheduled for October 6--a \nmajority of votes taken in the Senate will relate to the budget \nprocess.\n  Indeed, as my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, has pointed out, 73% of the Senate's votes \nin 1996 were budget-related, 65% in 1997, and 51% in 1998. It is no \nwonder--each year, it is quite common for the same subject to be voted \nupon 3 or 4 times during the course of the entire budget process.\n  Despite the inordinate amount of time and effort that Congress will \nput into fashioning a budget that will meet our Nation's spending needs \nin a fiscally responsible way, a veto threat still looms on each of the \nappropriations bills if spending does not approach what the President \nwants.\n  At that point, high-stakes negotiations between the Congress and the \nPresident will ensue. In an effort to avoid a Government shutdown--and \nthe blame that goes with it--these negotiations inevitably yield a \nspending compromise that neither Congress nor the President \nparticularly likes, but both agree is necessary.\n  It is a heck of a way to run a railroad, but what is really \nunbelievable is this whole process is repeated each year.\n  I say enough is enough. It's time to bring rationality to our \nnation's budget process.\n  It's a fact that Congress spends too large a portion of its time \ndebating and voting on items related to the Federal budget. Meanwhile, \nmost other Congressional functions are not given proper attention.\n  We need to reestablish our priorities so we may effectively do the \nwork of the people, make sure that the Federal Government is running at \npeak efficiency and deliver value, which is quality service for the \nleast amount of money.\n  I believe we have an excellent opportunity to do that this year.\n  One of the first bills I cosponsored when I became a Senator was a \nmeasure introduced by Senator Pete Domenici that would establish a 2-\nyear budget--just like we have in about 20 States including the State \nof Ohio. I believe enactment of this bill, S. 92, will provide an \nimportant tool in the efficient use of Federal funds while \nstrengthening Congress' proper oversight role.\n  Because Congress produces annual budgets, Congress does not spend \nnearly as much time as it should on oversight of the various Federal \nDepartments and agencies due to the time and energy consumed by the \nbudget resolution, budget reconciliation, and appropriations process.\n  Not only is this a problem for Congress, but each executive branch \nagency and department must spend a significant amount of its time on \neach annual budget cycle.\n  Again, as my colleague, Senator Domenici, pointed out in his \nstatement on S. 92, the executive branch spends 1\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\nyear putting together a Federal budget, 1 year explaining that Federal \nbudget before Congress, and 1 year implementing the budget eventually \npassed by Congress.\n  Even the most diligent Cabinet Secretary cannot keep track of all the \noversight he or she is supposed to accomplish if they are trapped in \nthis endless budget cycle.\n  A biennial budget will help Congress and the executive branch avoid \nthis lengthy process. Since each particular Congress lasts only 2 \nyears, a biennial budget would allow us to consider a 2-year funding \nproposal during 1 year, while reserving the second year for the \nGovernment oversight portion of our job.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \nand Restructuring in the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have noted \nthat even though the General Accounting Office conducts numerous \nreports documenting Government inefficiencies that need to be \ncorrected, most GAO reports sit on the shelf because there is no time \nto conduct detailed hearings.\n  When oversight hearings are held, nearly everyone in the executive \nbranch knows--from career bureaucrats to Cabinet Secretaries--that they \nneed only weather the immediate storm when they are asked to come to \nthe Hill to testify.\n  That is because once they answer the criticisms that have been \nleveled in these GAO reports, and explain how they are going to improve \nthe situation, it is over; the worst has passed. Rarely do they have to \nworry about followup hearings to make sure they have implemented the \nproper remedies because they know Congress just will not have the time \nto conduct future hearings.\n  Unfortunately, that reality can lead to problems later on that impact \npublic safety or national security.\n  Last year, the Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings regarding \nDr. Wen Ho Lee and the security situation at the Los Alamos National \nLab. I was shocked to learn that for 20 years we have had a problem \nwith security at the Department of Energy, and no one did anything \nabout it. But GAO knew: they had released 31 major reports on nuclear-\nsecurity problems at the Department since 1980.\n  Congress needs the time to conduct proper oversight--including \nfollowup investigations--in order to make sure that situations like \nthis do not repeat. Without having to devote the majority of its time \nand energy to annual budget bills, Congress will be able to make sure \nthat the Federal Government operates harder and smarter and does more \nwith less. I am confident that the Senate will pass S. 92--biennial \nbudget legislation--during this session of Congress.\n  Regardless of the Senate's actions on passing this bill, I believe \nthe House of Representatives needs to be more engaged in this process. \nUnfortunately, the news reports that I have seen indicate that there is \nnot much support at the leadership level in the House for such a bill.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to reconsider their views on \nbiennial budget legislation, or in the alternative, pass a better \nlegislative proposal. Congress should not continue to come up with \nreasons why budget reform can't pass, but find ways to make sure that \nit can.\n  It should be plainly obvious to my colleagues in both Houses--\nincluding those on the Appropriations Committees--that the annual \nappropriations process is not working. As I stated earlier, each year \nCongress ends up negotiating a spending deal that is higher than \nCongress wants in order to avoid the Presidential veto pen. If we are \never going to get a handle on our debt, we have to end this bad public \npolicy. It would definitely be in the best interest of our Nation.\n  I believe this biennial budget legislation, S. 92, is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we could consider this year. I will \ncontinue to press for its passage.\n  For my colleagues who are tired of the seemingly endless budget and \nappropriations cycles and are frustrated at the inability to devote \nenough time to the oversight duties of their committees, I urge them to \njoin in cosponsoring this legislation. I also urge my House colleagues \nto review the merits of the biennial budget process and act upon \nlegislation as expeditiously as possible for the good of America.\n  The point I am making is this. It is time for this Congress to adopt \na 2-year budget cycle instead of the one we have had for too many \nyears. It will help us do a better job in terms of budgeting and \ncertainly get us to do the oversight that is so badly needed by this \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, similar to many of our colleagues, I have \nbeen back home in my State at townhall meetings. One of the very \nconsistent themes I heard is that folks want to see us address some of \nthe key issues of our time, particularly the economic issues.\n  I have heard again and again--and it is clear--that millions of \nsenior citizens cannot afford their prescription medicine. I heard \nagain and again that millions of married couples are being shackled by \nthis marriage tax penalty. It seems to me Congress can fashion a \nprudent, well-crafted bill that addresses this marriage tax penalty and \nalso responds to the concerns of seniors--without blowing up the \nbudget, without violating the principles of fiscal responsibility, and \nby prudent use of the surplus.\n  Democrats want to see--and Democrats are anxious to work with \nRepublicans on this--an effort to help the many seniors and families \nwho are walking on an economic tightrope trying to afford their \nprescription drug bills. We want to see meaningful tax relief for \nmarried couples. What we have to do is work together, in a bipartisan \nway, to fashion that.\n  I will spend just a minute talking about how serious this \nprescription drug problem is for the Nation's older people.\n  When I was home recently, I heard from an elderly woman in Yoncalla, \nOR. She lives by herself. She lives in southern Oregon. She has an \nincome of about $500 a month. When she is done paying her prescription \ndrug bill, she has just a little bit over $200 to live on for the rest \nof the month. She lives a long way from pharmacies, so she cannot very \nwell comparison shop.\n  She wants to know, why isn't it possible for this Congress to enact a \nprescription drug benefit for her and for others similarly situated? My \nview is, if we do not enact a prescription drug benefit for this \nperson, she is going to end up a lot sicker and with a lot more health \nproblems than she has today. That will be much more expensive to the \ntaxpayers.\n  In addition, I recently heard from an elderly couple from Baker, OR, \nwho have to take a great many prescription drugs. After their monthly \nmedication, together they have less than $200 on which to get by. They \nsaid in their letter: ``That is not living. That is existing.''\n  Colleagues, it is very clear that in a country as rich and as strong \nas ours, we clearly are capable of doing justice to the vulnerable \nolder people, such as the elderly folks I described from rural Oregon \nwho are struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford their \nprescription drugs.\n  People ask us all the time: Can we afford prescription drug coverage? \nMy message is: We cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs.\n  One of these anticoagulant medicines that helps prevent strokes in \nolder people might cost $1,000 or $1,500 a year--certainly pricey--but \nyou prevent that stroke with the medication and you save upwards of \n$100,000 that an older person might incur in expenses for problems \nassociated with the stroke.\n  What we need to do--and the President has one approach; Senator \nKennedy has another approach; Senator Snowe and I have worked together \non a bipartisan basis--is bring these bills together and make sure we \nuse marketplace forces to hold down the costs of prescription drugs for \nolder people. Each one of these bills--the kind of approach the \nPresident is talking about, as well as the approaches Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Snowe and I are\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\ntalking about--each one of these approaches makes sure the dollars we \nearmark for this program are used to pay the prescription drug portion \nof an older person's private health insurance bill.\n  You hear a whole lot of talk these days about how the insurance \ncompanies would not possibly be interested in this. Of course they are \ngoing to be interested in this. I have talked to them from my area. \nThey are anxious to see the Government in a responsible, prudent \nprogram, for which I believe there is now bipartisan support. They are \nanxious to see Medicare pick up the prescription drug portion of a \nsenior's private health insurance bill.\n  With a lot of my colleagues on the Democratic side--and I know \nSenator Snowe and others on the Republican side want to address this as \nwell--I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate and keep \nreading these letters and describing the circumstances of older people \nwho want to see this Congress enact meaningful relief for prescription \ndrug costs before we adjourn.\n  Medicare did not cover prescription drugs when it began. Right now, \nthe senior citizen who does not have prescription drug coverage is \nbasically subsidizing other people in this country who do have coverage \nwhose plans are able to negotiate discounts. That is not right. It is \nnot fair.\n  We can enact meaningful prescription drug coverage under the Medicare \nprogram in this session of Congress. Until we do, I and other Democrats \nare going to keep coming to this floor, reading the accounts of seniors \nwho are facing these staggering prescription drug costs they cannot \nafford.\n  I intend to keep working with Senator Snowe and Senator Kennedy, and \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle, so the legacy of this session \nof the Congress can be that we stood up for a fair shake for the \nmillions of vulnerable older Americans and their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my first elected job was as a member of the \nboard of trustees of then the largest hospital district in the State of \nNevada, Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. During the time I was on the \nboard, we were gratified to see Medicare come into being because 40 \npercent of the senior citizens coming to our hospital had no insurance. \nPeople arrived at the hospital with their husband, their wife, their \nsons and daughters, and they had to sign papers agreeing to pay the \nbill. If patients did not pay the bill, a collection company pursued \npeople to see that the bills were paid. We garnished wages and made \nsure the government institution received the money to which it was \nentitled.\n  Approximately 35 years later there are some problems, but of course \nit is a great medical program. Now instead of 40 percent of seniors \nhaving no health insurance when they come into a hospital, virtually \nall seniors have some type of health insurance when they come to the \nhospital. That is a result of Medicare.\n  In 1965, when I was a member of that hospital board, coverage was \nimportant to pay a hospital bill and to be able to see a doctor. What \nwe did not cover and was not necessary when Congress passed the act was \nprescription drug coverage. Now we need prescription drug coverage. It \nis a tremendous lacking in the Medicare program.\n  We have had breakthroughs in the interim years in the pharmaceutical \nindustry that are among the greatest advances in medical history. \nToday, prescription drugs alone have the power to reduce heart attacks \nby lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, using all kinds of drugs, \nincluding aspirin. Drugs such as Zocor, Mevacor, Inderal, Corgard, and \nCalan are great in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. These are \nlifesaving. Drugs can minimize death from cancer. These include Taxol \nand Tamoxifen. They slow the progress of AIDS with AZT and other \nprotease inhibitors. They treat depression and mood disorders with \nProzac and Zoloft. Bacterial infections can be cleared up, including \near and bladder infections, with a string of antibiotics called \nCephalosphorin. We can reduce the possibility of organ rejection. We \ncould not have organ transplants until they came up with something \ncalled Cyclosporin. Now people can have kidney transplants almost \nroutinely. Other transplants are becoming more common.\n  The Presiding Officer and I served in the House of Representatives \nwith a Member of Congress who had a heart and lung transplant many \nyears ago. He leads a very productive life. That is because of the \npharmaceutical industry.\n\n  For migraine headaches, I am sure, Mr. President, you have, as I \nhave, had family members who benefited tremendously from something \ncalled Imitrix. People would go to doctors and use all kind of special \npillows and heat and cold and all kinds of things, but what has worked \nwell is this thing called Imitrix. It really, basically, takes away \nheadaches.\n  For enlarged prostate, there is something called Proscar. To treat \narthritis pain, one wonder drug is called Imuran; for allergies, \nCaritan, Allegra, and other things. Allergies take tremendous amounts \nof time away from the workplace. At certain times of the year they can \nbe debilitating.\n  To slow the progression and control the symptoms of Parkinson's \ndisease--we have a long way to go; about 50 percent of the people in \nrest homes are there because of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's--\nbut we have made some progress treating Parkinson's disease with drugs \ncalled Amatadine and Deprenyl. There are drugs to reduce muscle \nspasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.\n  There are things there we need to work on, but we are making \nprogress. I had a hearing a number of years ago where a doctor said we \nare making great progress, and indeed progress has been made since \nthen.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of older Americans, 3 out of every 4 \nseniors,\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nlack decent, dependable private-sector coverage for prescription drugs, \nand at least 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have absolutely no \nprescription drug coverage at all. That is wrong. That is why the \nMedicare legislation, which passed in 1965, needs to be updated.\n  Many seniors, and especially senior women, struggle to meet the \nrising cost of filling their prescriptions. Why do I say women? \nBecause, according to the Older Women's League, total prescription drug \nspending for women on Medicare averages about $1,200 a year, 20 percent \nmore than that for men. In many cases, seniors simply do not take the \ndrugs their doctors prescribe because they cannot afford them.\n  You do not have to be a doctor to understand this is bad medicine. \nWithout access to important medication, seniors run the risk of \ndeveloping complications that require expensive treatments and hospital \nstays. While some seniors enroll in Medicare managed care plans because \nthey provide some drug coverage, we cannot depend on this option, and \nmany of these plans are no longer around. The Medicare managed care \nplans have found they cannot afford them, so they are dropping seniors. \nThis is an unstable source of coverage because many Medicare managed \ncare plans have decreased their drug coverage. The number of \nbeneficiaries enrolling in these Medicare plans is declining because \nthe promises are not what they are supposed to be.\n  Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health costs for \nseniors. On average, seniors fill 18 prescriptions a year and take 4 to \n6 prescription drugs a day. Because of the high cost and lack of \ncoverage, one study shows that one in eight seniors is forced to choose \nbetween buying food and buying medicine. That is drastic. One in eight \nseniors is forced to choose between buying food or medicine. Every day \nthis takes place in America. To make matters worse, studies show that \nseniors without drug coverage pay more for drugs than those who have \ninsurance.\n  Prescription drugs are a necessary component of modern medicine, and \nour seniors are dependent on them to maintain a healthy, active \nlifestyle. This is something that has come about in the last 35 years. \nThe special health needs of our seniors are often those that respond \nbest to treatment by prescription drugs. For millions of seniors, \nprescription medicines are lifesavers. It is time to show our seniors \nwe are serious about creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and \nI hope we can work together to do that as quickly as possible. We need \nMedicare to include prescription drugs.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum for one \nmoment, and then I will call up the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It passed overwhelmingly in the House of \nRepresentatives last year by a vote of 419-0, and it has always had \nstrong support in the Senate from Senators Lieberman, Feinstein, and \nHelms--a very broad, bipartisan group.\n  I also have to acknowledge the cooperation of Senator Levin, who has \nbeen working with me on the managers' amendment. I think it is \nimportant, we now go forward with this legislation.\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\n  I am pleased I have been joined in this effort by Senator Lieberman, \nwho he is on the floor to participate in the discussion of this \nlegislation. Senator Lieberman is a long-time expert in \nnonproliferation and Middle East matters, and he certainly deserves a \nlot of the credit for making this legislation possible.\n  The purpose of the bill is to express once again our deep concern \nregarding the transfer to Iran of dangerous technology, principally \nfrom Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as from other foreign \nentities, and to recommend additional steps to halt this deadly trade.\n  Again, let me go into a little history. This legislation passed the \nHouse and the Senate in 1998. The President vetoed it, but, at the \nrequest of the administration, efforts were ongoing to work with \nRussia. That veto was not overridden. We did not vote on it. But the \nhope that progress would be made has not paid off; we have not achieved \nthe results we hoped for. You can say it was because they had changes \nin the leadership positions in Russia. They are trying to make \nprogress, but the fact is, they are not making progress and this \ndangerous transfer of the technology that could lead to proliferation \nof nuclear weapons continues.\n  This bill requires the President to report to Congress when credible \ninformation exists of a transfer of dangerous technology to Iran. The \nPresident must also inform Congress whether he has imposed certain \npenalties on foreign persons as a result of such transfers. If such \npenalties are not imposed, the President must report the reasons why he \ndecided against taking this step.\n  The bill will also create new incentives for the Russian aviation and \nspace agency to cooperate with the United States in efforts to stem the \nproliferation of weapons technology to Iran by precluding certain \npayments to that agency if entities under its jurisdiction and control \nengage in such transfers.\n  Think about that. The United States is assisting the Russian aviation \nand space agency at a time when entities under its jurisdiction may, as \na matter of fact, be involved in transferring this dangerous technology \nto Iran. It is absurd, and the American people would rightly be \nhorrified to find that is the case.\n  As I noted, this bill passed the House last September by a unanimous \nvote, and that vote occurred despite an explicit veto threat by the \nPresident. The overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House and the strong \nbipartisan support the bill enjoys in the Senate underscores the \nseriousness with which the Congress views Iran's continued quest for \nlong-range missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.\n  I can think of few international developments that would be as \ndamaging to U.S. national security and to stability and security in the \nMiddle East as the acquisition by Iran of long-range, nuclear-tipped \nmissiles.\n  We know already Iran has been the most notorious state sponsor of \nterrorism, including attacks on Americans, and we know Iran remains a \nsteadfast opponent of peace between Israel and her neighbors, and Iran \nsupports those whose violence is aimed at undermining prospects for a \ngenuine lasting peace.\n  Some of our colleagues might observe that they had elections in Iran \nlast week, and I believe those elections continue now. It appears \nreformers have been making some gains. That may be the situation in \nIran, and the relations with Iran will change as a result of that. Let \nme assure my colleagues that the danger is still there. Those who are \nin charge of this nuclear proliferation in Iran have a very strong grip \non what is being done, and there is very little likelihood they are \ngoing to let go of it anytime soon, in spite of what appears to be \nencouraging election returns. In fact, one can argue that to continue \nto send a strong signal against Iran's acquisition of weapons of mass \ndestruction actually bolsters the reformers in their efforts to change \nthe approach of Iran, both internally and externally.\n  While we are pleased to see what appears to be encouraging results--\nand I think the Senate should express itself on that, and I will \nsuggest to the Democratic leadership we perhaps have a resolution \nacknowledging what has happened there and are hopeful about what that \nmay mean--I do not think by any stretch of the imagination that should \nlead us to think everything is going to change immediately and we \nshould not go forward with this very important legislation.\n  If my colleagues think about it, it is quite scary: Iran's leaders, \nnow and in the future, will be in possession of nuclear-tipped ICBMs \ncapable of reaching Washington or Los Angeles or New York. America's \nsecurity and that of our friends and allies in the region will be \nunalterably affected by such a horrific development.\n  Yet that day of reckoning is coming and much sooner than we prefer, \nunless something is done to stop the transfer of this technology and \nother forms of assistance to Iran by Russia, in particular, but also by \nChina and North Korea.\n  My colleagues will recall we have been working on this for 3 or 4 \nyears. We have tried mightily to be of help to the administration in \ntrying to put pressure on Russia in particular, but that strategy has \nfailed to slow the flow of this dangerous technology.\n  Let me point out what CIA Director George Tenet said recently in a \nreport to Congress on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nover the previous 6-month period. In that report, Director Tenet wrote:\n\n       Entities in Russia and China continued to supply a \n     considerable amount and a wide variety of ballistic missile-\n     related goods and technology to Iran.\n\n  The report also stated:\n\n       Iran's earlier success in gaining technology and materials \n     from Russian companies accelerated Iranian [missile] \n     development.\n\n  Director Tenet also noted:\n\n       Russian entities continued to interact with Iranian \n     research centers on various [nuclear] activities. These \n     projects will help Iran augment its nuclear technology \n     infrastructure, which in turn would be useful in supporting \n     nuclear weapons research and development.\n\n  The report also highlighted China's development in their programs. \nFor example, the report stated:\n\n       Firms in China provided missile-related items, raw \n     materials, and/or assistance to . . . Iran.\n\n  I had occasion to meet personally with Director Tenet recently \nbecause I wanted to hear what information he had that he could provide \nto me and other Senators who wished to have a private briefing about \nwhat is going on in this area, and also to discuss the recent U.S. \ncounterterrorism activities.\n  Director Tenet reaffirmed that the flow of dangerous technology to \nIran from Russia and China is, in fact, continuing and on a significant \nscale. It has not dropped. If anything, it has become worse. I urge \nthose Senators who have not had a chance to review this classified \nrecord to go up to room S-407 to get this briefing. It is a sobering \nreminder that despite the end of the cold war, serious threats to U.S. \nsecurity and our critical allies around the world remain.\n  I commend Director Tenet and the entire U.S. intelligence community \nfor their heroic efforts to uncover the truth about these dangerous \ntransfers. What makes the intelligence community's successes so much \nmore astounding is that they come in spite of significant denial and \ndeception by Russia, China, and others.\n  Director Tenet's report underscores the administration's current \nstrategy for dealing with this growing problem. I know they worked at \nit. I discussed this with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. They \nhave tried. They acknowledged it has been difficult. They have had to \ndeal with changing people and the laws in Russia, of while their \nintentions, as they provide them to us verbally, appear to be in the \nright direction, the results are just not there.\n  The administration had hoped that by engaging Russia, China, and \nNorth Korea in a dialog, they could persuade those nations to cease and \ndesist from their provocative behavior. The administration, I \nunderstand, did get the Russian Government to take some steps, such as \nadoption of export control law and regulations, but despite this fact, \nnot a single Russian has been successfully prosecuted for transferring \nweapons of mass destruction or missile technology to Iran. Not one. I \nrepeat, the intelligence we get is it is probably growing worse. So \naction against an individual, action against companies or academicians \nand professors, if there is anything in that nature going on, we do not \nsee any results.\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\n  Thus, it appears the Russian Government either supports this \nclandestine transfer of dangerous technology to Iran or is unwilling to \ntake strong necessary steps to halt it.\n  The same can be said for the People's Republic of China and the \nDemocratic People's Republic of North Korea; therefore, I join with \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in believing that it \nis time to send a strong signal to the administration but, more \nimportantly, to Russia, China, and North Korea, and to other countries \nthat may be contemplating the transfer of this dangerous technology to \nIran, or to Iraq, for that matter.\n  The message is simple: The Congress and the American people are not \ncontent with the status quo. We are not content with the dialog that \nproduces even more promises on the one hand and scant or no real \nreduction in the flow of technology on the other. Some might say this \nbill is not strong enough, and I would be hard pressed to disagree with \nthat. I would prefer it to be even stronger. After all, the bill \nprovides the President with the authority to impose sanctions, but it \ndoes not require them. We may want to look at doing that if we do not \nsee some changes. If we do not see some actions by the administration, \nif we do not see some actions being taken to impose sanctions, then we \nmay want to go that next step.\n  I believe bolder action is going to be needed, that this will not be \nenough. It is a signal that is worth providing at this time. Because of \nits strong bipartisan support and because I believe it will become law, \nI am willing to go forward with it in this fashion at this time.\n  The bill before us now reflects a continuing commitment in both \nparties to take a tough stand in the fight against nuclear \nproliferation.\n  With this in mind, I urge the President not to veto this bipartisan \nbill but instead to sign it into law as soon as it lands on his desk.\n  Again, I thank Senator Lieberman, Senator Helms, and the many other \nSenators who are involved in the process of crafting this important \nlegislation. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1883, the Iran \nNonproliferation Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the leader leaves the floor, I say it is important \nthat we, on matters relating to foreign policy, do as much as we can on \na bipartisan basis. I think moving this legislation along speaks well \nof that. I am confident that the legislation will be signed.\n  I also extend my congratulations to the Senator from Connecticut, who \nhas worked on this for a long time, well more than a year. It is \nbecause of him, working with the full committee, that we have been able \nto move this measure along.\n  I also say to the leader, I think when the votes are counted in Iran, \nwe should consider a resolution congratulating the people of Iran for \nwhat appears to be the moderate tone of the election results. I think \nthat is very important. That is a positive sign, as it is a positive \nsign today that there appears to be developing in Russia a stable \ngovernment.\n  I extend my appreciation to the leader for the manner in which this \nmeasure is moving along. On an issue such as this, we should not have \nacrimonious debate. We have been able to avoid that with the work that \nhas been done behind the scenes. That is very important.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I think it is important the \nSenate take note of the fact that for the first time in 20 years \nreformers may have been making some gains and that maybe internally and \nthe way they deal with the rest of the world things may change in Iran. \nWe hope that is the case.\n  I ask that you join me in talking to Senator Daschle to see if we can \ncraft some legislation that would express the resolution's views on \nthis. Hopefully, we can also take that up, if not today, maybe later \nthis week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support this legislation. I \nparticularly wish to thank the majority leader for his steadfast and \nvery strong support for this important piece of legislation. The \nmajority leader has recognized the serious threat that the \nproliferation of ballistic missile capacity and weapons of mass \ndestruction to rogue nations, such as Iran, represents to our forces in \nthe Middle East, to our allies in the Middle East, and in the not-too-\ndistant future--maybe real soon--to our allies in Europe, and, heaven \nprotect us, to the United States of America, to our homeland.\n  We have talked a lot in this Chamber, and outside, about national \nmissile defense. We crossed a bridge on this issue last year, I think, \nwith the bipartisan legislation sponsored initially by the majority \nleader's colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran.\n  But if we are now involved in an effort to develop a national missile \ndefense, does it not make sense to use whatever authority we have to \ndeter, to retard, and, if possible, to prevent a rogue nation, such as \nIran, from developing the capacity to strike us and our allies?\n  This is to me the other side of the American effort to protect us and \nour people and our allies from what, in the years ahead, I am afraid \nwill be the single most serious threat to our security, which is, the \nproliferation of ballistic missile capacity and weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The majority leader has been the leader on the bill we are \nconsidering today, and I have been privileged to work with him on it. I \nappreciate the broad bipartisan support we have on this measure. As the \nmajority leader said, this legislation could have been stronger. It \nstarted out stronger when we introduced the initial legislation, but in \nthe process of trying to get something done, we modified it.\n  It still makes an important statement to the world about the \nsteadfast commitment of the Congress of the United States to do \neverything we can to diminish the threat of weapons of mass destruction \ncarried by ballistic missiles. It sends a message to our friends in \nRussia about the intensity of our concern about their part in helping \nIran develop weapons of mass destruction. I believe it sends a message \nto the Administration of the United States about the broad bipartisan \nsupport in Congress for tougher actions against any nation, including \nRussia--with whom we have a developing relationship--if they are \nsupporting Iran in the development of this destructive capacity.\n  A reporter stopped me earlier today on the way to the Chamber and \nasked: Aren't you worried about the effect that passage of the Iran \nNonproliferation Act will have on the Government of Russia or in the \nPresidential elections coming in Russia? My answer, directly, is no. \nBut, obviously, we are all concerned and hopeful that the forces of \nreform will take hold in Russia and bring stability and progress to \nthat country. But our first concern has to be not what happens in \nRussia, but what we can do to protect the security of the American \npeople in this country and our forces abroad from the threat of weapons \nof mass destruction carried by ballistic missiles. If the Russian \nGovernment will be true to its own statements about working against \nproliferation, then there will be no problem for Russia as a result of \nthe passage of this legislation.\n  My colleagues have talked about changes in Iran. The developments are \nmost remarkable in Iran. There is a whole new generation of Iranians \nand, if I am not mistaken, more than half of it was not of age when the \nextreme Islamic revolution, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, occurred in the \nlate 1970s. It is a generation that appears to want reform, better \nlives for themselves, freedom, better relations with the West, and \nbetter relations with the United States of America.\n\n  Remarkably, in the midst of the very authoritarian government that \ncame into power in the late 1970s and has been there since, the \nIranians have continued to have elections.\n  Here is the power of the people at work again. Last Friday, \napparently, more than four out of five eligible voters came out to vote \nin Iran. I say, parenthetically, what an embarrassment it should be to \nus to recall that in 1998, the last time we had a congressional \nelection--our own, if you will, parliamentary election--36 percent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\neligible voters came out to vote; only one-third, as compared to more \nthan four-fifths in Iran. They are apparently expressing very broad \nsupport for the forces of reform.\n  Does that diminish the concern we have about what Iran is doing? Not \nimmediately, unfortunately. Because the power is still exercised by a \nsmall group of leaders at the top. Not by the reform-oriented, moderate \nPresident Khatami, but by the religious leaders at the top who still \nexercise and control the agencies of foreign policy, defense policy, \nand intelligence policy, who still have the power to override and veto \nany of the acts, even of this new reform Parliament.\n  The focus of our concern about Iran is that it has been our most \nimplacable foe in the recent past and that it has been the single most \nintransigent supporter of terrorism against this Nation and our allies, \na reality that remains unchanged.\n  The thought that weapons of mass destruction, carried by ballistic \nmissiles, would be in the possession of this nation, effectively still \ncontrolled by this small group of enemies of the United States, should \nfill us with the most profound fear and anxiety.\n  It is from that fear and anxiety that this bill emerges. It is not \nthe first time we have expressed our concerns about these developments \nin Iran. In previous enactments we have given the Administration the \ntools to try to address this problem, specifically in the Arms Export \nControl Act and in the Iran-Iraq Sanctions Act. But we were not \nsatisfied with those measures and the way they were being used, so we \npassed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act in 1997, a measure \nsimilar to this legislation we are considering today.\n\n  Unfortunately, the President chose to veto that legislation. That is \nwhy H.R. 1883 was introduced and why it passed the House \noverwhelmingly, 419-0, with every Member of both parties who voted \nsupporting it.\n  Since 1997, our concern about the problem has not diminished. It is \nwidely and reliably reported--this is why we are back with this \nlegislation--that entities and people in Russia continue to provide \nboth technology and assistance to Iran to build these dangerous \nweapons. Iran has made worrying progress on its missile program, as the \nmajority leader indicated and as the intelligence reports, classified \nas they are, which are available to our colleagues, clearly state.\n  I cite also an unclassified source. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, with help from Russians and others, notably North \nKoreans and Chinese, Iran has produced a Shahab 3 ballistic missile \nwith a range of 800 miles and tested it; on July 22, 1998, to be exact. \nAlthough the first test was apparently unsuccessful, the Congressional \nResearch Service reports that the Shahab 3 is now thought to be \noperational and in production. There also have been credible reports \nthat Iran is in the process of developing yet another, more advanced \nmissile, the Shahab 4, which would have a range of up to 2,000 miles, \nmore than double the range of the Shahab 3. We have some basis for \nbelieving the Iranians are now working on intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles.\n  If combined with weapons of mass destruction, these existing Iranian \nmissiles can threaten American forces and our allies and friends in the \nMiddle East and, soon after that, as indicated, our forces and allies \nthroughout Europe and, of course, eventually, the American homeland \nitself. This is a frightening prospect, given Iran's large chemical \nweapons program and aggressive attempt to acquire a nuclear weapons \ncapability. The American Government has made it clear that Iran is \nattempting--in this case largely with China's help--to reach self-\nsufficiency in the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons, \nthough Iran continues to deny that charge. Concerns have also been \nexpressed by authorities in our country that Iran is seeking to become \na nuclear arms state by attempting to buy material for such weapons or \nby using nonmilitary nuclear assistance to build up its knowledge about \nnuclear weapons.\n  These programs in Iran can profoundly change the balance of power in \nthe region and strike a very serious blow to our efforts to contain \nIran until it becomes a responsible member of the community of nations, \nuntil the forces of change which are blowing so hopefully through Iran, \neven as we speak today, reach fruition and a change of policy.\n  I am sure most everyone in this Chamber will look forward to a day \nwhen sanctions of this kind will not be necessary because a new \ngovernment, representing what seems to be the clear will of the Iranian \npeople, would be in power in Tehran; a government with which the United \nStates of America and our allies could have constructive and peaceful \nrelations. But until that time, the kinds of weapons capabilities that \nare being developed allow Iran to threaten, for instance, friendly Arab \nStates, making it harder for them to cooperate with the United States. \nThese weapons capabilities would raise the risks to U.S. military \nforces in the region and could threaten the free flow of oil out of \nthis critical region which could, of course, create crises in the \nUnited States, in Europe, Asia, and in any other place in the world \nthat depends on fuel from the Middle East to power their economies.\n  It is self-evident and axiomatic that we have to do whatever we can \nto try to deter this dangerous capability, to delay it, to retard it as \nbest we can, given the Iranian Government that now exists. Part of that \nis making clear, as I believe this legislation does, to our friends in \nRussia in no uncertain terms that we are serious about this. The time \nfor hit and miss, slower, bob-and-weave progress toward shutting off \nRussian assistance to Iran for the development of these dangerous \nprograms is over.\n\n  In addition to other sanctions, we have focused in this bill on \nholding up extraordinary, as we call it, American funding for the \ninternational space station to the Russian space agency, unless Russia \ntakes sufficient action to halt any part it is playing in proliferation \nto Iran. This is our attempt to demonstrate the seriousness of our \nconcern about this matter, even to the extent of stopping the funding \nof a program that is not only important to us--that is, space \ncooperation--but important to the Russians.\n  While we cannot expect to prevent all technology transfers to rogue \nstates, we do have the ability to check the flow of some of it by \nadopting the kinds of sanctions in this legislation that are aimed at \npersons engaged in such activity. We are able and therefore must act to \ntake measures against those governments that condone such activity, \nwhether or not they are organizing and abetting the transfer, or merely \nlooking the other way when their citizens engage in these activities.\n  Senator Lott quoted CIA Director George Tenet. Director Tenet has \nmade quite clear that despite the noticeable shifts within Iran, it \nremains ``the most active state sponsor of terrorism.'' Iran's support \nfor dangerous terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the \nPalestinian Islamic Jihad, through training, money, and weapons, has \njust not ended. There are people in our country, people whom I respect, \nwho continue to sustain the belief, based on evidence they have \ngathered, that Iran was involved in the 1996 attack on American service \npersonnel at Khobar in Saudi Arabia, though no definitive conclusion \nhas been reached on that matter.\n  We have been engaged in a dialog across a wide spectrum with our \nfriends and allies in trying to address the issue of proliferation to \nIran. The prospect of a nuclear-capable, militarily powerful Iran armed \nwith ballistic missiles is clearly a threat to our national interests \nand to those of our allies; therefore, we must act to stop it. The \nsanctions we are proposing will further stop the diffusion of this \ntechnology and lead to a more stable Middle East.\n  I echo the words of the majority leader: The passage of this measure \nmay actually encourage the forces of reform in Iran which are now so \nboldly and inspiringly expressing themselves. It certainly does seem \nthat those forces of reform want to have better relations with the \nWest, with the United States. Part of what we are saying to them is, \nthis matters to us. You must stop your support of terrorism. Stop your \ndevelopment of these weapons of mass destruction, and we can develop a \nmuch better relationship.\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\n  The bill itself is simple and direct. It requires the President to \nsubmit reports to Congress on foreign entities where there is credible \ninformation that these entities have transferred certain goods, \nservices, or technologies to Iran. That part of the bill would apply to \nany entities anywhere in the world, not just the Russians. It \nauthorizes the President to impose measures against these entities, but \ndoes not mandate him to do so. It allows him to consider exculpatory \nmaterial, material that argues against the guilt of the entities.\n  And with an amendment that will be adopted, submitted by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Levin, those entities will be given an opportunity \nto respond to those allegations before any sanctions are considered.\n  Finally, the bill prohibits these extraordinary American payments to \nthe Russian space agency until certain conditions enumerated in the \nbill are met. The purpose is to say to the Russians specifically that \nwe keep seeing compelling evidence that entities in Russia are \nsupporting the development of these dangerous programs within Iran.\n  As much as we want to continue to work with Russia on joint efforts \nin space, we will not do so if they are contributing to this grave \nthreat to our security.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Lott, Senator Biden, Senator Helms, and \nothers on both sides who have worked together to bring this bill to the \nfloor, where I have reason to believe it will achieve strong support. I \nwas pleased to hear representatives of the Administration indicate to \nsome of us a short while ago that, though they may not specifically \nsupport the bill, they would not recommend that, in its current form, \nthe President veto it. I think we are on the way to making a unified \nstatement, which is a constructive one, and which takes a small but \nsignificant step toward protecting us, our children, and grandchildren \nfrom the threat of weapons of mass destruction carried by ballistic \nmissiles.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves \nthe floor, I wish to thank him and acknowledge all the work he has done \nover the past year or more on this issue. He has, in a sense, exercised \nsome forbearance in the past when he thought it might have been more \nappropriate to make a stronger move, but because of circumstances \nwithin Russia and our bilateral relations and the hope--not \nexpectation--that there may be a way to get this done, he has \ncooperated. I think everybody should understand the reason this issue \nhas stayed so much on the forefront is because of his vigilance and his \neffort. I thank him for that. I thank him as well, along with other \ncolleagues, for entertaining some of the changes that Senator Levin \nproposed. I think this is a much better bill. I agree with him; I think \nenough time has passed to demonstrate that this may be the only course \nleft open, and hopefully it will work.\n  In a strange sense, the Senator and I have had occasion separately \nand individually, as the Presiding Officer has, to meet with members of \nthe Russian Duma, members of the Russian Government, and members of the \nleadership of the various Arab states. I find it counterintuitive that \nthey don't understand, quite frankly, that what is happening in Iran \nand their quest for this missile technology is literally a greater \nthreat to them than it is to us. It is no greater threat to anyone than \nIsrael; nonetheless, it is an incredibly significant threat to our \nfriends in Europe, as well as our Arab friends. What is going on in \nNorth Korea is a threat to China and Russia in the long term, not only \nJapan and South Korea. What is going on in Iraq is a greater threat to \nour French friends--who seem to support Iraq against their own \ninterests--than it is to us.\n  I am wondering when reason will take hold. I am a little bit \ndismayed, and more than a little bit miffed, by the ability of our \nfriends, as well as those who are not viewed as our close friends, to \ndismiss reality. What do they think? If Russia is worried about the \nradicalization of the Moslem populations within the former Soviet \nUnion, the Trans-Caucasus, and other places, why in the devil do they \nnot understand that what is going on in Iraq, as well as in Iran--if it \ndoes not take a drastic change in course--is inimical to their \ninterests? Ironically, the second largest former Communist state--the \nformer Soviet Union--seems to be the ultimate capitalist in this \nregard; but they can't add very well. This is, I think, more about \nmoney than anything else. Hopefully, as I will lay out in my \nstatement--and I don't want to delay the Senator any longer--they will \nsee the virtues of looking to the West and not to Iran and Iraq for the \nsource of their economic survival. At any rate, I thank the Senator \nvery much for his leadership.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nDelaware for his kind words and the spirit of cooperation in which we \nhave worked on this and on so many other matters over the years. I \ncould not agree with him more on what he said. There is an irony here. \nIt is as if folks in places such as Russia are still doing what we \nsometimes criticize people in our country for doing--going by a cold-\nwar mentality. But it is a cold-war mentality heavily not only affected \nby communism, but what the Senator has said, capitalism. So they are \nselling for short-term gains that, before very long, will endanger them \nmore than us. This is our attempt to say: We are in this together. We \nare threatened by what you are doing, but watch out, friends, you are \ngoing to be threatened soon yourselves.\n\n  I thank the Senator for his characteristically straight talk--\nalthough he is not on the Straight Talk Express. He is a straight \ntalker in the Senate Chamber. I thank him for his support.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I wish the driver of that express a lot of luck.\n  Maybe what Mr. Putin, who is the Acting President and likely soon to \nbe elected President, it appears--maybe we should send my mom over to \nsee him. My mom had an expression, from the time we were kids, when you \nwould do something against your own interest out of anger, or out of \npique, or misunderstanding. My mother would say, ``Don't bite your nose \noff to spite your face.'' Well, we have a whole lot of Russians seeming \nto bite their noses off to spite their faces. I find it absolutely \nastounding what they appear to continue to do.\n  The bill before us is called the Iran Nonproliferation Act. That is \nthe context in which we should talk about this, and I think we should \nunderstand this. The purpose of this bill is not to punish, but rather \nto restrain. The goal that we pursue is not to invoke sanctions, but \nrather to make this a safer world for all of us, including the \nRussians. The means to that end is to make this a world with fewer \nweapons of mass destruction and with fewer delivery systems able to \ndeliver weapons of mass destruction, notably long-range ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Long-range ballistic missiles are a curious invention. They are \nawesome, frankly, but they don't amount to much as a military weapon \nunless they are armed with a powerful warhead. Now, the sort of long-\nrange missile that Third World countries might build --and that the \ncountries I have mentioned are attempting to build, or have built--\nthose missiles cannot carry big enough warheads to do much damage with \na conventional high explosive, a plain old bomb; they are too heavy. \nThe missile is not big enough, powerful enough, does not have enough \nthrow weight to carry conventional weapons. So the irony is that a \ncountry which develops or buys long-range ballistic missiles is all too \nlikely, therefore, to seek weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear \nwarheads that are lighter and have much more--no pun intended --bang \nfor the buck than a conventional weapon, or even potentially a lighter \npayload, with chemical weapons or biological weapons on top of these \nmissiles. The irony is that as they develop a long-range ballistic \nmissile capacity, they are led inextricably--if they are going to be of \nany ``value'' militarily--they move toward weapons of mass destruction \nwith which to arm the missiles.\n  North Korea has been trying to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq has built \nchemical and biological weapons and is seeking a nuclear capability. \nThey were close to building a nuclear weapon a decade ago. Similarly, \nIran has a\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\ncovert nuclear weapons program. Even the Government of Russia admits \nthat. Iran has also developed and used chemical weapons. Now, again, \nthat is chemical weapons that, based on the missile technology they may \nhave acquired, even if they have a range of 2,000 miles, as my friend \nfrom Connecticut indicated, doesn't get them to Washington, DC. It \ndoesn't get them to any U.S. territory. But it does get them to a lot \nof areas of the world where our friends--in this case, the Russians--\ncan be affected.\n\n  We have to stop this as best we can. The world must move toward fewer \nweapons of mass destruction, not more of them. We have to reduce the \nnumber of long-range ballistic missiles in the world, not increase \nthem. Unfortunately, some foreign persons--and I say ``persons'' \nbecause that is the legal word in this legislation for officials or \nentities; by ``entities'' we mean the Russian agency comparable to our \nspace agency, NASA, or the agency in Russia comparable to our Defense \nDepartment, or institutes, or companies. In Russia, institutes or \ncompanies cannot be separated very clearly from the Government.\n  Unfortunately, some of these foreign ``persons''--in Russia, China, \nand North Korea--are deaf to the world's call for nonproliferation and \napparently tone deaf to their own interests. The countries or entities \nare so desperate for cash or so angry at the West that they will risk \nArmageddon by helping Iran build long-range ballistic missiles or even \nnuclear weapons.\n  As ironic as this sounds, this legislation is designed in part to \nsave them from their own destructive impulses. The United States has \nimposed sanctions at times on entities from all three of these supplier \ncountries. Again, by the ``supplier'' countries I mean North Korea, \nChina, and Russia. The United States has imposed sanctions on entities \nfrom these countries and is continuing negotiations with all of these \ncountries to secure an end to their assistance to Iran. While we may \nhope for success in the months or years to come, however, there has \nbeen little success so far.\n  Today the Senate will vote to make the President list the offending \n``persons;'' to increase his powers to impose sanctions against them; \nand to limit United States support for Russian work on the \ninternational space station if any entities under the Russian Aviation \nand Space Agency continue to assist Iran, which we have reason to \nbelieve they have.\n  It is important to understand that H.R. 1883, which we will shortly \npass, is not an anti-Russian bill. Rather, it is simply and \noverwhelmingly a nonproliferation bill. Both I and the Senate sponsors \nof this bill would like nothing better than to have this bill result in \nno sanctions whatever against Russia.\n  While we try to crack down on entities that assist Iran's long-range \nballistic missile programs, we also support nonproliferation of \nassistance to Russia. We continue to help Russia reduce its unneeded \nstrategic weapons through the Nunn-Lugar program, protect its sensitive \nnuclear materials, help it find new careers for excess weapon \nscientists, and improve its export control laws. Those are the laws \nthat are on the books, and should be enforced, which would prevent any \nagency or company within Russia from transferring usable information to \naid and abet Iran in their long-range missile programs.\n  We are helping Russia in other ways, as well, so this should not be \ntaken in isolation. This is part of a continuum of efforts on our part \nto deal with the interests of our country as well as Russia. The United \nStates Government, with the support of many in this body, also \ncontinues to work with Russia on many other vital issues. We seek \ncontinued strategic arms reductions, through the so-called START \nprocess. We support the sharing of missile warning data. We are working \nto preserve the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the ABM Treaty, with an \namendment that allows for--again, in Russia's interests--a limited \nballistic missile defense. Again, we pointed out that North Korea and \nIran present a greater danger to them than they do to the United \nStates.\n  The United States and other Western countries also offer the \ninvestment on which Russia's economic development depends. United \nStates companies even buy ballistic missile engines from Russia's top \ndesign bureaus. Our American companies are purchasing directly from \nRussian design entities. We are buying engines that they are producing, \nfrom which they are making substantial money. Iran cannot begin to \nmatch the power of the United States to sustain and transform Russian \nindustry. In other words, they will make a heck of a lot more money \ndoing the right thing, dealing with the United States and with the \nWestern Europeans and Japan, than they will ever make from selling \ntechnology to Iran. I urge Russian leaders to think about that.\n\n  I wonder, with all the chaos that is in place in Russia, whether \nanybody at the top has ever really focused on this. In pure \nunadulterated dollars and cents, what is in Russia's economic interest \nis to sell to the West rather than to sell to Iran. If the choice is \nstarkly made, which we are about to do, I hope they will focus more \nlogically on their alternatives.\n  This bill and the Senate are not anti-Russian, but we are manifestly \nanti-proliferation. We will not tolerate vicious and venal persons \nplunging the world into a new cold war, let alone a hot one in which \nweapons of mass destruction would be a freely traded currency of death. \nIf Russia or China or North Korea should choose the path of \nproliferation--and they have to some degree already done that--we will \nshow that there are better paths to power and prestige than \nproliferating ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction to \nThird World countries with unstable regimes. There is still time to \nstamp out proliferation and to put the world on a more peaceful path, \nbut we must not and we will not collaborate in sowing the seeds of \nglobal destruction through proliferation.\n  It is unfortunate that the Senate action occurs only weeks before \nnext month's Presidential elections in Russia. The need to pass this \nlegislation is not our fault, that is Russia's fault. Some in that \ncountry between now and those elections may try to use our action to \nstir up a nationalistic reaction for their own political purposes in \nthe upcoming Russian election. That would be both unwise and ill \nfounded. It is also unfortunate that the House authors of this bill \ninsisted upon triggering Presidential reporting and possible sanctions \nbased upon a very low standard of evidence. In practice, however, no \nPresident will impose sanctions unless he is convinced that wrongdoing \nhas occurred, notwithstanding the fact that the House standard of \nevidence is too low a threshold.\n  Finally, I regret that this bill does not permit the President to \nauthorize extraordinary payments for work on the international space \nstation, if those payments should be needed, to protect sensitive \nintelligence information. Neither does it permit payments to a \nsanctioned entity if such payments are needed to prevent significant \ndangers to the crew of the space station. I do not think either of \nthose are wise restrictions, and I hope these concerns can be addressed \nin conference between the House and Senate.\n  The important fact is, however, that the Senate action today is a \nmeasure not of anti-Russian sentiment, nor of any impulse to bully. \nRather, it reflects the depth of our concern and also our frustration \nover the increasing risk that Russian and other entities will \nrecklessly open Pandora's box, against their own interest as well as \nours.\n  I earnestly hope that in the coming weeks, our President and the \nnewly elected President of Russia can put us back on the track of \npeaceful cooperation to make this a safer and more prosperous world. \nThat is a real prospect for both countries, if Russia would only accept \nthat its profit and its destiny lies in the West, not in the East.\n  Perhaps passage of this bill will help to bring about such a \nreevaluation. If so, then prospects for the new century on which we \nhave just embarked would truly be improved. If not, it puts us on a \nperilous slope to more proliferation and colder, not warmer, relations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1883, the \nIran Nonproliferation Act of 1999.\n  As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am in a \nprivileged position to have access to the volumes of intelligence \ninformation gathered at great expense and\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\neven risk of life by our intelligence community.\n  Sadly, this intelligence leads me to the conclusion that our efforts \nthus far to stem proliferation have failed. As the Director of Central \nIntelligence told me in an open Hearing before the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee just this month:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, on proliferation, the picture that I drew \n     last year has become even more stark and worrisome. Transfers \n     of enabling technologies to countries of proliferation \n     concern have not abated.\n\n  Particularly in the case of Iran, the intelligence indicates that the \nproliferation of missile technologies as well as the technologies and \nexpertise to enable their development of chemical, biological, and \nnuclear weapons, continues unabated.\n  Our nonproliferation efforts haven't failed because we haven't tried \nother things. They have failed because the tools we have used thus far \nhave not been up to the task.\n  The task is indeed formidable.\n  Iran desperately wants these weapons. We wish they didn't. We wish \nthe problem would go away on its own. But the evidence indicates that \nit won't. In the unclassified version of a report submitted to me on \nJanuary 21st pursuant to a mandate in the Intelligence Authorization \nAct of 1997--a report available to all Members--the Director of Central \nIntelligence stated:\n\n       Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to \n     acquire WMD [weapons of mass destruction] . . . from abroad. \n     In doing so, Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous \n     capability to produce various types of weapons--nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological--and their delivery systems.\n\n  With regard to missile proliferation, in his testimony to me this \nmonth, the DCI reported that:\n\n       Most analysts believe that Iran, following the North Korean \n     pattern, could test an ICBM capable of delivering a light \n     payload to the United States in the next few years.\n\n  And, he added, Iran could become not just a recipient, but a \nproliferator:\n\n       While Russia, China, and North Korea continue to be the \n     main suppliers of ballistic missiles and related technology, \n     long-standing recipients--such as Iran--might become \n     suppliers in their own right as they develop domestic \n     production capabilities.\n\n  Iran is not just seeking missiles, but also biological, chemical, and \nnuclear weapons. Iran is seeking dual-use technologies to further the \nbiological warfare program it began during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also \nwants to maintain a prohibited chemical weapons capability. According \nto the January DCI report I just mentioned, Iran, despite its \ncommitment to give up chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, ``has manufactured and stockpiled chemical weapons, \nincluding blister, blood, and choking agents and the bombs and \nartillery shells for delivering them.'' They have continued to ``seek \nproduction technology, expertise, and chemicals that could be used as \nprecursor agents in its chemical warfare program from entities in \nRussia and China.'' Finally, Iran wants a nuclear weapons capability. \nAccording to the DCI: ``Iran sought nuclear-related equipment, material \nand technical expertise from a variety of sources, especially in \nRussia, during the first half of 1999.''\n  Importantly, Iran is seeking an indigenous capability. Their pursuit \nof WMD and delivery systems has lead to a maturing indigenous \ncapability. This means that the window in which we can stop significant \nproliferation to Iran is closing rapidly. This means that the time to \nintervene is now.\n  Some have suggested that the recent elections in Iran should lead us \nto pause our consideration of this bill. I disagree. First, to the \ndegree that the newly elected Iranian legislators seek to constrain \nefforts to develop and deploy weapons of mass destruction, I believe \nthat this legislation will strengthen such an effort. It demonstrates \nthe seriousness with which the United States Congress views \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Second, existing evidence \nindicates that we cannot count on the elections to bring an end to \nIran's national policy of developing weapons of mass destruction and \ntheir means of delivery. It is important to underscore that former \nPresident Rafsanjani, considered a moderate in Iranian political \ncircles, was the very leader who initiated Iran's pursuit of those \nweapons. Indeed it was Rafsanjani who said that ``Chemical and \nbiological weapons are poor man's atomic bombs . . .'' After he became \nIran's President, he is quoted as saying: ``We should fully equip \nourselves in the defensive and offensive use of chemical, \nbacteriological and radiological weapons.'' We cannot expect that Iran \nwill therefore give up its pursuit of these weapons on their own. This \nbill will provide additional incentive for them to do so, and we will \nwatch carefully for evidence of such a decision, but at this point, \nabsent strong policy on our part, we must conclude that the policy of \nacquiring these weapons and their means of delivery will continue.\n  The task of stemming proliferation to Iran is made more difficult \nbecause individuals and the nations from which they proliferate have \ntheir own strong motives for aiding Iran. For some individuals, the \nmotive is money. But why can't we simply rely on the governments in \nwhich they operate to stop them? In some cases, governments are too \nweek to intervene. In others, the government looks the other way or \neven promotes proliferation to Iran because their leaders welcome the \nchallenge an Iran with missiles and weapons of mass destruction poses \nto the United States.\n  We need the tools to offset the benefits of aiding Iran. We must \nensure that there are financial and other costs associated with \nsupplying the assistance Iran still needs in its drive for weapons of \nmass destruction and missiles.\n  H.R. 1883 gives the United States tools to attack proliferation on \nthe supply side.\n  The first tool is the light of exposure to scrutiny. H.R. 1883 \nrequires the President to submit annual reports identifying every \nperson that, on or after January 1, 1999, transfers to Iran goods, \nservices or technology on existing control lists or items with the \npotential to make a material contribution to Iran's development of \nnuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or ballistic or cruise missile \nsystems. As a result, the Congress, the American people, and the \ncommunity of nations will know who is supporting Iran's efforts to \nthreaten peace and stability. We will shine a light on those lining \ntheir bank accounts by selling the tools of hideous death and \nunimaginable destruction to Iran. The threat of public exposure should \nserve as a significant deterrent to those who contemplate proliferation \nto Iran.\n  The second tool offered by H.R. 1883 is the authorization for the \nPresident to deny perpetrators of proliferation access to some U.S. \ntrade. I highlight the word ``authorization.'' The sanctions provided \nby H.R. 1883 are not mandatory and exceptions are granted.\n  These tools, properly employed, will help stem the tide of \nproliferation to Iran. Are there costs? Yes. Some U.S. businesses may \nbe called upon by the President to refrain from commerce with \nindividuals that are shown to be materially aiding Iran's weapons of \nmass destruction and missile programs. But such a potential cost seems \nreasonable to me in light of the potentially far greater cost if we \nfail to act--the lives of American men, women, and children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1883 in a \nbipartisan way, as our House colleagues did when they voted to pass \nH.R. 1883 by a vote of 419-zero.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there are few in this body who have \nworked harder on this issue than my friend from Connecticut, and it has \nbeen a real pleasure to work with him on this legislation and on this \nissue.\n  The Iran Nonproliferation Act is an important piece of legislation \nwhich seeks to halt the flow of ballistic missile technology and other \nweapons of mass destruction from Russia to Iran. I strongly support \nSenate passage of this legislation.\n  Indeed, even as much of the U.S. focus in the past year--and rightly \nso, in my mind--has been on the peace process and Israel's relations \nwith Syria and the Palestinians, there may be no greater long term \nthreat to Israel's security and Middle East peace than an Iran actively \nseeking ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.\n  That is why I believe that preventing the transfer of illegal nuclear \nand missile technology from Russia to Iran must be at the top of the \nU.S. policy agenda.\n  As my colleagues are aware, there have been numerous reports over the\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\npast several years of Russian missile technology reaching Iran, \nsometimes with a semi-official wink from government authorities in \nMoscow, sometimes by rogue operators.\n  Either way, the Russian government must put a stop to these \ntransfers.\n  As much as we want good relations with Russia, cooperation in this \narea is crucial. In some ways, I believe it is a litmus test of what \nsort of player Russia wants to be in the post-Cold War international \nsystem.\n  Although Russia has denied that any illegal transfers have taken \nplace, it has taken some tangible steps in response to American \nconcerns--such as the cancellation of a 1997 contract between a Russian \nmissile factory (NPO Trud) and Iran in which rocket engine components \nwere to have been shipped under the guise of gas pipeline compressors.\n  Unfortunately, despite such progress as cooperation with the NPO Trud \ncontract, since issuing an Executive Order in 1998, the United States \nhas been forced to sanction ten Russian entities for continuing to \ntransfer technology for the development of advanced ballistic missiles \nand weapons of mass destruction, and the Central Intelligence Agency \nreports that Russian entities continue to provide Iran with assistance. \nIndeed, there are reportedly over 10,000 Russians in Iran helping Iran \nwith these programs.\n  For its part, and despite some positive signs of moderation in Iran's \npolitics--the recent elections notwithstanding--Iran has not yet \nmoderated any of its policies with regard to the support of \ninternational terrorism or the pursuit of advanced ballistic missiles \nand weapons of mass destruction.\n  Iran has flight-tested the Shihab-3, a missile that can hit Israel \nand U.S. forces in the Middle East, and is continuing to work on other \nadvanced missile designs, including those capable of delivering nuclear \nwarheads.\n  Because of Russia's mixed record--and Iran's outright dangerous \nrecord--I believe that although we should try to build on Russia's \nrecord of cooperation, we must also be prepared to take tough action \nwhen the situation warrants. In other words, we must be prepared to \nwork with Russia on this issue and offer them a carrot, but, if our \ninterests and those of our friends and allies are threatened, we must \nalso be prepared to use a stick.\n  To that end, last year I offered an amendment on the Department of \nDefense authorization bill, passed by the Senate, which stated that it \nis the sense of Congress that the U.S. should increase the quota on \ncommercial space launch services provided by Russia if the Russian \ngovernment demonstrates a sustained commitment to prevent the transfer \nfrom Russia to Iran, or other countries, of nuclear and missile \ntechnology.\n  I continue to believe that pending Russian cooperation this quota can \nbe raised to 20 and, if Russia continues to cooperate, incrementally \nraised again in the coming years. Each launch provides Russia with \napproximately $100 million in hard currency. A $100 million carrot is a \ngood incentive to cooperate.\n  The bill we consider before us today recognizes that in addition to \nsuch carrots, we must also be prepared to take tough action when \nnecessary. The Iran Nonproliferation Act has two parts.\n  First, it requires the President to report credible information about \nany foreign entity providing dangerous technologies to Iran and \nauthorize the President to sanction these entities in accordance with \nthe President's own Executive Order.\n  Second, it requires that the President must certify that the Russian \ngovernment opposes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to \nIran and is taking steps to oppose such proliferation before the \nRussian Space Agency is provided with any additional U.S. taxpayer \nmoney beyond what has contracted for the International Space Station. \nThese are funds which the U.S. is providing to Russia so that Russia \ncan meet its own obligations to the International Space Station. If \nRussia and the Russian Space Agency cooperates with the U.S. on \nproliferation, then cooperation between Russia and Iran on the \nproliferation of advanced ballistic missiles and weapons of mass \ndestruction must stop. If Russia and the Russian Space Agency \ncooperates with the U.S. on proliferation, then I believe we can work \nin partnership with them to increase commercial space launch and to \nprovide funding for the International Space Station.\n  But there are few things more dangerous or destabilizing to U.S. \ninterests and peace and security in the Middle East than a nuclear \narmed Iran which continues to support international terrorism. And if \nRussia does not recognize this and is not willing to work with the \nUnited States to build a more stable and more secure Middle East, then \nwe must not shy away from taking the tough action necessary to get \nresults.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for the past three years the Clinton \nadministration has fought tooth-and-nail against the legislation now \nbefore the Senate. The White House repeatedly claimed, in its attempted \ndefense, that the Lott-Lieberman initiative would undermine U.S. \nnonproliferation efforts, repeatedly asserting that they had Russia's \nbehavior in check, and that progress was being made.\n  Well, Mr. President, we now confront an Iran that has been armed to \nthe gills with technology for ballistic missiles and nuclear, chemical \nand biological weapons. According to the National Intelligence Officer \nfor Strategic and Nuclear Programs, (who testified before the Foreign \nRelations Committee this past September), Iran is in a position to \ntest, within the latter half of this decade, an ICBM that ``could \ndeliver a several-hundred kilogram payload to many parts of the United \nStates . . . using Russian technology and assistance.''\n  Moreover, according to the Director of Central Intelligence, Iran \n``probably has achieved `emergency operational capability' '' with its \nmedium range Shahab-3 missile. In other words, under President \nClinton's watch, Iran has acquired from Russia and China the ability to \nstrike Israel and Turkey with ballistic missiles carrying chemical or \nbiological warheads. And the mullahs are working overtime to develop \nthe Shahab-4 and Shahab-5 in order to menace U.S. citizens at home.\n  In conclude now, in the absence of fierce opposition to this bill \nfrom the White House this time around, that reality has finally sunk in \nat the National Security Council. The Clinton administration's \nnonproliferation policy has been an abject failure. Bill Clinton and Al \nGore will leave office having subordinated nonproliferation concerns to \nbusiness interests, the wishes to foreign campaign donors, and their \n``touchy-feely'' personal politicking in Russia, China and elsewhere.\n  The result has been an all-out fire-sale of deadly technologies by \nRussia, China, and others. Delegations from Iran, Syria, Iraq, North \nKorea, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, India, and Pakistan are virtually tripping \nover one another on their way in and out of various Russian and Chinese \nfirms.\n  The Clinton-Gore Administration will leave office:\n  1. having allowed Russia and China to sell dangerous commodities \naround the globe with no fear of sanctions or consequences;\n  2. having presided over the development of a North Korean ICBM \ncapable of dropping biological weapons on U.S. soil (according to the \nintelligence community, a Taepo Dong-2 ICBM could be tested any day \nnow);\n  3. having presided over the arming of Iran, Syria, and others with \nnuclear, chemical, and biological missiles;\n  4. having squandered its inheritance regarding Iraq by interfering \nwith, and ultimately abandoning, UNSCOM;\n  5. having prompted India and Pakistan into an all-out nuclear arms \nrace by trying to ``strong-arm'' the two countries into the Test Ban \nTreaty (which merely prompted the nations to test);\n  6. having lost all hope of getting the START II Treaty ratified, \nwhich would have banned MIRVed ICBMs in Russia;\n  7. having imperiled the IAEA by tying the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty to the poorly-conceived, poorly-drafted CTBT, which the Senate \nrightly rejected;\n  8. having destroyed the Missile Technology Control Regime by allowing \nRussia (a missile proliferator) to come in as a member; and\n  9. having wasted half a decade of precious time in deploying a \nnational missile defense to protect the United States from the \nconsequences of their failed nonproliferation policy.\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\n  We must all remember that the Clinton-Gore administration voted the \nDoD authorization bill in 1995 because it required deployment of a \nnational missile defense by 2001, with additional protection by 2003. \nBecause of the President's reckless disregard for the nation's \nsecurity, the U.S. will not ``break ground'' on a missile defense site \nin Alaska until this summer, at the earliest.\n  At the same time, this administration taught Russia and China how to \nevade U.S. sanctions laws while simultaneously putting the U.S. \nsanctions determination process into a deep freeze. Not a single MTCR \nsanction has been imposed for Russia's arming of Iran or China's \nassistance to Pakistan. The enormity of this blatant disregard for the \nlaw is stunning, Mr. President.\n  What is worse, by promoting U.S. commercial interests at the expense \nof national security, the Clinton-Gore administration has become part \nof the problem.\n  China's nuclear proliferation has been swept under the rug by Mr. \nClinton in order to clear the way for the nuclear lobby to sell \nreactors to the PRC. We must recall that, in 1998, President Clinton \nmade a legally binding certification which no other President could, in \ngood faith, bring himself to make. But the Clinton-Gore administration \nwas happy to oblige industry and the Communist Chinese.\n  In 1996 the Clinton administration pulled controls on commercial \nsatellites because millionaire campaign donors wanted it. Unsupervised, \nunscrupulous U.S. companies engaged in the transfer of very sensitive \nballistic missile information to the PRC, including information \nrelating to the MIRVing of ICBMs. The Congress tried to shore up this \nfiasco by recontrolling satellites, but the Commerce Department is at \nit again, having recently declared--despite the law--that it wants \nreduced controls on extremely sensitive items such as radiation \nhardened chips and kick motors.\n  From 1993 until 1999, willful disregard for security at the White \nHouse and the Department of Energy permitted continued acquisition of \nthe nation's most sensitive nuclear warhead designs by China. This was \nexacerbated by the foolhardy declassification of thousands of documents \nby Hazel O'Leary, which undoubtedly has contributed to nuclear weapons \ncapabilities around the globe. Even now, the Clinton-Gore \nadministration is contemplating sharing nuclear weapons secrets with \nRussia in an effort to bribe them into submission on the ABM Treaty.\n  Lately, the Department of Defense--once the bulwark against the \nfoolhardy weakening of export controls--has been working ``hand-in-\nglove'' with the defense industry and the Gore campaign. The Pentagon \nis now looking for ways to undermine the Arms Export Control Act. \nAgain, this is happening because industry lobbying groups want these \nchanges. There is an effort underway to avoid congressional \nnotification of arms sales and to create license-free zones. The \nresult, if unchecked, will be unfettered and unregulated trade in \nweaponry, which cannot be seen as a positive development under any \ncircumstance.\n  Finally, the administration has decided to support passively an \nExport Administration Act which would effectively undermine all \nexisting U.S. export controls and which would undercut what is left of \nthe nonproliferation policy which this administration inherited eight \nyears ago. Enormous sums of money are being spent all over Washington \nby various industry groups because they know how loose export controls \nwill be under this bill.\n  Ronald Reagan's nonproliferation policy is in shambles, Mr. \nPresident. At best, this administration has been inept in managing such \nimportant issues. At worst, the administration has co-opted and \ncorrupted nonproliferation policy on the basis of fund-raising schemes \nbeing run out of the Oval Office. The damage to U.S. nonproliferation \npolicy is so severe and far-reaching, and the global results to date \nhave been so catastrophic, that the next administration is going to \nspend the first four years just picking up the pieces.\n  Mr. President, history will do worse than recording this \nadministration as having fiddled while Rome burned. It will record \nthese people as having set many of the fires themselves.\n  I support the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Its reporting requirements \nwill shed light on the fact that numerous Russian entities have sold \ntheir souls to the Mullahs in Tehran by offering that bunch of \nterrorists everything they want for their ballistic and cruise missile \nprograms, including nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare \ntechnology. It will also prove that this administration has \naccomplished nothing in the past several years of ``talking.''\n  That said, however much it might help, this bill will not solve the \nproblem. It is much too late to prevent Iran from capitalizing upon the \ncapabilities it has acquired.\n  While it is not too late to defend ourselves, or to assist Israel, \nTurkey, and others in defending themselves, it will fall to the next \nadministration to reconstruct a comprehensive nonproliferation policy \nand reverse the fearful effects of the past eight years.\n  Thank you, Mr. President; I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and ballistic missile delivery systems continues to be one \nof the most significant threats to America's national security. States \nlike North Korea and Iran are actively pursuing ambitious programs and \nthe technology needed to threaten the United States. Unclassified \nreports from our intelligence agencies indicate that these efforts have \nintensified.\n  Iranian ballistic missile progress is largely the result of \nsubstantial assistance from North Korea, China, and especially, Russia. \nThere is no doubt that foreign technology and assistance are essential \nto Iran's ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs. \nThe U.S. intelligence community's most recent unclassified Semiannual \nReport to Congress on Proliferation states, ``Iran remains one of the \nmost active countries seeking to acquire WMD [weapons of mass \ndestruction] and ACW [advanced conventional weapons] technology from \nabroad.''\n  The type of foreign assistance that is the subject of this \nlegislation serves to increase the sophistication and rate of \ndevelopment of Iran's ballistic missiles. We must do more than we are \ndoing now to impede its progress and, at the same time, prepare \ndefenses against the use of such weapons.\n  The rapid development of the Shahab-3 demonstrates how foreign \nassistance accelerated Iran's ballistic missile programs. The Shahab-3 \nis based on the North Korean Nodong ballistic missile. But instead of \nsimply purchasing the missile as Pakistan did, Iran chose to modify the \ndesign of the missile with Russian and Chinese assistance and produce \nthe missile on its own. In February 1997, George Tenet, then Acting \nDirector of the CIA, testified that with North Korean assistance, Iran \ncould develop the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, ``in less \nthan ten years.'' Less than a year later, in January 1998, Director \nTenet testified, ``Iran's success in gaining technology and material \nfrom Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian \nadvances, means that [Iran] could have a medium-range ballistic missile \nmuch sooner than I assessed last year.'' Six months later, in July \n1998, Iran flight-tested the Shahab-3. An unclassified Intelligence \nCommunity report released in January of this year assessed that Iran \nhas achieved an ``emergency operational capability'' with the Shahab-3.\n  Proliferation to Iran continues. According to the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity's most recent unclassified Semiannual Report \non Proliferation, summarizing proliferation that occurred in the first \nhalf of 1999,\n\n       Russian entities during the first six months of 1999 have \n     provided substantial missile-related technology, training, \n     and expertise to Iran that almost certainly will continue to \n     accelerate Iranian efforts to build new indigenous ballistic \n     missiles.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       During the reporting period, firms in China provided \n     missile-related items, raw materials, and/or assistance to \n     several countries of proliferation concern--such as Iran.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Throughout the first half of 1999, North Korea continued to \n     export ballistic missiles-related equipment and missile \n     components, materials and technical expertise to countries in \n     the Middle East . . .\n\n  This report to Congress also states, ``. . . economic conditions in \nRussia continued to deteriorate, putting more pressure on Russian \nentities to circumvent export controls. Despite some\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\nexamples of restraint, Russian businesses continue to be major \nsuppliers of WMD equipment, materials, and technology to Iran.''\n  Because Russian government officials continue to show an \nunwillingness or inability to stop this dangerous assistance to Iran, \nthe legislation we are considering should be passed to authorize and \ndirect more effective sanctions.\n  North Korea's continuing relationship with Iran is also of great \nconcern. Iran has already received sufficient technology from North \nKorea to build a copycat three-stage Taepo Dong-1 ballistic missile on \nits own. Moreover, senior Intelligence Community officials have \ntestified that they expect North Korea to continue to sell ballistic \nmissiles to Iran. Therefore, we must expect Iran to acquire the \ntechnology for the longer-range Taepo Dong-2 ballistic missile when \nNorth Korea begins its export. It is too optimistic, given the North \nKorea-Iran ballistic missile relationship, to expect Iran's \ncapabilities to lag North Korea's for very long.\n  There are several significant consequences of the continued \nproliferation of ballistic missile technology to Iran. I'll mention \ntwo.\n  First, this assistance will allow Iran to develop more advanced \nballistic missiles faster, cheaper, and easier than it otherwise would \nhave on its own. Iran's defense minister has announced that it is \nworking on the more advanced Shahab-4 and Shahab-5 missiles, and the \nIranians even claim that they are going to launch a satellite into \norbit by the second half of 2001. According to press reports, Iran's \nShahab-4 and Shahab-5 ballistic missiles will use Russian engine \ntechnology, leading to an Iranian ICBM based in large part on Russian \ntechnology. Diminishing this proliferation is essential to slowing \nIran's long-range ballistic missile program.\n  Second, Iran is bound to become a supplier of ballistic missile \ntechnology and expertise as its own program proceeds. CIA Director \nTenet recently made this point, testifying that, ``Iran's existence as \na secondary supplier of this technology to other countries is the trend \nthat worries me the most.'' We are already seeing indications that Iran \nis no longer merely a recipient of ballistic missile technology. \nAccording to unclassified intelligence community reports, Iran is \nassisting Libya's ballistic missile programs. Press reports also \nindicate Iran is helping Syria and others develop or acquire ballistic \nmissiles.\n  The legislation before the Senate will improve our efforts to \nrestrain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic \nmissile technology to Iran. I urge its approval.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I had a number of concerns with this bill, \nas it was approved by the House. I am pleased that we have been able to \nreach agreement on an amendment that addresses many of these concerns. \nThe managers' amendment would make it clear that the application of \nsanctions under section 3 of the bill is discretionary, not mandatory. \nIt would also urge the executive branch to provide notice to persons \nwho may be subject to sanctions under this provision, giving them an \nopportunity to provide explanatory or exculpatory information before \nsuch sanctions are provided.\n  I had planned on offering several amendments to this bill when it \ncame to the floor, but because of the adoption of this amendment, I \nshall not do so. I would also like to clarify a few points with the \nchief Senate sponsors of the bill.\n  First, the bill requires reporting of foreign persons when there is \n``credible information'' indicating that the person transferred \nspecified goods, services, or technologies to Iran. I understand that \nit is the intent of the sponsors that the President judge the \ncredibility of information on the basis of all information available to \nhim, including both information that supports and information that \nundermines the conclusion that a covered transfer may have taken \nplaces. In other words, ``credible information'' is information that \nwould lead a reasonable person to conlcude--after consideration of all \nthe available evidence--that there is a substantial possibility that a \ncovered transfer took place. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree. That understanding is consistent with the intent \nof the House, which defined ``credible information'' as such in its \nreport.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The second point that I would like to address is the use \nof the word ``timely'' in the managers' amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that the intent is that, whenever appropriate, the \nPresident provide notice to foreign persons, or to the government with \nprimarily jurisdiction over such persons, in a manner that provides \nthem a reasonable opportunity to provide explanatory or exculpatory \ninformation before sanctions are imposed. Do the lead sponsors agree \nwith this view?\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, I would like to address section 6 of the bill, \nwhich requires a determination by the President that, among other \nthings, the Government of Russia has demonstrated a sustained \ncommitment to seek out and prevent the transfer to Iran of goods, \nservices and technology that ``could'' make a material contribution to \nthe development of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, or of \nballistic or cruise missile systems. It is my understanding that the \nuse of the word ``could'' in this provision is not intended to go \nbeyond other nonproliferation requirements or require the President to \nconsider remote or absurdly hypothetical circumstances. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. The use of the term ``could'' is meant to \nconvey an expectation that commodities should be controlled and \nmonitored because of their potential for contributing to nuclear, \nchemical, or biological warfare programs, or to ballistic or cruise \nmissile development. That is to say, this section covers commodities \nwhich should be controlled because of their physical or technological \nproperties. This standard is consistent with current United States \nexport control practice and with various statutory nonproliferation \nreporting requirements.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Iran \nNonproliferation Act. For the past few years, I have been concerned \nabout Iran's efforts to acquire the technology for ballistic missiles \nand nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons from Russia and China.\n  When reports began to surface in 1997 about Russian missile \nassistance to Iran, I met twice with Russia's Ambassador to the U.S. \nand the administration's special envoy on this issue to express my \nconcern about this dangerous trade and to urge the Russian government \nand the Clinton Administration to take steps to stop it.\n  I also gathered together a group of 99 Members of the House and \nSenate, who wrote to the President to urge him to invoke sanctions to \nhalt this trade. The President refused.\n  Along with a bipartisan group of House and Senate Members, I went to \nthe White House to meet with Vice President Gore to urge the \nadministration to take concrete actions to end Russian transfers to \nIran. Again the administration refused, citing the need to let \ndiplomacy work.\n  That summer, I successfully offered an amendment that was adopted by \nunanimous consent to the fiscal year 1998 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill barring U.S. aid to Russia if missile assistance to \nIran continued. In conference, the amendment was changed to give the \nPresident the ability to waive this prohibition on aid to Russia, which \nhe subsequently did.\n  In November 1997, the Senate unanimously passed a concurrent \nresolution that I sponsored, expressing the sense of the Congress that \nthe President should sanction the Russian organizations involved in \nselling missile technology to Iran. The House also passed this \nresolution overwhelmingly by a vote of 414 to 8. Again the President \nrefused to impose sanctions.\n  The Congress tried again to spur the administration to action 6 \nmonths later when we passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions \nAct mandating sanctions on any organization involved in assisting \nIran's missile or weapons of mass destruction programs. This bill \npassed the Senate by a vote of 90 to 4. Yet, when it reached the \nPresident's desk, he vetoed it.\n  Instead of voting to override this veto, the Congress acceded to the \nPresident's request for more time to\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\nlet diplomacy work. The verdict is in on that decision. Transfers of \nnuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic missile technology to Iran \npersist demonstrating the Congress erred in deciding not to override \nthe veto. While the administration has imposed so-called administrative \nsanctions against a handful of Russian entities, it cooperated with the \nRussian government to identify the target organizations such that the \nsanctions would have no meaningful effect, completely undermining the \nvalue of the action.\n  While I will not go into the same detail here, let me simply say the \nadministration has a similar record on Chinese proliferation to Iran, \nwhere it has failed to enforce U.S. laws calling for sanctions, again \nnoting the need to let diplomacy work.\n  Since the administration would not take steps to halt proliferation \nto Iran, I offered an amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill \nthat the President signed into law in May 1998. The amendment \nappropriated $179 million to accelerate the development of U.S. theater \nmissile defenses, including $45 million for Israel to begin purchasing \nequipment for a third battery of its Arrow missile defense system in \norder to counter the increased Iranian missile threat.\n  As these examples show, the Clinton Administration is simply not \nwilling to take the tough actions necessary to prevent proliferation. \nAs a result, intelligence assessments indicate the problem is growing \nworse all the time. In an unclassified report to Congress last month, \nCIA Director George Tenet stated;\n\n       Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional \n     weapons technology from abroad. . . . For the first half of \n     1999, entities in Russia and China continued to supply a \n     considerable amount and a wide variety of ballistic missile-\n     related goods and technology to Iran. . . . Iran already is \n     producing Scud short-range ballistic missiles and has built \n     and publicly displayed prototypes for the [1,300 kilometer-\n     range] Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, which had its \n     initial flight test in July 1998 and probably achieved \n     ``emergency operational capability''--i.e., Tehran could \n     deploy a limited number of the Shahab-3 prototype missiles in \n     an operational mode during a perceived crisis situation. In \n     addition, Iran's Defense Minister last year publicly \n     acknowledged the development of the [2,000 kilometer range] \n     Shahab-4 . . . [and] publicly mentioned plans for a ``Shahab-\n     5.''\n\n  In the report, Director Tenet went on to note that Iran continues to \nseek biological warfare technology from Russia and Europe and despite \nbeing a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention has ``already has \nmanufactured and stockpiled chemical weapons . . . and the bombs and \nartillery shells for delivering them.'' He also said that ``Tehran \ncontinues to seek production technology, expertise, and chemicals that \ncould be used as precursor agents in its chemical warfare program from \nentities in Russia and China.''\n  Finally, the report indicated that despite promising never to acquire \nnuclear weapons, when it ratified the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty \n(NPT), Iran has a nuclear weapons program, stating:\n\n       Iran is attempting to establish a complete nuclear fuel \n     cycle for its civilian energy program. In that guise, it \n     seeks to obtain whole facilities . . . that in fact could be \n     used in any number of ways in support of efforts to produce \n     fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon. Despite \n     international efforts to curtail the flow of critical \n     technologies and equipment, Tehran continues to seek fissile \n     material and technology for weapons development and has set \n     up an elaborate system of military and civilian organization \n     to support its effort.\n\n  In fact, according to the Washington Post, the CIA recently concluded \nthat it could no longer rule out the possibility that Iran is already \ncapable of producing a nuclear weapon. This is terribly troubling in \nlight of the progress Iran has made in its missile program. Earlier \nthis month, Director Tenet testified to the Intelligence Committee \nthat:\n\n       Most [intelligence] analysts believe that Iran, following \n     the North Korean pattern, could test an ICBM capable of \n     delivering a light payload to the United States in the next \n     few years. . . . As alarming as the long-range missile threat \n     is, it should not overshadow the immediacy and seriousness of \n     the threat that U.S. forces, interests, and allies already \n     face overseas from short and medium range missiles. The \n     proliferation of medium-range ballistic missiles [to nations \n     like Iran] is significantly altering strategic balances in \n     the Middle East and Asia.\n\n  Finally, Director Tenet outlined a new type of proliferation threat \nfrom Iran in his testimony, warning that:\n\n       . . . long-standing recipients--such as Iran--might become \n     suppliers in their own right as they develop domestic \n     production capabilities. . . . Iran in the next few years may \n     be able to supply not only complete Scuds, but also Shahab-3s \n     and related technology, and perhaps more advanced \n     technologies if Tehran continues to receive assistance from \n     Russia, China, and North Korea.\n\n  It is clear that meaningful measures, and not simply another round of \nfeckless diplomacy or a flawed international treaty such as the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT, is needed to combat this growing \nthreat. Last Fall, the Administration accused the Congress of \nundermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts in rejecting the CTBT. But \nthat treaty was unverifiable, would have undermined America's nuclear \ndeterrent, and would have done nothing meaningful to combat \nproliferation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Iran along with 191 other nations has \nratified the NPT, and thereby promised never to acquire nuclear \nweapons. It is violating this treaty. It is also violating the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and is acquiring missile technology. All of these \nactions should trigger U.S. sanctions, but the Clinton Administration \nhas refused to take action.\n  If arms control treaties like the NPT and other nonproliferation \nefforts are to be useful, they must be enforced. I urge the \nadministration to finally get serious about this matter and for my \ncolleagues to vote for the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Iran's possession \nof nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and the missiles used to \ndeliver them poses a clear and present danger to the United States and \nour forces and friends in the region. It is long past time that we \naddress this threat.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to read portions of a proposed \nregulation found on page 173 of the January 3, 2000, issue of the \nFederal Register:\n\n       ``[I]t is important that individuals alter their daily \n     behaviors,'' ``and for governmental entities to seek \n     programmatic incentives, public education, regulatory \n     changes, or other approaches.''\n       ``Daily behaviors'' are further defined as ``Individual \n     decisions about energy consumption for heating, travel, and \n     other purposes;'' and ``individual maintenance of residences \n     or gardens.''\n\n  Those passages come directly from a ``4(d)'' Endangered Species Act \nregulation for the Pacific Northwest proposed by the National Marine \nFisheries Service. The rule states flatly these are examples of \nactivities that could kill salmon or steelhead through water, air, and \nocean pollution, and that NMFS ``might or might not'' seek to regulate \nthem as such under the rule.\n  Taken literally, if these rules are enacted as written, National \nMarine Fisheries Service could regulate how often individuals drive \ntheir cars, where and how property owners could plant or fertilize \ntheir lawns, gardens, or farm crops. They could dictate the content of \ncounty zoning, public works, building, and road ordinances, and \npossibly even suggest limits on the setting of thermostats in homes or \npublic school classrooms, or the operation of public transit buses--all \nto protect salmon.\n  Washington citizens, and those in other Northwest States, would be \nasked to make a host of changes in their daily lives, but \nunfortunately, could be assured of nothing except for the certainty \nthat a greater portion of their tax dollars would fund the salaries of \neven more Federal bureaucrats to draft more rules and regulations of \nthis nature. This year, the National Marine Fisheries Service is asking\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\nCongress to fund 41 new employees just to implement its West Coast \nsalmon recovery plan.\n  Those proposals would represent a striking power grab by unelected \nbureaucrats if they were absolutely necessary to save whole species of \nsalmon. But they are not. As I said in a letter to President Clinton 2 \nweeks ago, the Federal Government should be seeking to encourage and \npromote incentives for States, tribes, and local entities and private \ngroups to come up with creative solutions to save salmon, not make it \nmore difficult for them.\n  And that is exactly what these rules do. The rules go far beyond \ntelling hundreds of farmers in the Methow Valley that they cannot \nexercise their water rights to irrigate their crops until they have \nNational Marine Fisheries Service-approved fish screens installed at \ntheir own expense, as the agency told my constituents in north central \nWashington last year.\n  They would go beyond holding up the construction of bridges in \nColumbia County or cities' efforts to install stop lights, as the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service's salmon regulatory process has \nalready done.\n  In short, these rules, if enacted as proposed, would be likely to \nslow down local salmon recovery efforts, rather than ``increasing \npeople's flexibility in complying with the Endangered Species Act,'' as \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service publicly claimed in mid-December. \nMore Federal bureaucracy simply will not help local communities and \nprivate groups protect salmon and steelhead.\n  I also notice that the National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed \na narrow set of exemptions within the rules, which could make the \nenforcement of the rule arbitrary and unfair against those who don't \nmeet their stated criteria. The Oregon Department of Transportation, \nfor example, would be in compliance with the rule in carrying out its \nroad maintenance activities on roads abutting streams, because that \nagency agreed to implement special National Marine Fisheries Service-\napproved training for its road maintenance crews. No such exemption \nexists in the rule for private land owners anywhere or the Washington \nDepartment of Transportation to carry on the same activities.\n  The people of Washington State realized the importance of not \nallowing endangered salmon and steelhead runs to go extinct long before \nany Federal agency told them they should modify their own ``daily \nbehavior'' as part of the effort. The only ``daily behavior'' that \nlocal salmon enhancement groups are concerned with in Washington right \nnow is to restore salmon and steelhead runs right in the streams and \nrivers near where they live and work. And they are doing it.\n  Look, for example, at the successful efforts of the variety of \nagricultural, business, and tribal groups who formed the Skagit \nWatershed Council to produce an on-the-ground science-based strategy \nfor prioritizing local habitat recovery projects. They came together, \noften disagreeing on other issues, but to work together on the most \nproductive salmon recovery efforts--without the Federal Government \ntelling them to do so.\n  Then there are the successful efforts of Long Live the Kings on the \nWishkah River on Grays Harbor County, where low-tech, inexpensive \nhabitat restoration methods helped double the returns of natural \nspawning salmon there in 1 year.\n  A captive brook stock facility was built with $1 million in private \nfunds on Lilliwaup Creek on Hood Canal, and already the State of \nWashington has looked to that success in restoring the very most \nthreatened local wild salmon runs. I can cite several more examples, \nbut suffice it to say that local efforts are underway, and we should \ncongratulate their efforts to proactively and successfully preserve \nsalmon.\n  Proposing regulations of this sort, at the very least, would be \nputting the ``cart before the horse.'' The National Marine Fisheries \nService must come forward with concrete goals of how many fish they \nintend to recover throughout the Northwest in areas they call \n``evolutionary significant units.'' This is something that Congress \nasked the National Marine Fisheries Service to do in an appropriations \nconference report last year. The National Marine Fisheries Service was \ndirected to determine and set numerical goals for Puget Sound areas by \nJuly 1 of this year, and, by then, to set a schedule for establishing \nnumerical goals for all other areas in Washington State.\n  Why is this important? Well, very simply put: How can you mandate \nmeans, mandate lifestyle changes, before you know what you are trying \nto accomplish? In my view, having these numerical goals is critical to \nguiding the agency in any effort it makes to enforce 4(d) rules to \nprotect threatened species.\n  Unfortunately, not only has the National Marine Fisheries Service \nfailed to provide the required numerical goals for salmon species, it \nhas yet to deliver the actual funding to the State. Last year, Congress \napproved $18 million to be provided directly by the National Marine \nFisheries Service to the Washington State Salmon Recovery Board, so \nthat the board could distribute funds for State and local salmon \nrecovery projects, as well as fund implementation of the Washington \nForest and Fish Agreement, which was authorized by the State \nlegislature. I am disturbed to learn that the National Marine Fisheries \nService has not yet secured arrangements to distribute these much-\nneeded funds to the State of Washington. As a result, the National \nMarine Fisheries Service is holding up State and local efforts to \ncomply with the Endangered Species Act.\n\n  Even without funding, several counties and salmon enhancement groups \nthroughout Washington have been working on their own plans to comply \nwith ESA requirements. Many smaller counties, however, simply do not \nhave the resources to meet the National Marine Fisheries Service \nprocess under the rules. They are nevertheless expected to scramble to \ncome up with their own ordinances that will be ultimately reviewed and \napproved by the National Marine Fisheries Service to ensure that they \nare ``adequate to help conserve anadromous salmonids.''\n  Aside from my concerns with the way these rules are written, I am not \nat all pleased that the National Marine Fisheries Service has decided \nto refuse even a modest extension of the public comment period, and has \nstated publicly that it wants to enact this rule by July.\n  Keep in mind, these lengthy, 20 plus page rules were only printed for \nthe first time in the Federal Register about 5 weeks ago. After \ntonight, the public hearings process will already have been slammed \nshut.\n  That is why when I learned that the regional director of the National \nMarine Fisheries Service had scheduled all five of Washington's public \nhearings on these lengthy and complex rules within just a 7-day period, \nI asked for more opportunities for citizens to be heard. Most of the \nfive hearings were so full of interested citizens that not everyone \ncould find a chair or be given adequate time to have a face to face \nquestion and answer period with the very bureaucrats who want to have \nthe authority proposed in these rules.\n  While the National Marine Fisheries Service recently agreed to two \nadditional hearings scheduled on the same day and time, they flatly \nrefused to extend the comment process, stating that ``a longer \nextension to the public comment period would not be likely to provide \nany new information, and would delay implementation of the rules, which \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service feels are necessary for salmon \nconservation.'' It is disturbing that while they are often criticized \nfor being too slow to process permit requests, when it comes to \nlistening to people on highly controversial proposals, they can't move \nfast enough to enact them into law.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service owes the citizens of Washington \nand the Pacific Northwest a more responsible handling of their duties \nto enforce the Endangered Species Act. Section 2(c)(2) of the \nEndangered Species Act requires the National Marine Fisheries Service \nto cooperate with State and local agencies to protect endangered \nspecies. I believe the National Marine Fisheries Service cannot fairly \nforce rules and local and State agencies without first establishing the \ngoals and objectives requested by Congress last year. I renew the \nrequest made by the appropriations conference for the National Marine \nFisheries Service to provide the numerical goals and objectives for \nPuget Sound salmon, to provide a\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\nframework for similar numerical goals and objectives for the rest of \nWashington and the Pacific Northwest, and to establish performance \nstandards for salmon recovery projects. And they should do so before \nthey enact these rules.\n  I conclude my comments by noting that any proposal which would \nregulate ``daily behavior'' certainly requires closer scrutiny than 30 \ndays of public hearings and 30 more days of written comments. I commend \nthose Washington citizens who are now working hard on local-based \nsolutions to protect salmon, and offer them my full and continued \nsupport for the successful course they are taking to rebuild and \nrestore salmon. I am concerned that the Federal Government, with rules \ndrafted in this manner, would not help these on-the-ground local \nefforts. I will continue to call on Federal agencies not to dictate how \nbest to accomplish ESA compliance. I request that the National Marine \nFisheries Service address the valid concerns I and others raise \nregarding these proposals and to do so before they begin implementing \nthese sweeping regulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a lot of truckers in town, \nprotesting what they say is an unwarranted increase in fuel costs that \nis putting them out of business.\n  It really doesn't surprise me. It seems every year we come to the \nfloor of the Senate to criticize the administration's failure to \nimplement a domestic energy policy that would support a sustainable oil \nand gas industry. We argue for tax relief, common sense royalty \ncollection, access to oil and gas reserves on Federal lands. We do this \nbecause there are a lot of us who watch figures, and every day we can \nsee that we are growing more dependent on foreign sources of oil and \ngas. Oil traditionally coming from the Middle East and gas coming from \nCanada in ever increasing volumes despite large, untapped reserves in \nAmerica. I have been joined by numerous Senators from around the Nation \nin bringing those concerns to the floor. We have proposed numerous \npieces of legislation to combat the problem, yet we have not been \nsuccessful in getting many of them enacted into law.\n  As a result, we are faced with what is happening today: Oil prices \nare now around $30 a barrel, with few domestic producers reaping any \nbenefits, and with most of our oil coming from offshore. There are few \ndomestic producers enjoying the rise in oil prices because the \nAdministration's energy and environmental policies have just about run \nthem all out of business. That is sad. I speak not only for the oil and \ngas industry, the trucking industry and the transportation industry, \nbut also for all consumers. A case in point is that we are already \nwitnessing a surcharge being put on airline tickets; the same thing \nwill happen soon with rail transportation as well.\n  When I take a look at my home State of Montana, fuel costs are at \nleast 50 percent higher than they were just a year ago. We have cause \nfor frustration. Montanans are at the end of the line. I don't care if \nyou are receiving goods or shipping product, it hurts us. This is \nespecially true for our number one industry, agriculture. We end up \nselling wholesale, buying retail, and paying the freight both ways. One \nhas to remember that these costs have to be absorbed by somebody. This \nsomebody is generally the person least able to afford it. Now we have \nto ask ourselves a question. Are we doing anything about fixing the \nroot of the problem? What are we doing to fix the root problem we have \nin energy development?\n  Today's rally of long-haul truckers underscores the reality that all \nconsumers and all producers are being faced with fuel increases \nresulting from a failed domestic energy policy. Prices are simply \nraising out of sight. We have 26,000 people in Montana who are employed \nby the trucking industry. They are being impacted by these increases. \nFarmers are coming upon the planting season. They are facing higher \nfuel costs which add to their uncontrollable costs of production. Costs \nof producing in the agricultural industry cannot be passed on; they \nnever have been in the past. It is a buyers' market and you sell for \nwhat they offer. End of story. Just because our fuels costs go up, does \nnot mean we get to charge more per bushel. We also aren't faced with \nthe luxury of turning a tractor off and waiting for fuel prices to go \ndown. Mother Nature dictates when you plant, when you till, and when \nyou harvest. She doesn't care if diesel is 50 cents a gallon, $1 a \ngallon, or $1.80 a gallon. When the time comes, you go.\n  We have seen some improvement in the livestock industry, but we have \nnot seen any kind of improvement in the grain industry. There again, \nwith grain, we get hit harder by energy costs than anywhere else.\n  So far, the administration's only action has been to send the \nSecretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, to ask OPEC to release more oil \nand reduce prices. That tells me we are not in a very strong bargaining \nposition. That is upsetting when we could have taken steps to avoid our \ncurrent plight. The problem of inaction by the administration carries \nover into other areas of energy. One example is the production of clean \ncoal. We have a lot of coal that is clean coal and considered \n``compliant coal'' by the Clean Air Act. It has low SO2 \nlevels, and low emissions. But so far, the Department of the Interior \nhas blocked any sale of that coal, which lies right at the top of the \nearth. The only thing that has to be done is to take the overburden \noff, mine the coal and reclaim the area. The result of this inaction \nhas been--and it will show up later on in America's power bills--that \nsoon we will face a shortage of clean coal and stringent emissions \ncontrols, and all at once our electric bills will increase because we \nhaven't done a very good job in managing our clean coal resources.\n\n  Secretary Richardson has testified before the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee that clean coal will be an integral portion \nof our Nation's energy portfolio for the next 30 years. But after they \nsay that, they have done nothing or they are unwilling to ensure that \nthe political actions of the Department of the Interior do not endanger \nthe supply of clean coal.\n  It doesn't make a lot of sense. How about hydroelectric production of \nelectricity? Secretary Babbitt wants to be known as the first Secretary \nto tear down large dams that are placed along some of our major \nwaterways, and he offers no response when asked how we are going to \nreplace the power produced by those dams. In light of the recent action \non the nuclear waste bill, the administration has also opposed any \ncohesive policy for nuclear energy management, instead desiring to sit \nback and posture on the debate.\n  Again, we see evidence of a failed energy policy. Today we see the \ntruckers coming to town, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The \nDepartment of the Interior has thwarted any attempts to reinvigorate \nthe domestic gas industry. They have closed vast areas of our Outer \nContinental Shelf to gas. They will release a statement saying they \nfully support the natural gas industry, yet fail to deliver on any of \nthe policies to help it along.\n  The same has been done throughout the Rocky Mountains. We have \nreserves of natural gas across Montana that could be used to fuel this \nnation. There is a large supply, yet we cannot tap it because of the \nDepartment of the Interior and this administration's policy seal it \naway development.\n  I want to bring up one more fuel related problem we are faced with in \nMontana. In my hometown of Billings, MT, we have three refineries. They \nproduce gas, diesel, and other refined petroleum products, not only for \ndomestic use in Montana but also for the entire region, including \neastern Washington. We have to reroute a pipeline that lets those \nproducts flow to the Spokane area, and it has to cross about 60 miles \nof Forest Service managed public lands. This reroute has been \nvigorously opposed by this administration.\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\n  What happened? The Yellowstone Pipeline Company went to the Forest \nService and said: Give us an estimate for the reroute proposal. We have \nto do an environmental impact statement. We want to do it right. This \nwas back in 1997. What will it cost they asked. Less than a million \ndollars was the response from the Forest Service. Good they responded, \nlet's go ahead with the EIS process and find a viable route. Three \nyears later, the Yellowstone Pipeline Company has paid $5 million to \nresite those 60 miles of pipeline, and just a week and a half ago the \nYellowstone Pipeline was forced to pull the plug on the project because \nthe Forest Service refused to acknowledge that their preferred \nalternative was too expensive to build. A pipeline, the cheapest way to \nmove fuel and distribute energy across this country, now is in \njeopardy, if not dead.\n  The result will be that these 60 miles absent of pipeline will be \ncrossed in another way. We are going to rail it or truck it. We will \nprobably have an accident, even the Forest Service's EIS documents \nacknowledge this. A spill will probably result--we have already had one \nat Alberton. We might also truck it. However, with energy costs as high \nas they are today, that will increase the cost to consumers. It also, \nin that 60 miles, exposes traffic to large semis on a two-lane road. \nLives will be at stack. The Forest Service has also acknowledged that, \nbut continues to forge along proposing an unbuildable route. The \nhazards to the public, and the costs to the consumer, increase. That is \njust an example of what this administration has failed to do to ensure \nthat we have energy prices that are affordable and energy is accessible \nto all Americans.\n\n  So we feel for those truckers out there. We know what it is like to \ngo down that road and try to deliver the goods to America in an \nefficient and safe way, and to get the products to market in a \ncompetitive manner so they fall within the consumers' reach of \naffording them.\n  Two years ago, we were buying gasoline for around 85, 90 cents a \ngallon. It didn't take us long to get spoiled, did it? But now we find \nthat through that we usually have to pay the piper one time or another. \nIt is us, the consumers, that will pick up the bill of a failed energy \npolicy. The administration will be gone, but we will be left holding \nthe tab. It is our economy that will slow, and it is our families that \nwill have to do with less. We see it happening today in our oil and gas \nproduction. Let's not see it happen in our electricity production. This \neconomy we have been enjoying all these years could go away in a \nflash--just a flash. It takes a while for an administration's action to \nlead to a tangible impact, we are beginning the impact of this \nadministration's failed energy policy today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the \nstatus of the legislation at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are considering H.R. 1883 under a time \nlimit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Under that time limit, can the Senator from New Mexico \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If he yields himself time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation before us. This legislation is only one of many important \nsteps required to counter the greatest threat to U.S. security in this \nera--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I am not being an alarmist. I am being a realist. The proliferation \nof nuclear, chemical, and biological technologies and the means to \ndeliver them present a growing threat to U.S. security. This is a \nthreat which we have only begun to address in the changed security \nenvironment of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I would like to mention three important aspects of the \nproblem as stated by George Tenet, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence early \nin February.\n  First, Russia and China no longer represent the only missile threat \nto the United States. The missile threat to U.S. interests and forces \nfrom other nations is here and now.\n  Second, South Asian nations are establishing doctrine and tactics for \nthe use of their missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The nuclear \nrivalry between India and Pakistan steadily intensifies. The potential \nfor miscalculation, misperception and escalation of the conflict in \nKashmir is high.\n  Third, the countries we previously considered technology importers \nare now assuming roles as ``secondary suppliers.'' This compounds the \nproliferation problem and confounds our ability to control or defend \nagainst it.\n  As outlined in the most recent Intelligence Community assessment of \nBallistic Missile Threats, by the year 2015 the U.S. will not only face \nthe ongoing challenges of large-scale missile threats from China and \nRussia. U.S. cities will also confront a real threat from other \nactors--North Korea, probably Iran, and possibly Iraq.\n  One must mention that Intelligence Community's estimate excludes the \npossibility of social or political changes in those countries that \nwould change the calculus. Also, the missile arsenals of these nations \nwould be much smaller, limited to smaller payloads, and less reliable \nthan Chinese or Russian capabilities.\n  At the same time, these remain a lethal and less predictable threat. \nAcute accuracy is not required for missiles tipped with nuclear, \nbiological, or chemical warheads. And the U.S. cannot bank on rational \nactions from dictators like Saddam Hussein or Kim Chong-il.\n  At the same time that the threat increases, global changes make non-\nproliferation efforts even more difficult. Three specific aspects in \nthe current international security environment will impede U.S. efforts \nto control or minimize this threat.\n  First, Russia--hard currency starved and heavily indebted--is a \nwilling merchant--most notably of conventional defense items, but the \nU.S. Russian sales are not limited to this. This legislation attempts \nto address this aspect through creating incentives for the Russian \ngovernment and others to implement and enforce stricter export controls \non private actors or institutes in their dealings with Iran.\n  Second, North Korea and their No-Dong missile sales are altering \nstrategic balances in the Middle East and Asia. While the \nadministration's new strategy for engagement with North Korea may \nretard developments that require testing, such as reliability of long-\nrange missiles, many suspect that the North Korean missile program \ncontinues and that its role as a supplier of medium-range missile \ntechnology has not been addressed.\n  Third, technology advances and rapid international economic \nintegration alter and confuse the means by which the United States can \ncontrol military advances of other nations. The list of potentially \nthreatening dual-use technologies continues to grow. This is especially \ntrue of information technologies--command, control, communication, and \ninformation technologies, C-31, now comprise about 75 percent of a \nmodern military's capability. But potential dual use is also true of \nnuclear, chemical, biological, and missile technologies.\n  The proliferation threat will remain our Nation's No. 1 security \nchallenge in the 21st century. At the same time, the United States will \nbe most vulnerable to this threat. As George Tenet, our head of the \nCIA, also noted, U.S. hegemony has become a lightning rod for the \ndisaffected.\n  As Americans enjoy unprecedented prosperity, many in the world remain \ndisaffected. These disaffected represent a group who resent our power \nand our prosperity. Our success fuels the intensity of their claims and \ntheir feelings.\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nThe same forces aligned against our nonproliferation objectives apply \nto terrorist organizations as well, whether state sponsored or not. A \ndisaffected Iran, despite some moderating trends, remains an active \nstate supporter of terrorism.\n  Terrorist groups will continue to increase their destructive or their \npotential for disruption through rapidly evolving and spreading \ntechnologies. Again, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear \nagents offer cheap means to achieve highly lethal terror. Acquisition \nof information technology may not only greatly improve a terrorist \ngroup's means for organization and coordination and attack, these \ntechnologies offer increasing potential for massive, possibly \ncrippling, disruption of U.S. information infrastructure.\n  This legislation is a small step, but a good one, in addressing the \nproblem of supplying WMD technologies to Iran. But we have much more \nwork to do. We must prevent, when prevention is possible, such as \nproviding safeguards for nuclear materials in Russia and controlling \naccess to technology and know-how as best we can and in as many cases \nas we can.\n  We must also find the most effective means to defend against such \nthreats, such as training and equipping policemen and firemen to \nrespond to these attacks and pursuing the best technological solutions \nto defend against them.\n  I believe the United States is not pursuing with sufficient vigor the \nmeans of greatest potential against missile threats. For example, \ndirected energy technologies represent the next revolutionary step in \nmilitary technologies. Laser technologies in particular dramatically \nalter U.S. potential to counter a missile attack. Missile defense at \nthe speed of light will improve effectiveness and efficiency, \nsubstantially reducing the cost-per-kill ratios.\n  Despite this understanding, the budget of the President cut the \nairborne laser program $92 million. In addition, the defense budget \nreduced science and technology spending, according to our first \nestimates, by more than $1 billion. It is not easy to understand. The \nadministration proposes sacrificing the potential of real defense \nagainst proliferation threats, although it seems very clearly to be a \nshortsighted approach.\n\n  I have been working as hard as I can, and in some instances at the \nforefront, on some prevention efforts, especially with respect to \nproliferation threats from Russia. I hope this year for stepped up \nmeasures of prevention, especially regarding the threat of nuclear \nproliferation in the form of the brain drain from Russia. At the same \ntime, where I can, I will put on a full court press to improve the \nscience and technology budget for the Pentagon, especially as it \npertains to the most promising means of missile defense and directed \nenergy.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in ensuring that every means of \nproliferation prevention is pursued. I also invite my colleagues to \njoin in increasing the means of our military laboratories to provide \nfor our national defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, The Apocrypha, or the Hidden Books, is a \nterm used to describe the books found in the Alexandrine Greek \nScripture (The Septuagint), but absent from the Orthodox Hebrew \nScripture. In the second book of Esdras is found the following \nAdmonishment: ``Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with \na good courage that which hath befallen thee.''\n  There is one Member of this body who seems to have lived his life by \nthat particular piece of ancient wisdom. That Member to whom I refer is \nthe senior Senator from the State of Massachusetts, Edward M. Kennedy.\n  The saga of the Kennedy family is well known by nearly everyone. It \nis a story replete with triumphs and unfathomable tragedies. Many \ntimes, I have marveled, at the resilience displayed by Ted Kennedy and \nby his family. Somehow they always manage to regroup, to prevail, to go \non, even in the face of devastation.\n  I believe they find their strength in the love of each other, and in \ntheir unstinting devotion to public service.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy is absolutely committed to public service.\n  He has served and served wisely and well in the United States for 38 \nyears. First elected to the Senate in 1962, Ted Kennedy is now the \nthird most senior Member of this body.\n  A child of privilege, educated at Harvard and the University of \nVirginia Law School, Ted Kennedy could have taken the easier path in \nlife. But instead Ted Kennedy came to the Senate to work. And the \ncauses he has championed and put his broad shoulder to the wheel to \nsupport, are for the most part, the causes that benefit the little \npeople--the poor, the downtrodden, the children in our society.\n  Senator Kennedy has been an unstinting warrior in the effort to \nensure quality health care to the citizens of the Nation. Two recent \nachievements in this area are the Health Insurance and Accountability \nAct of 1996, which makes it easier for those who change or lose their \njobs to keep their health insurance, and the children's Health \nInsurance Act of 1997, which makes their health insurance far more \nwidely available to children through age 18 in all 50 states.\n\n  Senator Kennedy has for years, also been a dynamic leader on a wide \nrange of other issues of central importance to the people of this \nNation, including education, raising the minimum wage, defending the \nrights of workers and their families, strengthening civil rights laws, \nassisting individuals with disabilities, fighting for cleaner water and \ncleaner air, and protecting Social Security and Medicare for senior \ncitizens.\n  I have not always agreed with his solutions to our Nation's problems, \nbut I have always respected his capacity for hard work, his devotion to \nthe causes he champions, and his energetic ability to get things done.\n  And although we have disagreed in the past, one time or another over \nthe years, Senator Kennedy and I have come to be friends for a long \ntime. We share many things in common, although two more different \nindividuals in background could hardly be imagined. We share a love of \nhistory, of poetry, of the rough-and-tumble and the humor of politics, \nand we share a love and understanding of this Senate and the singularly \nimportant role it was intended to play in this Republic.\n  Rarely have I been more touched than when Ted personally delivered 80 \nlong-stemmed roses to my office in remembrance of my 80th birthday, 2 \nyears ago. It was a memorable moment for me.\n  Through all the triumphs and tragedies, through all the hard work, \nthe disappointments, and the hard knocks that always accompany a long \npolitical career, Senator Kennedy has retained a young man's zeal for \nlife, for service, for laughter, and for achievement. I believe that \nhis shadow will loom large when the history of this body is written in \nfuture years. Already, the sum total of his legislative achievements \nis enormous, and he is still as active, as energetic and as committed \nas ever. Fortunately, for this body and for the Nation, we can expect \nmany, many more years of loyal and distinguished service from the \nsenior Senator from the Bay State.\n\n  So today on the birthday of my friend, Ted Kennedy, I rise to salute \nhis courage, his work, his resiliency, and his extraordinary friendship \nand kindness to me.\n  And I offer to him this day one of those famous, certainly very \nlyrical of Irish blessings:\n\n     May the road rise to meet you,\n     May the wind be always at your back,\n     May the sun shine warm upon your face,\n     May the rain fall softly upon your fertile fields.\n     And, until we meet again,\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\n     May God hold you in the palm of His hand.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Iran \nNonproliferation Act. I note, as many do, the encouraging election \nresults that happened this past week within Iran. I say encouraging \nbecause perhaps that country is moving towards a more open policy, a \nbetter policy of engagement with the rest of the world and the United \nStates.\n  I want to point out some facts and some reasons that this act should \nbe passed. Iran remains a danger to the United States and to our \nfriends in the Middle East, particularly to Israel. It is a fact.\n  Iran continues as the largest state supporter of international \nterrorism, the bankroller of munitions supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon \nand to Islamic Jihad and Hamas. It is still opposed to the Israeli \npeace process and to peace under any circumstances with Israel.\n  Those are all the facts, and they remain the facts, in spite of the \nfact that a so-called moderate President Khatami has been in power in \nIran for 2\\1/2\\ years. I know some would say he does not have full \ncontrol, and he doesn't, nor will he after these elections. This will \nremain the factual situation even after this election.\n  I don't think the United States should act on hope but on fact. The \nrecent Hezbollah attacks on Israeli soldiers could not have happened \nwithout Iranian approval. Those attacks, made possible by the continued \nfunneling of arms from Iran to Hezbollah, were undertaken primarily to \nderail the peace process. After all, Israel has already committed \nitself to withdraw from Lebanon by July.\n  Even more worrisome is Iran's effort to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction and the missiles to be able to deliver them. The \nadministration has already sanctioned 10 Russian entities for providing \ndangerous technologies to Iran but readily admits that the flow \ncontinues. Thousands of Russian scientists and technicians are at work \nin Iran helping these efforts. This remains the fact today.\n  Iran has already flight-tested a missile capable of reaching Israel \nand is working on longer range missiles capable of carrying nuclear \nwarheads. Fact.\n  Under the guise of peaceful nuclear energy development, Iran is \nspending billions to develop a nuclear infrastructure. Iran, a country \nrich in both oil and natural gas, needs to develop nuclear energy about \nas much as Alaska needs artificial snowmaking machines.\n  The picture gets worse. CIA Director Tenet, in testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee earlier this month, forecast the possibility \nthat Iran might become a supplier in its own right of missile \ntechnology as it develops its own indigenous production capability. \nFact.\n  Those are the facts. Iran is getting this dangerous technology from \nNorth Korea and China, but its primary source remains Russia. Russian \nentities have assisted Iran in the development of a missile capable of \nhitting Israel. They are also the main technology sources for a longer \nrange missile, the Kosar, that could hit the heart of Europe with \nnuclear warheads. Fact.\n  The Russian Government has also signed peaceful nuclear cooperation \nagreements with Iran to build nuclear power reactors. Iran is \nreportedly using this legal cooperation to make clandestine efforts to \nprocure nuclear material and to develop the ability to produce weapons-\ngrade nuclear material on its own.\n\n  The administration sought to get the Russian Government to stop this \nflow, and the Russians have taken some steps. They have passed \nlegislation to create an export control regime, for example, but they \nhave done little to enforce it. Not one Russian has been convicted of \npassing dangerous technology to Iran. Not a single Russian has been \nconvicted under this law.\n  That is why we must keep the heat on. This legislation requires the \nPresident to report to Congress, in a classified form if he deems it \nnecessary, credible information on any entity anywhere in the world \nthat is providing Iran with dangerous technology. It then authorizes \nhim to sanction those entities. If he chose not to, he would then \nreport to Congress on his rationale for not sanctioning. So, in the \nfirst instance, this legislation captures China, North Korea, and any \nothers who are providing Iran the wherewithal to obtain weapons of mass \ndestruction and the missiles to deliver them.\n  It goes a step further. Over the past few years, the Russians have \nbeen unable to meet their limited financial obligations to the creation \nof the international space station, so we have been helping them out, \npaying part of their funding in addition to our own, considerably \nlarger, space station obligations. As it happens, the recipient of this \nmoney, the Russian Space Agency, their NASA, is also the Russian \ngovernmental entity with jurisdiction over any entity in Russia dealing \nwith missile technology.\n  Therefore, this legislation requires the President to certify three \nthings before we can continue to pay the Russian share of the space \nstation: That it is Russian policy to stop proliferation to Iran, that \nthey are taking the steps necessary to prevent the proliferation, and \nthat no entity under the jurisdiction of the Russian space station is \ncooperating with the Iranian missile program.\n  If we are going to pay Russian obligations, then we have the right to \nsuggest they must do everything they can to stop the proliferation to \nIran--something that threatens not only America and our friends but, \nultimately, Russia as well. It cannot be in Russia's interests to have \na nuclear-armed Iran sitting on its borders.\n  Some may say, with the recent elections in Iran in which the \nmoderates appear to have done very well, indeed this is not the time to \npush this legislation. Unfortunately, as I pointed out earlier, even \nunder the reportedly moderate President Khatami over the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, Iranian support for terrorism and its weapons technology \nacquisition have not diminished. Those facts remain.\n  Hard-liners remain in charge of Iranian security and foreign policy; \nthey will after this election, as well. It may be that at some point in \nthe future Iranian moderates may seek a different course. They have not \nto date. But for now, they have neither the ability nor necessarily the \ninterest. They appear much more interested in reforming Iranian \ndomestic policy than in all of these problems they are creating \ninternationally. That means we cannot let down our guard. We must do \neverything we can to stop the flow of technology, to raise the cost of \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction, and to delay the time at which \nIran could have such a capability.\n  This is the purpose of this legislation and why I strongly urge its \nadoption. While the timing of this legislation may not seem the best, \nperhaps it is the absolute right time. We need to make clear to the \nIranian people, particularly their leadership on foreign policy and \nthese terrorist items, that this is unacceptable behavior for them and \nfor the rest of the world to have to tolerate. The development of these\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\nweapons, the sponsorship of terrorism, the development of the missile \ncapacity that could so threaten its neighbors and much of Europe is not \nresponsible behavior. This is something we cannot tolerate, and we are \nsending that clear message at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the \nplight of our independent truckers who are here in Washington, many of \nthem, expressing their frustration as a consequence of the high \nincrease in the cost of diesel oil. These are individuals who own their \nown trucks, for the most part, and supply this country with untold tons \nof food and various other supplies, virtually everything we need.\n  This is a mobile society and we are dependent on energy to move us. \nThe price of that energy has increased dramatically.\n  I have yet to hear from the administration expressing any of their \nconcerns, as a consequence of this demonstration by the independent \ntruckers who are trying to bring a focus to what kinds of relief the \nadministration is proposing because every indication is we are going to \nsee higher oil prices, higher energy prices. There are some reasons for \nthis. One of them is we have an increased dependence on imports of oil. \nWe are currently 55-percent dependent on import oil. Most of these \nimports are coming from the Mideast.\n  In the world of the oil market, the United States is certainly a \ngiant consumer but, a bit player. The Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries really calls the tune, and the U.S. generally has \nto pay the piper. That organization is known by all of us as OPEC. \nThere are 11 countries that make up OPEC, and they produce more than 40 \npercent of the world's oil and possess three-fourths of the world's \nproven reserves. The United States, as I indicated, imports 55 percent \nof the oil we use, or about 10.5 million barrels out of the 19.3 \nmillion barrels of oil consumed in the Nation in each and every day.\n  The point I want to make is this is not just a one-time incident. If \nyou go back to 1973, some of you will remember the lines around the \nblock at the gas station. At that time, we had an Arab oil embargo. \nHowever, at that time, we were 36-percent dependent on imported oil, \nand we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We said we would never \nexpose ourselves to near 50-percent dependence on foreign oil. Today, \nwe are 55-percent dependent, as I have indicated, and growing. It is \nour own Government's policies, or lack of policies, both local and \nnational, that have handicapped our domestic industry. The result is \nconsumers from New York to Oregon are paying the price. The truckers \nwho are in Washington today, are paying the price, but not without some \nloud howls, seeking some Government relief. Several of these self-\nimposed handicaps are correctable if we would only wake up to a few \nrealities.\n  On the production side, we have banned oil exploration off a good \nportion of our coastline, including California and Florida, because a \nmajority of these States oppose it. They have every right to oppose it, \nand we should honor it. However, we refuse to consider exploration in \nmany areas where clearly it is supported, such as in some areas of \nTexas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and my State of Alaska.\n  We should, in these areas where the public supports exploration, get \nan aggressive leasing plan and proceed to open up these areas, using \nthe advanced technology we have and getting on with the task of \nlessening our dependence on imported oil.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in my State of Alaska has often \nbeen mentioned as a potential for major oil discovery. From the \nstandpoint of my State of Alaska, we have supplied this country with \nnearly 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in the last 27 years. \nWe have done it through a pipeline and a development process that has \nbeen safe. The tragic accident of the Exxon Valdez was a tanker \naccident that had nothing to do with the production or transportation \nof oil by pipeline.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge consists of 19 million acres. The \nassumption is that the entire 19 million acres is going to be open for \nexploration. That is not correct. Congress has set aside 8 million \nacres of that tract in wilderness in perpetuity that can never be \ndisturbed. Another 9.5 million acres have been set aside in a wildlife \nrefuge. No development is allowed or is going to be allowed. The \nremainder of that 19 million acres is 1.5 million acres which \ngeologists have identified as holding as much as 16 billion barrels of \noil which would or could replace Saudi oil coming into the United \nStates for the next 30 years. It is not a drop in the bucket by any \nmeans.\n\n  Where is this administration going with regard to lessening our \ndependence on imported oil? It wants to raise taxes on the oil \ncompanies, saying the royalty valuation in the past has been unfair. Is \nthat an incentive for exploration? I think not.\n  The President's current proposal in his budget calls for more than \n$400 million in new taxes on the oil industry. Who is going to pay \nthose taxes? It is going to be the American consumer.\n  The consequences are evident. Since the Clinton administration \nassumed office, U.S. crude oil production has fallen by 17 percent, and \nduring that period U.S. consumption of oil has gone up 14 percent. Why? \nSome people drive bigger cars than they used to. Some people like air-\nconditioning. Some people get on that jet airplane.\n  What has happened to the industry? Our drilling rigs have gone from \n532 active rigs operating in 1990 to 133 rigs operating in 2000.\n  What is our policy? Our policy is to become more dependent on \nimports.\n  On the downstream side, domestic policy really is not any better. \nSome of my New York colleagues have concerned themselves about the high \nprice of heating oil. I am sympathetic with those who are dependent on \nthat energy source, but while I sympathize on the one hand, I also \npoint out that a good portion of this is self-inflicted. Prices are \nhigh because stocks are low.\n  The State of New York itself reports that the petroleum bulk storage \ncapacity has declined over the past 5 years by more than 15 percent, \nand the heating oil storage capacity has declined nearly 20 percent, \nlargely due to environmental regulations. Those regulations may be \nwell-founded, but the fact is they do not have either the storage for \ncrude nor the storage they once had for heating oil. Of course, it has \nbeen a cold winter. When the heating oil supply is tight, many of my \ncolleagues search for an excuse, while the answer is right in their \nbackyard.\n  Moving over to suggested relief that has been proposed by opening up \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is our petroleum reserve in case \nof a national emergency, there is a suggestion that if we were to \nrelease that, somehow this would address the concerns we have over the \nhigh price of heating oil. Let me walk you through that scenario.\n  First of all, the SPR is for supply disruption emergencies. It is a \ncrude oil supply in salt caverns in Louisiana. As a consequence, it has \na limited capacity to get out that crude. It is not heating oil. It is \ncrude. So it has to be moved from SPR to refineries, be refined, and \nthen go into the market.\n\n  The difficulty with this is the refineries have crude supplies. So if \nyou bring in SPR crude, you are going to have to offset that with the \ncrude they have at the refinery already. The difficulty is in the mix \nof what the refineries make. As a consequence of low stocks going into \nthis winter, based on the assumption this would not be a cold winter, \nthose inventories were low. Coupled with the reduction in the storage \nsupply for the fuel oil--and then later we did have a colder winter; we \nall saw the Coast Guard breaking ice in the Hudson River--as a \nconsequence of that, we could not meet the demand for heating oil, and \nthe price went up to nearly $2 a gallon. That was indeed unfortunate.\n  Relief. The refiners continued to produce more heating oil. The \nweather\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\nbegan to cooperate, and reports suggested that Europe sent over refined \nproduct.\n  The point I want to make is, SPR is not the answer because the simple \nreality is, you do not displace one type of crude oil with another. \nThat does not relieve the problem. It is the mix within the refineries.\n  Now we have an administration that is petitioning them to still \nproduce large volumes of heating oil even though there are indications \nthe inventories are now adequate. The real threat is that they should \nbe producing gasoline soon for the summer market. We could see a \nshortage of gasoline this summer and perhaps retail price increases in \nthe neighborhood of nearly $2 a gallon.\n  We did a little comparison on the west coast, which is the area where \nI am from. We did a comparison for retail prices in three Western \nStates and Alaska. We found California's regular gasoline was $1.38 per \ngallon; for Oregon's regular gasoline, it was $1.42 per gallon; for \nWashington's regular gasoline, it was $1.35 per gallon; and for my \nState of Alaska, it was $1.35 per gallon.\n  But when we talk about self-inflicted problems, we need to look at \nthe taxes imposed on each gallon of gas within the four States.\n  California's tax burden is about 46.4 cents on the gallon; for \nOregon, it is 45.4 cents per gallon; for Washington State, it is about \nthe same. The taxes include Federal, State, and local taxes in the \nthree States. California includes a sales tax, as well, and has the \nadded burden of 5 to 8 cents a gallon its residents must pay for \nreformulated gasoline.\n  Oregon is a little different. It adds to its cost by banning self-\nservice as an option at the pumps. In other words, you do not fill up \nyour car in Oregon. Somebody does it for you. You pay for it. The \nestimated additional cost is about 15 cents a gallon.\n  But in Alaska, my State, the combined taxes are only 26 cents. \nWithout taxes, my State of Alaska actually pays the highest price for \ngasoline of the four States; yet we produce it all--or a good portion \nof it.\n  Gasoline prices. If you take off gas taxes, take off the cost of \nadditives, take off the cost in relation to whether or not somebody \nfills your tank, then you begin to be able to identify what the true \ncosts are to the consumer for a gallon of gasoline.\n  My State of Alaska supplies 46 percent of the current stock to the \nwest coast. But barrels of oil from Alaska are beginning to decline. We \nare producing little more than a million barrels a day. Virtually all \nof that is shipped to Washington and California; significant portions \ngo from Washington to Oregon.\n  California's Senators object to any development in the Arctic. But \nwithout new development, the production will continue to decline, and \nit will be necessary for the west coast and their west coast \nconstituents to purchase more oil from even more expensive sources, \nsuch as the Mideast. How are they going to get the oil in? In foreign \ntankers owned by foreign companies that clearly have more of an \nenvironmental exposure than our own domestic fleet.\n  Common sense tells us we should stop handicapping our industry. We \nshould do this by encouraging exploration, development of our reserves, \nand not increasing taxes on this industry.\n  Oil development in my State can be done right. It is environmentally \nsound. It keeps land disturbance to a minimum.\n  To give you some idea, out of the 19 million acres of ANWR that we \ntalked about, of the million and a half acres that Congress has the \nauthority to open up--and I add, this body voted to open it up; and the \nPresident vetoed it a number of years ago--the footprint is estimated \nto be no larger than the footprint of the Dulles International Airport, \nassuming the rest of Virginia were wilderness. That is to give you some \nidea of the magnitude of what the footprint is. It is relatively small.\n  Again, I remind you that the estimates are that the ANWR area could \nproduce more than 16 billion barrels of oil, which would equate to \nabout what we bring in from Saudi Arabia over a 30-year period. Yet \nthis administration would rather bolster the oil output of Saddam \nHussein by lifting oil production limits in Iraq, which is what they \nhave done. Should we really be placing our energy security on OPEC \ndecisions?\n  The administration pursues policies that discourage investment within \nour borders, driving investment overseas, and our jobs overseas. If we \nare going to participate in this energy race, we are going to need to \nget in the game. If we choose to continue to drive oil production \noffshore, then we will have no room--or little room--to complain about \nthe high price of that decision, or the insecurity of our future oil \nsupplies.\n  There is no question in my mind that our national energy security is \nvery much at risk. We still do not seem to get it. We do not understand \nthe vulnerability of increasing our dependence on imports.\n  If we look over our shoulders at world crude markets, since 1997, we \nhave gone from a low of $10 a barrel to $30 a barrel. To some extent, \nwe have explained that this was due to the slowdown of the Asian \neconomy, mild winters, and increased Saudi and Venezuela production. \nThen we have also seen OPEC kind of get its act together with self-\ndiscipline. It cut production 6 percent. They decided they would rather \nsell less oil but sell it higher than sell more oil and sell it lower.\n  Then we saw the Asian economy rebound. Winters in the U.S. got colder \neven with global warming. The thought from OPEC was: Wait a minute. We \nare going to hold off for a little while. We saw the low stocks as a \nresult of this.\n  Of course, we have discussed the heating oil situation and SPR and \nOPEC and ANWR. But when we get back to what the administration is doing \nabout it, we are still stuck with the reality that they are throwing \nmore taxes at us--$400 million. They are not encouraging the industry \nto go out and drill, as evidenced by the reduction in drilling rigs.\n  Some of them say: We will simply go out and hook up to natural gas. \nThe National Petroleum Council report indicated that is not going to be \na viable alternative. They said that we consume about 20 trillion cubic \nfeet of gas today. We will be consuming about 31 trillion cubic feet in \nthe next 10 years. We do not have the infrastructure in to meet that \ndemand. It is going to have to be an expenditure of about $1.5 \ntrillion. Gas will not be cheap.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, won't make public lands \navailable to produce natural gas. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission puts up environmental roadblocks to building new gas \npipelines to the Northeast. Where is the power going to come from?\n  Some would say hydroelectric. We have already seen the proposal by \nthe Secretary of the Interior. He wants to tear down four dams in the \nPacific Northwest. Now a FERC Commissioner, Commissioner Hoecker, \nclaims that FERC has the authority to tear these dams down.\n  Moving over to coal, the administration is proposing to take a number \nof plants down through EPA decisions. Those were plants that were \ngrandfathered in under the Clean Air Act, with the assumption that they \nwould operate for a period of time. As the power industry has attempted \nto maintain those plants, they have been subjected to criminal \nprosecution by the EPA for extending the life of the plants. I am not \ndebating the issue of, if you stay within your permit by continuing to \nmaintain your plant at a level that you have to, whether you are \nextending the life of that plant or not. But that is the dilemma for \nthe coal industry.\n  We have already debated for days the reality and role of the nuclear \nindustry, the fact that it contributes 20 percent of the power in this \ncountry. The administration does not want to address a solution on its \nwatch. It would just as soon let the industry choke on its own waste. \nWhile we had 64 votes the other day, we were still a few short of a \nveto override, and the President threatened to veto the legislation \nthat would address, temporarily, relief so our nuclear industry could \ncontinue to produce power.\n  With the attitude of the administration, it is evident that in the \narea of nuclear, coal, hydroelectric, there are simply no alternatives \nbeing proposed. I suggest to the Senate that is an irresponsible \nattitude. It seems all this administration wants to do is to hang on \nuntil it is over--and I can't wait--in\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\nthe hope that there won't be some kind of calamity that will disrupt \ntheir departure. I suggest there is going to be a calamity. It relates \nto what is happening in Washington today with the truckers. This is \nproof the folks out there are fed up. They are looking to Government \nfor a response. They are fed up with the administration's attitude \nwhich suggests we should go over to OPEC and beg that they increase \nproduction, that we become more dependent on imported oil. The \nrealities of that are totally unacceptable to this Senator.\n  It is going to get more serious. OPEC would like to see oil at \nsomewhere between $20 and $25; that is good for OPEC. I suppose now \nthat it is $30, it might be good for the United States.\n  OPEC is having a meeting in March, but some economists suggest it is \ntoo late. We are going to be increasingly exposed to increased gasoline \nprices this summer. Some suggest we are going to be subjected to $40 \noil, if Saddam Hussein chooses to cut off his supply in protest of \nUnited Nations sanctions. Here we are in the United States, dependent \non what Saddam Hussein might do to his oil production that could affect \nour price of energy. Incredible, Mr. President, incredible, but \nnevertheless true.\n  As I have indicated, the past year alone, oil has tripled in cost to \n$30 from less than $11; heating oil, nearly $2 a gallon; our airline \ntickets, $20 surcharge. One of these days when you go to fill up that \nsports utility vehicle, it is going to cost you $60 to fill your gas \ntank.\n  People in this technological age wonder what the role of oil is. Is \noil energy king? Well, let's look at inflation. We hear Chairman \nGreenspan worry about inflation, about oil prices increasing. The \nSecretary of Energy, in the meantime, tours six oil-producing nations. \nHe says he can't ignore the potential for oil to have an impact on \ninflation. He says what OPEC does matters, and it sure does. I think we \nare at a point of reckoning where oil has reemerged as a political and \neconomic threat to our economy.\n\n  Now, here we are, looking at dependence on Mideast oil-producing \ncountries, and we are asking them to change their cash-flow to \naccommodate us and increase production. I wonder if they will be \ninclined to do that.\n  If we look at some of the realities associated with inflation, I \nthink we have to look over our shoulder and recognize what happened in \nthe past. Many people don't remember the gas lines in 1973. December of \n1980, inflation in this country was 11 percent; the prime rate was 20.5 \npercent. People started to wake up. Are they waking up now? The signs \nare there. Is OPEC willing to sacrifice windfall oil profits to help \nkeep economic growth on track in the United States, Europe, and Asia at \ntheir own expense? I happen to believe that charity begins at home. We \nhave become dependent on OPEC. Can we be dependent on them increasing \nthe supply of oil?\n  A source of information from the International Energy Agency says \nthat OPEC will have to increase by 10 percent just to keep up with \nworld demands. If they don't want to keep up with world demands, the \nprice goes up, doesn't it? That will increase production somewhere \nbetween 4.5 and 12 percent, or between 1.2 and 3.1 million barrels per \nday.\n  A lot of people don't realize how long it takes for a barrel of oil \nfrom the Mideast to reach their gas station. It is roughly 6 weeks. If \nwe go into this summer with the current forecast we are getting, we \nwill see gasoline at $2 a gallon. We depend on oil to keep us warm, for \ntravel, for our homes, sport utility vehicles, on and on, and we are \nconcerned about prosperity. We are concerned about inflation.\n  There was an article by Daniel Yergin with the Cambridge Energy \nResearch Association, an expert on oil. He indicated there are three \nthings that can get people concerned about inflation and spook the \nstock market. When I highlight them, you will agree they are here.\n  It is the price and availability of labor. It is the cost of money or \ninterest rates that are on the rise. And it is the increased price of \noil.\n  We are starting to move. Mark my words, the Organization of Economic \nCooperation and Development has estimated that every $10 rise in the \nprice of oil lifts inflation by\\1/2\\ percentage point and reduces \neconomic growth by \\1/4\\ percent. If that isn't what is happening right \nnow, I will trade places with the President of this body. Oil prices \nhave accounted for the doubling of inflation, to 2 percent from 1.1 \npercent in the last year.\n  I quote Chairman Greenspan:\n\n       I've been through too many oil shocks to not take them \n     seriously. If price changes, it impacts the economy.\n\n  These are a few of the highlights of where the United States is, why \nthe truckers are circulating in Washington, DC.\n  What is this administration doing about it? They are kowtowing to the \nArab world. They are wringing their hands. They have no positive \nsuggestions. Least of all, they have not made one single statement to \nencourage domestic exploration and production in this country. One \nwonders what you learn by history; some people say ``not much.'' If you \nlook over your shoulder at where we were in the early 1970s with the \nArab oil embargo, where we are today--and, of course, in the interim we \nfought a war over oil in Iraq and Kuwait. Today, we are right back \nthere, only we are more dependent on the Mideast. If we don't take the \nsteps now to reduce that dependence, this is going to happen again.\n  Keep in mind that, for the time being, it isn't over. We are just \nstarting into this crisis. This administration must be held accountable \nfor the lack of an energy policy in this country. There is no energy \npolicy on nuclear power, no energy policy on coal, no energy policy on \ngas, no energy policy on oil. It kind of drifts out there. And they are \nwell-meaning, but some extreme environmental groups basically propel \nthe direction of this administration. It is no direction at all because \nthere is no energy policy.\n  So as we look at the increased price of energy, we look at the \nfrustration of the truckers in Washington, DC, and we look at what the \nadministration is doing to address it, we have to come to the \nconclusion that the administration's efforts--if you can identify them \nat all--are limited to pleading with the Mideast oil barons to simply \nproduce more oil. That is inadequate. They are simply exporting jobs \nand dollars. We are going to have to turn this around in the Congress \nof the United States. The administration won't stand up and recognize \nthe reality that charity begins at home. We have the resources in this \ncountry, we have the technology, we have the capital, and we can \nrelieve our dependence on imports if given the support of the Clinton \nadministration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S676-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the social security earnings test for individuals who have \nattained retirement age; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         social security earnings test elimination act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in favor of repealing the \nSocial Security earnings test, the onerous tax burden the United States \ngovernment places on seniors who wish to continue working. In order to \nease this unfair burden, I am hereby introducing the Social Security \nEarnings Test Elimination Act of 2000.\n  The earnings test limits the amount a person older than 65 and \nyounger than 70 can earn without having his or her Social Security \nbenefits reduced. Currently, benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 of \nearnings over $17,000. This test provides a disincentive for seniors to \nwork by reducing seniors' Social Security benefits according to the \namount of income they earn.\n  It is time to repeal that limit. Right now, Social Security is \nscheduled to go bankrupt in 2034. One of the reasons for the looming \nbankruptcy of Social Security is the declining ratio of workers\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nto beneficiaries, which worsens as our elderly population continues to \ngrow much faster than the number of workers entering the workforce. In \n1960 the ratio was 5:1, today it is a little more than 3:1, and in \nthirty years it is expected to be only 2:1. This decreasing number of \nworkers paying for retirees benefits is making it increasingly \ndifficult to make the Social Security books balance.\n  Instead of helping to fix this problem, the earnings test exacerbates \nthis situation. By providing a disincentive to work, the earnings test \nkeeps seniors at home instead of at work and paying the payroll taxes \nthat keep the Social Security system solvent.\n  The earnings test is based on a misconception of the U.S. economy. \nThe Social Security Earnings Test is a relic of the Great Depression, \ndesigned to move older people out of the workforce and create \nemployment for younger individuals. The idea behind the earnings test \nis that if seniors were penalized for working, they would stay home and \nopen up employment opportunities for younger workers. Not only was this \nview wrong in earlier times, but it is counterproductive in today's \neconomy. Today, we do not have a labor surplus, but a labor shortage. \nUnemployment is at a long-time low of 4.0%, one-and-a-half points lower \nthan the so-called ``full employment'' mark of 5.5%.\n  Low unemployment is a great development, but it contributes to a \nlabor shortage that will worsen when the ``baby boom'' generation ages. \nEmployers will have to develop new sources of labor to fill this \nshortage, and seniors represent the most experienced, most skilled \nworkers. Many senior citizens can make a significant contribution, and \noften their knowledge and experience complements or exceeds that of \nyounger employees. 35 million Americans are over the age of 65, and \ntogether they have over a billion years of cumulative work experience. \nIt is both counterproductive and harmful to our growing economy to keep \nwilling, diligent workers out of the American economy.\n  In addition to the negative consequences for the economy as a whole, \nthe Social Security Earnings Test is also bad for seniors. The earnings \ntest punishes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 for their \nattempts to remain productive after retirement. This is particularly \nproblematic for low income seniors, many who exist on fixed incomes, \nand are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When \ncombined with federal, state and other Social Security taxes, taxes on \nthe elderly can total nearly 55 or 65 percent. An individual who is \nstruggling to make ends meet should not be faced with an effective \nmarginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent.\n  While the earnings test harms lower-income people, it only affects \nseniors who must work and depend on their earned income for survival. \nWealthy seniors are not affected by the earnings limit. Their \nsupplemental, ``unearned'' sources of income are safe and not subject \nto the earnings threshold. At the same time, many of the older \nAmericans penalized by the Earnings Test need to work in order to cover \ntheir basic expenses: health care, housing and food. Many seniors do \nnot have significant savings or a private pension. For this reason, \nlow-income workers are particularly hard-hit by the Earnings Test.\n  In addition to all of the policy reasons for elimination of the \nEarnings Test, the most important reason to eliminate the Test is that \nit is fundamentally unfair. The earnings test discriminates against \nseniors. Nobody, regardless of creed, color, gender, or age should be \npenalized for working or discouraged from engaging in work.\n  Furthermore, the Earnings Test takes money from seniors that is \nrightfully theirs. The Social Security benefits which working seniors \nare losing due to the Earnings Test penalty are benefits they have \nrightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout their \nworking years before retiring. These are benefits which they should not \nbe losing because they are trying to survive by supplementing their \nSocial Security income.\n  Mr. President, it is time to eliminate this counterproductive and \nunfair penalty. With the Social Security and Medicare Trusts Funds \nfacing long-term insolvency, it is now more important than ever to \nencourage work. More people working means more people paying into the \nSocial Security Trust Fund and Medicare.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation of my colleague Senator John Ashcroft to repeal the Social \nSecurity earnings limit. Under current law, workers aged 65-69, can \nearn only up to $17,000 without losing out on their Social Security \nbenefits. This ``earnings limit'' penalizes hard-working seniors by \ndocking them $1 for every $3 of earnings over the limit. In fact, an \nolder worker's entire Social Security benefit could be eliminated by \nthe earnings limit if he or she earns more than $45,944. A few years \nago, I worked successfully to increase the limit to $30,000 by 2002. \nBut we can do better. Penalizing older workers sends the wrong message \nto those who choose to stay in the workforce beyond normal retirement \nage. And in today's tight labor market, we need to do a better job \nabout recruiting and retaining good employees. In fact, in my state of \nIowa, the jobless rate for December was 2.2 percent. That rate is even \nbelow the national jobless rate of 4.1 percent. We cannot afford to \ndiscourage older Americans who want to work from remaining in the labor \nmarket.\n  I am a strong supporter of efforts under way this year to repeal the \nearnings limit. Eliminating the penalty would help 800,000 older \nworkers who now lose part or all of their benefits simply because they \nhave the will and ability to stay on the job after 65. From my home \nState alone, many Iowans have contacted me in frustration over the \nearnings limit.\n  For the first time in years, I am confident we can get the job done \nonce and for all. The proposal has overwhelming bipartisan support from \nCongress and the White House. We could see swift action on this \ncommonsense proposal.\n  While fixing this inequity in the retirement system will give fair \ntreatment to those ages 65-69 who have paid into the program during \ntheir entire working years, it will not address Social Security's long-\nterm demographic challenges. When the baby boom generation comes on \nboard, the revenue and benefit structure will not be able to sustain \nthe obligations under current law. That is why I have worked with six \nof my Senate colleagues, Senators Judd Gregg, Bob Kerrey, John Breaux, \nFred Thompson, Craig Thomas, and Chuck Robb, to craft bipartisan Senate \nreform legislation. Our bill, the ``Bipartisan Social Security Reform \nAct'' S. 1383 is the only reform legislation which has been put forth \nin the Senate which would make the Social Security trust fund \npermanently solvent. I will continue to press ahead and work to build a \nconsensus among our colleagues to save Social Security and achieve \nlong-term solvency for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Specter, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Landrieu, and \n        Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2076. A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New \nYork, in recognition of his accomplishments as a priest, a chaplain, \nand a humanitarian; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n legislation to authorize a congressional gold medal for john cardinal \n                    o'connor, archbishop of new york\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to rise \nalongside my distinguished colleagues Senators Moynihan, Specter, \nSantorum, Bayh, Brownback, Durbin, Landrieu, and Stevens, to honor the \nenormous contributions made by John Cardinal O'Connor to religion, \nhumanity, international relations, and service to America, by bestowing \nupon him the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  I believe this simple gesture would be our opportunity, as members of \nCongress, as representatives of this nation, to thank his Eminence for \nthe care, compassion, and spiritual guidance that he has provided to \nmillions of people throughout his lifetime. The work he has done from \nthe treasured St. Patrick's Cathedral has reinforced the traditional \nteaching and practices of the Roman Catholic church, and helped bring \nto life the spirit and mission of the Vatican.\n  Since being ordained 54 years ago, John Cardinal O'Connor has \ndedicated his life to the noblest of deeds, that of service. He has \nbeen an advocate of the poor, the sick, the elderly, and America's \nyoung children. He has heeded his country's call to service, serving \nfirst as a military chaplain, and rising, with distinction, to become \nNavy Chief Chaplain. He has served as an international ambassador, \ntraveling the world over, Israel, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nand Russia, as a messenger of peace, humanity, and freedom. Wherever \nwar, oppression, and poverty have threatened to weaken the human \nspirit, he has been there--a tireless servant of the Roman Catholic \nchurch and as an American citizen.\n  With the recent celebration of his 80th birthday, and the prospects \nof his retirement growing, it is truly the proper time for America to \npay tribute to John Cardinal O'Connor. Last week, the members of the \nHouse overwhelmingly supported similar legislation, introduced by \nCongressman Fossella, by a 413 to 1 vote. It is my hope that this \nlegislation will receive similar support here in the Senate, and that \nall of our colleagues will join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 2077. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nnonitemizers a deduction for a portion of their charitable \ncontributions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE CHARITABLE GIVING TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nCharitable Giving Tax Relief Act along with my colleague Senator \nCoverdell. This legislation will allow non-itemizers to deduct 50 \npercent of their charitable giving, after they exceed a cumulative \ntotal of $500 in annual donations.\n  As we approach another tax deadline, more than 84 million Americans \ncannot deduct any of their charitable contributions because they do not \nitemize their tax returns. In contrast, there are 34 million Americans \nwho itemize and receive this benefit. In Pennsylvania, there are nearly \n4 million taxpayers who do not itemize deductions while slightly more \nthan 1.5 million taxpayers do itemize.\n  While Americans are already giving generously to charities making a \nsignificant positive impact in our communities, this legislation \nprovides an incentive for additional giving and allows non-itemizers \nwho typically have middle to lower middle incomes to also benefit from \nadditional tax relief. In fact, non-itemizers earning less than $30,000 \ngive the highest percentage of their household income to charity. It is \nestimated that restoring this tax relief provision which existed in the \n1980's would encourage more than $3 billion of additional charitable \ngiving a year. According to Price Waterhouse, the Charitable Giving \nRelief Act would result in $725 million in additional charitable giving \nin Pennsylvania alone over a five year period.\n  Representative Philip Crane of Illinois has previously introduced \nidentical bipartisan legislation, H.R. 1310, with 122 cosponsors in the \nHouse of Representatives. The legislation is also supported by a long \nlist of nonprofit groups and the Independent Sector, a coalition of \nmore than 700 nonprofits, foundations, and other charitable groups.\n  President Clinton in his FY2001 budget has included a provision which \nwould allow non-itemizers to deduct 50 percent of their charitable \ncontributions in excess of $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for \njoint filers. The President's proposal would eventually lower the \nthreshold to $500 in 2006 in a manner consistent with the Charitable \nGiving Tax Relief Act.\n  One important dimension of my involvement in promoting charitable \nefforts helping to revitalize our communities, empower individuals and \nfamilies, and enhance educational opportunities is encouraging \ncharitable giving. This legislation is a great opportunity to lower the \ntax burden on the many Americans who have not received any tax relief \nfor their charitable contributions since 1986.\n  As Senate Co-Chair of the Congressional Empowerment Caucus with \nSenator Lieberman and in my efforts with the Renewal Alliance, I am \ncommitted to helping further unleash the potential of charitable \norganizations and harness the generosity of Americans to improve the \nquality of life of all Americans. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and the President to provide additional tax relief and \nincentives for charitable giving this year.\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the timely resolution of back-logged \ncivil rights discrimination cases of the Department of Agriculture, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n              THE USDA CIVIL RIGHTS RESOLUTION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce a \nbill that is designed to clean up a terrible mess at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, dealing with civil rights.\n  Last year, a finding was made that the USDA had, for decades, been \nguilty of violating many of America's producer's civil rights. When \nthese producers tried to take advantage of the programs offered by the \nUSDA they were treated differently than their friends and neighbors.\n  Many cases have been pending for too long. At least one has been on \nthe list for up to ten years. Due to USDA's inaction, Congress waived \nthe statute of limitations on certain USDA discrimination cases, giving \nfarmers until October 21, 2000, to file or re-file cases that allegedly \noccurred between 1981 through 1997. In addition to the cases that have \nbeen pending, that added another major backlog.\n  While we realize there is a massive backlog of cases to be dealt \nwith, we feel Congress has made a good-faith effort to assist the \nOffice of Civil Rights (OCR) in every way possible. We have written \ncountless letters and met with Rosalind Gray, the Director of the OCR \nto discuss this issue. In addition, in 1998 the Senate included money \nin the agricultural appropriations bill, to deal with this back-log of \ncases.\n  However, despite numerous phone calls and letters, no progress has \nbeen made in resolving these cases. I have invited Department officials \nto come to Montana and speak with the civil rights complainants so that \nwe may solve these cases more quickly. So far, I have not seen enough \naction and not nearly enough closure.\n  The horror stories about the treatment civil rights complainants have \nreceived from the USDA are numerous and unbelievable. These complaints \nare simply being ignored. The inadequacy of this process is adding \ninsult to injury. These people are being put on hold while the USDA \nplods through their cases. Many have been forced to the brink. They \ndon't even know if they can still make agriculture their livelihood \nshould USDA finally decide in their favor. Operating costs alone are \nplacing many producers at a disadvantage. Add to that, the costs \nassociated with filing a complaint and you can see why many feel \ncompletely helpless, and hopeless.\n  I have constituents calling my staff at home because they are on \ntheir last leg. The OCR has continually ignored requests for \ninformation from my staff, or delayed sending pertinent information to \nthese people. Those affected by these decisions cannot afford to waste \nmore precious time listening to the USDA's excuses while they try to \nfind a way to buy next month's food. Allowing these cases to go on for \nyears and years is a travesty. How can these people get on with their \nlife? The USDA has taken away their livelihood. Without equal treatment \nfrom the USDA they can't run their operations. Without a working farm, \nthey have lost everything they had.\n  Secretary Glickman has stated publicly and repeatedly that the civil \nrights issue within the Department of Agriculture is an extremely high \npriority on his agenda. It should be. But still, I have seen very \nlittle action.\n  These constituents cannot get on with their lives until the USDA does \ntake action. My bill will give the OCR 270 days to resolve the \ncomplaint after it has been investigated. If, after 270 days the \ncomplaint is not resolved, the complainant may petition the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ shall then \nconduct a review and make a recommendation to the OCR within 30 days.\n  This law will also broaden the statute of limitations. As I said \nearlier, legislation passed by Congress waived the statute of \nlimitations on certain USDA discrimination cases, giving farmers until \nOctober 21, 2000, to file or re-file cases that allegedly occurred \nbetween 1981 through 1997. However, I want to make sure that civil \nrights cases do not fall through the cracks of that waiver. If an act \noccurred prior to February 22, 1998, for example, that person could not \nfile for discrimination. This legislation will cover that gap.\n  These cases must be resolved soon. These producers have suffered too \nmuch already. They cannot afford to wait any longer. We look forward to \nworking with members of other states affected by this abuse of the \ncivil rights program to resolve these complaints as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2080. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire that food that contains a genetically engineered material, or \nthat is produced with a genetically engineered material, must be \nlabeled accordingly, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           the genetically engineered food right-to-know act\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nGenetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act. This legislation \nrequires that all foods containing or produced with genetically \nengineered material bear a neutral label stating that: ``this product \ncontains a genetically engineered material or was produced with a \ngenetically engineered material.''\n  The bill adds this labeling requirement to the provisions of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Federal Meat \nInspection Act, and the Poultry Products Inspection Act which contain \nthe general standards for labeling foods.\n  Recent polls have demonstrated that Americans want to know if they \nare eating genetically engineered food. A January 1999 Time magazine \npoll revealed that 81% of respondents wanted genetically engineered \nfood to be labeled. A January 2000 MSNBC poll showed identical results.\n  This pressure has already led some companies not to use genetically \nengineered materials in their foods. Gerber and Heinz have said they \nwill no longer use genetically engineered material in their baby food. \nWhole Foods and Wild Oats Supermarkets also have said they will use no \ngenetically engineered material in their own products.\n  Great Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, \nDenmark, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Spain, Austria, Italy, Portugal, \nGreece, New Zealand, and Japan already require genetically engineered \nfood to be labeled.\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\n  If the U.S. wants to sell its genetically engineered food to these \ncountries, it will have to label the food for foreign consumers. It is \nonly fair that American consumers be given similar information.\n  Why do I feel it's important for consumers to know that their food is \ngenetically engineered?\n  First, we don't know whether genetically engineered food is harmful \nor whether it is safe. However, scientists have raised concerns about \ngenetically engineered food. These concerns include the risks of \nincreased exposure to allergens, decreased nutritional value, increased \ntoxicity and increased antibiotic resistance.\n  In addition, scientists have raised concerns about the ecological \nrisks associated with genetically engineered food. Some of those risks \ninclude the destruction of species, cross pollination that breeds new \nweeds that are resistant to herbicides, and increases in pesticide use \nover the long-term.\n  Earlier this year, for example, researchers at Cornell University \nreported that Monarch butterflies were either killed or developed \nabnormally when eating milkweed dusted with the pollen of Bt-corn, a \ngenetically engineered food.\n  Second, the Food and Drug Administration does not require pre-market \nhealth and safety testing of genetically engineered foods. Therefore, \nit is only fair that consumers know they are eating products that have \nnot been tested.\n  Third, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of \nAgriculture do not require substantive environmental review of \ngenetically engineered materials under their jurisdiction.\n  My Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act not only mandates \nlabels, but does something even more important: it authorizes $5 \nmillion in grants to conduct studies into the health and environmental \nrisks raised by genetically engineered food.\n  Specifically, it directs the Secretary of HHS to make grants to \nindividuals, organizations and institutions to study risks like \nincreased toxicity, increased allergenicity, negative effects on soil \necology and on the environment in general.\n  What is the extent of genetically engineered crops today?\n  Last year, 98.6 million acres in the U.S. were planted with \ngenetically engineered crops. More than one-third of the U.S. soybean \ncrop and one-quarter of corn were genetically engineered. This \nrepresents a 23-fold increase in genetically engineered crop production \nfrom just four years ago.\n  And waiting to come into the marketplace are more than 60 different \ngenetically engineered crops--from apples and strawberries to potatoes \nand tomatoes.\n  Providing consumers with information about the foods they eat is \nhardly new.\n  For example, I was proud to be the author of the law to provide for \nthe ``dolphin safe'' label on tuna. The label indicated that the tuna \nwas harvested by methods that don't harm dolphins.\n  I was also proud to lead the fight in the Senate to make sure that \nchicken frozen as solid as a blowing ball could not be labeled fresh. \nAt the time, USDA's position was that frozen chicken could be labeled \n``fresh.''\n  In 1996, I succeeded in amending the Safe Drinking Water Act to \nrequire that drinking water providers give their consumers annual \nreports concerning the quality of their water.\n  Others in Congress led the fight to tell consumers whether their \nproducts contain artificial colors or sweeteners, preservatives, \nadditives, and whether they are from concentrate. I supported those \nlabels as well.\n  Food manufacturers also label their products with information that is \nof little value to consumers. Certain brands of pretzels, for example, \nbear a label which states that the manufacturer is a ``Member of the \nSnack Food Association: An International Trade Association.''\n  I don't think this is information consumers are clamoring for, yet \nthe manufacturer is willing to go through the trouble of putting it on \nthe bag.\n  My legislation builds on the existing food labeling system, and would \nbe simple to implement. It would require that all foods containing or \nmade with genetically engineered foods be labeled with this \ninformation: ``this product contains a genetically engineered material \nor was produced with a genetically engineered material.''\n  For example, corn flakes made with genetically engineered corn would \nbe a ``product that contains'' genetically engineered material. To take \nanother example, milk from a cow treated with genetically engineered \nbovine growth hormone would be a product ``produced with'' genetically \nengineered material.\n  Specifically, my bill requires that food that contains or was \nproduced with genetically engineered material be labeled at each stage \nof the food production process--from seed company to farmer to \nmanufacturer to retailer. The labeling requirement in my bill, however, \ndoes not to apply to drugs or to food sold in restaurants, bakeries, \nand other similar establishments.\n  Genetically engineered material is defined under the bill as material \nthat ``has been altered at the molecular or cellular level by means \nthat are not possible under natural conditions or processes.'' Food \ndeveloped through traditional processes such as crossbreeding is not \nconsidered to be genetically engineered, and the legislation's labeling \nrequirement would not apply to foods produced in that way.\n  Under the bill, persons need not label food if they obtain a written \nguaranty from the party from whom they received the food that the food \ndoes not contain and was not produced with genetically engineered \nmaterial. Persons who obtain a valid guaranty are not subject to \npenalties under the bill if they are later found to have failed to \nlabel food that contains genetically engineered material.\n  For example, a farmer who plants genetically engineered corn must \nlabel that corn. Each person who then buys and then sells that corn, or \nfood derived from it, will also be required to label it as genetically \nengineered.\n  Conversely, farmers who obtain a guaranty that the corn they are \nplanting is not genetically engineered may issue a guaranty to \npurchasers that their corn is not genetically engineered. The purchaser \nthen would not have to label that corn or product made with that corn.\n  If the corn or food is later found to have contained or been produced \nwith genetically engineered material but was not labeled accordingly, \nthe purchaser would not be subject to penalties under the bill.\n  This guaranty system is used today to enforce provisions of existing \nlaw concerning the distribution of adulterated or mislabeled foods. The \nsystem is much less expensive than a system which would require food to \nbe tested at every phase of the food production process.\n  Failure to label food that contains or was produced with genetically \nengineered material carries a civil penalty of up to $1,000 amount for \neach violation.\n  Importantly, the bill provides that if a party fraudulently warrants \nthat a product is not genetically engineered, no party further down the \nchain of custody may be held liable for mislabeling. This provision is \nparticularly meant to protect small farmers from the possibility that \ntheir suppliers would by contract provide that any liability for \nmislabeling be borne by the farmer regardless of the suppliers' own \nactions.\n  The bill also provides another protection for farmers. Under the \nbill, a farmer who plants a non-genetically engineered crop, but whose \ncrop came to contain genetically engineered material from natural \ncauses such as wind carrying pollen from a genetically engineered plant \nis not subject to penalties under the bill. This is the case so long as \nthe farmer did not intend or did not negligently permit this to occur.\n  And, finally, the bill directs the Secretary of HHS to make grants to \nstudy the possible health and environmental risks associated with \ngenetically engineered foods. The bill authorizes $5 million for this \npurpose.\n  In closing, Mr. President, during the recent negotiations on the \nBiosafety Protocol, it was the United States' negotiating position that \ninternational shipments of seeds, grains and plants that may contain \ngenetically engineered material be labeled accordingly.\n  If the United States took the position that it is appropriate to \nprovide this information to its trading partners, shouldn't we make \nsimilar information available to American consumers?\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\n  I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to \nensure the passage of my legislation to give American families the \nright-to-know whether their food contains or was produced with \ngenetically engineered material.\n  I ask that the text of my legislation be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the legislation follows:\n\n                                S. 2080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Food \n     Right-to-Know Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1999, 98,600,000 acres in the United States were \n     planted with genetically engineered crops, and more than \\1/\n     3\\ of the soybean crop, and \\1/4\\ of the corn crop, in the \n     United States was genetically engineered.\n       (2) The process of genetically engineering foods results in \n     the material change of such foods.\n       (3) The health and environmental effects of genetically \n     engineered foods are not yet known.\n       (4) Individuals in the United States have the right to know \n     whether food contains or has been produced with genetically \n     engineered material.\n       (5) Federal law gives individuals in the United States the \n     right to know whether food contains artificial colors and \n     flavors, chemical preservatives, and artificial sweeteners by \n     requiring the labeling of such food.\n       (6) Requirements that genetically engineered food be \n     labeled as genetically engineered would increase consumer \n     knowledge about, and consumer control over consumption of, \n     genetically engineered food.\n       (7) Genetically engineered material can be detected in food \n     at levels as low as 0.1 percent by reasonably available \n     technology.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a program to award grants to improve and \nmaintain sites honoring Presidents of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               presidential sites improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor not only the \nbirthday of our great nation's first president, George Washington, but \nall presidents who followed in his foot steps. I am introducing the \nPresidential Sites Improvement Act of 2000, which would create a new \nand innovative partnership with public and private entities to preserve \nand maintain Presidential birthplaces, homes, memorials, and tombs. Our \nPresidents have contributed so much to our country, and we have much to \nlearn from them. It is fitting that we recognize their contributions as \nleaders of our country.\n  Mr. President, there are numerous sites across the nation that pay \ntribute to our nation's chief executives, but the majority of these \nsites are not owned by the National Park Service. This means that these \nsites generally do not receive federal support. These sites must rely \non donations, state and local assistance, and private endowments to pay \nfor staff, maintenance, and restoration projects. Some of these sites \nhave large endowments for operation expenses. Unfortunately, many other \nsites have a very difficult time making ends meet. In fact, many of \nthese sites delay necessary capital improvement projects because site \nmanagers simply don't have the resources to pay for them. Over time, \nmaintenance neglect will cause these historic sites to slowly fall \napart.\n  I have visited many of the Presidential historic sites throughout my \nhome state of Ohio, a state that has been the home of eight presidents. \nIt is disturbing to see at the Ulysses S. Grant birthplace the \ndiscoloration throughout the house and falling plaster because of water \ndamage. At the home of President Warren Harding, the famous front porch \nwhere then candidate Harding gave his campaign speeches actually began \nto pull away from the house. Fortunately, we were able to obtain the \nfunding to prevent these two historic treasures from deteriorating \nfurther. However, by providing some federal assistance for maintenance \nprojects today, we can help prevent larger maintenance problems \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, these Presidential sites are far too important to let \nthem slowly decay. My legislation would authorize grants, administered \nby the National Park Service, for maintenance and improvement projects \non presidential sites that are not federally owned or managed. A \nportion of the funds would be set aside for sites that are in need of \nemergency assistance. To administer this new program, this legislation \nwould establish a five member committee, including the Director of the \nNational Park Service, a member of the Trust for Historic Preservation, \nand a state historic preservation officer. This committee would make \ngrant recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior. Each grant \nwould require that half of the funds come from non-federal sources. Up \nto $5 million would be made available annually.\n  With this legislation, we can do more than just set one day aside to \nhonor our country's dedicated leaders. We can make a lasting commitment \nto preserve their memory and contributions for generations to come. Our \nchildren and grandchildren should have the opportunity to understand \nthe richness of our country's history. If we do not make efforts to \nmaintain these Presidential sites, we will lose these treasures \nforever. The funds given to these sites would be a great tribute to our \nnation's past and a lasting asset to our nation's future.\n  Our Presidents have shaped this country, so it is fitting that we \nrecognize their contributions as leaders. I invite my colleagues to \njoin me, along with my colleagues from Virginia, Senators Warner and \nRobb, in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Sites \n     Improvement Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are many sites honoring Presidents located \n     throughout the United States, including Presidential \n     birthplaces, homes, museums, burial sites, and tombs;\n       (2) most of the sites are owned, operated, and maintained \n     by non-Federal entities such as State and local agencies, \n     family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, \n     historical societies, historic preservation organizations, \n     and other nonprofit organizations;\n       (3) Presidential sites are often expensive to maintain;\n       (4) many Presidential sites are in need of capital, \n     technological, and interpretive display improvements for \n     which funding is insufficient or unavailable; and\n       (5) to promote understanding of the history of the United \n     States by recognizing and preserving historic sites linked to \n     Presidents of the United States, the Federal Government \n     should provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of \n     Presidential sites.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senators \nDeWine and Warner to introduce a bill aimed at preserving an important \npart of our national heritage. The Presidential Sites Improvement Act \nwill help preserve and protect some of our nation's greatest historical \ntreasures, homes and other places close to the lives of U.S. \nPresidents. Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Virginia is the \nbirthplace and home of some of our most illustrious presidents. We have \nhonored those Presidents by preserving their homes, and we honor our \nhistory by maintaining those homes and using them to educate and remind \nourselves of what has gone before. Mount Vernon, Monticello, and \nMontpelier are famous for providing historic perspective on what the \nnation was like during the years when their owners served our country.\n  Not all Presidential homes are as grand as Mount Vernon, nor were all \nPresidents as well remembered and honored as George Washington. But \neach President has an important place in American history, and their \nhomes and other sites related to their lives, remain an important part \nof our nation's story.\n  Many of these sites are owned by private citizens, small community \norganizations, universities, and historical societies. These \norganizations don't always have the funds available to keep the sites \nin good repair, provide fire protection, handicap access, and develop \ninterpretive displays that teach our nation's history. The Presidential \nSites Improvement Act is aimed primarily at those sites. We want to \nlend a hand to those local organizations and individuals who work to \npreserve the story of individual Presidents in order to preserve the \nstory of America's growth, and America's greatness.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank each of these organizations for \npreserving our country's history, and for providing our generation and \nfuture generations with information on the backgrounds and influences \nthat tie each President to his time in history, and his place in the \nnational mosaic of our great democracy.\n  I am pleased to be an original sponsor of this bill, and I hope the \nSenate will join us in supporting this legislation, and moving it to \nquick passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. L. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2083. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na uniform dollar limitation for all types of transportation fringe \nbenefits excludable from gross income, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  commuter benefits equity act of 2000\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today with Senator Moynihan I \nintroduce legislation that will continue our fight on urban sprawl by \nencouraging the use of public transportation. The Commuter Benefits \nEquity Act of 2000 increases the tax exemption for transit and van \npasses to the same level as parking. Currently, we allow employers to \nprovide up to $175 a month in tax-free parking benefits, but only $65 a \nmonth for transit. This makes no sense when our goal is to reduce the \namount of traffic on our highways.\n  The Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000 raises the limit on transit \nand van passes up to the current limit for parking passes, $175 a \nmonth. Both of these benefits will then be adjusted for inflation \nannually. To ensure that federal employees can also take advantage of \nthis benefit, the bill also eliminates an outdated provision that \ncurrently precludes an employee from cashing out his employer-provided \nparking pass and using an employer-provided transit pass instead. It is \nimportant that federal employees have the same access to public \ntransportation benefits as do private sector employees.\n  While this is but one step towards dealing with traffic congestion \nand the more comprehensive problem of sprawl, it is an important one. I \nwill continue to push for sensible legislation, like this bill, that \ncontinues to improve our quality of life.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about \nthe Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000, which Senator Robb introduced \ntoday. I am proud to join Senators Schumer, Lautenberg, Lieberman, \nDodd, Chafee, Mikulski, Warner, Kerry, and Sarbanes as a cosponsor of \nthis legislation, which will provide substantial tax savings to \nAmerican workers and move commuters out of their cars, off our \ncongested highways, and onto mass transportation systems.\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\n  The Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000 represents the latest in a \ndecade-long series of Federal surface transportation policy reforms \nthat began with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991 (ISTEA). Instead of building highways irrespective of need or \neconomic justification, we have, since ISTEA, turned our focus to \nimproving the mobility of Americans while reversing some of the \nenvironmental degradation caused by highway congestion. We have made \ngreat progress and built formidable constituencies for balanced \ntransportation investments, but arguments over Federal transportation \npriorities extend back to Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. In \nshort, we must remain vigilant.\n  Under current law, employers may permit employees to set aside up to \n$65 of their monthly pre-tax salary to pay for commuting costs. This \nbenefit, known as the transit/vanpool ``qualified transportation \nfringe,'' excludes up to $780 of a worker's annual salary from Federal \nincome taxes and reduces employer payroll taxes while encouraging mass \ntransit usage. If employers prefer, they may choose to offer the \nbenefit in addition to an employee's salary. Under this system, workers \nreceive a Federal tax-free benefit of up to $780 per year, which \nemployers may provide at a far lower cost than a commensurate salary \nincrease.\n  These are sensible measures that promote environmentally sound \ncommuting practices, and reward working Americans. However, a similar \nbenefit exists for employer-provided parking spaces with a monthly cap \nof $175 per month. For many commuters whose companies offer both the \ntransit/vanpool and parking benefits, driving to work can be \nsignificantly cheaper. With this bill, my colleagues and I are stating \nthat the Federal government should, at minimum, treat transit commuters \nand those who drive to work equally. Our proposal is to raise the cap \non the transit/vanpool benefit to $175.\n  A second feature of the bill expands the availability of the transit/\nvanpool benefit to many Federal employees who are precluded from using \nit because of Federal employee compensation law. Specifically, under \ncurrent law Federal employees may not ``cash-out'' their parking space \nbenefit in exchange for either taxable income or the tax-free transit \nand vanpool benefit. This section of the bill permits Federal employees \nto enjoy the same benefits as their private sector counterparts.\n  I believe that this bill is long overdue. Federal tax policy should \nnot encourage people to drive to work, and Federal employees should not \nbe prohibited from enjoying the same tax benefits as other working \nAmericans. In passing this bill, we can institute a measure of fairness \ninto both Federal tax policy and Federal employee compensation. In \naddition, we can reduce automobile congestion and air pollution from \nour highways.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2084. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the amount of the charitable deduction allowable for \ncontributions of food inventory, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE HUNGER RELIEF TAX INCENTIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunger Relief \nTax Incentive Act. The United States is experiencing one of the \ngreatest economic expansions in our nation's history. Our country is in \nthe enviable position of experiencing both strong growth and record low \nunemployment and inflation.\n  Unfortunately, some families have not shared in this rising economic \ntide. Last year, America's Second Harvest food banks, our nation's \nlargest hunger relief network, provided food assistance to 26 million \nneedy people.\n  Food banks and other charities are finding it increasingly difficult \nto meet all of the demand for food assistance. Nearly 1 million needy \nand hungry people were turned away from food banks last year for a lack \nof food, according to Second Harvest. Statistics by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture show that up to 96 billion pounds of food \ngoes to waste each year in the United States. If a small percentage of \nthat food could be captured and directed to food banks, significantly \nmore food would be available to those in need.\n  In the past, food banks have gained donations from the inefficiencies \nof manufacturing. Producing blemished product or manufacturing too much \nmerchandise has provided charities with a steady flow of donations. \nHowever, technology has made businesses and manufacturers significantly \nmore efficient. Although beneficial to the company's bottom-line, \ndonations have lessened as a result. Furthermore, the advent of a \nseconds market, including dollar and value stores, has created \nadditional demand for these over-produced or cosmetically flawed \nproducts, placing another strain on this source of food donations.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I realize the \nimportant assistance provided through federal nutrition programs. \nDuring the debate on welfare reform, I fought for our nation's school \nlunch program, opposing the block granting of such funds in order to \nensure that low income children received at least one nutritious meal a \nday. I also fought successfully to maintain food stamps as an \nentitlement to ensure access to nutritious food for the nation's poor. \nIn 1997, Congressman Lee Hamilton and I sponsored and passed \nlegislation that gave charities that serve the poor preferential access \nto surplus federal property. The Hunger Relief Tax Incentive bill I am \nintroducing today will complement these efforts and spur private \ndonations of food products to food banks and soup kitchens around the \ncountry.\n  Under current tax law, when a corporation donates food to a food \nbank, it is eligible to receive a ``special rule'' tax deduction. \nCongress created the ``special rule'' deduction in the Tax Reform Act \nof 1976 to provide a special incentive for the donation of food to \ncharities that serve the poor. The ``special rule'' deduction allows a \ncompany to deduct the cost (or basis) of the donated product and up to \n\\1/2\\ the mark-up of the product's fair market value. This deduction is \ncapped to not exceed twice the cost basis.\n  Unfortunately, when the ``special rule'' deduction is applied to most \ndonations, companies have found that they do not even recoup their \nactual production costs. Moreover, current tax law limits the ``special \nrule'' deduction to corporations, thus disallowing farmers, ranchers, \nsmall businesses and restaurant owners from receiving the same tax \nbenefits afforded to corporate donors.\n  The Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act will encourage additional food \ndonations with three changes to our current law. First, this bill will \nextend these favorable tax incentives now afforded only to corporate \ndonors of food to all business taxpayers. That means farmers, ranchers, \nsmall business and restaurant owners will benefit through tax \nincentives for their donations of food to hungry people in their own \ncommunity.\n  Second, this legislation will enlarge the tax deduction for donated \nfood to the fair market value of the product, not to exceed twice the \nproduct's cost (basis). Although most companies will continue to recoup \nless than the entire cost of production, the enhanced deduction from \nthe donation and the resulting heightened good-will makes donating food \na more economically sound proposition.\n  Lastly, this bill will codify the Tax Court ruling in ``Lucky Stores, \nInc. v. IRS''. In that case, the Court upheld the right of the taxpayer \nto determine the fair market value of donated food, rather than the \nIRS. I agree that taxpayers are in the best position to determine the \nappropriate fair market value of these products.\n  Mr. President, the Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act will help in our \nbattle to feed needy Americans and I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2085. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act and the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for older Americans \nto remain in the workforce beyond the age of eligibility for full \nSocial Security benefits; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the retired americans right of employment act i\n\n  S. 2086. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security and the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for older Americans \nto remain in the workforce beyond the age of eligibility\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nfor full Social Security benefits; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the retired americans right of employment act ii\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nGregg and Breaux, to introduce two pieces of bipartisan legislation \nintended to encourage older Americans to remain in the workforce. Today \nmore individuals wish to work and are capable of working beyond \nretirement age. Yet our laws discourage such behavior. Our policies \nshould provide productive older Americans with incentives for staying \nin the workforce, paying taxes, and strengthening our economy and \nSocial Security System.\n  The American economy, its workforce, and ensuing retirement patterns \nhave all changed dramatically since Congress passed the Social Security \nAct over sixty years ago. In 1935, when the Social Security retirement \nage was set at age 65, most workers were employed in physically \ndemanding jobs in either the manufacturing or agricultural sectors. The \nphysical strain of work and the resulting health problems made it \ndifficult for individuals to continue to labor past the age of 65. \nFurthermore, most individuals were not expected to live much beyond the \nage of retirement. The life expectancy of individuals born in 1935 was \nonly 61 years.\n  Today's economy and workforce differs greatly from the industrial one \nthat Social Security was designed to augment. The current American \nemployment base is mostly service and technology driven. These sectors \ndo not take as much of a physical toll on workers. Compared with the \n1950's that witnessed 20 percent of the workforce in physically taxing \njobs, today those figures are closer to 7 percent.\n  The health and life expectancy of older Americans also has improved \ndramatically since Social Security was enacted. In the past decade, the \nrate of disability among older Americans has been falling nearly three \ntimes as fast as the previous eight decades. Older Americans are living \nlonger and healthier as a result of improvements in medicine and \ntreatment. According to Frank Williams, a professor of medicine at the \nUniversity of Rochester, the approaching trend for older Americans will \nbe to experience a longer ``health span'' during their retirement years \nand a brief acute illness before death, rather than years of costly, \nchronic disability. Other studies have supported these findings. This \nsuggests that older Americans have the physical abilities to continue \nto work beyond retirement age if they so choose.\n  Unfortunately, laws remain on the books that are designed to penalize \nolder Americans for staying in the workforce past retirement age. We \ncannot afford to discourage older Americans from working. As our \neconomy grows and the baby-boomers approach retirement, productive \nworkers will be scarce. Tapping into the pool of experienced older \nAmericans will be important to continue to improve our economy and \nstandard of living.\n  The two bills I am introducing today each make four changes to our \nlaws in an effort to encourage older Americans to remain in the \nworkforce. The most significant disincentive for working past \nretirement age is the Social Security earnings test and both bills I \nhave introduced would eliminate it. In 2000, the earnings test provides \nthat recipients under age 65 may earn up to $10,080 a year in wages or \nself-employment income without having their Social Security benefits \naffected. Those aged 65-69 can earn up to $17,000 a year. For earnings \nabove these amounts, recipients under age 65 lose $1 of benefits for \neach $2 of earnings, and those aged 65-69 lose $1 in benefits for each \n$3 of earnings.\n  The earnings test was established during a time when our nation \npushed older employees out of the workforce in order to make room for a \nyounger generation. Our economy is in need of all productive workers, \nincluding the growing pool of experienced older Americans. The \nantiquated Social Security earnings test remains an onerous work \ndisincentive for older Americans and it should be eliminated. The \nelimination of the earnings test was one of the recommendations \ncontained in the final report of the 21st Century National Commission \non Retirement Policy.\n  The second provision contained in both pieces of legislation would \nchange the Social Security benefit formula to include all earnings \nyears in the calculation of an individual's benefit, including those \nthat occur after retirement. Under current law, the Social Security \nAdministration determines an individual's retirement benefit by using \nthe average of the top 35 earnings years prior to an individual's \neligibility age. For most people, retirement eligibility occurs at age \n62. This means that for most Americans, those earnings that occur after \nage 62 are not accounted for in an individual's benefit calculation. \nThis anomaly in the law provides a disincentive to work past retirement \nage. Our two bills would address this by including all earnings years \nin the benefit formula. Retirees will be rewarded through a higher \nbenefit for continuing to work and pay taxes.\n  The third provision would make adjustments to the benefit formula for \nthose who retire early and those who delay retirement. The 21st Century \nNational Commission on Retirement Policy recommends adjustments to the \nearly retirement benefit level and the delayed retirement credit to \nreflect more accurately the value of extra taxes paid if retirement is \ndelayed. Actuarial studies have found that the Social Security benefit \nformula is currently weighted to favor those individuals who retire \nearly and against those who delay retirement. These bills adjust the \nbenefit calculation to ensure that there is not a bias in the benefit \nformula that discourages working.\n  Where the two bills differ is in the fourth section, which uses the \ntax code to induce individuals to work past the retirement age. The \nRARE Act I would cut individuals' portion of the FICA tax by 10 percent \nonce they reach full retirement age as an incentive for them to stay in \nthe workforce. Retirees would see their FICA tax cut from 7.65 percent \nto 6.885 percent. Under current law, the Old-Age, Survivors, and \nDisability Insurance (OASDI) is currently funded with a 6.2 percent tax \non employee wages up to $76,200 with a matching contribution by the \nemployer. The Hospital Insurance (HI) or Medicare portion is funded \nthrough a 1.45 percent tax on all wages with a similar employer match. \nBecause FICA taxes are levied on the first dollar of wages earned, this \ntax reduction will benefit all income levels of retirees, including \nthose who choose to work part-time after retirement.\n  The second bill, the RARE Act II, takes a bolder tax cutting \napproach. It would provide individuals who have reached the full \nretirement age with a tax credit equal to the lesser of 10 percent of \nthe amount of income tax owed or the earned income of an individual. \nThis provision would effectively reward older Americans who continue to \nearn and to pay taxes past the age of retirement.\n  Mr. President, the Retired Americans Right of Employment Acts are \nthoughtful pieces of legislation aimed at keeping productive workers \nengaged in our economy and I urge my colleagues to support these \nbipartisan efforts.\n\n

SCHULZ\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who \nspent the first 36 years of his life as a Minnesotan, an artist who \nthrough his work--and his work ethic--illustrated the values cherished \nby the people of my state, and the dreams, ambitions, and even \naggravations of nearly everybody else.\n  Today, I pay tribute to Charles M. Schulz.\n  The ``Peanuts'' comic strip that ran in newspapers worldwide on \nFebruary 13 was meant as a good-bye from the cartoonist to his creation \nand a thank-you to its legions of fans. Instead, it turned out to be a \nfitting farewell to the cartoonist himself when Charles Schulz passed \naway the day before its publication.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I never had the privilege of meeting \nCharles Schulz, but I felt like I knew him anyway. That is a sentiment \nthe artist understood. ``If you want to know me, ready my comic \nstrip,'' he would say to inquiring journalists. So, the journalists \ndid, along with much of the rest of the planet.\n  At its peak popularity, ``Peanuts'' was published in more than 2,600 \nnewspapers in 20 languages in 75 countries, and had 350 million daily \nreaders.\n  The artist's observations on life from a child's point of view were \ninternationally acclaimed. Charles Schulz twice won comic art's highest \nhonor. He was named International Cartoonist of the Year. Adaptations \nof his work garnered Emmy and Tonay Awards, even the prestigious \nPeabody Award.\n  Today, Charlie Brown and his companions can be found everywhere * * * \npopulating Camp Snoopy at the Mall of America, starring in books, TV \nshows, movies, and on the Broadway stage, and gracing everything from \npencils and backpacks to sheets, shoelaces, and greeting cards.\n  All this from a private man who was most content in letting has art \nspeak for itself.\n  Charles Schulz was quite simply the best, most honored, and most \nbeloved cartoonist of the entire 20th century. Success, however, never \ndiminished the enthusiasm he brought to his work or his passion for \ndoing it right; up until the day he retired, he insisted on drawing, \nlettering, and coloring every frame of every cartoon panel himself.\n  ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?'' he \nonce asked. ``The do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them \nif they did not. That is why I draw cartoons.''\n  What most ``Peanuts'' fans--at least those outside of Minnesota--\nprobably do not know is how Charles Schulz came to be a cartoonist. \nWell, that story begins in the Twin Cities.\n  Charles Monroe Schulz was born in Minneapolis on November 26, 1922, \nalthough he spent the majority of his youth across the river in St. \nPaul. An only child, he grew up in an apartment on the corner of Selby \nand Snelling Avenues, above the Family Barbershop owned and operated by \nhis father.\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nCharles Schulz went by the nickname ``Sparky,'' a tribute from his \ncomic-loving father to another popular comic strip character of the \nday. The young boy's interest in cartooning first took hold about the \ntime Charles was six, and was spurred after his graduation from St. \nPaul Central High by a correspondence course ad that read ``Do you like \nto draw?'' His parents paid the $170 tuition in installments, although \nthey may have questioned their investment when the class on drawing \nchildren netted Charles a grade of just C-plus.\n  After serving as an army tailgunner in Europe, Charles Schulz \nreturned to Minnesota and earned his first paycheck as a cartoonist by \nworking on a Catholic magazine feature. He also taught art, and sold 15 \ncartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. He created his first feature for \nthe St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. ``L'il Folks'' was brought in 1950 \nby United Feature Syndicate, christened with a new name, and Charlie \nBrown and ``Peanuts'' debuted on October 2 in seven newspapers. Two \ndays later, Snoopy was introduced to the world.\n  A phenomenon was born.\n  More than a few books, college theses, and critical essays have tried \nto dissect the popularity of ``Peanuts.'' Maybe Charles Schultz himself \nhad the best answer when in a 1994 speech he said, ``There is still a \nmarket for things that are clean and decent.''\n  I have always thought that the ``Peanuts'' gang endured because the \ncharacters were so strongly developed and so genuine that we saw \nsomething we could identify with in each of them.\n  Snoopy was the dreamer, persistently stradding his doghouse in \npursuit of the Red Baron.\n  Lucy, dispensing nickel douses of pop psychology, took great pride in \nher crabbiness.\n  Woodstock was the accident prone one.\n  Peppermint Patty struggled in the classroom, but never struggled on \nthe baseball field.\n  Linus made it all right for us to need a security blanket from time \nto time.\n  Sally, the loveable younger sister, wanted to believe in Santa Claus \nand the Great Pumpkin.\n  Schroeder was the unapologetic artist who loved his music.\n  Pig Pen* * * well, I think we all know a Pig Pen.\n  And Charlie Brown, ``the little round-headed kid,'' was Everyman. We \nrelate to him because at some point in our lives, we all pined for a \nlittle red-haired girl * * * were menaced by a kite-Eating Tree * * * \nand faced down a football we were certain would be snatched away at the \nlast moment. Charle Brown's perpetually upbeat search for happiness was \nour search, too.\n  ``As a youngster, I didn't realize how many Charlie Browns there were \nin the world.'' Charles Schulz said. ``I thought I was the only one. \nNow I realize that Charlie Brown's goofs are familiar to everybody, \nchildren and adults alike.'' No wonder he considered Charlie Brown his \nalter ago. ``There is a lot of myself in his character, too,'' he said.\n  In his art, Charles Schulz could be tender, insightful, sometimes \nsarcastic, heartbreaking, hilarious, and occasionally sentimental. \nAlways, his work was centered in a deep spirituality. Though it \noccasionally drove his fans mad, there was a practical reason why his \ncomics were frequently tinged with pathos. In his 1980 book, ``Charlie \nBrown, Snoopy and Me,'' the artist wrote, ``You can't create humor out \nof happiness. I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me \nsaying, `Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie \nBrown always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?' \nWell, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the \nfootball.''\n  Mr. President, I am proud to co-sponsor legislation offered by my \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, to award Charles Schulz \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. I am pleased our colleagues in the House \nhave already adopted this resolution. While I wish we had accorded the \ncartoonist this great honor in his lifetime, I know that Charles Schulz \ndid not need the endorsement of this Congress to be fulfilled in his \nwork, for how can a congressional honor compare with the love shown to \nhim by his millions of faithful fans?\n  Minnesotans have always considered Charles Schulz one of us, even \nthough he eventually moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he made his \nhome with his wife Jeannie. He was blessed with five children, two \nstepchildren, and several grandchildren, and our prayers are with them \nall.\n  Mr. President, Charles Schulz fretted that his work as a cartoonist \nwould never be considered great art and would certainly not stand the \ntest of time.\n  With all due respect to the cartoonist I honor today, my two-word \nresponse to that is ``Good grief!'' Charlie Brown will undoubtedly live \non long after the rest of us are forgotten. And that, I would argue, is \nexactly the way things are supposed to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S694-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A HEROIC GIFT OF LIFE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my \ncolleagues of a recent act of great charity by one of my constituents, \nMs. Debbie Laakso of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n  In an astonishing act of kindness, the single mother of four donated \na kidney to her friend and former boss, Verle Jucht. The odd twist is \nthat Debbie and Verle met at John Morrell and Company where Verle was \nDebbie's supervisor. Though they separated as colleagues in 1993, they \nsurprisingly remained friends for the last six years. When Verle's \nkidney began to fail last year, Debbie gave him hers. Knowing her \njovial nature, Verle and his wife, Colleen, thought their old friend \nwas kidding when she first offered to donate.\n  Luckily, Debbie and Verle were a match, and after surgery last \nNovember, both are doing well. This story, Mr. President, is a great \ntestament to the truly good and giving nature of people. I rise today \nto thank Debbie Laakso for her good nature and good humor and to \ncongratulate her and Verle Jucht on their bravery and courage. Debbie \nserves as a model of goodness and friendship for all Americans, and \ntheir story is an account for all of the importance of the ``Gift of \nLife.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S694-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S694-S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RELEASE OF SONG YONGYI\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nsafe return of Song Yongyi to his home and family in Carlisle, \nPennsylvania. Mr. Song, Librarian at Dickinson College, was recently \nfreed from a Chinese detention center after a detainment of 172 days.\n  Mr. Song was born on December 15, 1949 in Shanghai where he attended \nelementary and middle school. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, \nhis education was interrupted and Mr. Song became a dockworker. In 1971 \nhe was detained and labeled a ``counter-revolutionary'' for organizing \na book club with four other young people interested in discussing \npolitical ideas. Mr. Song spent five years in detention under harsh \nconditions, where he was severely beaten, resulting in permanent damage \nto his health. After the Cultural Revolution, he was completely \nexonerated of all criminal charges.\n  In 1977 Mr. Song was part of an elite group of students who entered \nuniversity as a result of a competitive, nationwide examination. He \ngraduated from Shanghai Normal University in 1981. He taught Chinese \nliterature for Shanghai educational television until 1987, at which \ntime he became a full-time literary critic and widely recognized \nresearcher. Mr. Song moved to the United States in 1989 and enrolled in \ngraduate school at the University of Colorado, where his wife Helen \n(Xiaohua) and daughter Michelle (Xiaoxiao) joined him in 1990. After \nobtaining a second masters degree in library information science from \nIndiana University, the Song family moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, \nwhere Song Yongyi is employed as Librarian at Dickinson College.\n  Mr. Song's deep interest in the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution and \ngrowing prominence as an expert in the field led him to make research \ntrips to China in the summers of 1998 and 1999. As part of his \nresearch, Mr. Song collected documents concerning the Cultural \nRevolution, which are widely available in markets and curio shops. It \nwas during this most recent visit to China that state security \nofficials detained Mr. and Mrs. Song in Beijing on August 7. For about \none month, Yongyi and\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nHelen were held in a detention center in Beijing and interrogated. They \nwere not allowed to see each other or communicate with the outside \nworld.

Mr. President, well over a decade ago, plant \npathologists at North Dakota State University's Agricultural Experiment \nStation observed signs of a plant disease called Fusarium Head Blight--\nmore commonly known as scab--in a few of the region's wheat fields. \nUpon this discovery, the researchers swung into action, not knowing \nthey were about to do battle with an insidious plant disease which \nwould eventually devastate wheat fields across the Northern Plains \nduring the 1990s. Since 1993, scab has been an ever present scourge. \nLosses to the region's farmers from this cereal crop disease have been \nestimated to be as high as $2.6 billion during the last decade, the \nmost costly plant disease outbreak ever in the United States.\n  Earlier this month, though, some good news was delivered on this \nfront by those researchers who have battled this disease for so long. \nThe North Dakota State University Agricultural Experiment Station \nannounced the release of a new scab resistant spring wheat variety \nnamed Alsen. The new variety is named after the town of Alsen, located \non route 66 in Northeastern North Dakota, an area which was \nparticularly hard hit by this disease.\n  The researchers say that while this variety is not immune to scab, it \ncan fight off the disease. This is excellent progress and welcome news. \nAnd, while this is the first spring wheat variety to exhibit scab \nresistance, it certainly won't be the last.\n  My hat is off to these researchers from North Dakota State \nUniversity! There are many long, tedious, and unglamorous hours \ninvolved in cross-breeding wheat plants. The farmers of the region will \nbe served well by this research, and it is proper and fitting that we \nrecognize the dedicated efforts of those who have contributed their \nlife's work to combat this disease which threatens the livelihood of \nour producers.\n  On behalf of all who are involved with, or impacted by, the \nagricultural economy of the Northern Plains--which includes just about \neveryone living in the region--I am proud to be able to take this \nopportunity to say thank you for a job well done to the researchers and \nsupport staff of the North Dakota State University Agricultural \nExperiment Station.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S695-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BARBARA BUSCH\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan American who has given graciously and unselfishly to her country. \nFor over 36 years, Barbara Busch served this nation with great \ndistinction in her many different capacities at the U.S. Peace Corps: \nfrom a staff assistant when she first began in 1964, to Executive \nOfficer of the Recruitment and Communications Division, to Chief of \nOperations of Volunteer Recruitment and Selection, to Acting Director \nof the Peace Corps. It is truly a story of hard work and dedication.\n  Barbara retired from public service just under one month ago. Mr. \nPresident, I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate her for a \nremarkable career and wish her well as she moves on to the next stage \nof her life. She leaves the Peace Corps with a better understanding of \nits importance and its role in the world than anyone that comes to \nmind. She will be greatly missed.\n  When I had the privilege to serve as Peace Corps Director, Barbara \nwas working in the Office of Planning, Budget, and Finance. She was a \ndiligent worker, excellent manager, and had a wonderful rapport with \nPeace Corp volunteers and returned volunteers alike. She was one of the \nfew, courageous supporters of World Wise Schools, an innovative global \neducation program that provides students in the United States with a \nview of life in countries around the globe. Since its inception in \n1989, more than a million students in all 50 states have ``put a face \non a place'' through World Wise Schools.\n  Back in 1964, when Barbara began her service, the Peace Corps was \noperating in 48 countries. Today, after her 36 years, the Peace Corps \nhas 7,000 volunteers in 78 countries around the globe. It is because of \ndedicated public servants like Barbara that the Peace Corps continues \nto build on its distinguished record of service and continues to \nprovide unique leadership around the world. There is no doubt that \nBarbara embodies the very spirit of the Peace Corps: a strong work \nethic, generosity of spirit, and a commitment to service--the finest \ncharacteristics of the America people.\n  The Peace Corps continues to be the most successful program of its \nkind precisely because of its commitment to serving others. It is this \nlegacy of service and commitment to others that Barbara leaves behind \nand for which she will be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S695-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE HONORABLE IKRAM U.

Khan, M.D.\n  I have had the honor of knowing Ikram for several years and I am \nfortunate we have developed a good friendship. Because of that \nfriendship, I am doubly pleased that Ikram has been appointed by \nPresident Clinton to the Board of Regents for the Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences.\n  This is an extremely prestigious appointment, one that Ikram richly \ndeserves. During his twenty-one years of private practice, he has \nserved not only his patients and the institution of medicine, but also \nhis community and state. He has been honored by his hometown of Las \nVegas and various local organizations for his community service and \nachievements. He has been nominated to serve on Nevada's State Board of \nMedical Examiners and on the state Legislature's Health Care Cost \nContainment committee. On the national scene, Congresswoman Barbara \nVucanovich, in 1993, asked Ikram to adviser her on health care delivery \nissues specific to Medicare, and President Clinton, in 1995, recognized \nIkram for his health care reform efforts. He is a very fine man, and \nhis years of dedication to military medicine and to the health industry \nin general ensures he will perform a great service in this position.\n  Mr. President, I would like to again congratulate my friend, Dr. \nIkram Khan, on his appointment to the Board of Regents and wish him the \nbest on his new challenges managing the Uniformed Services University \nof Health Sciences. I trust the University and Secretary Cohen will \nfind him a valuable asset and a skilled adviser.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S695-4", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S695-S696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL HEART FAILURE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and to \nsalute our Nation's Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has \ndesignated the week of February 13-19 as ``National Salute to \nHospitalized Veterans Week.'' I take this opportunity to pay special \ntribute to those veterans who are currently hospitalized, especially \nthose hospitalized in the Battle Creek, MI, VA Medical Center.\n  These brave people served their country in time of need. Many of them \nwere wounded. Many of them knew others who never came home from battle. \nIt is only right, then, that our nation help them in time of physical \nneed.\n  The Battle Creek VA Medical Center provides an excellent example of \nhow our nation can repay some of the debt it owes our brave veterans. \nThis facility has provided quality care for up to 325 residents at a \ntime for over 75 years. It is an important part of our system of 172 VA \nMedical Centers across the United States, and an important part of the \nBattle Creek community.\n  I know that a festive schedule of special events has been planned for \nthe week long salute. Our veterans, and particularly those who are \ncurrently hospitalized, certainly deserve every tribute we can give to \nthem. And the same goes for the dedicated men and women who care for \nthem.\n  The American people will be forever indebted to our veterans and \ntheir families. Without their sacrifice, dedication, and unwavering \ncommitment to our nation and its ideals, America would not be the \nbeacon of freedom it is today. I ask that you and my colleagues join me \nin saluting the veterans at the Battle Creek VA Medical Center and each \nand every individual who has served with distinction in the U.S. Armed \nForces.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncelebrate the public service of Mary Ford, who recently stepped down as \nthe Mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts. Throughout her 8 years in \noffice, Mayor Ford has elevated the City to one of the jewels of New \nEngland, and I join all of her friends, family, and constituents in \nhonoring her today.\n  As Mayor of Northampton, Ms. Ford oversaw the improvement of the \nschool system, conducted comprehensive infrastructure improvements, \nmodernized city services, and restored fiscal discipline. Perhaps the \nlargest measure of her contributions to the city rests in the fact \nthat, in the course of managing an annual budget of $55 million \ndollars, she erased a $3.2 million deficit. This financial turn-around \nallowed the city to entertain larger goals; the renovation and \nexpansion of Northampton High School, the establishment of an \ninnovative trust to preserve Section 8 assistance, and establishing \nNorthampton as an attractive place to start new businesses.\n  Her leadership on the budget, which includes the general fund, \nschools, and enterprise funds, has been complemented by computerizing \nall the city office's and raising hiring standards. She set the policy \npriorities for all the city's administrative departments, including; \nhousing, health and safety inspection services, planning, culture and \narts, finance, as well as economic and community development. Mayor \nFord orchestrated all of these elements into a cohesive, focused set of \nservices that was delivered in an effective and efficient manner, thus \nimproving the lives of all residents.\n  Due to Mary Ford's leadership, The City of Northampton is now one of \nthe state's thriving, growing cities.\n  The list of her accomplishments on behalf of the city's \nrevitalization is varied and extensive; she improved the city's \nemergency response capabilities by allotting $5.5 million for a state-\nof-the-art firehouse, renovated one third of the city's roads, and \nconducted comprehensive traffic re-designing for increased safety. Her \naccomplishments in education include securing an investment of $25 \nmillion for the modernization of Northampton's high school, a $12 \nmillion middle school expansion program, and work with the entire \nsystem's faculty and staff in implementing staff recommendations, \nreforming curriculum, and increasing parental involvement.\n  She has also shared her expertise in municipal and governmental \naffairs with state and national organizations. From 1995-99, she was a \nmember of the Human Development Committee in the National League of \nCities, a founding member of the Regional Education Business Alliance, \nChair of the Task Force on the Future of State and Local Revenue \nSharing for the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and President of \nthe Women Elected Municipal Officials organization in 1998.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to regard Mary Ford as a friend, colleague \nand partner in maintaining Massachusetts's economic prosperity and \ngrowth. She has performed an enormous task for the City and its \nresidents, and I join with all of Northampton in thanking her for her \nexemplary public service and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S696-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE 110TH FIGHTER WING OF THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nproud achievements of the 110th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard. \nThis group was recently awarded the prestigious United States Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award for meritorious service, an award given to only \nthree Air National Guard fighter wings. I would like to take this \nopportunity to share the history of success of this unit.\n  The 110th Fighter Wing has served America courageously around the \nworld. Recently, the unit conducted flight operations from Aviano Air \nBase, Italy, in support of Operation Joint Guard over Bosnia-\nHerzegovina. During this period, the unit received a grade of \n``Outstanding''--an honor reserved for only the elite forces in the \nU.S. Armed Services--for an Operational Readiness Inspection. This \ndistinction was the first ever given to a Michigan-based unit.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize the service of Col. Ken \nHeaton, USAF, the unit's commander. Under Colonel Heaton's command, the \n110th Fighter Wing has continued its history of excellence with these \nmost recent awards. In the unit's 52-year history, it has been awarded \nthe Air Force Outstanding Unit Award four times.\n  I am proud to have the opportunity to share the accomplishments of \nthe 110th Fighter Wing on the floor of the U.S. Senate. On behalf of \nthe State of Michigan, I congratulate Colonel Heaton and his unit on \ntheir achievements, and I look forward to hearing of this unit's \nlaurels for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S696-4", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S696-S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes \ndiscussing the Agricultural Cooperation Agreement that was signed by \nthe United States and China in December in Seattle. Although the \nnegotiations for this agreement were held at the same time as the \nbilateral WTO accession negotiations between our two countries, this \nagriculture agreement is a stand-alone arrangement. According to its \nown terms, it formally entered into effect when U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Barshefsky and Chinese Trade Minister Shi signed it.\n  This agreement deals with three categories of agriculture products--\nPacific Northwest wheat, meat, and citrus. The agreement requires that \nsound science be used when evaluating agricultural imports into China. \nSpecifically, the agreement ends the decade-long prohibition that China \nhad against importing Pacific Northwest wheat. It provides for US \ngovernment certification of meat packing facilities. And it eliminates \nunreasonable technical barriers to the export of citrus products from \nthe United States to China.\n  On February 11, 52 other Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, \njoined me in sending a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, \ninsisting that China needs to implement the Agricultural Cooperation \nAgreement immediately. We explained to President\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nJiang that now is the time to buy our agricultural products. Words are \nfine. Agreements are fine. But what matters is the result--concrete \ncommercial purchases. I would like to put a copy of that letter, along \nwith a list of the 53 Senators who signed it, into the Record.\n  I am very pleased to announce that a high level Chinese agriculture \ndelegation, including government officials, along with representatives \nfrom COFCO, the China National Cereals, Oils, and Feedstuffs Import and \nExport Corporation, will visit my state of Montana on Wednesday and \nThursday of this week. This is a critical next step in securing the \nimplementation of the agriculture agreement.\n  I will join with Montana agriculture, Montana business, and Montana \neconomic development officials in Great Falls this week to meet this \nimportant delegation, to provide them with information about the \nopportunities Montana presents, and to offer them high quality and \ncompetitive agricultural products and value-added food products.\n  I have been working for over twenty years to expand trade and open \nmarkets overseas for Montana and American agricultural commodities, \nvalue-added agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services. \nIncreasing exports brings benefits to our farmers, our workers, and our \ncommunities, including, of course, in the state of Montana.\n  China represents a market of almost unlimited potential. I have \nworked hard for the last ten years to expand trading relations between \nthe United States and China. This year, I am leading the fight to grant \nChina Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR. The full \nimplementation of this agricultural agreement is a vital part of this \neffort to bring China into the WTO and to ensure that American and \nMontana will take advantage of the unique opportunities in China.\n\n  I look forward to the signing of purchase agreements with China in \nthe near future for Pacific Northwest wheat. Montana and China can help \neach other grow. That is what international trade is all about.\n\n                                                February 11, 2000.\n     President Jiang Zemin,\n     People's Republic of China,\n     Beijing, China.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge full \n     implementation of the bilateral Agricultural Cooperation \n     Agreement that Ambassador Barshefsky and Trade Minister Shi \n     signed in April. Both sides agreed that when they initialed \n     the Chinese version in Seattle last December that \n     implementation would begin immediately.\n       We appreciate that your citrus technical team has completed \n     its visit to the United States. We understand that actions \n     will now be taken to make those changes necessary for \n     American citrus products to be sold to China.\n       We want to stress, however, how important it is that actual \n     sales of wheat, meat, and citrus take place as soon as \n     possible. This would demonstrate to everyone watching our \n     bilateral relationship that this agreement is working. It \n     would also provide a solid contribution to the efforts to \n     ensure the passage of Permanent Normal Trading Relations \n     (``PNTR'') for China.\n       Mr. President, we are entering a new stage in the \n     relationship between our two countries. The sale of product \n     through the Agricultural Agreement will help immeasurably.\n           Yours Truly,\n         Max Baucus, Bob Graham, Kent Conrad, Tim Johnson, Patty \n           Murray, Slade Gorton, Pat Roberts, Larry E.

The activities of the company and its two owners, result not \nonly in participation in the development of community infrastructure \nand resources but also a substantial contribution to economic growth \nand development of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Among its achievements, \nThunder Cloud has recently completed a shelter for homeless children, \nthe Casey Family Building. Following last years devastating tornadoes, \nthe company won a substantial contract to build foundations and \nbasements for twenty-two units of replacement housing.\n  Mr. President, Leonard Lone Hill and Warren Giago of Thunder Cloud \nConstruction richly deserve this honor. After five years in business, \nthey have twenty-two employees on the payroll and annual sales of \n$277,500. Their work has vastly improved the economic landscape of \nPorcupine and the Pine Ridge Reservation, and is a great model for \nother aspiring businessmen to follow. They have overcome many obstacles \nand I look forward to all of their future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S697-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN RECOGNITION OF MOST REVEREND MOSES B.

On February 17, 2000, \nBishop Anderson was honored with the Mother Theresa Duchemin Maxis \nAward in recognition for his many years of dedication and service \nwithin the Archdiocese of Detroit.\n  Serving as Michigan's first African American Catholic Bishop, Moses \nAnderson has ministered to the needs not only of the Catholic \nCommunity, but to the Community of Humankind, since his ordination in \n1958. For the last 40 years, he has served the Catholic Church with \nintegrity and dedication. In addition, he is the recipient of multiple \nhonorary degrees, an enstooled Chief in Ghana, West Africa, and an \ninternationally revered minister and scholar. Currently serving as \npastor at the Church of the Precious Blood in Detroit, his homilies \nhave the distinction of being based in songs portraying the loving \nrelationship between God and humankind. For this reason, Anderson is \nknown as a man of songs as well as an accomplished and beloved \nclergyman.\n  Bishop Anderson's departure from his vicariate duties makes way for \nnew beginnings in his life. I am confident that his future endeavors \nwill be as successful and fulfilling as the previous ones. For certain, \nhe will remain active in his many church and community activities, but \nwill have more time to dedicate to his favorite hobbies--music, organic \ngardening, cooking, and being the ``good shepherd'' he is known to be. \nI am pleased to join his colleagues and friends in offering my thanks \nfor all he has accomplished in making his community a better place.\n  Mr. President, Bishop Moses B. Anderson can take pride in his long \ncareer of service and dedication to the Catholic Church. I know my \ncolleagues join me in saluting Bishop Anderson's commitment to his \ncommunity and religion, and in wishing him well in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S697-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S697-S698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WAYNE HAUSCHILD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

For his remaining forty-six years, Wayne \nHauschild served the community of Brookings in many capacities. For a \nremarkable thirty-nine years, he taught high school U.S. history and \ngovernment. In addition to his teaching duties, he coached high school \nbasketball, football, golf, tennis, and the Brookings Cubs and American \nLegion baseball teams.\n  His government service began as a representative to the South Dakota \nState Legislature where he served five terms from 1971 to 1980. Though \nhe retired from teaching in 1993, he remained a faithful servant of the \npublic, serving as Brookings mayor from 1993 to 1999, presiding over \nBrookings changed to the city manager form of municipal government.\n  Whenever someone mentions Wayne Hauschild, I think of dedication. As \na State Legislator and as Brookings mayor, he was dedicated to \nimproving the lives of his neighbors and his fellow South Dakotans. As \na teacher of thirty-nine years, he was dedicated to educating young \npeople, and ensuring they remember the importance of civic \nparticipation and the lessons of history when that fundamental right is \ndeprived. As a coach, he was dedicated to instilling the values of \nsportsmanship, fairplay, and hardwork. As all these things, he was \nalways a father and a husband, dedicated to his family. I will truly \nmiss him, because, to me, he was always a dedicated friend.\n  Mr. President, this is a sad time where we are forced to bid farewell \nto a man who was a fixture of the Brookings community for the last \nforty-six years. However, this is also a time when we can remember a \ndedicated man who led a truly extraordinary life, no matter the \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/22/senate-section/article/S698-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S698-S702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                                       U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1999\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJim Morhard:\n    Argentina..............................
