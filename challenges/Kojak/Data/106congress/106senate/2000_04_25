Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the case involving young Elian Gonzalez. At 11 o'clock this \nmorning, Senator Lott has scheduled a closed-door proceeding with \nAttorney General Reno, and there are a number of important outstanding \nquestions which, in my view, should be addressed.\n  At the outset, let me make it plain that I believe and have believed \nthat young 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez should have been reunited with his \nfather at the earliest possible time. I believe that as a legal matter \nthere is no real justification for any asylum proceeding to keep young \nElian Gonzalez in the United States. The purpose of asylum is to \nprotect an alien from going back to a country where he or she will be \npersecuted. That certainly is not the case with Elian Gonzalez. He \nwould be adulated.\n  Nonetheless, I believe there are some very serious issues which have \narisen that the Congress ought to address, and the most prominent of \nthose is the manner in which Elian Gonzalez was taken into custody. In \nmy opinion, there were less intrusive ways in which that could have \nbeen accomplished. The Immigration and Naturalization Service said that \nthey proceeded at 5 a.m. because they did not want to have any \ninterference from the crowd. The avoidance of interference from the \ncrowd could have been accomplished at high noon if the crowd were to \nhave been moved back several blocks, which is customary where people \nhave a right to demonstrate, people have a right to express themselves, \nbut they do not have the right to do it right at the location where \nthere may be other interests which have to be preserved. Had the crowd \nbeen several blocks away, there would have been no difficulty in taking \nwhatever action was deemed appropriate without the risk of having a \nproblem with the crowd.\n  Once the Immigration and Naturalization Service agents were directed \nto move in to take custody of young Elian, they had been armed to \nprotect themselves. But the action necessitating their being armed had \nvery great potential for violence. It was a potential powder keg. \nFortunately, there were no serious injuries. But there could have been. \nAnd it is my view that there ought to be a look by the Congress at ways \nto improve these procedures in the future.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Garner v. \nTennessee, issued a ruling involving a Tennessee statute which involved \nlaw enforcement officers using deadly force against a fleeing felon \neven if that felon was unarmed. The Supreme Court of the United States \nheld that this statute was unconstitutional because deadly force may \nnot be used unless it is to save lives or avoid grievous bodily injury. \nNow, the problem with what was done by the INS in moving in with drawn \nweapons at 5 a.m. was that it could have triggered a chain reaction \nwhich could have led to violence. And there was really no necessity. \nThey were not dealing with the customary INS case where they have a \nsuspected terrorist or a violent criminal. This is not a John Dillinger \nwho has to be taken into custody. That matter could have waited another \nday.\n  When I read the morning papers last Friday that the Department of \nJustice was considering moving in to take young Elian Gonzalez, I wrote \nto both the Attorney General and the President and expressed the view \nthat there were a number of less intrusive alternatives which could \nhave been undertaken. And I pressed hard at that time for them to have \na court order.\n  When the President said the Federal court ordered Elian Gonzalez \ntaken into custody, that is not correct. The Court of Appeals for the \n11th Circuit specifically refused to decide and declined to issue an \norder requested by the Department of Justice to have the uncle turn \nover Elian to INS so he could be turned over to the father. The \ndistrict court did not deal with the custody issue either, but only \ndecided that if there were to be an application for asylum, the proper \nperson to make that was the father and not the uncle.\n  On this state of the record, there is a very serious legal issue as \nto what authority the INS had to take Elian into custody. They \ncertainly were not going to take him into custody to deport him because \nthere was an order of the circuit court prohibiting that until the \ncircuit court had decided the case.\n  There is, in my opinion, a need for Congress to take a look at \nanother issue. The Department of Justice, regrettably, does not have a \ngood record at Ruby Ridge or at Waco. I chaired the subcommittee \nhearings on Ruby Ridge which led to a change in the FBI rules on use of \ndeadly force and currently am chairing a special task force of a \nsubcommittee looking into Waco. In the context of what happened at Ruby \nRidge and Waco and what happened with the potential powder keg in Miami \nlast Saturday morning, it is my view the Congress ought to consider \ninstitutionalizing some permanent unit within the Department of \nJustice.\n  The raid, which was conducted at 5 a.m., has the potential--and it is \nhard to determine--of leaving very deep scars on young Elian Gonzalez. \nWhen it occurred, the question came into my mind as to why the father \nwas not at the scene, if not present at the house, but close to the \nscene to assist in soothing young Elian. I think the entire matter \ncould have been avoided had the crowd been cleared, had there been a \ncourt order, had the Government taken up the representation of the \nuncle's lawyer that Elian would be peacefully turned over.\n  In the interim, it is my hope that the proceedings in Federal court \nwill be expedited. I ask unanimous consent that the letters I wrote to \nAttorney General Reno and President Clinton be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, those letters set forth in some greater \ndetail the way those hearings can be expedited. When the Million Man \nMarch occurred in 1998 in New York City, the Federal court ruled on \nAugust 26, and the court of appeals took it up on September 1 and \nissued a 9-page opinion the same day. In the Pentagon papers case, only \n18 days elapsed from the publication of the papers until the case went \nthrough the district court, the court of appeals, and the Supreme Court \nof the United States. I renew my suggestion to the Department of \nJustice to expedite those proceedings.\n  Ultimately, Elian will be returned with his father to wherever they \nchoose to go. I hope they will stay in the United States, but that is a \nmatter for the Gonzalezes to determine. Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the \nfather, having parental responsibility for the child, but these are \nissues as to the use of this extraordinary force and what should be \ninstitutionalized in the Department of Justice, which I think the \nCongress should look into in oversight hearings, not to attach any \nblame but to improve procedures and approaches for the future.\n  Again I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: I am deeply concerned about \n     reports in today's media that you may initiate action through \n     Federal law enforcement agencies to take Elian Gonzales from \n     the residence of his relatives in Miami and return him to his \n     father. My concern arises from the experience at Ruby Ridge, \n     a subject on which I chaired Judiciary\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n     Subcommittee hearings and also on the Waco incident, on which \n     I am now chairing a Judiciary Subcommittee on Department of \n     Justice oversight.\n       In advance of any such action there are a number of \n     alternatives which could be pursued. For example, the Court \n     of Appeals for the 11th Circuit could be asked to expedite \n     the appeals process. There are many precedents for prompt, \n     expedited Circuit Court action such as that taken by the \n     Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit on the Million Man March \n     case in 1998. There, the District Court, by order dated \n     August 26, 1998, allowed the March for September 5 and the \n     Circuit Court heard arguments on September 1, 1998 and issued \n     a written opinion the same day.\n       Another option would be to ask the Court of Appeals for the \n     11th Circuit to hear the case en banc which could be \n     accomplished very promptly.\n       Yet another option is to ask the Supreme Court of the \n     United States to take the case and hear it on an expedited \n     basis which that Court has the authority to do at any time. \n     The Pentagon Papers were published on June 12, 1971. The \n     District Court issued a decision on June 19, the 2nd Circuit \n     heard the case on June 22 and decided the case on June 23. \n     The Supreme Court heard arguments on June 26 and decided the \n     case on June 30, 1971.\n       In a case involving the Iranian hostages, the Solicitor \n     General asked the Supreme Court for the United States for \n     certification before judgment on June 10, 1981. The Supreme \n     Court granted the request on June 11, ordered briefs within \n     one week, heard arguments on June 24 and decided the case on \n     July 2, 1981.\n       There is good reason to believe that the order of the 11th \n     Circuit three-judge panel will be reversed for a number of \n     reasons. One glaring error is that there is no basis for \n     asylum for Elian Gonzales since that relief is granted when \n     the individual faces persecution or some prospective ill \n     treatment upon his return, which is certainly not the case \n     with young Elian. If returned to Cuba, he will be the subject \n     of adulation, not mistreatment.\n       Before resorting to action to take Elian from his Miami \n     relatives, I urge you to seek a judicial order from the \n     United States District Court authorizing such action by the \n     Department of Justice. While perhaps not technically \n     necessary, such an order might well be persuasive enough for \n     the Miami relatives to turn Elian over voluntarily. Such an \n     order may also be persuasive so that others would not impede \n     Department of Justice action to take Elian from his Miami \n     relatives.\n       I am sending a copy of this letter to the President, and I \n     am sending you a copy of a letter I am writing to him.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2000.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: With this letter, I am enclosing a copy \n     of a letter which I am sending to Attorney General Reno \n     suggesting a number of judicial remedies before any action is \n     taken to return Elian Gonzales to his father other than \n     through a voluntary turning over of the boy by his Miami \n     relatives.\n       I am writing to you and the Attorney General without being \n     privy to any of the on-going negotiations, but only because \n     of my concern about what happened at Ruby Ridge and Waco \n     which involved incidents where I have been extensively \n     involved in oversight of the Department of Justice by Senate \n     Judiciary Subcommittees.\n       If there is to be any action taken by Federal law \n     enforcement officials other than a voluntary turning over by \n     the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales, then I urge you to be \n     personally involved and to consult with experts in the field, \n     in addition to officials at the Department of Justice because \n     of the deeply flawed actions taken by the Department of \n     Justice at Ruby Ridge and Waco and in other law enforcement \n     judgments of the Attorney General.\n       As noted in my letter to the Attorney General, the hand of \n     the Federal Government can be considerably strengthened by a \n     District Court order authorizing the Department of Justice to \n     take Elian Gonzales from his Miami relatives and returned to \n     his father.\n       It may well be that taking the potential use of force off \n     the table would materially damage the Government's bargaining \n     position with the Miami Gonzales family; but if force is to \n     be used, it must be used with mature, measured judgment \n     contrary to what was done at Ruby Ridge and Waco.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we just heard a statement from the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania which echoes the statements of many Republicans since \nthe reuniting of Elian Gonzalez with his father. This was a very sad \nsituation. The Attorney General's comments indicate she made \nextraordinary efforts on a personal basis and through the Department of \nJustice to resolve the differences between the members of this family \ninvolving this 6-year-old boy.\n  I am sorry it came to the process that it did in the early hours of \nthe morning on Saturday. I understand up until the very last moment, \nnegotiations were underway with the family, with the very basic goal of \nreuniting this little boy with his father.\n  I will never know what took place in those conversations, but I can \ncertainly understand that when the decision was made to enforce the \nlaw, to enforce the subpoena, and to move forward, those agents who \nwent into that home were entitled to protect themselves. They did not \nknow, going into that home, whether there was any danger inside. The \nfact that they were armed, of course, is troublesome in the presence of \na 6-year-old boy, but I do not believe a single one of us would ask any \nlaw enforcement agent in America--Federal, State, or local--to endanger \ntheir own lives by walking into a building without adequate protection \nand show of force.\n  I hope we will put this in perspective. I have been absolutely \nfascinated by the Republican response to this. To consider some of the \nstatements that have been made by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill \nsince this event in Miami tells us a great deal about their priorities. \nThere is a passion, there is a commitment, there is a sense of urgency \nto drop everything we are doing on Capitol Hill and move into a \nthorough investigation of this episode which occurred in the early \nmorning hours of Saturday to decide whether or not Attorney General \nReno was doing the appropriate thing in the way she approached it.\n  My question to the Republican majority in the Senate and the House \nis: Where is your passion, where is your sense of urgency, where is \nyour commitment when it comes to the gun violence which is occurring on \nthe streets of America every single day?\n  Yesterday, here in our Nation's Capital, families who gathered at the \nNational Zoo for an annual holiday witnessed gun violence which claimed \nsome seven victims, one of whom is now on life support and may not \nsurvive. Yet for a year--one solid year--the Republican leadership on \nCapitol Hill has refused to bring forward any gun safety legislation. \nOvernight they can call for an investigation of Attorney General Reno. \nOvernight they can bring her to Capitol Hill because of this question \nof what occurred in Miami. But for one solid year, they have been \nunwilling and unable to step up and do anything about gun safety to \nprotect children and families across America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No one was injured in the house of Elian Gonzalez's \nrelatives in Miami. Thank God. But kids are injured every day across \nAmerica. Twelve children are killed every day across America because of \ngun violence, and this Republican majority, which has this passion to \ninvestigate, ought to have the passion to legislate, to pass laws to \nmake America safer. I would like to see some proportionality in the way \nthey respond to the real issues facing American families.\n  I yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding to me.\n  This is a very sad chapter. It is a story of a 6-year-old child who \nhas been used as a political football now for some many months--yes, by \nFidel Castro, but also by some in this country--and it ought to stop. \nWhat happened the other morning in Miami is something none of us wants \nto see in this country, but it happened without violence occurring. No \none was injured, and the fact is, a 6-year-old boy was restored to his \nfather's care.\n  I have heard all of the stories and all of the words. I watched \ntelevision last evening. I heard irresponsible statements about Waco, \nabout storm troopers, all kinds of conjecture about secret meetings \nbetween Fidel Castro and officials in this country. Look, those things \nserve no purpose at this point.\n  This is a 6-year-old boy whose mother died and who now has been \nrestored to the care of his father. Are there\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nthose here who believe that a 6-year-old boy whose father loves him \nshould not be restored to the care of his father? If so, then let's \nhave a long debate about parental rights. I suspect they do not want to \nrestore this young boy to the care of his father because his father is \na Cuban and he will go back to Cuba and that is a Communist country. \nBut I do not see people coming to the floor of the Senate talking much \nabout the fate of the children in Vietnam--that is a Communist \ncountry--or the fate of the children in China--that is a Communist \ncountry.\n  All of a sudden, this one 6-year-old child whose mother is dead and \nwhose father wants him, because he comes from Cuba, does not have the \nright to be restored to the care of his father? Something is wrong with \nthis.\n\n  I understand there is great passion on all sides. The Attorney \nGeneral was faced with an awful choice, and she made a choice. The \nchoice she made was to use whatever show of force was necessary--not \nforce; show of force was necessary--to prevent violence while they were \nable to get this boy and restore him to the care of his father.\n  The fact is, it worked. In a little under 3 minutes, they were able \nto get this boy. This boy, now we see in a smiling picture, is in his \nfather's arms where he ought to be.\n  I know we can criticize Janet Reno and others till the Sun goes down \nand every day thereafter, but it is not going to change the fact that \nthis boy belongs with his father. We all know that. We should not use \nthis boy for some broader political purpose of U.S.-Cuba relations, \nanti-Castroism, this, that, or the other thing. This is not about Fidel \nCastro. This is about a 6-year-old child and his father.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to hear both of my distinguished colleagues \ntalking about the necessity to protect those who go into a situation \nsuch as that. In an earlier career in law enforcement I had the \nexperience of going on raids or arrests or hostage situations, \noftentimes in the middle of the night. They are a very frightening \nthing.\n  I suspect those immigration officers and marshals also have families \nwho worry about whether they are going to come back alive. They are \nentitled to some protection, too. They talk about a frightening picture \nof a man so intimidating that everybody would stand still. His finger \nwas not on the trigger of his gun. If you look at the picture, the \nsafety was on the weapon. An unarmed female INS officer, with no body \narmor or anything else, came in there, putting her own life at risk so \nthe little boy would not be frightened when she picked him up. And she \nspoke to him in Spanish.\n  The Miami relatives could have avoided this. The Miami relatives took \na position they wanted to help little Elian and hurt Fidel Castro. They \nhelped Fidel Castro and hurt little Elian. They should have given him \nback to his father long ago. Instead, they made this whole situation \nnecessary.\n  The officers who went in there are entitled to protect themselves. If \nI were their spouse, if I were their child, I would hope that they \nwould. Then to accuse them of brainwashing or drugging this little boy \nis scandalous. These marshals, who took the little boy into their \ncustody, are sworn to give their own life, if necessary, to protect the \nperson they have in their custody.\n  They were there to protect the little boy. They did protect the \nlittle boy. He is now back with his father where he belongs.\n  I resent the statement of some of the Miami relatives saying these \npictures of a happy child with his father are doctored, that it is not \nreally little Elian, that they substituted someone else for him, or \nthat the marshals drugged him. One relative even said the only reason \nhe called his father from the airplane was because they put a gun to \nhis head. This is outrageous.\n  These brave men and women, who constantly put their lives on the line \nto protect the people of this country, including oftentimes Members of \nCongress, ought to be praised.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Twenty seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me close by saying I hope we will see the same \npassion, the same commitment, the same sense of urgency from the \nRepublican side when it comes to gun safety legislation, when it comes \nto legislation for a Patients' Bill of Rights, when it comes to a \nprescription drug benefit, as we have seen in their passion to continue \nto investigate every member of the Clinton administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2820-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2820-S2832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES TO \n   PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 12:30 p.m. shall be equally \ndivided between the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is a historic time because we are about \nto commence a debate on an amendment that has passed through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee but has not yet come to the floor of the Senate; \nthat is, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to protect the rights of \nvictims of violent crime.\n  I am very pleased this morning, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein \nof California, to be making the primary case in support of this \namendment.\n  I would like to make some opening remarks and then turn our opening \ntime over to Senator Feinstein for a discussion of the history of this \namendment and much of the articulation of the need for it. But let me \nmake a few preliminary comments.\n  First of all, we have heard a little bit about passion on a related \nmatter. I can tell you there is nothing about which I am more \npassionate these days than supporting the rights of victims of violent \ncrime.\n  According to the Department of Justice, there are over 8 million \nvictims of violent crime in our society every year. Not enough is being \ndone to protect the rights of these victims. They have no \nconstitutional rights, unlike the defendants. Those accused of crime \nhave more than a dozen rights which have been largely secured by \namendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n  They, of course, trump any rights that States, either by statute or \nState constitutional provision, grant to the victims of crime.\n  It is time to level the playing field, to balance the scales of \njustice, and provide some rights for victims of crime. These are very \nbasic and simple rights, as Senator Feinstein will articulate in just a \nmoment.\n  To secure basic rights to be informed and to be present and to be \nheard at critical stages throughout the judicial process is the least \nthat our society owes people it has failed to protect.\n  Thirty-two State constitutional amendments have been passed by an \naverage popular vote of nearly 80 percent. Clearly, the American people \nhave developed a consensus that the rights of crime victims deserve \nprotection.\n  Unfortunately, these State provisions have not been applied with \nsufficient seriousness to ensure the protection of these victims of \ncrime.\n  Let me note some quotations, first from the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, and then from attorneys general--these are the law \nenforcement officials of our country--and the Governors, who, of \ncourse, are the chief executives of the various States.\n  Attorney General Reno explained, in testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee:\n\n       Efforts to secure victims' rights through means other than \n     a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully \n     adequate. Victims' rights advocates have sought reforms at \n     the State level for the past 20 years. However, these efforts \n     have failed to fully safeguard victims' rights. These \n     significant State efforts simply are not sufficiently \n     consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative to safeguard \n     victims' rights.\n\n  Legal commentators have reached the same conclusion.\n  For example, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has explained that \nthe existing statutes and State amendments ``are likely, as experience \nto date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever \nthey come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional \nindifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an accused's rights \nregardless of whether those rights are genuinely threatened.''\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\n  According to a December 1998 report from the National Institute of \nJustice, the victims are denied their rights. The report concluded \nthat:\n\n       Enactment of state laws and state constitutional amendments \n     alone appear to be insufficient to guarantee the full \n     provision of victims' rights in practice.\n\n  The report went on to note numerous examples of how victims were not \ngiven rights they were already supposed to be given under State \nprovisions.\n  For example, even in several States identified as giving strong \nprotection to victims' rights, fewer than 60 percent of the victims \nwere notified of the sentencing hearing, and fewer than 40 percent were \nnotified of the pretrial release of the defendant. That can be a \nserious matter to a victim of crime. A followup analysis of the same \ndata found that racial minorities are less likely to be afforded their \nrights under the patchwork of existing statutes.\n  According to a letter, dated April 21 of this year, signed by 39 of \nthe State attorneys general:\n\n       We are convinced that statutory protections are not enough; \n     only a federal constitutional amendment will be sufficient to \n     change the culture of our legal system.\n\n  A 400-page report by the Department of Justice on victims' rights and \nservices concluded that:\n\n       [t]he U.S. Constitution should be amended to guarantee \n     fundamental rights for victims of crime.\n\n  The report continued:\n\n       A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only \n     legal measure strong enough to rectify the current \n     inconsistencies in victims' rights laws that vary \n     significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the state \n     and federal levels.\n\n  For those who are concerned that somehow a Federal constitutional \namendment would impinge upon States rights other than noticing, of \ncourse, that 75 percent of the States would have to approve such a \nconstitutional amendment for it to go into effect, let me refer to a \nresolution of the National Governors' Association, which passed by a \nvote of 49-1, strongly supporting a constitutional amendment.\n  It stated:\n\n       Despite . . . widespread state initiatives, the rights of \n     victims do not receive the same consideration or protection \n     as the rights of the accused. These rights exist on different \n     judicial levels. Victims are relegated to a position of \n     secondary importance in the judicial process.\n\n  The resolution also stated:\n\n       The rights of victims have always received secondary \n     consideration within the U.S. Judicial process, even though \n     states and the American people by a wide plurality consider \n     victims' rights to be fundamental. Protection of these basic \n     rights is essential and can only come from a fundamental \n     change in our basic law: the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  That is it. Despite the well-meaning intention of judges, \nprosecutors, and others who fundamentally agree that victims need these \nrights of basic fairness in our criminal justice system, as the \nevidence has overwhelmingly demonstrated, they are just not getting \nthat kind of fair treatment, despite the best efforts of all these \npeople. That is why, after 18 years, the conclusion has been reached by \nso many that the only way to guarantee these rights is by placing them \nin the U.S. Constitution where defendants' rights have also been \namended into existence.\n  We all know it shouldn't be easy to amend the Constitution, but we \nhave been very careful to communicate with prosecutors and others who \nare familiar with the issues. After 63 drafts, we think we have it \nright. We think we have a very tightly drawn amendment, which Senator \nFeinstein will explain in just a moment, that protects these rights \nwithout denigrating whatsoever the rights of the defendants or those \naccused of crime.\n  Our amendment has 42 cosponsors in this body, a bipartisan group of \nDemocrats and Republicans. We have 39 State attorneys general who have \nsigned a strong letter in support. Our Presidential candidates, both \ncurrent and past, have strongly supported a crime victims' rights \namendment, as have groups such as Parents of Murdered Children, Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, \nand others.\n  I thought it would be appropriate to recognize the President of the \nUnited States, who said in a very strong statement before a number of \ncrime victims' rights groups:\n\n       I strongly believe that victims should be central \n     participants in the criminal justice system, and that it will \n     take a constitutional amendment to give the rights of victims \n     the same status as the rights of the accused.\n\n  He also said the following, which I think represents the views of all \nof us in this body:\n\n       I do not support amending the Constitution lightly; it is \n     sacred. It should be changed only with great caution and \n     after much consideration. But I reject the idea that it \n     should never be changed. Change it lightly and you risk its \n     distinction. But never change it and you risk its vitality.\n       But this is different. This is not an attempt to put \n     legislative responsibilities in the Constitution or to \n     guarantee a right that is already guaranteed. Amending the \n     Constitution here is simply the only way to guarantee the \n     victims' rights are weighed equally with defendants' rights \n     in every courtroom in America.\n\n  Mr. President, that is all we ask.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record three pages of groups \nthat strongly support our amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Crime Victims' Rights Amendment Supporters\n\n\n                            public officials\n\n       42 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate (29R; 13D), Former Senator \n     Bob Dole, Representative Henry Hyde, Texas Governor George W. \n     Bush, California Governor Gray Davis, Arizona Governor Jane \n     Hull, Former U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese, Former U.S. \n     Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Former U.S. Attorney \n     General William Barr, The Republican Attorneys General \n     Association, Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, Alaska \n     Attorney General Bruce Botelho, Arizona Attorney General \n     Janet Napolitano, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, \n     Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar, Connecticut Attorney \n     General Richard Blumenthal, Delaware Attorney General M.

In terms of specific letters of support and so on, we will \nhear about that at a later time.\n  I conclude my statement by saying it has been a great pleasure for me \nto work on a bipartisan basis with Senator Dianne Feinstein who, as \nhave I, has spent the better part of 4 years honing and crafting this \namendment, working with victims' rights groups, visiting with fellow \nSenators, Members of the House of Representatives, representatives of \nthe White House, the Department of Justice, and many others in an \neffort to ensure that the amendment we present to the Senate today is \nthe very best possible product we could present.\n  We are always open to more suggestions. We have never closed the door \nto additional suggestions by people who in good faith wish to make sure \nthis amendment will do what we want it to do, without, of course, \ntaking away the rights of defendants. We remain committed to that \nproposition.\n  Over the next several days, obviously, we will hear from opponents. \nWe are delighted to hear their comments and to visit with them about \nsuggestions they may have. At the end of the day, as all of the \nstatements I have read suggest, there is no alternative. There is only \none way to protect the victims of violent crime; that is, through \nadoption of a Federal constitutional amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, had the Senator from Arizona completed his \nremarks?\n  Mr. KYL. I have completed my opening statement. I don't think there \nis a specific agreement. The time is divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between Senator \nKyl and Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, normally I would speak at this point, under \nthe usual procedure, following the majority floor leader. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from California wishes to speak. I will not \nfollow the normal procedure and speak but allow her to go forward. Then \nI will claim the floor after her speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank our ranking member for this \nopportunity. It gives an opportunity for the Senator from Arizona and \nme to explain the amendment. I very much appreciate that.\n  Providing constitutional rights for victims of violent crime has been \nat the top of my list of priorities as a Senator from California. I \nwill take a few moments to explain why.\n  I thank our colleague, Senator Kyl, for his leadership in bringing \nthis issue to the forefront and working so closely with me in a \nbipartisan way over the past 4 years through two Congresses. I believe \nthis is what voters sent us here to do, to work together, Republicans \nand Democrats, House and Senate, to find solutions to the problems \nordinary Americans face every day. Indeed, ordinary Americans do find \nproblems in the criminal justice system.\n  There were about 9 million victims of violent crimes in 1996, when we \nbegan this effort, and each of the 4 years since that time in the \nUnited States. Many of these victims were actually victimized a second \ntime by the criminal justice system. They were kept in the dark about \ntheir case. They were excluded at the trial. They were unable to \nexpress their concerns for their safety when a decision was made to \nrelease their attacker. It is for these victims we are fighting for \nthis amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  There are those who say the Constitution is a static document; it is \na perfect document; it should not be changed. There are those who say \nit should not be changed easily. There are those who say it should not \nbe changed without need. We are in the latter two. We believe we have a \nserious amendment, and we believe we can demonstrate the need for this \nchange.\n  The amendment we propose today meets a situation, the situation that \nwhen the Constitution of the United States was written in 1789, there \nwere but 4 million people in 13 colonies. Today we are over 250 million \npeople, and victims of violent crimes alone amount to over 9 million a \nyear.\n  When the Constitution was written, it was a different day. In 1791, \nthe Bill of Rights was written. Between the text of the Constitution \nand the text of the Bill of Rights, a number of rights were provided to \nthe accused, rights to protect them against an overeager, overzealous, \nand overambitious Government. We all know what they are: The right to \ncounsel, to due process, to a speedy trial, against double jeopardy, \nagainst self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures, \nthe right to have warrants issued upon probable cause, the right to a \njury of peers, the right to be informed, and so on.\n  Victims were entirely left out, and when the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights were written in 1789 and 1791, there were essentially no \nrights provided to victims in the United States. There was good reason \nfor it. I want to say why that took place.\n  When the Constitution was written, in America in the late 18th \ncentury and well into the 19th century, public prosecutors did not \nexist. Victims could, and did, commence criminal trials themselves by \nhiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant, initiating a private \nprosecution. The core rights of our amendment to notice, to attend, to \nbe heard were inherently made available to a victim of a violent crime. \nAs Juan Cardenas, writing in the Harvard journal of law and public \npolicy, observed:\n\n       At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the \n     prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as \n     their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often \n     hired a prosecutor.\n\n  Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private \nprosecution. With the explosive growth of crime in this country in \nrecent years, it became easier and easier for the victim to be left \naside in the process.\n  As other scholars have noted:\n\n       With the establishment of the prosecutor the conditions for \n     the general alienation of the victim from the legal process \n     further increased.\n\n  Mr. President, this began to happen in the mid 19th century, around \n1850, when the concept of the public prosecutor was developed in this \ncountry for the first time.\n\n       The victim is deprived of his [or her] ability to determine \n     the course of a case and is deprived of the ability to gain \n     restitution from the proceedings. Under such conditions, the \n     incentives to report crime and to cooperate with the \n     prosecution also diminished. As the importance of the \n     prosecution increases, the role of victim is transformed [in \n     our country] from principal actor to a resource that may [or \n     may not] be used at the prosecutor's discretion.\n\n  Those aren't my words; those are words of Fredric Dubow and Theodore \nBecker in ``Criminal Justice and the Victim.''\n  So we see why the Constitution must be amended to guarantee these \nrights. There was no need to guarantee them in 1789 and 1791, when the \nBill of Rights was added. We see that the criminal justice system has \nchanged with the\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nevolution of the concept of the public prosecutor, and we see that \nAmerica has changed. The prevalence of crime has changed. The number of \nvictims has changed. So creating the need and circumstance to respond \nto these developments and to restore balance in the criminal justice \nsystem by guaranteeing certain basic rights of violent crime victims in \nthe United States is what we seek to do.\n  Those rights would be as follows: The right to notice of proceedings; \nthe right not to be excluded from proceedings; the right to be heard at \nproceedings, if present; the right to submit a statement; the right to \nnotice of release or escape of an attacker. For me, that is a central \npoint and how I got involved in this movement. Also, there is the right \nto consideration in ensuring a speedy trial; the right to an order of \nrestitution ordered by a judge; the right to consideration of safety in \ndetermining any conditional release. Those are basic, core rights that \nwe would give to a victim of violent crime to be balanced against the \nrights of the accused.\n\n  Senator Kyl mentioned that among our supporters are Prof. Laurence \nTribe of the Harvard Law School. Professor Tribe is a noted \nconstitutional expert. Let me quote portions of his testimony from the \nHouse hearing on the amendment:\n\n       The rights in question--the rights of crime victims not to \n     be victimized yet again through the processes by which \n     government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and \n     release the accused or convicted offender--are indisputably \n     basic human rights against government, rights that any \n     civilized system of justice would aspire to protect and \n     strive never to violate.\n       Our Constitution's central concerns involve protecting the \n     rights of individuals to participate in all those government \n     processes that directly and immediately involve those \n     individuals and affect their lives in some focused and \n     particular way. . . . The parallel rights of victims to \n     participate in these proceedings are no less basic, even \n     though they find no parallel recognition in the explicit text \n     of the U.S. Constitution.\n       The fact that the States and Congress, within their \n     respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative \n     authority to enact rules protecting these rights is. . .not a \n     reason for opposing an amendment altogether. . . . The \n     problem, rather, is that such rules are likely, as experience \n     to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection \n     whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, \n     traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an \n     accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are \n     genuinely threatened.\n\n  Now, some people would say, ``Let's pass another Federal statute.'' \nTo them, I say: Been there, done that. We did that twice--in the case \nof the Oklahoma City bombing--and the judge ignored the Federal statute \nboth times. According to the FBI, 98.4 percent of violent crimes are \nprosecuted in State courts. So why a Federal statute won't work is that \neven the broadest Federal statute would affect only 1 percent of the \nvictims of violent crimes in this Nation. And then that statute could, \nin effect, be trumped at any time by the constitutional amendment \nprovided to the accused.\n  The attorneys general of 37 States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin \nIslands have all signed a letter with this statement:\n\n       We are convinced that statutory provisions are not enough. \n     Only a Federal constitutional amendment will be sufficient to \n     change the culture of our criminal justice system.\n\n  Let me tell you, very personally, why I believe this to be very \nnecessary. Let me take you back to my life in San Francisco in the \n1970s. In 1974, in my home city, a man by the name of Angelo Pavageau \nbroke into the house of Frank and Annette Carlson in Portrero Hill. Mr. \nPavageau tied Mr. Carlson to a chair, murdered him by beating him with \na hammer, a chopping block, and a ceramic vase. He then repeatedly \nraped Annette Carlson, who was 24 years old, breaking several of her \nbones. He slit her wrists and tried to strangle her with a telephone \ncord before setting their home on fire and leaving them to go up in \nflames.\n  But Mrs. Carlson survived the fire; she lived and she testified \nagainst her attacker. That testimony sent him to prison where he \nresides, I believe, to this day. But she has been forced to change her \nname. She lives anonymously and she continues to live in fear that one \nday her attacker may be released and come back after her.\n  When I was mayor of San Francisco, she called me several times to \nnotify me that she had found out that he was up for parole, and she \nbegged me to do what I could to see that she would know if he was \nreleased so she could protect herself. Amazingly, it was up to her to \nfind this information. The system did not provide it.\n\n  I believe no American citizen should have to live out of fear that \ntheir attacker will be released from jail or from prison without their \nnotice. That is a basic right provided by this measure.\n  In 1979, a killing occurred which galvanized the victims' rights \nmovement in California. A young woman named Catina Rosa Salerno was \nmurdered on her first day of school at the University of the Pacific in \nStockton. The killer was an 18-year-old, Steven Jones Burns, Catina's \nhigh school sweetheart and a trusted family friend. After shooting her, \nBurns went back to his dorm room to watch Monday night football. He \ncould see her as she bled to death outside his window.\n  During the trial, the family was not allowed in the courtroom and had \nto sit outside waiting for news. The murder of Catina had a profound \nand lasting effect on the family. Her mother, Harriet, and her father, \nMichael, cofounded Crime Victims United, one of California's more \noutspoken groups for victims' rights, and the family has since that day \nworked tirelessly to educate the public about the rights of crime \nvictims.\n  These cases helped California become the first State in the Nation to \npass a crime victims' constitutional amendment, an amendment to the \nState Constitution of California, Proposition 8, in 1982. It gave \nvictims the right to restitution, the right to testify at sentencing, \nprobation, and parole hearings, established a right to safe and secure \npublic school campuses, and made various changes in criminal law. It \nwas a good start.\n  Since that time, a total of 32 States have passed constitutional \namendments to provide victims of crime with certain basic rights. All \nof them have passed by substantial margins--Alabama, 80 percent; \nConnecticut, 78 percent; Idaho, 79 percent; Illinois, 77 percent; \nIndiana, 89 percent; Kansas, 84 percent. Some States passed them by \nconstitutional convention: South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, \nVirginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  What is wrong with that? What is wrong is the paperwork quilt of \ndifferent rights provided by different State Constitutions. The \nremaining States--18 of them--provide no basic rights for a victim of a \nviolent crime. We provide a basic core of rights--of notice, of \npresence, to be heard, to be noticed of an attacker's release, to \nrestitution if ordered by a judge--eight certain, basic, core rights \nthat exist for every victim of a violent crime throughout the United \nStates. For the first time in history, the Constitution would recognize \na victim has core basic rights, that those rights are present in the \nConstitution, and that the victims are free to exercise those rights.\n  In summary, I know this amendment is controversial. I know there are \nthose who will say these State amendments are enough. I want to give a \nfew examples of why the State amendments are not enough.\n  Maryland has a State amendment. But when Cheryl Rae Enochs Resch was \nbeaten to death with a ceramic beer mug by her husband, her mother was \nnot notified of the killer's release 2\\1/2\\ years into the 10-year \nsentence. The mother was not given the opportunity to be heard about \nthis release--in violation of the Maryland constitutional amendment.\n  Arizona has a State constitutional amendment, but an independent \naudit of victim-witness programs in four Arizona counties, including \nMaricopa County, where Phoenix is located, found that victims were not \nconsistently notified of hearings; they were not conferred with by \nprosecutors regarding plea bargains; they were not consistently \nprovided with an opportunity to request postconviction notification.\n\n  Ohio has a State amendment. But when the murderer of Maxine Johnson's \nhusband changed his plea, Maxine was not notified of the public hearing \nand was not given the opportunity to testify at his sentencing as \nprovided in Ohio law.\n  A Justice Department-supported study of the implementation of State\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nvictims' rights amendments released earlier this year made similar \nfindings:\n\n       Even in States with strong legal protections for victims' \n     rights, the Victims' Rights study revealed many victims are \n     denied their rights. Statutes themselves appear to be \n     insufficient to guarantee the provision of victims' rights.\n\n  The report goes on:\n\n       Nearly two-thirds of crime victims, even in states with \n     strong victims' rights protection, were not notified that the \n     accused offender was out on bond.\n\n  Therefore, the victim had no opportunity to protect himself or \nherself.\n\n       Nearly one half of all victims, even in the strong \n     protection states, did not receive notice of the sentencing \n     hearing--notice that is essential if they are to exercise \n     their right to make a statement at sentencing.\n\n  Finally:\n\n       A substantial number of victims reported they were not \n     given an opportunity to make a victim impact statement at \n     sentencing or parole.\n\n  State amendments are not enough. The reason a Federal statute will \nnot work is that it has not worked before and our area of coverage is \ntoo small. The best Federal statute we could pass would cover but 1 \npercent of victims of violent crimes in this Nation.\n  That leaves but one remedy. It is a difficult remedy. It takes time. \nIt imposes an act of conscience on every Member of this body and the \nother body who believes the Constitution of the United States should \nnot be amended: Is it worthy to make this amendment to afford the \nvictim of a rape attack, the victim of an attempted murder attack, with \nthe notice as to when that individual is going to be released from jail \nor prison? I think it is.\n  Is this a worthy enough cause so that an individual can at least be \nnoticed when a trial is going to take place, can at least be present, \ncan at least make a statement, can at least have an order of \nrestitution if ordered by a judge, and to at least have notice of these \nbasic rights? I think so.\n  I don't believe the Constitution of the United States was written \npurposefully to exclude victims. The victim was part of the trial. The \nvictim brought the trial. The victim brought the investigation. The \nvictim was present in court. And our country functioned that way until \nthe mid-19th century and the evolution of the public prosecutor.\n  The only way to remedy this significant omission, I contend, is to \namend the Constitution of the United States and at long last show the \nConstitution is, in fact, a living document, that it does expand to \ntake into consideration the evolution of circumstances within our \ncountry. This cannot be done, it cannot be achieved, without an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the people who have followed the victims' \nrights amendment closely know that I voted for this measure in the \nJudiciary Committee, and that I did so despite some reservations about \nits provisions and its language. No one has worked harder on this issue \nthan the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information--\nSenator Jon Kyl. He has been a tireless advocate for victims rights, \nand has done more than most will ever appreciate to make the Senate's \nconsideration of this proposed resolution a reality. Both he, and his \nlead cosponsor and ranking member on the Subcommittee, Senator Dianne \nFeinstein, are to be commended. Frankly, they--and the committed \nnetwork of victims' advocates--are why we are here today. It is because \nof their tireless commitment to this measure that I will vote to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of S.J. Res. 3. I \nshould be clear, however, that I do so with some reservations \nconcerning the proposed text of the amendment. But I hope my concerns \ncan be addressed during the floor debate on the resolution.\n  Among my reservations are:\n  Its scope: the amendment's protections apply only to violent crimes;\n  Its vagueness: some of its definitions are unclear and will be \nsubject to too much judicial discretion; and\n  Its effects on principles of federalism: the proposed amendment could \npave the way for more federal control over state legal proceedings.\n  Given my reservations, some of my colleagues have asked how I could \nnevertheless approve the Senate's consideration of S.J Res. 3. I'd like \nto explain, beginning with a little background on the origins of the \ncriminal justice system.\n  Our Constitution provides the backbone for what has unquestionably \nevolved into the best criminal justice system that has ever existed on \nEarth. Decent and thoughtful people have worked for over two hundred \nyears writing and re-writing the statutes, case law, rules and \nprocedures that guide the judges and lawyers who run the system. Those \nlaws and rules have, by and large, kept the courts appropriately \nfocused on the twin goals of seeking the truth and protecting the \naccused from arbitrary or unreasonable government actions.\n  Although our criminal justice system is the best, it is not perfect. \nThere are many ways in which it could improve. One of the most \nimportant areas needing improvement is the manner in which the criminal \njustice system treats victims of crime.\n  The fact that the drafters of the Constitution did not include \nspecific rights for victims of crime is not surprising. At that time, \nthere was no need for such rights because victims were parties to the \nlegal actions against their perpetrators. There was no such thing as a \npublic prosecutor; victims brought cases against their attackers. When \nthe Constitution was drafted, victims of crime were protected by the \nsame rights given to any party to litigation.\n  The rights of victims were dramatically altered--along with the rest \nof the criminal justice system--with the advent of government-paid \npublic prosecutors in the mid-1800s. Since then, the government, not \nthe victim, has been the party litigating against criminals in court. \nObviously this has been a tremendously important effect on society by \nensuring that criminals are punished even when their victims could not, \nor would not, prosecute them. Today we would not have even a semblance \nof crime control without public prosecutors.\n  Unfortunately, however, one side-effect of replacing victims with \npublic prosecutors was to force victims to the sidelines of the \ncriminal justice system. No longer are victims parties to the case. No \nlonger do individual victims have legal representation in court. No \nlonger are the victims an integral part of the process. Instead, \nvictims have become relegated to the role of one-call witnesses who can \nbe summoned--or not--by either side.\n  The distance between victims and the criminal process has grown \ngreater over time. Prosecutors are overworked, courts face backlogs of \ncases, and prisons are overcrowded. These practical constraints, \ntogether with strategic legal considerations, has led to an \nincreasingly institutional view of crime--a view that focuses on \nprocessing cases rather than involving victims.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe the time has come for the \nSenate to consider the victims rights amendment. The issue for the \nSenate should not be whether we pass a victims' rights amendment--I \nbelieve we should do so. But I believe we must ensure that whatever \nform our final product takes, we have fully debated and considered the \nmatter. In the end, deliberations and our final passage of a victims' \nrights amendment will have profound, reaching effects on the criminal \njustice system. We need to be sure the results are as we would wish \nthem to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened to my two distinguished \ncolleagues. Not only are all colleagues ``distinguished'' colleagues, \nbut these two are also personal friends. One is a Republican, one a \nDemocrat. Both are individuals I like very much, individuals with whom \nI enjoy working on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  However, notwithstanding our friendship and our service on the same \ncommittee, I must disagree with them on this constitutional amendment.\n  I do not disagree with them at all on the intent of the amendment to \ngive victims rights; to make sure they can be heard in sentencing, to \nmake sure their views are sought out in every area from plea bargains \nto compensation. I know in the 8 years I was a prosecutor I did that. \nIt was the standard\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\nprocedure in my office. I insisted that victims be heard in the pre-\nsentence report, victims be heard by the court, victims be heard by the \nprosecutor's office if a determination was made to either bring extra \ncharges or to drop some charges--whatever the reason might be.\n  I must admit, I would have been very concerned had there been a \nconstitutional amendment of this nature because I can almost picture \nthe number of appeals, the number of delays, and the number of other \nissues that would come up. In many ways, it would create, in my view, \njust the opposite effect from that which the sponsors want; that is, so \nmany appeals could come out of this that everybody would lose sight of \nwho is being prosecuted and why.\n  Last Wednesday, we observed the fifth anniversary of the killing of \n168 Americans in the horrific bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City, and we opened the Oklahoma City National \nMemorial.\n  Every American was shocked at the initial bombing. Every American \nmust have been moved by the speeches and the observance at the \nmemorial. I remember, after that terrible incident, the Senate \nproceeded to consider antiterrorism legislation. The incident was in \nthe spring, and by June, we were considering antiterrorism legislation. \nIn fact, at that time the Senate accepted my amendment to include \nvictims legislation in the antiterrorism bill. I worked with Senator \nMcCain to increase assessments against those convicted of crime, with \nthe assessments to go to the Crime Victims Fund. When the matter was \ncompleted the following year, we preserved our legislative improvements \nto help victims of terrorism in the United States, in fact around the \nworld, as the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996. We moved \nvery quickly to respond.\n  Last Thursday, we also observed the anniversary of the tragic \nviolence at Columbine High School. That was one in a series of deadly \nincidents of school violence over the last few years. Scores of our \nNation's children have been killed or wounded over the last 3 years \nfrom school violence, and that violence has shaken families and \ncommunities across our Nation. In the wake of the Columbine violence, \nthe Senate moved to the consideration of juvenile crime legislation. We \nhad one of the few real Senate debates in the past few years. We had a \n2-week debate. During that 2-week debate, we greatly improved the bill \nwith numerous amendments, including a number directed at commonsense, \nconsensus gun safety laws.\n  On May 20 last year, within a month of the Columbine tragedy, the \nSenate acted to pass the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill. We did it by \na 3-1 margin, but since last May when we passed it, the Congress has \nkept the country waiting for final action on the legislation. Since \nlast May, the Congress and the Senate have kept the country waiting for \nsensible gun safety laws. It has been now more than a year since the \ntragic event at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO; more than a \nyear since 14 students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy \non April 20, 1999. Still, the American people are waiting for action by \nthis Congress.\n  It has been more than 11 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-\nLeahy juvenile justice bill by a bipartisan vote of 73-25. It had \nmodest, but I believe effective, gun safety provisions in it. It has \nbeen more than 8 months since the House and Senate juvenile justice \nconference met. That was only a ceremonial meeting. We did it for the \nfirst and the last and the only time. Throughout the entire school year \nthat has ensued, the Republican Senate chairman of the House-Senate \nconference and the Republican leadership of the Congress, have refused \nto call this conference back to work. The Senate and House Democrats \nhave been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference \nand work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice \nconference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions. But \nthe majority has refused to act.\n\n  I think the lack of attention, a lack of effective action is \nshameful, particularly in light of the fact that Congress has spent far \nmore time in recess than in session since the first ceremonial meeting \nof the conference.\n  I spoke on the floor several times over the last year--on September \n8, September 9, October 21, March 21, March 28, March 29, April 5, \nApril 6, April 13, and today--urging the majority to reconvene the \njuvenile justice conference. I have joined with Senators, both in \nwriting and on the floor, to request the Senate leadership let us \ncomplete our work on the conference and send a good bill to the \nPresident. We should not delay simply because some powerful gun lobbies \ndo not want us to pass even the most modest gun safety legislation; \neven the modest provision that closes this huge loophole we now have \nfor gun shows where somebody in a flea market can sell firearms to \nfelons.\n  On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees \nsent a letter to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde, calling for an \nopen meeting of the conference. On March 3 of this year, after another \nshocking school shooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, \nRepresentative Conyers and I wrote again to Senator Hatch and \nCongressman Hyde requesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The \nresponse has been resounding silence.\n  Even a bipartisan letter on April 11 from the Republican chairman of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde, and the Ranking Democrat, \nJohn Conyers, to the Republican Senate chairman of the conference, \nSenator Hatch, has not succeeded in getting the conference back to \nwork. We have to find time, or at least the will, to pass balanced, \ncomprehensive juvenile crime legislation. This is something that could \nbe signed into law today, or within a day after being passed. This is \nlegislation we passed by a 73-25 margin, and then we hold it in \nabeyance because the gun lobbyists said do not touch this.\n  What have we done in the meantime? We keep having a number of \nproposed constitutional amendments. Last month, it was a proposed \nconstitutional amendment regarding the flag. I spoke at the beginning \nand end of that debate to urge the Senate to turn to completing our \nwork on the juvenile crime bill, health care reform legislation, on \nminimum wage legislation, on privacy legislation, on confirming the \nFederal judges needed in our courts around the country, and all the \nother matters that have been sidetracked this year. But rather than \ndoing the legislative work that we should do first and foremost, we are \nnow going to turn our attention to another constitutional amendment, \nthis one with regard to crime victims' rights.\n  I believe constitutional amendments, if they are brought up, should \nbe approached seriously. The distinguished Senator from Arizona and the \ndistinguished Senator from California have approached it seriously. But \nthat means a real, serious debate. If we are going to amend the \nConstitution of the United States, we should do it seriously. Instead, \nlate on Thursday, after we voted to adopt an adjournment resolution, \nand everybody had left for the airport, the majority leader came to the \nfloor to move to proceed to this matter. I do not think constitutional \namendments should be a time filler to be called upon when we do not \nwant to proceed to legislative items. Nor is a constitutional amendment \nthe type of item that should be rushed through Senate consideration. It \nshould be explored and thoughtfully considered. If we are going to \nstart having constitutional amendments rather than legislative matters, \nthen let's set aside a good period of time--a few weeks--to talk about \nthis one.\n  Let's talk about the others that should come up. I can think of at \nleast two. Let's have a constitutional amendment debate on abortion. \nFor those who think Roe v. Wade should be the law of the land, let's \nwrite it into the Constitution. For those who think it should not be, \nthis is the chance to overrule the Supreme Court. Let's settle once and \nfor all this whole constitutional issue on abortion. Let's have a \nconstitutional amendment on that. I am perfectly willing to move \nforward with that. Even though I have stated my strong positions on \nthis issue, let's have a debate on it.\n  There are those who are concerned about whether we have too many gun \nrights and those who think we do not have enough. Maybe we should have \na gun amendment to clarify the second amendment. Maybe we should get \nthese\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\nissues out of the way once and for all. We can spend a few weeks on \neach one of these. We can be done by late August, and the Senate will \nhave spoken as to how they think it should be done.\n  The last two times the Senate debated the so-called balanced budget \namendment, those debates consumed a number of weeks, as they should. \nThis was a palliative I happened to oppose. We were told that without a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, we could never balance \nthe budget. Many of us said if we did our work and wrote the \nlegislation the right way we could. Of course, that is exactly what \nhappened. We did not need a constitutional amendment after all. We are \nnow debating how to spend the budget surpluses because we balanced the \nbudget without a constitutional amendment.\n  This proposed amendment is of similar length and additional \ncomplexity and will require some time to debate, as we did with the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  In addition, of course, this is the first time this amendment will be \ndebated by the Senate. It has never been debated by the House. So there \nis a lot of new ground to cover. If we are to pass it, I know the House \nwill want to look to our debate. I assume there will be weeks of debate \non it, as there should be. It is a legitimate issue.\n  I think it can be handled statutorily, but if we are going to do it \nin the Constitution, we should spend the weeks necessary to make sure \nwe get it right.\n  By way of illustration, the Judiciary Committee took more than 6 \nmonths to file its report on the proposed amendment, even though a \nsimilar measure had been the subject of a report last Congress. I note \nthat the majority views in the committee report run over 40 pages. The \nprincipal sponsors, Senators Kyl and Feinstein, added a statement of \ntheir own additional views on top of those. I urge all Senators to read \nthem because they are worth reading. I note that the minority views, in \nwhich I join with Senators Kennedy, Kohl, and Feingold, extend over 35 \npages. I think they are well worth reading. There is a lot of \ndiscussion in them.\n  We will vote today on the majority leader's motion to invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed. I will not oppose invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. In fact, I urge Senators to vote for cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. I hope it will be a 100-0 vote. But once we proceed \nto consideration of this measure, my colleagues should understand that \nit is an important matter that will require some extensive debate, and \nwe will see serious and substantial amendments to this proposal. I have \nheard from both sides of the aisle. I told the distinguished Senator \nfrom California that I will offer a statutory alternative in the days \nahead that can move the cause of crime victims' rights forward \nimmediately by a simple majority vote, without the additional \ncomplications and delays the constitutional amendment ratification \nprocess might entail, and without the need to return to Congress to \ndraft, introduce, and pass implementing legislation. There will be \nother amendments, as I have said.\n  I know the distinguished sponsors of this amendment have been through \nmore than 60 drafts to date. This is not an easy issue. It is hardly \nfixed in stone. It has not had Senate scrutiny. In fact, a number of \nSenators told me when they came back from the recess that they were \nsurprised to know this was coming up because it was added to the agenda \nafter we had voted to adjourn for the Easter recess. Many Senators are \nsurprised it is before us. I have told them the proposed constitutional \namendment is important. I think its meanings and mandates have to be \nexplored.\n  In my personal view--and I actually note this with some sadness--the \nfocus on the constitutional amendment has actually had the unintended \nconsequence of slowing the pace of victims' rights legislation over the \npast several years. I am reminded of the debate we had year after year \nof the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nPresident Reagan, who submitted budgets with the biggest deficits in \nthe Nation's history, would always give great speeches about needing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Of course, I used to \ntell him: There you go again. All you had to do was introduce a \nbalanced budget and let us vote on it. Instead, he introduced budgets, \nas was his right as President, with enormous deficits, and then a few \ndays later gave a speech saying: I wish we had a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget so we could balance this budget.\n  A President came along who did balance the budget. It was a very \ntough vote. I remember that vote in 1993. By a 1-vote margin in the \nHouse--no Republicans voted to balance the budget, which means cutting \na whole lot of programs--no Republicans voted for it. It passed by a 1-\nvote margin in the House. It was a tie vote in the Senate. Vice \nPresident Gore had to preside and cast the deciding vote for a balanced \nbudget.\n  It was tough. A lot of special interest groups from the right to the \nleft saw their programs nailed, but it was the only way to balance the \nbudget, and we balanced it. The stock market and the various financial \nmarkets took note: This is serious; they really are serious. That vote \nbegan this huge economic surge in this country. I do recall some on the \nother side saying: Why, if we vote to balance the budget, we are going \nto have enormous layoffs, 20 percent unemployment, we are going to have \na depression, we are going to have a recession--all these things. \nInstead, the economy has created the most jobs ever in the history of \nour Nation. We have had the greatest economic expansion in our Nation's \nhistory and an enormous budget surplus. That is what happened, but it \ntook a tough vote, not a palliative of a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget; a tough vote.\n  A lot of Democrats who were courageous enough to actually vote to \nbalance the budget were defeated the next year because they had to cast \nsuch unpopular votes to balance the budget. They did the right thing, \nand their children and grandchildren will bless them for it.\n  I have argued that rather than look again, in this case victims' \nrights, to a constitutional amendment, we should be looking at a \nstatutory way, the same way we did with the balanced budget. I wish the \nSenate was considering the Victims Assistance Act, S. 934, and its \nextensive provisions to improve crime victims' rights and protections \nnow and do that during this debate. Instead of during the next several \nweeks debating the constitutional amendment, why don't we debate S. \n934?\n  I wish we would consider our Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, that helps \nprotect our seniors from nursing home fraud and abuse and creates \nprotections for victims of telemarketing fraud. These senior citizens \nwho are abused in nursing homes and who are ripped off from \ntelemarketing frauds are victims also.\n  I wish the Senate would consider a number of the scores of additional \nlegislative proposals that would assist crime victims. Instead of the \nweeks we will spend on this constitutional amendment, why don't we \ndebate the Violence Against Women Act II, S. 51, that my friend, \nSenator Biden, has championed? That bill will continue and improve \nimportant and effective programs for domestic violence victims and \nother victims of crime. The aid to those victims of crime would be \nimmediate.\n  Senator Wellstone has introduced the International Trafficking of \nWomen and Children Victim Protection Act, S. 600. It has received \nlittle attention, but it should be debated. He also sponsored the \nBattered Women's Economic Security and Safety Act, S. 1069, and the \nChildren Who Witness Domestic Violence Protection Act, S. 1321. These \nbills were introduced to improve the safety and security of these \nvictims, but they are not being considered.\n  It is said that we do not have time, but we are going to spend \nseveral weeks on a constitutional amendment that would still have to go \nthrough the other body, and would still have to go to the States for \napproval and ratification. During those several weeks, we could be \ndebating those pieces of legislation for victims.\n  Senators Snowe, Hutchison, Grams, Ashcroft, Smith, Abraham, Hatch, \nEdwards, Durbin, Torricelli, and others have sponsored legislation to \nhelp crime victims, but I do not think we are going to consider them. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\ngoing to debate a proposed constitutional amendment. We will spend \nseveral weeks on something that is not self-executing but would require \nadditional follow-on legislation in any event, but we are told we do \nnot have time to debate, again, legislation which could apply help to \nvictims this summer.\n  So as we turn to this constitutional debate, I observe it is not a \nmatter on which the immediate filing of a cloture motion would be \nappropriate. I urge all Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--to \nvote for cloture on the motion to proceed. But if we are serious about \ndebating this measure, then we should debate it. The distinguished \nSenator from Arizona should have all the time he needs to talk about \nit. The distinguished Senator from California should have all the time \nshe needs to talk about it. Other Senators who strongly support it \nshould have all the time they need. But a number of Senators who \ndisagree with them ought to have time to speak, too.\n  If it means setting aside other legislative agenda, then let's do so. \nWe have a short legislative calendar filled with recesses as it is. Do \naway with a couple of the recesses and devote a significant portion of \nthat time to this. It is not my first choice. I would prefer to go to \nlegislative matters on the calendar. But if we are going to bring up a \nconstitutional amendment, let's do it right.\n  I hope once we turn to the measure, the majority leader will \nrecognize the inappropriateness of filing a cloture motion on this \nunexplored, proposed constitutional amendment. When that course was \nfollowed in 1995 in connection with the constitutional amendment to \nimpose term limits on Congress, it short circuited the debate and \nprevented any serious consideration or amendment.\n  But then I suspect in that case it was because a lot of the people \nwho said they were for term limits never wanted to actually vote on \nterm limits. We have had people in this body who have been for term \nlimits before I was born, people who have come back here 20 and 30 and \n40 years to the Congress saying: We have to do something about term \nlimits. They are so determined they will stay here if it takes them 100 \nyears. If they have to serve for 100 years to get term limits, they \nwill do it. It is probably why we have never voted on term limits, \nbecause it is a lot easier to talk about it than to vote on it. It is \nlike a balanced budget; it is a lot easier to talk about it than to \nvote on it.\n  But we have a serious matter here. It has never been considered by \nthe Senate, so we should talk about it. I think it could erect \ntechnical problems for important amendments such as proposals of \nstatutory alternatives. But both the supporters and the opponents \nshould know that we should have debate on it.\n  We have had a number of people, conservative commentators such as \nGeorge Will and Stewart Taylor, who have spoken out strongly against \nit. We have had liberal commentators who have spoken out against it.\n  We have editorials from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and \nothers who have opposed it--people ranging from Chief Justice William \nRehnquist to Bud Welch, the father of one of the victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a partial list of those opponents be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    List of Opponents of S.J.

Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to respond to the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy.\n  He is absolutely correct that constitutional amendments should not be \nrushed. We have taken a long time to get to this point--4 years. As a \nmatter of fact, in the Judiciary Committee alone we have heard from 34 \nwitnesses and have had 802 pages of testimony and submissions. In the \nHouse, there have been hearings. They have had 32 witnesses and about \n575 pages of testimony and submissions. In other words, there have been \nabout 66 witnesses and nearly 1,400 pages of testimony.\n  I commend the report of the Judiciary Committee to anyone who would \nlike a really good read on this entire subject and the reasons why we \nneed a Federal constitutional amendment.\n  The bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee 12-5. We took our time \ngetting it to the Senate floor to make sure everybody had their say. \nThe distinguished ranking minority member needed additional time to \nfile his comments to the report. That was granted. He did so.\n  We agree there should be adequate time for the debate of this \nconstitutional amendment, but we disagree that there should be a \nfilibuster to use unnecessary time of the Senate.\n  Senator Leahy talked about a lot of things. He talked about abortion, \ngun control, a balanced budget amendment and Ronald Reagan, the \njuvenile crime bill, nursing home fraud, and term limits. I would \nsuggest that we ought to stick to the subject.\n  We all know one good way to defeat a good idea is to talk it to death \nand threaten to delay other business of the Senate.\n  I would suggest we stick to the exact question before us, and that is \nwhether there should be a constitutional amendment protecting victims \nof crime.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have laid out the case for this.\n  As I heard Senator Leahy, there was only one fleeting reference to an \nargument in opposition. That was that the Senate had acted with \nalacrity in dealing with the problems that the victims of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing case were suffering because the judge there did not permit \nthe victims to attend the trial. Basically, he gave them a choice, over \na lunch hour one day, saying: You can either attend the trial or be \npresent at the time of sentencing and speak to that issue, but you \ncannot do both. Take your pick. What a Hobson's choice. The prosecutor \nreally could not help advise the victims.\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\n Some of them chose not to attend the trial. Others chose to attend.\n  Senator Leahy is correct about one thing. The Congress did act \nquickly to pass a law basically telling the Federal judge that they did \nhave a right to attend the trial and the right to attend the sentencing \nand to speak at that time and that he should not deny them that right.\n  We passed that. The day after the Senate passed it, the President \nsigned it into law. We were so concerned that these victims of that \nhorrible tragedy have their rights protected that we passed a Federal \nstatute--exactly what Senator Leahy is suggesting as an alternative to \nthe Federal constitutional amendment that Senator Feinstein and I have \npresented.\n  What has happened? What has happened is that we are worse off than we \nwere before we passed the statute. The judge did not apply the statute \nto protect the victims of crime. In effect, what happened was that the \ndefendant's right to exclude them, based in the U.S. Constitution, \ntrumped the Federal statute which, of course, is subservient to the \nFederal Constitution. If that was the basis on which the court ruled, \nit would have been a correct basis. If he really felt the defendant's \nrights required that the victims not be present in the courtroom, and \nthat those rights are in the U.S. Constitution, then he would be \ncorrect that that would trump a Federal statute--the one that the \nCongress passed.\n  Clearly, the Oklahoma City bombing litigation leaves no doubt about \nthe difficulties that victims face with mere statutory protection of \ntheir rights. For a number of the victims, the rights afforded in the \nact Congress passed in 1997 and the earlier victims' rights bill were \nnot protected. They did not observe the trial of the defendant in that \ncase, Timothy McVeigh, because of lingering doubts about the \nconstitutional status of the statutes.\n\n  The interesting thing is that because that case was later taken up on \nappeal, the case of these victims, and the Tenth Circuit ruled in that \ncase denying the victims the rights notwithstanding the Federal \nstatute, you literally have a situation in which it would have been \nbetter if Congress had not acted by statute because there is now a \nprecedent on the books. This was the first time victims sought Federal \nappellate review of their rights since the Victims Bill of Rights was \npassed in 1990, the underlying statute on which the 1997 statute was \nbased.\n  Quoting now from Professor Paul Cassell:\n\n       The undeniable, and unfortunate, result of that litigation \n     has been to establish--as the only reported federal appellate \n     ruling--a precedent that will make effective enforcement of \n     the federal victims rights statutes quite difficult. It is \n     now the law of the 10th circuit that victims lack \n     ``standing'' to be heard on issues surrounding the Victims' \n     Bill of Rights and, for good measure, that the Department of \n     Justice may not take an appeal for the victims under either \n     of those statutes. For all practical purposes, the treatment \n     of crime victims' rights in federal court in Utah, Colorado, \n     Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming have been remitted \n     to the unreviewable discretion of individual federal district \n     court judges.\n\n  Professor Paul Cassell of the University of Utah Law School \nconcludes:\n\n       The fate of the Oklahoma City victims does not inspire \n     confidence that all victims rights will be fully enforced in \n     the future.\n       . . . the Oklahoma City case provides a compelling \n     illustration of why a constitutional amendment is necessary \n     to fully protect victims' rights in this country.\n\n  The sad truth is that Congress's efforts to protect the rights in a \nvery specific case by Federal statute not only didn't protect their \nrights but made matters worse. The statutory alternative Senators \nKennedy and Leahy have proposed is not the answer. There has been no \nrefutation of the point I tried to make in my original 10-minute \nstatement that authority after authority after authority--the Attorney \nGeneral, the Governors, the attorneys general--have all said that \ndespite their best efforts, the statutory and State constitutional \nremedies simply have not worked to provide protections to victims of \nviolent crime. After 18 years of experimenting, of trying, of doing \ntheir best, it is obviously now necessary to move forward with the next \nstep, which is to elevate these rights to the same Constitution that \nprotects the rights of the defendants. Nothing less is going to work.\n  I submit the arguments that Senator Feinstein and I made have not \nbeen refuted. If the only response is that we are going to have to take \na long time talking about extraneous matters, then my suggestion is \nthat there is no real argument by those who oppose this amendment. \nThere is no real substance to the notion that we shouldn't move \nforward.\n  I reiterate, I am pleased that Senator Leahy will encourage all of \nhis colleagues, as I certainly will encourage mine, on both sides of \nthe aisle to support the motion to proceed. We do need to proceed. When \nwe proceed, we can have that debate. Senator Feinstein and I will renew \nour offer to continue to meet with the Department of Justice to get \nmore suggestions from them. We have, in fact, incorporated many of \ntheir suggestions into the current text of the amendment. But it is \ntime to move on. We can't keep putting it off. That is why we filed the \ncloture motion. That is why we want to proceed.\n  I appreciate what Senator Leahy said, but I suggest that we need to \nmove on with the debate on this amendment. Senator Feinstein and I are \nprepared to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to have an \nopportunity to ask the Senator from Arizona a couple of questions. I \nthought he pointed out very ably the problem of a statute filling the \nvoid, the first problem being that the rights of the accused will \nalways trump the rights of the victim. He pointed out very well and \nvery ably and very specifically the situation that took place with \nrespect to Oklahoma City.\n  Then we turned to the FBI to try to get the amount of coverage that \ncould be achieved in the statute for victims across this great land. We \nwere told that really the best we could do would be to protect by \nstatute the 1 to 2 percent of victims who were victimized by violent \ncrimes.\n  I think it is important that we discuss a little bit more why the \nConstitution will always trump a State law. I ask the Senator to lay \nthat out once again.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. I am pleased to do so.\n  I think she makes three very important points. One very important \npoint she made is that if you have a Federal statute, you are only \ndealing with 1 to 2 percent of the victims of violent crime--those 8 \nmillion victims each year. Of course, that is the number of Federal \ncrimes. There aren't very many serious Federal crimes that would carry \nthe penalties necessary to invoke this constitutional provision. A \nFederal statute would be very small and of no comfort to the millions \nof victims of crime involved in State court proceedings.\n  Secondly, there are occasions when, as in the Oklahoma City bombing \ncase, a defendant's rights are asserted based on an amendment to the \nConstitution. Sometimes, for example, the judge will say: Well, I am \ngoing to exclude witnesses. I will exclude victims from the courtroom \nbecause the defendant thinks it will create undue emotion, that it will \njeopardize his right to a fair trial if the jury sees the victim or the \nfamily of the victim. That was the case in the Oklahoma City bombing \ncase and in scores of others Senator Feinstein has brought to the \nattention of the Senate.\n  Of course, the defendant and his family are permitted to sit there \nall dressed up and supportive of the defendant at the time of \nsentencing and to stand up and say what a fine fellow he is. The judge \ntakes that into consideration. We are simply saying the victims ought \nto be able to stand before the judge and recount the horror, the \ntragedy, the weakness, the loss they have suffered for the judge to \ntake into account as well at the time of sentencing. If the defendant's \nconstitutional rights are deemed always to be superior because they are \nembodied in the U.S. Constitution and the victim's rights are always \nsecondary, then the victim's rights will be honored in the breach \nrather than the observance, to quote one of the people I quoted \nearlier.\n  That is why the third point is so important. Even when there isn't a \ndirect conflict--and there will rarely be a direct conflict--the \nprimary situation will be presence in the courtroom at\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\nthe time of trial. But in most situations there won't be the direct \nconflict between the defendant's right and the victim's right. It \nsimply is a matter of inertia.\n  Perhaps Senator Feinstein can find the quotation she read before. I \nthink it was Professor Tribe whom the Senator quoted, who talked about \njudicial indifference, inertia. Well-meaning judges and prosecutors \ndon't mean to deny victims the notice of the proceedings and the right \nto be present, but it becomes a secondary matter. We give the Miranda \nwarning to the defendant. We make sure the defendant has legal counsel \nthat people hire on his behalf, and we make absolutely certain that \nnone of the defendant's rights are intruded upon, because if they are, \nthe case will be overturned on appeal. And that is as it should be. But \nbecause of that attention to the constitutional rights of the \ndefendant, we forget the victim. It is in that sense that the victims' \nrights are simply not being honored, why 60 percent--even in the States \nwith good provisions--of the victims do not even get notice. That is a \nhorrible statistic. What if we said 60 percent of the defendants didn't \nget their court-appointed lawyer, that it was too inconvenient or too \ncostly? Sixty percent is a pretty good percentage. Clearly, we would \nfind that inadequate. Fundamental rights are fundamental rights and \nthey need to be protected.\n\n  So I think the Senator from California is correct that even though we \ndon't mean to deny these rights, either because of the attention paid \nto the defendants or simply because of the fact there are other things \nmore important to do than make sure victims have notice of these \nproceedings, they are denied their rights and the ability to \nparticipate.\n  A final point. There has been the contention that somehow it is going \nto become very expensive if--as we do with defendants--society has to \npay for their rights. We do that for defendants; we pay for their \nattorneys, for their transcripts, and everything they need for their \nappeals. What we did here was not guarantee that victims have the right \nto attend the trial. For example, as are most of the provisions of the \nConstitution, we have said that the Government may not deny them the \nright to participate. They have to get there. They have to get there on \ntheir own. It is just that the Government can't deny them the right to \nsit on the bench in the courtroom if they show up.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me stop the Senator on that point because I think \nhe has very well expressed what we are trying to do. We have discussed \nthis before. I think the whole body should hear this. We know that \nthose who are accused have basic rights. We know that the prosecution \nusually wants to try to get the victim in the courtroom. The defense \nattorney wants to keep the victim out of the courtroom. Supposing a \nsituation arises where you have an emboldened or abusive victim, or one \nwho is overly emotional, under our amendment, how would this work? What \nrights would the judge have in this situation?\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for that question because people not \nfamiliar with the process inside a courtroom may wonder if this \namendment would permit a victim to cause a big scene in court, thus \ndisrupting the trial and working to the disadvantage of the defendant. \nOf course, as the Senator knows, a judge has total control of the \ncourtroom and has the ability to set whatever rules are necessary to \nmaintain decorum and dignity within the courtroom and certainly to \nensure the protection of the fair trial rights of the defendant. That \nis why a judge can always say--and we have seen it on TV hundreds of \ntimes--``order in the court,'' in effect saying, if you can't sit there \nquietly and unemotionally watching what is occurring, then you have to \nleave. Because in the court we cannot have undue displays of emotion. \nSo the judge has within his total authority the ability to control \neither the defendant from his or her outbursts or any emotional \noutbursts of anybody else in the courtroom, including victims.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. The Senator and I worked \nextensively with both Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law \nat Harvard University, and Paul Cassell, a professor of law at the \nUniversity of Utah College of Law. Both are very skilled and \nknowledgeable in this area. I happened to find an article that they \nwrote together in a newspaper. I thought it might be interesting to \nhear their view. I would like to read it to you and ask for your \nresponse:\n\n       We take it to be common ground that the Constitution should \n     never be amended merely to achieve short-term, partisan, or \n     purely policy objectives. Apart from a needed change in \n     governmental structure, an amendment is appropriate only when \n     the goal involves a basic human right that by consensus \n     deserves permanent respect, is not and cannot adequately be \n     protected through State or Federal legislation--\n\n  I think we have shown why that can't happen--\n\n     would not distort basic principles of the separation of \n     powers among the Federal branches or the division of powers \n     between the national and state governments or the balance of \n     powers between government and private citizens with respect \n     to their basic rights.\n       The proposed Victims Rights Amendment meets these demanding \n     criteria. It would protect basic rights of crime victims, \n     including their rights to be notified of and present at all \n     proceedings in their case and to be heard at appropriate \n     stages in the process. These are rights not to be victimized \n     again through the process by which government officials \n     prosecute, punish and release accused or convicted offenders.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       These are the very kinds of rights with which our \n     Constitution is typically and particularly concerned--rights \n     of individuals to participate in all those government \n     processes that strongly affect their lives. ``Participation \n     in all forms of government is the essence of democracy,'' \n     President Clinton concluded in endorsing the amendment.\n\n  Now, what we come down to, essentially, is how do you express these \nthings in a way that gives victims these certain basic rights? I think \nwe have tried to do that. We put it up on a schedule here of crime \nvictims' rights. I wish to quickly go over this. The rights of the \naccused are on the left. The rights we would afford victims are on the \nright. In a sense, we achieve a kind of balance. Now, the question \ncomes when and if these rights come into conflict. The fact is, I think \nwe both believe it will be rare that these rights come into conflict. \nAs was said, with an emotional victim, there is in the law already the \nopportunity for a judge to handle this situation.\n  I have had a very hard time, because the Senator and I have had a \nnumber of critics on this; we have had a number of newspapers that have \neditorialized and said that what we are trying is trivial, not \nimportant. But let me tell you something. If you are a rape victim and \nyou have reason to believe that individual may come back after you, it \nis not unimportant that you have notice when that individual is \nreleased from prison or from jail. It is not unimportant at all. I \nindicated earlier a case of an individual who has had to change her \nname and live in fear and anonymity because of this. The Constitution \nshould protect that victim, and that is what we try to do. So I have \nhad a very hard time seeing instances where there is actual conflict.\n  My question of the Senator is, Can the Senator expand on this more \nand indicate where there is conflict? People have said, ``You diminish \nthe rights of the accused.'' I don't see us diminishing the rights of \nthe accused. Their rights are very specific. We don't touch on these. \nThere is the right to counsel, the right to due process, the right to a \nspeedy trial. We want that, as well, because we know that the speed of \nthe trial is an important deterrent to violence. We know that if a \ntrial is not speedy, evidence grows cold, witnesses disappear. It is \nmuch more difficult to make a case if there is a long hiatus between \narrest and trial. In fact, Federal law recognizes that by moving trials \nalong in an expeditious way.\n\n  Double jeopardy. We certainly don't interfere with that. We certainly \ndon't interfere with the prohibition against self-incrimination or \nagainst unreasonable search and seizure, probable cause, a jury of \npeers, the right to be informed, the right to confront witnesses, to \nsubpoena witnesses, a prohibition against excessive bail, the right to \na grand jury. There are a few other rights written into the \nConstitution. But our rights are so basic for a victim, such as the \nright to have notice when a trial takes place, the right to be present \nin the courtroom, the right to make a statement at an appropriate\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nplace in the trial, the right to have notice if your assailant is \nreleased. These are certain basic, core rights that in no way, shape, \nor form, it seems to me, interfere with the constitutional rights \ngranted to a defendant or to an accused to protect them from excessive \ngovernment under the Constitution of the United States.\n  So I have been very perplexed as to why we see bubbling out there \nthis argument that we are setting up some collision of rights. We are \nsimply trying to provide a victim with certain basic rights that are \nspelled out and are specific.\n  Would the Senator care to elaborate on that?\n  Mr. KYL. I agree it is perplexing how one could conclude a \ndefendant's rights would be trampled on in any way by our proposal. It \ndoes not do that.\n  The article in the Los Angeles Times, quoting Professors Tribe and \nCassell, makes the point that ``a victims' rights amendment must, of \ncourse, be drafted so the rights of victims will not furnish excuses \nfor roughshod treatment of the accused. The Senate Resolution is such a \ncarefully crafted measure, adding victims' rights that can exist side \nby side with defendants'.''\n  Precisely the point. There is only one conceivable circumstance I \nknow of in which there could actually be an assertion of two \nconstitutional rights, one by the defendant and one by the victim, \nwhich could theoretically come in conflict, and that is the right to be \npresent at the trial. Courts deal with that today. They would balance \nthe interests tomorrow. We have the same thing existing with respect to \nthe press. We have the right of free press. Say victims want to attend \nthe trial. Sometimes, as we know, judges don't permit that, but it is \nin the Constitution. That is right. But the defendant has a right to a \nfair trial as well.\n  The courts will balance those two interests and generally come to an \naccommodation that enforces both rights.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Would the Senator finish reading that? I think the \nnext points are very important to our cause. They should be heard.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the two distinguished law professors make a very \nimportant point. They point out the example of paralleling a \ndefendant's constitutionally protected right to a speedy trial. Our \namendment confers on victims the right to consideration of their \ninterest in a trial, free from unreasonable delay.\n  By definition, the professors note, these rights could not collide \nsince they are both designed to bring matters to a close within a \nreasonable time. If any conflict were to emerge, courts retain ultimate \nresponsibility for harmonizing the rights at stake.\n  We have also gone one other step. That is, whereas the defendant had \nan absolute right to a speedy trial--and frequently, also, courts \ndetermine he has a right to delay things--we have provided for victims \nmerely that the judge must ``consider'' their desire to bring the trial \nto a speedy conclusion.\n  In this case, we have created a right of victims which, indeed, is \nsubservient to the right of the defendants. Theirs is absolute. The \nvictims have a right to have their views considered. We have been very \ncareful to ensure we don't trample on defendants' rights.\n  I make one more point because the Senator reminded me of something \nthat is very important. In the statement by Professor Mosteller, he \nmakes a relative point that relates to this. ``In theory, victims' \nrights could be safeguarded without a constitutional amendment. It \nwould only be necessary for actors within the criminal justice system--\njudges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and others--to suddenly begin \nfully respecting victims' rights. The real world question, however, is \nhow to actually trigger such a shift in the Zeitgeist. For nearly two \ndecades, victims have obtained a variety of measures to protect their \nrights. Yet, the prevailing view from those who work in the field is \nthat these efforts have `all too often been ineffective.' Rules to \nassist victims `frequently fail to provide meaningful protection \nwhenever they come into conflict with'''--and here I break the \nquotation--not the defendant's rights. They are not conflicting with \ndefendant's rights. That is not why they are denied, but rather \n``whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional \nindifference, or sheer inertia.''\n\n  That is what is preventing these rights from being fully affected--\nnot that they conflict with the defendant's rights.\n  Here is the conclusion: The view that State victims provisions have \nbeen and will continue to often be disregarded is widely shared, as \nsome of the strongest opponents of the amendment seem to concede the \npoint. For example, Ellen Greenlee, president of the National Legal Aid \nand Defenders Association, bluntly and revealingly told Congress that \nthe State victims amendments, ``so far have been treated as mere \nstatements of principle that victims ought to be included and consulted \nmore by prosecutors and courts. A State constitution is far . . . \neasier to ignore than the Federal one.''\n  That is the bottom line point.\n  State constitutions, even Federal statutes, as we found in the \nOklahoma City bombing case, are far easier to ignore than the U.S. \nConstitution. That is something no judge and no prosecutor can ignore. \nThat is why we want to elevate these rights--not because they conflict \nwith the defendant's rights, not because they take anything away from \nany accused in the courtroom, but rather because these elemental rights \nof fairness are not currently being enforced by the judges and \nprosecutors because they just don't have the stature of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  If the Senator recalls, in our earlier discussions with the Justice \nDepartment, we were very concerned that the rights of the accused not \nbe violated, not be diminished, and we quite consciously left out any \nspecific remedy in this situation so that if someone doesn't exercise \ntheir right either to be present or to make a statement, in effect, \nthey have no remedy, or after they make their statement, if the facts \nin the trial are such and the jury comes in with a decision, they have \nno right of a remedy.\n  So the basic core rights we provide are, in a sense, certain \nprocedural rights that give them a place in the process.\n  Let me read what these two law professors have said on this point:\n\n       The framers of the Constitution undoubtedly assumed the \n     rights of victims would receive decent protection, but \n     experience has not vindicated this assumption. It is now \n     necessary to add a corrective amendment. Doing so would \n     neither extend the Constitution to an issue of mere policy, \n     nor provide special benefits to a particular interest group, \n     nor use the heavy artillery of constitutional amendment where \n     a simpler solution is available, nor would it put the \n     Constitution to a purely symbolic use or enlist it for some \n     narrow partisan purpose. Rather, the proposed amendment would \n     help bridge a distinct and significant gap in our legal \n     system's existing arrangements for the protection of basic \n     human rights against an important category of government \n     abuse.\n\n  This, I think, goes right to the question of remedy. We don't provide \nfor a remedy, we simply say you have these basic rights to participate \nin this manner.\n\n  Mr. KYL. If I could put an exclamation point on that.\n  The point Senator Feinstein makes is this: During the pendency of the \nproceedings, the victim has the right to assert these rights. For \nexample, if you have a week-long trial and the victim finds out about \nthe trial after the second day, the victim can't go back and say you \nhave to start the trial all over again. All the victim can do is say, \nhey, I have a right to be there for the rest of the trial.\n  That is unlike the defendant's rights. Here is the exact language we \nincluded: ``Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or \ncontinue any trial, reopen any proceeding, or invalidate any ruling''--\nand there are only two exceptions--``except with respect to conditional \nrelease or restitution or to provide rights guaranteed by this article \nin future proceedings without staying or continuing a trial. Nothing in \nthis article shall give rise to or authorize the creation of a claim \nfor damages . . .''\n  There are only two exceptions. One is prospective, so long as it does \nnot continue or delay the proceedings. In other words, you have the \nright to say: Judge, this trial is starting, and I have a right to be \nthere. And the other one is with respect to a conditional release.\n  I close with this point: You need the right to enforce it with \nrespect to a conditional release.\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n  Here is a true story. Here is how it would work. Patricia Pollard of \nFlagstaff, AZ, was picked up one night by a man and his wife, \nironically, and the man brutally raped her, sliced her up with an open \nbeer can, and left her to die. She lived. He was eventually prosecuted. \nAfter the Arizona legislature passed the provision which enabled \nvictims to be notified, the parole board held a hearing on his \nconditional release. They decided to conditionally release her \nassailant from the Arizona State Penitentiary, but they did not give \nher notice.\n\n  The Governor's office found out about this, located Patricia Pollard \nin California, brought her back, and arranged for another meeting of \nthe parole board after they had already made their decision. They \nagreed to hear her. She spoke about what he had done to her and what \nshe feared he would do to others. The parole board reversed its \ndecision.\n  I asked Patricia Pollard whether she did that because she feared for \nher life, that he would come after her again. She said: Well, he might \nhave tried to track me down. But in truth, his crime against me was a \nrandom kind of crime. I was available for him to victimize. I simply \ncould not have lived with myself if I had not gone there and told these \npeople what he could do to someone else because I know that had he \ngotten out, he would have done it to somebody else.\n  That is why we provide this limited exception, the only situation, \nreally, where something can be done retroactively--where a person was \nnot given notice to attend the parole or conditional release \nproceedings and the individual has not yet been released, you can go \nback in and tell your story and just maybe it will make a difference. \nThat is what this amendment is all about, protecting the rights not \nonly of the victims of crime but of the rest of society as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague, yield the floor, and reserve \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to the presentations on \nthe floor. Let me say the passion with which the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, and the Senator from Arizona bring this \nissue to the floor is a passion I understand. I certainly respect their \nviews.\n  I have studied this issue at some length. I must say the Senator from \nCalifornia visited with me, I guess, half a dozen times about this \nissue over the past year or so. But I have reached a different \nconclusion. It is a difficult trail to get to this point, but my view \nis the issue is not whether victims in this country have rights in \ncourt proceedings, but how we achieve those rights.\n  It is true that criminals are accorded a whole series of rights in \nthis country. I do not quarrel with that. I do not want us to put \ninnocent people behind bars. It is difficult to convict in this \ncountry, and our Constitution establishes certain rights. We try, as a \ncountry, to make certain we only put those guilty of crimes, behind \nbars.\n  It is also true--and I say this to the Senator from California and \nthe Senator from Arizona--it has been a longer process and a more \ndifficult track, to make certain that victims and victims' families \nhave their rights protected in our court system. I have offered \nlegislation on this issue previously. In fact, I authored language \nincluded in the 1994 crime bill, which is now law, that gives crime \nvictims the right to testify at federal sentencing hearings. My \nprovision gives crime victims and their families the right in Federal \ncourt to present testimony about ``What this crime meant to me or to my \nfamily'' and ensures that judges and parole boards formally consider \nthe impact of a crime on its victims when making sentencing and parole \ndecisions.\n  I sat in a court at the manslaughter trial of the man on trial for \nthe death of my mother. I am very sensitive to this issue. I \nunderstand--being a family member, sitting in a court, watching the \ntrial of the man who was responsible for the death of my mother--I \nunderstand the concern a family member has about the rights of the \nvictim and the rights of the victim's family to be present in that \ncourt. I understand the desire to present testimony during the \nsentencing phase, to have an understanding about when someone is let \nout of prison. I understand all that, and I am very sensitive to it \nbecause I have been through it personally, as a result of the tragic \ndeath of my mother.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today saying I strongly support \nvictims' rights. We are moving in this country in a variety of ways to \nachieve those rights. Thirty-three States have now amended their state \nconstitutions to specifically describe the rights of victims and their \nfamilies. Some say that approach does not work very well and is not \nuniversal; that sometimes it does not achieve our goal. I understand \nthat argument. I understand the argument that the perpetrator of a \nheinous and violent crime is brought into the court, now some months \nlater after the crime was committed, and his or her hair is combed, \nthey are in a new suit, they look as if they just finished singing in a \nchurch choir, and all their acquaintances testify to what a remarkable \nperson this is. It happens all the time in trials.\n  This animal who committed the violent murder on a Saturday night, in \ncourt 1 month or 2 or 6, or a year later, looks completely different \nand has a whole set of rights. I understand all that.\n  My concern is about the Constitution of the United States, and \nwhether we should address this by changing the U.S. Constitution, or \nwhether we should address it by continuing to make the changes, both \nwith respect to Federal law and also mandating changes with respect to \nState law and State constitutional changes that accomplish the same \nresult.\n\n  I have in my hand three pages of constitutional amendments that have \nbeen introduced in this session of Congress. We have had several of \nthem, frankly, on the floor of the Senate. These are very important \nissues. Amending or changing the Constitution of this country ought to \nbe done rarely and then only in circumstances where it is the only \nopportunity to achieve the change we want as a society. These are three \npages of constitutional amendments that are proposed by my colleagues \nnow.\n  We have had over 11,000 proposals to change the Constitution since it \nwas written; 11,000 proposals. One of them, for example, said let's \nhave a constitutional amendment that provides the Presidency of our \ncountry should be rotated. One term it shall be held by someone who is \na southerner, from the southern States, and the next term followed by \nsomeone who comes from a northern State. That was a proposed \nconstitutional amendment. I could describe more, of course. 11,000 \ntimes, the Members of Congress have felt the need to change the U.S. \nConstitution--this document which begins:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union. . . .\n\n  We all understand the words. It was written by 55 white men just over \ntwo centuries ago in a room called the Assembly Room in Constitution \nHall. My colleagues have heard me talk about it before, but I will say \nit again. In that room, George Washington's chair is still sitting at \nthe front of the room where he presided over the Constitutional \nConvention. Go there today in Philadelphia and look at his chair. Ben \nFranklin sat over there; there James Madison. Thomas Jefferson was in \nEurope at the time so he didn't participate except through his \nwritings, which then became, as we know it, the Bill of Rights.\n  But since those 55 men wrote the Constitution of the United States \nover two centuries ago, we have had so many proposals for change. I \nhave mentioned to my colleagues on the 200th birthday of the writing of \nthe Constitution, I was one of the 55 people who were authorized to go \nin for a ceremony, into this Assembly Room. This time, it was 55 men, \nwomen, minorities. I got chills sitting in this room because I had \nstudied in a very small school the history about Ben Franklin, Madison, \nMason, George Washington--the father of our country--and now I was \nsitting in the Assembly Room in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia where \nthey wrote the Constitution of the United States.\n  Since that experience, I have had difficulty coming to the conclusion \nthat we can improve upon the basic framework of the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Other countries try to replicate\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\nthis Constitution; we try to amend it. Some of my colleagues apparently \nthink it is a rough draft available for amendment at the whim of \nsomeone's interest in the House or the Senate. It is much more \nimportant than that, and we ought to amend the Constitution, in my \njudgment, rarely, and then when it is the only solution.\n  As I mentioned, 33 States have amended their Constitution to provide \nfor victims' rights. We can provide for the Federal portion, and the \nSenators from Arizona and California are absolutely right, that is a \nvery small portion of crime in the criminal justice system. We can also \nmandate--and I am perfectly prepared to do that--that the States must \ndo the same in exchange for a certain number of incentives which we in \nthe Congress provide. I am perfectly prepared to do that.\n  I do want to clear up a couple of misconceptions that have been part \nof the discussion with respect to the victims' rights amendment. The \nproposal to change the Constitution, in some measure, rests on the \ndiscussion about, among other things, the folks who were convicted in \nthe Oklahoma City bombing case.\n  I want to describe what happened in that case because like many \nothers, I saw the initial ruling and comments of the judge in the \nFederal court in Denver, and was appalled. He essentially said that \nthose who were victims or family members of victims who wanted to \nwitness the trial would not necessarily then be granted the opportunity \nto testify during the sentencing phase of the trial. I was concerned \nabout that. I felt that was an abrogation of victims' rights.\n  What happened as a result of that is Congress passed a piece of \nlegislation called the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. We did \nthat almost immediately. It reversed a presumption against crime \nvictims observing any part of the trial proceedings if they were likely \nto testify during the sentencing hearing.\n  This piece of legislation that was passed almost immediately after \nthe judge's ruling prohibited courts from excluding victims from the \ntrial on the grounds they might be called to provide a victim's impact \nstatement at sentencing. The result of the legislation was that the \nvictims in the Oklahoma City bombing trial were allowed to observe both \nthe trial of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and to provide impact \nstatements through testimony.\n  In this circumstance, the legislation we passed in Congress worked \nexactly as Congress intended it to work. The testimony by a former \nprosecutor at the Oklahoma City bombing trial, Ms. Wilkinson, is \nsomething I want to recount because it is important to understand what \nhappened, inasmuch as this example has been used.\n  It is important to look at how the Victim Rights Clarification Act \nwas actually applied in the Oklahoma City case.\n  On June 26, 1996, Judge Matsch held that potential witnesses at any \npenalty hearing were excluded from pretrial proceedings and the trial \nitself to avoid any influence from that experience on their testimony.\n  That is what I described earlier, and I felt the same revulsion about \nthat judge's decision as I think my colleagues did, and the result was \nthat we passed the Victim Rights Clarification Act almost immediately. \nThe President signed it into law on March 19, 1997. One week later, \nJudge Matsch reversed his exclusionary order and permitted observation \nat the trial proceedings by potential penalty-phase impact witnesses. \nIn other words, the judge changed his mind immediately after the \nPresident signed the legislation.\n  Beth Wilkinson, a member of the Government team that successfully \nprosecuted, said:\n\n       What happened in [the McVeigh] case was once you all had \n     passed the statute, the judge said that the victims could sit \n     in, but they may have to undergo a voir dire process to \n     determine whether rule 402. . .would have been impacted and \n     could be more prejudicial.\n\n  This is what the prosecutor said. It is important to say this:\n\n       I am proud to report to you that every single one of those \n     witnesses who decided to sit through the trial survived the \n     voir dire, and not only survived, but I think changed the \n     judge's opinion on the idea that any victim impact testimony \n     would be changed by sitting through the trial. [T]he \n     witnesses underwent the voir dire and testified during the \n     penalty phase for Mr. McVeigh.\n       It worked in that case, but it worked even better in the \n     next case. Just 3 months later when we tried the case against \n     Terry Nichols, every single victim who wanted to watch the \n     trial either in Denver or through closed-circuit television \n     proceedings that were provided also by statute by this \n     Congress, were permitted to sit and watch the trial and \n     testify against Mr. Nichols in the penalty phase--all without \n     having to undergo a voir dire process.\n\n  The point is, when the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing trial, \nwhich was conducted in Denver, made his initial ruling, there was a \ngreat amount of press about it, and all of us, including myself, was \naghast at this ruling. Congress passed a piece of legislation almost \nimmediately, the President signed it, and the judge reversed his \nruling, and every single one of the victims or victims' families who \nwished to testify during the penalty phase was allowed to testify. That \nis critically important to be on the record.\n  The urge to amend the Constitution ought to be an urge based on all \nof the information available, and there is plenty of information \navailable, it seems to me, based on this case and also based on the \nfact that 33 States have now changed their constitution and more will \ndo so. In fact, all could do so if we decided to provide a mandate that \nwould require them to do so. We are making significant progress in this \narea.\n  I understand, as I said when I started, the passions of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from California. I have those same \npassions, and I want victims to have the same rights. I believe, \nhowever, that amending the Constitution should always be a last resort, \nnot a first resort. I do not believe, despite all that has been said, \nthat it serves this document very well to bring a piece of legislation \nto the floor of the Senate on a Tuesday and have a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed. Presumably, we will have a cloture vote on the bill \nitself and probably have 8 hours, maybe 10 hours, maybe 14 hours, which \nwould be a lengthy period of time for discussion in this Senate, and an \nattempt, I am sure, to stifle amendments, and then we would say: All \nright, now the Senate has considered changing the U.S. Constitution.\n  I do not think that is what Washington, Franklin, Madison, Mason, or \nothers would have wanted us to do in consideration of changing this \nsacred document.\n  My hope is we will have an interesting and significant discussion \nabout this and we will, from this debate, not only turn back the \nconstitutional amendment but probably stimulate a great deal more \nactivity on the part of the States. As I said before, I am willing to \neither offer an amendment or join others in offering an amendment that \nwill require the States to make these changes. That would accomplish \nexactly the same thing without amending the U.S. Constitution. We can, \nin any event, make certain all this applies with respect to the Federal \nstatute and Federal crimes.\n  My hope is, at the end of it, we will not only have denied the \nimpulse to change the Constitution, but we will have created new energy \nand new incentives to make certain that victims' rights gain ground in \nState after State across this country. I will be happy to join others \nin the coming days, weeks, and months in an effort to accomplish that, \nbecause I have strong feelings about this issue. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to depart from the debate on the \nissue before us, which is an important issue. I appreciate the remarks \nmade by my colleague from North Dakota. I listened intently to what he \nhad to say, and I can understand his deep feelings about this issue.\n  I want to talk about another issue because today, across the street \nfrom where we sit in the Halls of the Senate, the U.S. Supreme Court is \nhearing arguments on a case involving the so-called partial-birth \nabortion law of the State of Nebraska. That law, passed by the Nebraska \nLegislature, is quite similar to the version the Senate and the House \nhave debated over the years. In fact, it is very similar to the one \npassed by the Senate last October.\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\n  However, the real issue in the case before the Supreme Court and in \nthe legislation before Congress is not about banning late term \nabortions. The real issue is about a systematic effort to overturn Roe \nV. Wade and to criminalize all abortions. The real issue is about \nwhether we trust women, in consultation with their faith and their \nfamily, to make this very difficult, personal decision or do we put \nthat trust in politicians? That is what this is really all about.\n  Last October 21, during debate on the so-called partial-birth \nabortion bill in the Senate, I, along with Senator Boxer, offered a \nresolution to this so-called partial-birth abortion bill. Our \nresolution was very simple. It stated that it was the sense of the \nSenate that Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and should not be \nrepealed.\n  Let me read for the record the entire text of that resolution because \nit was very simple and very straightforward.\n\n       (a) Findings: Congress finds that--\n       (1) reproductive rights are central to the ability of women \n     to exercise their full rights under Federal and State law;\n       (2) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973));\n       (3) the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n     established constitutionally based limits on the power of \n     States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy; and\n       (4) women should not be forced into illegal and dangerous \n     abortions as they often were prior to the Roe v. Wade \n     decision.\n       (b) Sense of Congress: It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures an \n     important constitutional right; and\n       (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n\n  That is the full text of the resolution that I and Senator Boxer \noffered last October 21.\n  By invalidating the laws that forced many women to seek unsafe, and \noften deadly back-alley abortions, Roe was directly responsible for \nsaving women's lives. It is estimated that as many as 5,000 women a \nyear died from illegal abortions before Roe.\n  Roe v. Wade is the moderate, mainstream policy on which American \nwomen have come to rely. It recognized the right of women to make their \nown decisions about their own reproductive health. And very \nimportantly, it provides specific protections for the life and the \nhealth of women.\n  So the vote on the Harkin-Boxer amendment last October to finally put \nthe Senate on record about its support for the mainstream Roe decision \nwas very important. It was the first vote directly ever held here on \nwhether the Senate wants to go back to the days of back-alley \nabortions.\n  Our amendment barely passed, 51-47. Fifty-one said yes, Roe v. Wade \nwas a good decision, it should not be overturned. Forty-seven Senators \nvoted against that resolution, basically saying they did not agree with \nRoe v. Wade and that it should be overturned.\n  Frankly, I was shocked at how close the vote on our amendment was. In \nfact, in offering the amendment, I thought: Here is a chance for an \noverwhelming vote of support by the Senate in confirming the Supreme \nCourt decision on Roe v. Wade.\n  But after that close vote, I then realized that the vote really \nlifted the veil of moderation of antichoice Senators. For so many who \nwere saying, that they support Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to \nchoose, they just want to ban partial birth abortion, here was the \nchance to express that. With 47 votes against Roe v. Wade, the veil has \nbeen lifted. Now we know what is the real agenda. The agenda is to \ncriminalize choice, criminalize freedom of choice for women.\n\n  While the Nation's attention is refocused on the issue of choice with \ntoday's Supreme Court case, I also want to shed some light on what has \nbeen going on behind the scenes in Congress since the Senate very \nclosely approved our amendment.\n  What would normally happen is that after the Senate passed the bill \nwith our amendment, the House would act on the Senate-passed bill and \nrequest a conference with the Senate to work out the differences \nbetween the two bodies. Instead, the House of Representatives avoided a \nvote on our amendment. They took up a clean bill and sent it over here \nin order to avoid a conference. So it is clear that the Republican \nleadership in the House does not want to have to take a vote on this \nissue. In fact, the House has never had a vote on the issue of support \nfor Roe v. Wade.\n  Why else would the House majority take the unusual step of punting \nthe bill back to the Senate for a unanimous consent instead of taking \nit to conference? It is clear the Republican leadership in the House \ndid not want to have a vote, which would be allowed under the House \nrules to instruct the House conferees to support my amendment in \nconference, thus putting the House on record, once and for all, as to \nwhether or not they support Roe v. Wade.\n  Again, the Republican leadership in the House wants to continue to \nhide their true agenda. They want to hide behind a false cloak of \nmoderation on the issue of choice.\n  Senator Boxer and I have objected to this latest maneuver. Let me be \nclear. Every time the so-called partial-birth abortion bill, or any \nother antichoice legislation, comes to the Senate floor, I will offer \nmy amendment, and there will be another vote on the Roe v. Wade \nresolution. People in the leadership know that. That is why they have \nnot bothered to bring up any of their antichoice legislation since the \nlast vote on October 21. They know I will offer my amendment every \nsingle time to lift their veil of moderation.\n  So today I am challenging the House Republican leadership to allow a \nvote on our amendment. Let's let people know where their \nrepresentatives stand on the basic issue of choice, the basic issue of \nRoe v. Wade. Because Roe v. Wade is the moderate, mainstream policy on \nwhich American women have come to rely. The Roe v. Wade vote in the \nSenate should send a wakeup call to all Americans that this policy is \nin jeopardy. They need to act to maintain it.\n  In this most personal of decisions, we need to trust women, not \npoliticians, to make the choice. That is what this is all about. \nWhether it is the case in front of the Supreme Court or whether it is \nthe vote in the Senate, the issue is simply this: Do you trust \npoliticians, whether they are in a State government or in the Federal \nGovernment, to make this decision for women or do you trust women?\n  People of strong faith and good conscience have very different views \non the issue of abortion. I respect both sides on this often divisive \nissue. I have struggled with it personally myself.\n  Whether or not we agree, we should all work together to find \ncommonsense, common ground steps to reduce the number of abortions and \nto protect the health and well-being of women and children. That means \nfully funding maternal and child health programs, fully funding the \nWomen, Infants, and Children's feeding programs, fully funding \ncontraceptive coverage, family planning services, and better adoption \noptions, just to name a few of the policies we ought to be about.\n  But the bottom line is this: Roe v. Wade was an enlightened decision. \nIt is moderate. It puts the basic decisions on reproductive health \nwhere it belongs, with the woman and not with the Government.\n  Today, as the Supreme Court, across the street, listens to the \narguments on the Nebraska partial-birth abortion law, let us resolve \nthat we are going to maintain a woman's basic right to choose, that we \nwill not let the politicians take it over, that we will not return to \nthe dark days of back-alley abortions and the criminalization of a \nwoman's own right to choose her reproductive health. That is what this \nissue is about.\n\n  The women of this country are counting on us to make sure we uphold \nthe decision in Roe v. Wade. We cannot afford to let them down.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor of the Senate because \nI noted that my friend, Senator Harkin from Iowa, was talking about a \nvery important subject, a woman's right to choose. This right has been \nprotected.\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\n After the case Roe v. Wade in 1973, a woman has had that right.\n  Today we are looking at a different type of constitutional amendment. \nSenator Harkin made the point that, in fact, we have a case being heard \nat the Supreme Court which is going to essentially look at a woman's \nright to choose. I think it is appropriate that he would come over to \nmake a few points, and I would like to engage him in a colloquy, if he \nwould be willing to do that.\n  First, I ask him to reiterate for me the basic point he made. We see \nin the Senate tens of votes we have to face on the issue of a woman's \nright to choose and the different aspects of it, whether a person who \nlives in the District of Columbia can use her insurance paid by the \ncity to obtain a legal abortion, whether a Federal employee has that \nright, whether a woman in the military has the right to use a clean \nmedical facility to exercise her rights, whether a woman in the late \nstage of a pregnancy that has turned desperately wrong has the right to \nhave her health protected. We stand here on so many occasions casting \nthese votes, having this debate ostensibly about a narrower issue \nsurrounding a woman's right to choose.\n  I wonder if my friend believes that is the real goal of the people \nwho continually bring up this matter or whether it is, in fact, \nsomething quite deep, which is trying to erode a woman's right to \nchoose, that basic right that was given to her after the Roe v. Wade \ndecision in 1973.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California for her long and \nstrong support for the decision in Roe v. Wade. The Senator from \nCalifornia has been one of the most persistent and enlightened voices \nin the Senate--indeed, in the country--on protecting a woman's basic \nright to choose. I follow in her footsteps in many of these issues.\n  The Senator from California has really put her finger on it, the \npoint I was trying to make today. This partial-birth abortion law that \nthe Supreme Court is reviewing today, as well as the legislation before \nCongress--is just a smokescreen. Its a smokescreen which anti-choice \nMembers and groups are hiding behind in order to get their eventual \ngoal, which is the total repeal and overturn of Roe v. Wade, to take \naway the essential and basic fundamental rights about which the Senator \njust spoke.\n  Without Roe v. Wade and without that constitutionally protected right \nof women to have control over their own reproductive health, many of \nthe things about which the Senator just spoke would be gone. There \nwouldn't be any right for women in the military, there wouldn't be any \nright for women in the District of Columbia or anywhere else, to have \nthe kind of health coverage that would protect them in dire need when \nthey need help, when perhaps a pregnancy has gone terribly wrong and \nthey need immediate and very intensive medical help.\n  That was why I wanted to talk about it today. I don't want to \ninterfere in the Supreme Court decision. That is for them to decide \nover there. What I wanted to point out was that in conjunction with \nthat, here in the Halls of Congress there is a very dangerous game \nbeing played out where proponents of so-called partial-birth abortion \nreally have want to overturn the basic right to choose for women. That \nis why the two of us joined together last fall to offer that amendment.\n  I say this because the Senator and I worked together on this \namendment. We offered the amendment in good faith, thinking we were \ngoing to get an overwhelming vote of the Senate saying, yes, we support \nRoe v. Wade. I think both of us were shocked at how close we came.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was stunned that Roe v. Wade is hanging by a thread in \nthe Senate: 51-49; is that correct? It was very close.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 51-47; there were a couple of people who \nwere not here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There were a couple of Members who were not here. To \nthink that a basic right won by women when we were very young, in 1973, \nall those years ago, would be hanging by a thread in the year 2000 is \nreally amazing. I really do pray that the Supreme Court, as they \nindependently decide these issues in this particular case of the \nNebraska statute will recognize that what the Senator from Iowa says is \nabsolutely true. It is so important.\n  We have a big debate over some made-up terminology that doesn't even \nexist in medical books. There is no such thing as partial-birth \nabortion. There is either a birth or an abortion. That is it. The \ndescription of the method used is really a method that is used in the \nearly stages of a pregnancy as well. So if, in fact, that Nebraska case \nis upheld, women will be denied what is considered by many doctors to \nbe the safest method. That undermines Roe because Roe was a very \nmoderate decision. It basically said that before that fetus is viable, \nthe woman has an unfettered right to choose. But at any stage in the \npregnancy, one thing has to come first: the woman's life and the \nwoman's health.\n  I say to my friend, when we get into a pattern of outlawing specific \nprocedures and playing doctor--by the way, we do have one doctor in \nthis Senate, but he is not an OB/GYN--when we start to play doctor in \nthe Senate, we are going to endanger women's health.\n  If we start outlawing procedures we don't like--by the way, there is \nno medical procedure--something that is gruesome or you don't get upset \nby--if we start doing that, we will overturn Roe right here because we \nwill be saying a woman's health really is subordinate, doesn't matter, \nand what does it matter if a woman can't have a particular procedural \nand as a result she is paralyzed or can never bear another child? It \nwould be a disaster, and it would be overturning this basic right.\n  So I want to say to my friend that I appreciate his leadership. I \nenjoy working with him on this because we feel so deeply about it. \nBefore he leaves, I will make one more comment. I trust my friend \nmentioned this, but I am not sure because I was on my way over here. \nThe House of Representatives denied the House the opportunity to vote \non the Harkin-Boxer amendment. The House of Representatives in this \nyear has used a gag rule, if you will, to deny the Members of the House \na chance to stand up for or against Roe v. Wade. I wonder what they are \nso afraid of. Are they afraid that some of their Members are so to the \nright on this issue and so against public opinion, it would hurt them \nin their reelection?\n  Now is the time to be heard, when Roe is hanging by a thread, and we \nneed to have a vote over there. I hope my friend will continue to press \nthis point, as we say together that it is wrong to deny the House a \nchance to vote up or down on Roe.\n  I ask my friend for his closing comment on that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I appreciate the Senator's very lucid and clear \ndelineation of exactly what is going on here. It was a gag rule in the \nHouse. That is what they did. Under their rules, the Republican \nleadership would not allow a vote on our amendment. Again, I think it \nis because they don't want their veil of moderation lifted. They want \nto say this is only about partial birth. It is not, and we know it. It \nis about Roe v. Wade. Yet they don't want to have their people out \nthere voting on it.\n  I think the American people have a right to know where we stand on \nthis most fundamental right of women in this country.\n  Again, I thank my friend from California for her long and strong \nleadership on this issue. It is vitally important to all of us in this \ncountry that the basic, fundamental, constitutional rights that were \nenumerated in Roe v. Wade for the women of this country remain, and \nremain strong, and not be undermined in this body. So I thank the \nSenator for her strong leadership in this effort.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I see the Senator from Arizona on the \nfloor, so I will wrap up.\n  I think it is interesting and important, as we look at new amendments \nto the Constitution, that we think about the rights we already take for \ngranted. The women in this country have counted on the Constitution to \nprotect their right to choose. I only hope they will continue to have \nthat right. It is, in fact, hanging by a thread here in the Senate with \nonly 51 votes supporting that basic decision.\n  So I say it is a day to look at our rights, as we are looking at \nvictims' rights, or their lack of rights, and what ways we want to make \nsure victims have rights, and that we also consider if a woman is \ndenied a fundamental right to have control over her own\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nbody, if she is denied that, she will be a victim--a victim of this \nGovernment thinking that, in fact, it knows better than she or the \npeople who love her, and that the Government would think it would know \nbetter than her family, her God, and her conscience to make such a \nbasic decision.\n  So it is a good day to talk about Roe v. Wade. As we look at new \nrights we are giving people, let's also make sure we don't take away \nany rights.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2835-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES TO \n   PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the proponents of the crime victims' \nconstitutional rights amendment, as I understand it, have about 6 \nminutes remaining. Senator Feinstein has asked that I conclude our \nportion of this opening debate.\n  People who are viewing this might wonder what the last 35, 40 minutes \nhave been about. This wasn't supposed to be about abortion. How did \nthat get involved in the crime victims' rights amendment? Perhaps \nSenator Leahy began this trend when he first spoke this morning about \nthe possibility of gun control, abortion, and the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I think the point is that people who are not motivated to adopt a \nconstitutional set of rights for crime victims are willing to try to \nuse our hard work, our efforts, and our energy to bring this proposed \nconstitutional amendment to the Senate--which is very difficult to do--\nas a means of trying to tack on their favorite proposal, or to delay \nthe Senate action on the crime victims' rights amendment to the point \nthat we will have to move on to other pressing business. Either of \nthose possibilities, I think, would be very sad.\n  Let me recount what has happened here. For almost 4 years, Senator \nFeinstein and I have worked very patiently to bring forward a crime \nvictims' constitutional rights amendment. It is very difficult to get a \nconstitutional amendment to the floor of the Senate. We have had 66 \nwitnesses appear at hearings, with I think something like 15 pages of \ntestimony transcript. We have had hearing after hearing. We have gone \nthrough 63 different drafts to make this as perfect as we could. We \nhave gotten it out of the Judiciary Committee on a strong, bipartisan \nvote. Then we got the majority leader to give us some floor time, which \nis very precious.\n  In other words, we put a lot of work into this in support of victims \nof violent crime in our society. Throughout this building, and in \nothers, there are scores of victims and victims' rights organizations \naround television sets watching these proceedings, having finally \ngotten what they hope to be their ``day in court''--an argument about \nthe crime victims' rights amendment and a vote on that.\n  What is beginning to emerge is a very disturbing tactic by those who \noppose us, and that is either to try to delay this to the point that \nthe majority leader will have to move on to something else, by offering \nall kinds of extraneous amendments, or by seeking to achieve what they \nhave never been able to achieve through the normal legislative process, \nby using our proposal as a vehicle to attach their idea onto--in this \ncase, perhaps, abortion. What better way to kill ours while getting \nsome time to discuss their proposal.\n  Some of these same proponents are those who argue most vigorously \nagainst so-called riders to appropriations bills. They say, well, you \nshould not have an extraneous amendment on an appropriation bill. If \nyou are going to bring something to the floor, you should not debate \nsomething else. You should not amend it with something extraneous. We \nare willing to allow germane amendments to victims' rights in an effort \nto resolve how to best protect victims' rights. But what I fear I have \nseen here is a tactic either to defeat what we are trying to do or to \nuse what we are trying to do to advance an entirely different agenda. \nThat would be wrong.\n  The people watching this debate must be saying: There they go again. \nWhat are these Senators doing? They had a proposal to bring forth a \ncrime victims' rights amendment to the floor, and, by procedural \nlegerdemain, is that going to be prevented, overcome by an abortion \namendment or something of that sort? We hope not. The bottom line is \nthat there is a reason all of the people who support this amendment \nhave said it is now time for a Federal constitutional rights amendment.\n\n  As we have seen this morning, States have been unable to protect the \nrights of crime victims with State statutes and their own State \nconstitutional amendments. Attorneys general and prosecutors support \nthis. Law enforcement supports it. The Attorney General of Wisconsin, \nJim Doyle--a very respected Democratic attorney general--said this \nbefore the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       I believe that most prosecutors strongly support victims' \n     rights.\n\n  He notes some of the concerns of prosecutors. He said:\n\n       I believe these concerns are more than adequately addressed \n     in S.J. Res. 3.\n\n  The bottom line is that we have support from victims' rights groups, \nprosecutors, attorneys general, and Governors, and it is time now to \ndecide whether we want to protect crime victims or not. We have an \nopportunity by bringing this matter to the floor. At 2:15, we will have \na vote on what is called a cloture motion on a motion to proceed. If 60 \ncolleagues agree, we will be able to go forward and debate the motion \nto proceed, which I assume will be adopted later today. Then we can \nproceed with debate on the constitutional amendment itself. We look \nforward to that. If people want to bring forward relevant amendments to \nthat, so be it. That is what the process is about. But I fear what will \nhappen if, instead, we get a series of nongermane amendments or \nattempts to delay this, to the point that we run out of time and, in \neffect, a filibuster has killed any hope these crime victims have of \nprotecting their rights in our courts.\n  We have waited too long. Eighteen years ago President Reagan's \nCommission on Crime Victims recommended the constitutional amendment to \naddress these rights. Eighteen years is long enough to wait. I hope \nwhen we finally have an opportunity on the Senate floor, that \nopportunity is not snatched away by people who want to pursue other \nagendas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents is expired; the \nopponents have 9 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 82, the nays are 12. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I voted against a motion to close \ndebate on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 3, a victims' rights \nconstitutional amendment. Only twelve Senators voted no, although a far \nlarger number oppose this resolution. I was prepared to vote yes on the \nmotion, because the rights of victims are terribly important and a \nresolution like this ought to be thoroughly debated. But before the \nvote I learned that the language of this resolution to amend the \nConstitution is still being negotiated. This ought to be a solemn, \nsoberly undertaken effort, for it presumes to revise the work of \nMadison and Hamilton and those great Americans who put to paper the \ningenious design of the American republic in that hot Philadelphia room \n224 years ago. But instead, we were asked today to begin that debate in \nearnest while the supporters of the resolution were still off in a room \nsomewhere trying to agree on the language of the resolution.\n  So I said no. I said no to this casual, cavalier approach to amending \nthe Constitution. It does not respect the seriousness of the process \nand has led to constitutional profligacy in the Congress--to hundreds \nof constitutional amendments being offered as if they were not gravely \nimportant, as if they were not an attempt to edit the organic law that \nhas held our democracy together for two centuries. In the opening days \nof some recent Congresses, we have seen constitutional amendments \nintroduced at a rate of more than one per day.\n  A few weeks ago, we considered a constitutional amendment to allow \nprohibition of flag desecration. I opposed that amendment, but I didn't \noppose cloture on the motion to proceed. I voted for cloture because \nthe backers of the flag amendment, wrong as I thought they were, at \nleast showed some respect for the process. They believed there was a \nneed for the amendment and they were able to point to particular events \nand precedents that they believed needed to be addressed. But no court \nhas struck down the dozens of state constitution provisions and \nhundreds of statutes that protect victims' rights across America today, \nso why rush to amend the Constitution? The backers of the flag \namendment argued, correctly, that their goal of allowing prohibition of \nsome forms of speech could be realized only by a constitutional \namendment. They offered a resolution that had been refined over time, \nwhose supporters at least, had agreed upon. All of us were aware, long \nbefore the vote, what the resolution said. The vote on proceeding to \nthe flag debate was not held in a fluid situation, where negotiations \nabout language that might end up in our Constitution were still talking \nplace. So we voted as Senators to proceed and we did proceed to a \nsober, deliberate and thoughtful debate and an informed vote about the \nflag amendment.\n  Today, on the victims rights amendment, the process was not \nrespected. The Senate acquiesced in a casual exercise in constitutional \nimprovisation, shunning the statutory alternatives that are readily \navailable, to embrace the near immutability of constitutional language. \nSo I voted no--to say we are not ready to have this debate, but we will \nhave the debate and we may now add one more reason to the many reasons \nto oppose this resolution: its proponents have not respected the \nprocess and we are obliged to assume that their constitutional \namendment, even if it were right in its general substance, must be \nflawed in its language and details.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is the motion to proceed to S.J. \nRes. 3.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there having been a cloture vote on that \nmotion to proceed, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator would have up to 1 hour of \ndebate, with a maximum of 30 hours total.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And within that 30 hours, am I correct, under the \nprecedent of the Senate, Senators can yield part of their time to other \nSenators but not in such a way as to enlarge the 30 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As long as it does not extend beyond a total \nof 30 hours. The yielding of time must go to the managers.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The leaders or their designees?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will claim such part \nof my hour as I might consume.\n  It was less than a month ago, I recall, I stood on the floor of the \nSenate to defend the Bill of Rights against the proposed flag amendment \nto our Constitution. The Senate voted March 29 to preserve the \nConstitution and refused to limit the first amendment and the Bill of \nRights by means of that proposed amendment. Apparently, preserving the \nConstitution in March does not mean the Constitution is safe in April. \nSo here I am again as we begin to debate yet another proposed amendment \nto the Constitution. Yet, again, I am here to speak out in favor of the \nintegrity of our national charter.\n  I support crime victims' assistance and rights, but I do not support \nthis proposed amendment to the Constitution. Just as opposition to a \nflag desecration amendment does not mean a Senator is in favor of flag \nburning, opposition to a victims' rights amendment does not mean that a \nSenator opposes justice for victims of crime. In fact, during the \ncourse of this debate, we will have a statutory alternative to the \nproposed constitutional amendment that would serve to advance crime \nvictims' rights.\n  I have been in the Senate for 25 years. I think it is safe to say \nthat I have been a very strong advocate for victims' rights during that \ntime. My initial involvement with victims' rights began more than three \ndecades ago when I served as State's attorney for Chittenden County, \nVermont. According to our population and under\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nour procedures at that time, by virtue of the office, at the age of 26, \nI became the chief law enforcement officer for the County. I saw \nfirsthand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure \nthat the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and \nthe dignity of victims of crime and domestic violence, rather than one \nthat presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.\n  I will continue to work for victims of crime and domestic violence in \nthe course of this debate. I support crime victims and their rights, \nbut I oppose this constitutional amendment. As a prosecutor, I was able \nto make sure victims were heard, that sentencing decisions were made \nwith the rights of victims in mind, that plea bargains were not entered \ninto without the rights of victims in mind. They were all heard. I also \nknew we could do that individually, or by State statute, or by State \nconstitution. But we didn't have to amend the United States \nConstitution.\n  The proposed amendment, S.J. Res. 3, goes on for over 60 lines. I \nbelieve the most important part of our national charter, the \nConstitution, is the first amendment. This magnificent part of our \ndocument, in just five or six lines, says that we have the right of \nfree speech, we have freedom of religion--that is, to practice any \nreligion we want, or none if we want--we have the right to petition our \nGovernment, and we have the right of assembly. These rights, enunciated \nin just five or six lines in the Constitution, preserve the diversity--\nactually, they almost demand diversity in our country, and they protect \ndiversity in our country. If you have diversity, especially diversity \nthat is protected, you have democracy. Those five or six lines are the \nbedrock of our democracy and our freedom.\n\n  Contrast this with S.J. Res. 3. As I said earlier, I don't doubt the \nsincerity of my two friends, the chief sponsors of this; they are my \nfriends and they are two people I respect. But this is over 60 lines. \nIt is like a complicated statute, which will be made more complicated \nas the courts get a hold of it, as prosecutors have to figure out what \nis going on, and as defense attorneys look for loopholes. No place in \nit does it mention what we have always built our criminal justice \nsystem on--the protection of the rights of the accused.\n  James Madison, the great framer of the Constitution, instructed that \na constitutional amendment should be limited to ``certain great and \nextraordinary occasions.'' Well, we have one thing that is great and \nextraordinary and that is our country and our democracy. It has made us \nthe most powerful and influential nation on Earth today. But these are \nnot great and extraordinary occasions that demand the amending of the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  I find it distressing that we so ignore James Madison's instructions \nand advice and that there are almost 60 proposed constitutional \namendments pending before this Congress alone, including an amendment \nto make it easier to adopt other amendments in the future. Now, if we \nare going to do this, let's do it on everything. Let's have an \namendment on gun control. Let's have an amendment on abortion. Let's \nhave an amendment on reapplying from where Senators can serve. Let's do \na number of other things. Some of the amendments that have been \nproposed look as if they were before a local board of select people. We \nshould not be so eager to amend our Constitution. Look at Article V of \nthe Constitution and read the first part of the first sentence. It \nsays:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary. . . .\n  Does anyone think the American people would ``deem this necessary''?\n  At one time, after the President at the time sent up unbalanced \nbudget after unbalanced budget, Congress said the only way to stop us \nfrom spending was to have a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. Fortunately, we do not have such a constitutional amendment \ntoday. Instead, we have a President who had the guts to send up a \nbalanced budget, and we had a Congress who had the guts to back him up \nand pass it. That is how to do it--the old-fashioned way.\n  I believe this particular proposed constitutional amendment regarding \ncrime victims' rights fails to set the standards set by our founders in \nArticle V of the Constitution. It cannot be necessary. Let me state \nwhy: Over the last several years, we have been making great strides in \nprotecting crime victims' rights. We have accomplished much in 20 years \nto advance the cause of crime victims' rights, through State law and \nFederal statutory improvements, through increased training or \neducation, and through implementation efforts. There is no basis today \nfor concluding that this constitutional amendment is necessary for \nproviding crime victims' rights in the criminal justice process.\n  There is a growing fascination in the Congress with amending our \nConstitution first and legislating second. No Member knows how long he \nor she will be in the Senate. I have been privileged in the State of \nVermont. My friends in the State of Vermont have sent me here for over \n25 years. They do remind me that Vermont is the only State in the Union \nthat has elected only one member from my party to the Senate, but I am \nthankful they do it by ever increasingly large margins. I don't know \nhow long I will be here; no Member does.\n  As long as I am here, I will take upon myself the duty to say to the \nSenate: Slow down on this idea of amending the Constitution. Slow down.\n  Whatever short-term political gain Members may feel today, your \nchildren and your children's children will in all likelihood live by \nwhat you do. The temptation was there for the framers of the \nConstitution. I am sure they looked at the differences between the \nStates and thought, if I amend the Constitution just this way, my State \nhas an advantage or I have an advantage over this person. Instead, they \nresisted the temptation. Maybe that is why we are the oldest currently \nexisting democracy in the world. Maybe that is why we have a First \nAmendment, something not duplicated in any other nation on Earth. Maybe \nthat is why we protect ourselves and our rights as we do, because we \nknow we have resisted over the years the 11,000 suggested amendments to \nthe Constitution. Of those 11,000 amendments, one has to assume that \nsomebody in every single instance thought their amendment was extremely \nimportant. Every one of those 11,000 times, somebody somewhere thought: \nThis is the amendment to the Constitution that we really need; this is \nthe amendment that falls under Article V which says it is necessary.\n  I was the 21st person in the history of this country to vote 10,000 \ntimes in the Senate. Those 10,000 votes were not all necessary for this \ncountry. Sometimes they were votes called by the Sergeant at Arms, and \nsometimes they were to adjourn. Sometimes they were votes to commend \nourselves for doing something we were paid to do anyway. Of course, \nsometimes they were extraordinarily important votes.\n  I took pride in being the 21st person in our Nation's history to vote \nthat many times. But I wouldn't have taken pride to think I voted \nalmost the same number of times for a different constitutional \namendment. Yet 11,000 constitutional amendments have been before the \nSenate. Imagine our Constitution if the 11,000 amendments had passed. \nHeck, take half of them. Imagine our Constitution if 5,500 passed. \nImpossible. Say 10 percent, 1,100, passed; 5 percent, 550; 1 percent, \n110, passed. If we had taken a tiny fraction of these 11,000 that were \nso essential to this Nation, our Constitution would not be something \nthat would be revered around the world, that other countries would try \nto emulate; it would be a laughingstock.\n\n  Until we do our job with statutes, until we find the ways within the \nState, until we explore other ways to help with victims' rights, until \nwe follow through with the commitment of necessary resources, until we \nlook at all those States that have passed their own victims' rights \nlaws, until we accept the fact that not one single court has found \nthose unconstitutional, thus saying we don't need a constitutional \namendment, until we do that, why do we amend the Constitution again?\n  As I said, I don't know how much longer I have in the Senate. \nHowever, I will stand on this floor, constitutional amendment after \nconstitutional amendment. This is a wonderful document. Don't change \nit. Don't change it\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nunless an amendment falls under Article V and really is necessary. This \nis not necessary.\n  It is ironic, at the height of the key dynamic changes in increased \nrights and protections for crime victims over the last decade, the \nefforts on behalf of this constitutional amendment have had the \nunfortunate, and I believe unintended, fact of slowing that process and \ndissipating those efforts.\n  Who suffered? The crime victims. Crime victims are among the most \nsympathetic figures. And they should be. They are also some of the most \npolitically powerful groups in our society today. We are all supportive \nof crime victims. That probably takes political courage, to say we \nshould ask some questions, because it takes little political courage to \nsay you are in favor of crime victims; we all our. It is not whether we \nsupport crime victims, because we all do. Certainly, those of us like \nmyself who have been prosecutors, who have seen firsthand the beaten \nvictims, the stabbed victims--I even had a murder victim die in my arms \nwhile he was telling me who killed him--understand victims. But this \ndebate is not about those victims. It is whether the Senate will \nendorse the amendment to the United States Constitution. I will do all \nin my power to make sure we do not amend the Constitution.\n\n  April is an especially sensitive time of year for crime victims and \nthose who advocate for them. Frankly, I feel every day we should be \nadvocating for them. Two weeks ago was the 20th anniversary of Crime \nVictims' Rights Week. During that time, I was one of the few Senators \nwho came to the floor to try to make progress on crime victims' rights \nby proposing an improved version of the Crime Victims Assistance Act, \nS. 934.\n  Last week, we observed the fifth anniversary of the bombing of the \nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Some of us have worked long and hard \nfor the victims of crime and terrorism around the world. I was proud to \nbe the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act amendment to the anti-\nterrorism bill that passed the Senate in the wake of that tragedy of \nJune, 1995, which served as the basis for what became the victims \nprovisions ultimately enacted in 1996.\n  I worked with Senator Nickles and others to provide closed circuit \ntelevision coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing trials. I supported \nspecial assistance for victims and their families to attend and \nparticipate in the trials, including enactment of the Victims Rights \nClarification Act in 1997 to help ensure those who attended the early \nportion of the trial could also testify or attend during the sentencing \nphase.\n  I do not need to be told by anybody that I have to be sympathetic \nwith victims of crime. I have done that throughout my professional \ncareer. I have done it in legislation. I did it for 8 years as a \nprosecutor.\n  But I also look at some of the things we are not doing here in \nCongress. Last Thursday, we observed the first anniversary of the \ntragic violence at Columbine High School in Colorado. That anniversary \nserved as a reminder of the school violence we have witnessed too often \nover the past few years. Yet the Senate and House have not completed \ntheir work on the juvenile crime bill, a bill that passed the Senate \nlast May by a margin of almost 3 to 1.\n  The Hatch-Leahy bill passed this body 73-25. Since then, the \nRepublican leadership continues its refusal to convene the House-Senate \nconference necessary to complete action on this measure. Tell that to \nthe families who were at the zoo here in Washington D.C. yesterday. \nTell them the gun lobby will tell us when we can meet and when we \ncannot, in the United States Congress. Tell those families.\n  We, oftentimes, have emotional issues that come before us. This past \nweekend Elian Gonzalez was reunited with his father, Juan Miguel \nGonzalez. You know what happened there. The great uncle had temporary \ncustody, custody was revoked, he refused to do a voluntary transfer of \nthe child, the Attorney General finally had to act to reunite them and \nsay the United States would uphold its own laws. I think it was done in \nthe right way. Everybody is running around: We'll have a special \ncitizenship bill, special amnesty bill, special whatever else. I say, \nremember what the Senate is supposed to be. Remember that wonderful \nstory about the cup and saucer. We are the saucer that allows the \ncooling of the passions, and we should approach debate of a proposed \nconstitutional amendment with the seriousness and deliberation that it \nrequires.\n  We could go, instead, back to some of the legislative things we could \ndo right now, that could be signed into law right now, that might help \nvictims of crime.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey, a man who, \nthroughout his career here in the Senate, has worked so hard, not just \nfor victims of crime but for those laws that might ensure that at least \nwe have a diminution of crime, especially gun crimes. I am perfectly \nwilling to reserve my time and yield to the distinguished Senator if he \nwould care to speak.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. He \nhas a homespun way of talking at times, but he always brings good sense \nand good judgment to the debate. I appreciate his comments about how we \nhave to be so mindful of our responsibilities under the Constitution, \nand we ought not to trifle with amendments to the Constitution. The \nConstitution is the fundamental text of our democracy and we ought not \nto amend it if there are other ways to address the problem.\n  Some of those listening may have trouble following all of our twists \nof logic, but one thing should be clear--we all know we have too many \nvictims in our society. We know we have families torn apart, even if \nthey are not directly victims themselves. Look at Columbine High \nSchool. Who were the victims? Were they just the young people and the \nteacher who were killed and their families? Were they the only victims? \nOr was the whole high school population of Columbine a victim? Or was \nthe whole community of Littleton, Colorado that was the victim? Was the \nwhole country a victim? I think so.\n  All of us had images seared into our psyches that I think for most of \nus will last a lifetime. Were we victims of a sort? Were we victims of \nour lack of understanding of how we got to that point? Are we \nvictimized by violence that does not touch us immediately? I think so \nbecause otherwise we would not see these magnetic detectors all over \nthe place. We wouldn't have security guards all over the place, and we \nwouldn't be spending money building ever more prisons--money that could \nbe used for education or health care or prescription drugs or to help \nyoung people in our society. So we are all victimized by crime.\n  That is the problem with the constitutional amendment that is \nproposed--defining who is the victim. Once again, is it the family \nwhose house was broken into and the terrible deeds that followed? Or is \nit everybody in the neighborhood? Or is it young child who lost a \nfriend who was 6 years old, who do not understand why the friend was \nmurdered by another 6-year-old child? Who is the victim? Even the \nfamily of a perpetrator of a terrible crime is often a victim.\n  Given the difficulty of defining who is a victim, it might be better \nto address this statutorily. We ought to write a statute that very \nclearly says: Yes, victims' rights have to be protected. We have said \nit so many times over the years, writing laws as opposed to amending \nthe Constitution. That is the question, really. No one is saying we \nshould not take care of the victims. But the question is whether you \ntry to address the problem by statute or if you take the much more \ndrastic step of amending the Constitution.\n  And when we talk about victims we should remember all of the people \nwho have suffered because of the proliferation of guns.\n  Look at what happened yesterday at the National Zoo. Seven young \npeople were shot. I have my four children and their spouses and seven \ngrandchildren, the oldest of whom is 6, coming to Washington in a few \nweeks commemorating, with the grandfather of the family, my career in \nthe Senate. We are going to celebrate. Because they are all so young, \nto amuse them I said we would go to the zoo. I am not as enthusiastic \nabout going to the zoo today as I was a couple of weeks ago when we \nthought about this.\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\n  I am worried about what might happen in public gatherings. The two \noldest of my grandchildren--again, they are little kids--are in school. \nI call my daughters and say: How are the kids? When I see something \nthat goes awry in a school and a 6-year-old child can kill another 6-\nyear-old child because of someone's careless possession of a gun, their \ncareless abandonment of normal safety protections, I worry about them. \nI worry not only for my family. I worry mostly, obviously, as we all \ndo, about my family. But I also worry about all of the violence that \npermeates our society. There is enough of that on television--even in \ncartoons. And I think that some of the depictions of violence may \nencourage violent behavior. The seeds may be there, but the \nencouragement, the nurturing of those seeds often takes place in movies \nand television where the hero is the guy who comes in with a gun \nblazing. Who he is killing we are never quite sure, but he is killing \npeople.\n  If we want to take care of the victims, then we ought to pass a law \nand be bold about it and not fall prey to public posturing and say \namend the Constitution. How many other rights ought to be included as \nwe talk about victims? Should parents' rights be protected? Should \ngrandparents' rights be protected? Should workers' rights be protected? \nShould women be protected? We think so. They are very often victims of \ncrimes that do not necessarily leave a mark that one can see but often \ndoes enormous damage to their psyche and to their mental well-being--\nharassment, sexual harassment. Are we amending the Constitution to deal \nwith that? No, we are not.\n  And we need to stop the political posturing about many issues. For \nexample, we need to stop all of the posturing on gun control and take \naction.\n  I wrote an amendment and presented it to the Senate when we were \ndiscussing the juvenile justice bill. The amendment is very simple--it \nwould close the gun show loophole. We received 50 votes on each side. \nNo, that is not fair to say. Fifty votes for and 50 votes against, \nincluding some of my Republican friends who agreed with us that we \nought to close a loophole in gun shows that permits people to buy guns \nwithout identifying themselves. I call it buyers anonymous: Someone \ngoes in, puts their money down, and walks out with as many guns as they \ncan physically carry. They can even come back for another load. There \nis no identification required. Even though some in this Senate want to \nprotect that practice, my amendment prevailed. With the Vice President \ncasting the tie-breaking vote, the amendment passed 51-50.\n  It was a dramatic day. We all worked so hard. But since then, the \njuvenile justice bill has been stalled in a conference committee.\n  There is a game played around here--political football. If you are in \nthe majority and do not like something, you have the ability to stop \nthe legislation from moving. We established a Senate conference \ncommittee with a House conference committee, which is the normal \nprocess. They confer on differences that each of the Houses has on \ntheir legislation. We sent it to the House. The conferees took forever \nto be named. Finally, we got conferees.\n  What did they do to keep the public from knowing, to keep potential \nvictims from understanding what might be happening? They did nothing. \nThe distinguished Senator from Vermont, who always brings sense to our \nbody when he discusses issues with which he is so familiar, mentioned \nit. April 20 was the 1-year--I do not even like to use the word \n``anniversary''--but it was one year since that horrible day we all \nwitnessed--kids running, young people in the prime of life killed.\n\n  There is nothing more satisfying to me, perhaps because of my white \nhair and age, than seeing young people in the full blush of youth \nenjoying themselves. Sometimes they do silly things. It is fun when I \nsee young people, whether they are little young people or 16, 17, or 19 \nyears old. I joined the Army when I was 18. I did not realize how young \nit was until I looked back.\n  Young people who were enjoying themselves were mowed down by two \nyoung killers at Columbine High School. Families were brought to the \nworst grief anyone can imagine. A young man was hanging out the window \npleading for help. We do not know what he was saying. One can imagine \nwhat he was saying. His hand was outstretched trying to reach for \nsafety wherever he could go get it, a refuge from the madness \nsurrounding him. That was April 20, 1999. April 20, 2000--nothing has \nhappened. Nothing. I say let's vote on it--you can vote for gun safety \nor against it. Let the public see how you voted. But no, they do not \nwant to do that because they are all scared in their own way. They are \nscared the public is going to see that they will not take steps to end \ngun violence.\n  Here we are. We had promises recently that we would be voting on a \nconference bill, and we ought to do that pretty soon. All they have to \ndo is say to the conferees, ``Get the job done,'' and the bill will be \non the floor. But we cannot get them to do that.\n  The majority--and I talk with all due respect in friendship about the \nmajority--is in charge. That is the way it is. I wish it was otherwise, \nfrankly, but the Republicans are in charge, and the Republican leader \nhas not brought it up, though he said he wants to bring it up. He said \nit publicly. On April 9, when asked, he said he would bring it up soon. \nOn ``Face the Nation,'' a very well-known program, he said he would be \namenable to bringing it up. He was asked by Bob Schieffer: ``Don't you \nhave to get the conference committee to meet? Why don't you at least \nhave a meeting?'' in reference to the conference committee on juvenile \njustice, one part of which is an attempt to control gun violence.\n  The majority leader said they were talking about it.\n  Schieffer came back and said: ``Let me pin you down. Do you think \nyou're going to get that conference committee to meet to kind of get \nthis started?''\n  The response by the majority leader was, ``I do.''\n  That was April 9. Today is April 25. April 9 to April 25, that does \nnot seem as if it is rushing to do things.\n  It was promised. Well, the majority leader said, ``I do.''\n  Schieffer said, ``This week?''\n  The majority leader, again, with all due respect, said, ``I don't \nknow if it will be this week, but we will get it done in the next few \nweeks.''\n  There have been a few weeks. Why don't we get this done? We are all \nconcerned about victims of crime, but let's pass legislation that will \nprevent people from becoming victims of crime.\n  I continue to urge the Congress to move forward on gun safety. And \nwhat is the response of the Republican Party--the Republican Senate \ngroup. Well, here is what GOP aide John Czwartacki said in Roll Call:\n\n       It is a shame but no surprise that they would exploit the \n     tragedy of these children's deaths to promote a political \n     agenda.\n\n  That is what he said. He said it in response to a commitment that I \nand several other Senators made that we would do whatever we could to \nget that juvenile justice bill moved along so we could discuss ways of \nreducing gun violence.\n  At times I wonder what it will take for people in this chamber to get \nthe message. Despite what the American public says, despite what \nparents say, despite the fact that there will be a million moms \nmarching on Mother's Day--some members of this body refuse to act.\n  Why? Why is it that the voice of the NRA, the National Rifle \nAssociation, can be heard so clearly in this place and so clearly \ninfluences legislation. Why is it that special interest voice sound so \nloudly in this place that the majority will not bring up legislation \nthat says: Close the gun show loophole so unlicensed dealers cannot \nsell guns to unidentified buyers? Why is it?\n  Why is it that it drowns out millions of voices? Look at some of the \npolling data. In overwhelming majorities, up as high as 90 percent, \npeople say: Shut down that gun show loophole. But those voices do not \nget through here.\n  It is quite an amazing process of physics that the sounds travel all \nthe way here from the NRA office in Washington, but across this country \nwhere everybody is supposed to be represented in this body, those \nvoices do not get through. They do not see the tears. They do not \nunderstand the grief. They do not hear the pleas of people who have \nbecome victims as a result of a loss of a child or a loss of a loved \nmember of a family. Those voices\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\ndo not get through. But the voice of the NRA, with its control of some \nof the people that work here and in the other body--control, that is \nwhat happens--they set the agenda.\n  As we discuss victims of crime and constitutional amendments, it \nbears a note of hypocrisy because buried in there, in my view, is this \noverhanging question about what constitutes a victim, as I earlier \ndiscussed. What should the Constitution be open to? In the more than \n200 years we have had the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, it has \nbeen amended 18 times. It is a deliberate violation of what constitutes \ngood judgment very sparingly.\n  One of the dreaded thoughts that passes through so many of our minds \nis amending the Constitution for one thing after another. We have had \nseveral goes at that very recently when it was thought maybe we would \namend the Constitution to do things that we ought to take care of by \nlaw.\n  I will close, but just with this reminder. Here is a picture of one \nterrible person. He is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. Guess what. \nHe can go up to an unlicensed dealer at a gun show and buy guns. He \ndoes not even have to worry about them calling the cops because they do \nnot ask his identification when selling weapons.\n\n  There is enormous pressure to keep this gun show loophole in place. \nImagine, those criminals on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and any one \nof them could walk in to a gun show and approach an unlicensed dealer \nand say: Give me a dozen of these or two dozen of those, and here is \nthe money, and the deal is done.\n  It is my hope we will resolve the dispute that is in front of us now \nin a statutory fashion; that is, to write law, not to amend the \nConstitution. Start there. Extend the debate so that all points of view \nare sufficiently heard. Let's let the public know what we are talking \nabout when we do this.\n  But even as we contemplate the course of action on this \nconstitutional amendment--I think it was with 80-some votes that we \nsaid we ought to move ahead. Some of those who voted for cloture, \nhowever, are just interested in opening up the debate and not really \nsupporting the constitutional amendment.\n  I say to all my colleagues, I intend to continue to push for the \nconferees on the juvenile justice bill to sit down and talk and to come \nup with a conference report. Come up with their conclusion, whatever \nthat happens to be, and let the American public know that they are not \njust sitting on their hands as a way of killing this legislation. And \nthose who oppose it should have the courage to speak up and say: No, I \ndon't want to control gun violence that way. Guns don't kill. People \nkill. Or they may say: The little boy who is 6 years old is a criminal \nthat the police should have been watching, I suppose, before he went to \nschool that day with that gun.\n  There are so many times when a person becomes a criminal for the \nfirst time when they pull that trigger. But the response is always the \nsame--guns don not kill, people kill. Well, you do not have many drive-\nby knifings. It's a lot easier to kill people with a gun.\n  So we are going to do whatever we can. We are going to seize whatever \nopportunities we can. We are going to stand and shout this message \nuntil it is heard all the way across this country, so that people will \ncall this place, call their Senator, call their Representative, and \ntell them they want to see something done about gun violence in this \ncountry, that they are sick and tired of losing thousands and thousands \nof people to gun violence.\n  There are 33,000 victims in a year, when a country such as Japan and \nthe UK and others have less than 100. We sure do not have 300 times \ntheir population.\n  There are ways to control violence. One of them is to take these \nlethal instruments out of the hands of people who are not qualified to \nhave them.\n  I wrote a law to take guns away from those who are domestic abusers, \nguys who like to beat up their wives or kids, or guys who like to beat \nup their girlfriends.\n  We had a heck of a fight here. Finally, with President Clinton's \nhelp, we got a bill signed one night that was attached to an \nappropriations bill.\n  The opponents said: It is not going to do any good; it is not going \nto matter. That was done in the fall of 1996. Since that time, we have \nstopped 33,000 requests to buy guns. 33,000 times that a spouse or a \nfriend or a child in a household doesn't have to hear somebody say, \n``If you don't do this, I'm going to blow your brains out''; 33,000 \ntimes in just over 3 years.\n  The gun lobby fought me and said that is junk, you don't need that, \nthat is silly, that is not where we ought to be going, we ought to be \nlocking people up, and so forth. Of course, we do lock them up. They \ndeserve to be locked up, if they are criminals. We lock up and enforce \nthe law in more cases now than at any time in the past. Convictions are \nway up. Housing criminals has become a problem. We don't have a \nsufficient number of jails to accommodate them.\n  I go with this promise: We will be back again. Not just on this bill, \nbut as we consider other pieces of legislation. We are going to fight \non this floor. Whether it is kids pulling out guns to resolve fights, \nor someone using a gun when they want to rob someone, we have to stop \nthe gun violence. I am sure the public will agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as I understand it, to debate this \namendment, S.J. Res. 3, I am entitled to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield myself that hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nhis eloquent words, his passion and leadership on this issue. I join \nwith him, helping in any way I can to see that we get to finally pass \nthe Lautenberg amendment which the country so much wants. I thank him \nfor his doggedness. We will prevail, I do believe. I thank the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  I am here to address S.J. Res. 3, the constitutional amendment for \nvictims' rights. As I guess my history in the Congress shows, I have \nbeen very concerned about crime issues. If one would have to say they \nhad a signature issue, for me, that has been it. I came to the view \nwhen I came to Congress--and am still of that view--that particularly \nin the 1980s and early 1990s, the pendulum had swung too far in the \ndirection of individual rights and not enough in the direction of \nsocietal rights. I spent a good portion of my time in the Congress \ntrying to bring that pendulum to the middle, joined by Democrats and \nRepublicans. I am very proud of that work.\n  I come to the floor because nothing in my time in the Senate has \ntroubled me more, has bothered me more, than the amendment we are \nbeginning to debate. I greatly respect the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, for the work they \nhave done on this issue. Frankly, my views are not dissimilar to theirs \non the issue of victims' rights. I helped write the law for right of \nallocution, for the victim to stand up at sentencing and say his or her \npiece. I have been extremely supportive of victims' rights.\n  Then why would I find this amendment so troubling, more troubling \nthan any other bill we have debated? Because I revere the Constitution. \nI consider America to this day the noble experiment the Founding \nFathers called it when they had written the Constitution. I believe the \nConstitution is a sacred document. The more I am in Government, the \nmore I almost tremble beside the wisdom of the Founding Fathers. \nSomeone called them the greatest group of geniuses. There may have been \nother individual geniuses who were greater than any single member who \nwrote the Constitution, but their collective genius was the greatest \ngroup assemblage of genius the world has known, a person wrote. I tend \nto share that.\n\n  Amending the document they put together is an awesome responsibility, \nsomething that should not be taken lightly, something that should be \ndone with the utmost care and forethought. One should only debate \nconstitutional amendments when there is no other way to go. We should \nnot mess with the Constitution. We should not tamper with the \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\n  Yet here we are today debating a victims' bill of rights, a \nconstitutional amendment on victims' rights, when not a single State \nsupreme court, and certainly not the U.S. Supreme Court, has declared \nany victims' rights statute unconstitutional. I repeat that amazing \nfact for my colleagues. For the first time we are here debating a \nconstitutional amendment with the other 19 amendments and with, of \ncourse, the 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights being different, where \nnot a single State supreme court and not the U.S. Supreme Court has \nruled any part of victims' rights unconstitutional.\n  What is called for here is a statute. I would support making a \nstatute, a law, almost the exact amendment, perhaps even the exact \namendment, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California are \nproffering. But a constitutional amendment? Why? Why? Why amend the \nConstitution when no law has been declared unconstitutional? We have \nnever done that in the over-200-year history of this Republic. We have \nnever taken something we believe in and said, let's immediately make it \na constitutional amendment.\n  We have debated constitutional amendments here because statutes were \nthrown out. We just did it on the flag burning amendment. People \nbelieve strongly that the flag should not be burned. The U.S. Supreme \nCourt said it was under the aegis, the penumbra, of the first \namendment. So we did our duty on this floor and debated whether we \nshould amend the Bill of Rights. For the first time ever, we would do \nit to say that flag burning was prohibited. It was what the Founding \nFathers thought the constitutional process should be. It was an \namendment that had been thought about. It was an amendment that had \nbeen debated. It was an amendment that went to the core of great \nconstitutional issues.\n  My guess is if a Washington or a Jefferson or a Madison were looking \non the floor during that debate, they would have smiled, they would \nhave said that was the Senate they hoped to have.\n  If a Washington or a Jefferson or a Madison were looking on the floor \nas we debate this, I believe they would recoil, not because of the \nissue of victims' rights but because of the thought of passing a \nconstitutional amendment, only the 20th since the Bill of Rights, when \nno law had been declared unconstitutional, when no aspect of the \nConstitution itself needed to be clarified.\n  I ask my colleagues--and I will ask them when they are here because \nthis debate will go on for some time, as it should--why not a statute? \nI have heard my colleague from California say: Because we have to show \nhow important victims' rights are. With all due respect, we can show \nthat importance with a statute.\n  I believe in the rights of working people. I have worked for laws \nsuch as minimum wage and protecting rights in the workplace. I would \nnot put in the Constitution that we must protect the rights of working \npeople, unless, of course, there were a series of statutes about \nworking people that had been thrown out by the courts. Even in the \nearly 1900s, when the wage laws and child labor laws were thrown out as \nunconstitutional, we didn't amend the Constitution--when there might \nhave been reason to. But here? Now? As the lawyers say, no stare \ndecisis, no final opinion. It doesn't make sense.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, if we were to pass this amendment, we \nwould be fundamentally changing constitutional history, the way the \nlaws of this country are made, because we would say that the new \nConstitution is open to things we believe in and feel strongly about, \neven where a statute might have solved the problem.\n  My colleague from California and I--I regret that she is not here--\nhad this conversation after our caucus. She said to me, well, there \nhave been two Federal courts that ignored victims' rights even though \nwe passed statutes. Well, that means the statute was poorly drafted. A \njudge cannot ignore statutory law. I asked her, ``Well, why wouldn't \nthat be appealed if it wasn't well drafted?'' It wasn't appealed. But \nto rush to a constitutional amendment?\n  This amendment has been below the radar screen. It has crept up upon \nus stealthily. It hasn't gotten the airing and debate it needs, and \nalready we are rushing to judgment, attempting to pass a constitutional \namendment. Again, it was said that the constitutional amendment is \nstill being negotiated by one of the chief sponsors. What is this? We \nare negotiating a constitutional amendment at the same time we are \ndebating it--something that if it becomes part of the Constitution \ncannot be changed without huge movement? You don't do that. The \nConstitution is a sacred document. The greatest group of practical \ngeniuses in the world put it together. It is not something willy-nilly, \nif somebody feels strongly about it--and I respect the energy and \npassion--that we just go ahead and amend the Constitution. This is a \ndispiriting day in a certain way, in my judgment, because we are \ndebating whether to take that great document, the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and cheapen it by saying when we feel passionately about \nsomething, we skip the statutory process, the judicial process, and we \ngo right to amending the Constitution.\n  I am not debating the merits of the provisions. As I said, I believe \nin almost every one of them. But every one of these could be \naccomplished by statute, by law. And then, if we found out one was \npoorly drafted, we could change it; then, if we found out there was \nsomething people didn't take into account--and that happens when we \nwrite laws--we can change it. Not so with a constitutional amendment.\n  If you look at the amendment that has been drafted, it is longer than \nthe entire Bill of Rights. If you look at the language, it is not the \nlanguage of the Constitution of the United States, which talks about \ngreat concepts. Victims' rights is a fine concept, but the language, \nwhich I have here, is the language of a statute.\n  Again, I have not received an answer--a good answer--from my \ncolleague from Arizona and my colleague from California as to why not a \nstatute. You can pass it more quickly and more easily. It fits the \namendment. It fits what you are trying to do. No court, no supreme \ncourt, no final authority has thrown it out. And to say there were two \nFederal cases where the judge ignored a statute, and we immediately go \nto a lower court judge, and we immediately go to a constitutional \namendment, again, cheapens the Constitution.\n\n  I intend to debate this amendment at some length. I know some of my \ncolleagues will, too. As I said, this has not gotten airing. In fact, a \nmonth ago, if you talked to most people, they shrugged their shoulders \nand said, ``Don't worry, this won't come up.'' Well, it is here and it \nis being debated. We are on the precipice of changing what an amendment \nto the Constitution of this great country means. We ought not to do it \nlightly. We ought not to do it simply because we feel a need, as I do, \nto say that victims have rights in the courtroom. We ought to do it \nbecause there is no other alternative. And here there is. We ought to \ndo it because the judicial and legislative processes have been \nexhausted and the Constitution hasn't anticipated a new change. This \nclearly is not that case. We ought to do it because this issue has \nreached its fulsomeness.\n  My colleagues, I believe if this body were to pass this amendment, we \nwould regret it shortly thereafter. We would experience, as we never \nhave, debate about what specific little clauses in the Constitution \nmean--not the interpretation of what is freedom of speech, but how do \nyou define a victim. How do you deal with certain phrases and clauses? \nIt is a troubling day. It is a troubling day because almost without \ndebate, almost without national focus, we are thinking of changing what \nan amendment to the Constitution means. It is not simply supposed to \nmake us feel good. It is not simply to make a political statement to \nthe people back home. It is to fundamentally change the rights, \nprivileges, and obligations of the Government and the citizenry.\n  Again, to my colleagues, why can't we try to pass this very same \nlanguage as a statute? I am going to introduce that as an amendment if \nwe are allowed to--the exact language they have but make it a statute. \nI have not heard a good argument and, until I do, I urge every one of \nmy colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to refrain from the \nunderstandable desire to do something quickly and instead do something \ncorrectly.\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the hour that has been \nceded to me to debate this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't understand the procedure at this \nmoment. I don't know if I seek recognition through the Senator from New \nYork or the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can seek recognition in his own \nright for up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask to be recognized on S.J. Res. 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New York on \nthe statement he has made on the floor of the Senate. It is interesting \nthat when Members of the Senate are brought into this Chamber and asked \nto become official Members of this body, we are asked to take an oath. \nIt is an oath which in one part--and perhaps the most important part--\nis to preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States. When \nyou consider all of the great documents that have been produced in the \nhistory of this great country, it is clear that when it comes to our \nservice in the Senate, the one document that we are asked to hold above \nall others, to preserve and defend, is the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Of course, it is understandable because those who created the Senate \nand its counterpart, the House of Representatives, did it in this \ndocument, this Constitution, a copy of which I carry. They believed \nthat future Senates and future Members of the House of Representatives, \nif they preserved this document, would preserve this union.\n  The job of preserving this Constitution of the United States is not \noften easy nor popular. Some say 11,000 different times in the last 100 \nyears Members of the Senate have come to the floor in an attempt to \nchange this document. It is interesting that in the course of the \nhistory of this Nation, after the adoption of the first ten amendments \nto the Constitution, the so-called Bill of Rights, we have only amended \nthis Constitution 17 times--the Bill of Rights and 17 additional \namendments. Today, we are being asked to amend the Constitution for the \n18th time since the adoption of the Bill of Rights.\n  It is curious that in the history of our politics, the Republican \nParty, which so often claims to be the conservative party--and to take \nthat literally, I assume that means to conserve the values and \nprinciples of this country--has so often been in the leadership not to \nconserve but to overturn and change the most basic document, the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I am told in the last 4 weeks there have been four proposals--one in \nthe House and three in the Senate; this is the third in the Senate--to \nchange the Constitution of the United States. This document has endured \nfor over 200 years. It appears many of our colleagues want to change it \nas quickly as possible in a variety of ways. Some want to change it \nwhen it comes to balancing the budget. Others want to change it when it \ncomes to flag burning. Now today there is a suggestion that we want to \nchange it when it comes to the rights of the victims of crime.\n  With all due respect to the wisdom and intelligence of all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, frankly, I think they are anxious to take a \nroller to a Rembrandt. They want to make their mark on the Constitution \nbelieving that what they suggest matches up to the stature of the words \nof Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and the Founding Fathers of this country.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, Senate Joint Resolution No. 3 \nbefore the Senate now pales in comparison. This resolution has been \naround a while. It is shop worn. One of the sponsors of the resolution, \nSenator Kyl, came to the floor today and said with some pride that this \nwas the 63rd draft of this constitutional amendment, and as we stand \ntoday and debate, the 64th draft is being written in a back room. At \nsome point it will pop out of that room and on to the Senate floor and \nwe will be told: Here it is; this is the next amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Forgive me if I am skeptical, but I believe on reflection we would \nregret passing this proposed constitutional amendment. If the authors \nof this amendment who have been working on it for years--and I give \nthem credit for all of their effort, but they still haven't gotten it \nright. As the matter comes to the floor of the Senate, do we honestly \nbelieve the words in this document will endure as our Constitution has \nendured for over 200 years? No, I think we are in haste producing a \nproduct which we will come to regret.\n  Now to the merits of the issue. It is one which, frankly, cannot help \nbut touch your heart. Far too many people are victims of violent crime. \nThese victims are frightened, they are fed up, and they are determined. \nThey are rightfully frightened because they and others have far too \ngreat a chance of falling victim to a violent crime. These victims have \nendured needless and unjustified physical and emotional suffering. Just \nlast night at 6 p.m., in the Nation's Capital, at the National Zoo, one \nof the real attractions in this city for visitors from across this \nregion, around the Nation, and even around the world, seven children \nwere shot while visiting the zoo. One of the seven, an 11-year-old boy, \nwas shot in the back of the head and is in grave condition.\n  The statistics on violent crime and gun violence are staggering in \nthe United States of America. Twelve children die every day in America \nas a result of gun violence.\n\n  Many crime victims are justifiably fed up. They feel as if the \ncriminal justice system has wronged them. These people were innocent \nvictims, but they feel deprived of the fundamental need to participate \nin the process of bringing the accused to justice. Victims of crime are \nunderstandably determined to ensure that other victims of violent crime \nhave the right to an active and meaningful involvement in the criminal \njustice system. I believe every effort to ensure that crime victims are \nnot victimized a second time by the criminal justice system should be \ntaken. Today, we are here to begin the hard task of determining how \nbest we can achieve this shared goal.\n  I don't think many will ever be able to appreciate fully the impact \nof crime on a person. In my family's history, we have had a home \nburglarized and felt violated, as most people would when they come home \nto find someone has been through your belongings and taken something \naway. This is an eerie feeling as one walks through the house.\n  I have had one of my children assaulted. Thank goodness she wasn't \nhurt seriously. As a parent, I felt rage at the thought that somebody \nwould do this to my daughter. Thank God she survived it. They never \ncaught the person responsible for it. I felt in a way that she was not \nthe only victim. All of us who loved her were also victims of this \nviolence.\n  A violent crime irreparably alters the texture of life for the \nvictim, that victim's family, and many of their friends. The awareness \nand memory of that crime pervades and alters the victim's very being. I \ndon't think a victim ever totally gets over it.\n  We know a criminal justice system at its best cannot undo a crime. We \nsurely also realize the way to fully address the effect of crime is not \njust through the criminal justice system. If we are serious about \ndealing with the impact of crime upon an individual victim, a family, \nor a community, we must act systematically and consciously--not just \nwith symbolism and political effort. I believe one of the worst things \nwe can do is to pass a constitutional amendment that contains illusory \nor unenforceable promises regarding crime victims. In order to \ngenuinely address this issue, we must understand the way crime rewrites \na victim's life. Then we must do what we can to ensure that the rewrite \nis not inevitably tragic.\n  I support crime victims' rights. I confess to concerns about amending \nthis Constitution. I view the Constitution, and in particular the Bill \nof Rights, as one of the most enlightened, intelligent, and necessary \ndocuments ever created. I believe any efforts to amend it must be \nreserved for the most serious circumstances.\n  I cannot help but remember as I stand on this floor, as I often do, \ndebating constitutional amendments which seem to be the order of the \nday, how many leaders of newly emerged democracies come to the United \nStates of\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nAmerica as one of their first stops. These men and women who have seen \ntheir countries liberated from totalitarian rule, Communist rule, come \nto the United States and make their stop right here on this Hill, in \nthis city, in this building.\n  They believe, as I do, that the validation of democracy lies right \nhere within the corners of the walls of this great building, because \nthis generation of leadership in the Senate and in the House tries to \ncarry on a tradition, a tradition of freedom and democracy, a tradition \nthat is not embodied in a flag but is embodied in a book--the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  When you look at the political atmosphere surrounding this debate on \nthis constitutional amendment, you will see that it is different from \nany other debate we have had on an amendment to this Constitution. A \nconstitutional amendment is really only necessary when there is a \nconcern that the rights of the minority may not be respected by the \nmajority. When there was first a suggestion of a Bill of Rights, it was \nopposed by James Madison. He said: It is not necessary. The original \nConstitution, as written, defines what the Federal Government can do, \nand therefore all of our rights as individuals, as State governments, \nand as local governments, are certainly ours and preserved. We do not \nneed to add any language preserving them, it is assumed that they will \nbe preserved.\n  But as the Constitution was submitted to the various States for \nratification, more and more delegates came back and said: We disagree. \nWe want explicit protection. We want the Bill of Rights to explicitly \nprotect the rights of American citizens, and we want to spell it out.\n  One of the primary arguments used for the validity of the Bill of \nRights is that the first amendment, so often quoted for freedom of \nspeech and press and assembly and religion, is often heralded as the \nfirst amendment because it was so important. A little reading of \nhistory shows us it was not the first amendment in the Bill of Rights. \nThe first two amendments submitted to the States in the Bill of Rights \nwere rejected. The third amendment, which is now our first amendment, \nmoved up. The first two that were rejected related to the question of \nreapportionment of the Congress and the ability to be compensated or \nreceive additional compensation during the course of a congressional \nterm.\n  That little footnote in history notwithstanding, we value these 10 \namendments in the Bill of Rights as special.\n  Then, beyond that Bill of Rights, concerns about the rights of the \nminority rose again in the 13th and 14th amendments, when we repealed \nslavery, or in regard to the 19th amendment and the provision of \nsuffrage to women.\n  This amendment, however, does not fit in that description. All but a \nvery small number of American politicians and organizations \nemphatically support victims rights. Every State in the Union has at \nleast statutory protection of victims of crime when it comes to the \nprocedure of criminal prosecution. Some 33 States have amended their \nState constitutions to provide similar protection, including my own \nhome State of Illinois in 1992. I fully support that. I think the State \nwas right to pass a crime victims protection in our State constitution.\n  Second, any amendment to the Constitution should be more than just a \nsymbolic gesture. I want to grant crime victims real and concrete \nrights. The proposed amendment, however, has certain provisions which \nare illusory and unenforceable. Indeed, the amendment lacks definable \nlanguage and does not address its implementation. What is the most \nimportant single word in a crime victims protection amendment? Let me \nsuggest it is ``victim,'' the word ``victim.'' That is the group they \nseek to protect and honor and empower. Yet search, if you will, S.J. \nRes. 3, you will not find a definition of the word ``victim.''\n  For those who are listening to the debate, who say, ``How can that be \na problem? We know who the victim of the crime is''--are you sure? My \ndaughter was assaulted. She was certainly the victim of a crime. As her \nfather, was I victimized?\n  Some say: That is a stretch, we just mean the person who was actually \nassaulted.\n  Let's try this from a different angle. Let's assume someone is a \nvictim of a crime and is murdered. Are they the only victim of the \ncrime? Is the spouse of the murdered victim also a victim? I could \ncertainly argue that. I could argue a lot of other members of the \nfamily could be victims.\n  Let's consider this possibility. If you are going to empower victims \nto change the prosecution and the procedure in a criminal case, think \nabout a battered wife. A battered wife, who has been the victim of \ndomestic violence for a long period of time and who finally strikes \nback and assaults the spouse who has battered her, she is then brought \nin on criminal charges of assault and battery, and the abusing spouse \nbecomes a victim, too. According to this amendment, the abusing spouse \nnow has crime victim's rights, even though he was the one who battered \nhis wife, giving rise to her response and retribution. It gets a little \ncomplicated, doesn't it?\n  We know who a crime victim was--someone who was hurt. When you start \nplaying this thing out, you understand why the authors of this proposed \nconstitutional amendment, despite 63 different drafts of this \namendment, have never defined the word ``victim.'' Because if you \nempower that victim to slow down court proceedings or speed them up, to \nbe notified, to be part of the process, you had better take care to \nunderstand who is going to receive these rights and how these rights \nwill be exercised, because if you are not careful, you can have a lot \nof unfortunate consequences.\n  The amendment lacks this definable language. It does not direct the \nlaw enforcement court personnel, who are supposed to enforce the newly \ncreated victims' rights, on how to do so.\n  Finally, the important goal of establishing victims' rights can be \nachieved through legislation. A constitutional amendment is simply not \nnecessary. Due to the respect I have for the Constitution, I am \nextremely reluctant to amend it unless there is no other means by which \nthe victims of crime can be protected. Every state in the United States \nhave a state statute to protect the rights of victims. Thirty-three \nStates have constitutional amendments to protect the rights of victims. \nFrankly, there appears to be across the United States, in every State \nof the Nation, a protection of crime victims.\n  The obvious question of those who bring this amendment to the floor, \nthen, is, why is this necessary? Why do we need to amend the \nConstitution of the United States if existing State law and State \nconstitutional provisions already protect the victims of crime? There \nmay be flaws in these State amendments, State constitutional \namendments, State laws, but these flaws can be corrected on a State \nbasis, as needed.\n  In addition, a statutory alternative to this constitutional amendment \ncan reach all of the goals it seeks to achieve. Indeed, there is \nlegislation that has been proposed by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, which I enthusiastically support, which would put in statute \nthese crime victim protections. I think this is the best way, the most \neffective way, to deal with this.\n  Let me give a few illustrations of how complicated this situation can \nbecome. Some of them are real-life stories that give evidence of \nproblems prosecutors have run into in States where individuals have the \nright to come forward and to assert their rights as victims of crime. \nLet me give you two of them.\n  In Florida, a Miami defense lawyer tells of representing a murder \ndefendant who accepted a plea from the prosecution. Of course, the \nacceptance of a plea is a decision that you will plead guilty under \ncertain circumstances and waive the right to a trial. The judge refused \nto accept the offer after the victim's mother spoke out against it. The \nvictim's mother insisted that the criminal defendant go to trial, \ndespite the agreement by the Government and the defense that he would \naccept a plea. The client went to trial, was acquitted, and released.\n  In the second case, in California, relatives of a homicide victim \ncomplained to a judge that a plea bargain between the prosecution and \nthe defense was too lenient. They got what they wanted, withdrawal of \nthe plea and prosecution of the man on murder charges. At\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nthe close of the trial, the defendant was acquitted and went free.\n  In each of these instances, in each State, the victim or victim's \nfamily asserted their rights to overturn a decision by the prosecutor \nbased on that prosecutor's evaluation of the evidence and the likely \noutcome of a trial, and the net result of it was that the wrongdoer \nended up walking out of the courthouse door without a penalty.\n  The suggestion that the victim's involvement or intervention is \nalways going to lead to a stiffer penalty is, frankly, shown in these \ntwo cases not to apply.\n  I also make note of the fact that, during the course of this debate, \nthose who support the constitutional amendment, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, have \nsaid on occasion that this would in no way jeopardize the rights of the \naccused; in other words, that empowering and giving new rights to crime \nvictims will not be at the expense of the accused defendant. Our \nConstitution is very clear when it comes to criminal defendants, that \nthere are certain rights which shall be protected. We, of course, know \nthe right to trial by jury, the right to confront your accuser, and all \nof the rights which have been cataloged over the years.\n  When this constitutional amendment came before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee 2 years ago, I was a member of that committee. I offered an \namendment to this legislation in committee which said nothing in this \nproposed constitutional amendment shall diminish or deny the rights of \nthe accused as guaranteed under the Constitution. It was said over and \nover that is the case of this language and this proposal. Yet my \nattempt to put it into the amendment was refused. I understand Senator \nFeingold of Wisconsin offered the same amendment in committee this time \nwhen it was being considered, and it, again, was refused.\n  As I stand here today, I suggest to my colleagues that we are \nconsidering a constitutional amendment which, though it is important, \nis not necessary. Before we amend the Bill of Rights in the United \nStates of America, it should be something that we all believe, or at \nleast the vast majority believes, is necessary. The existing State \nconstitutional protections of crime victims, the existing State \nstatutes all provide protection to the victims of crime. The suggestion \nthat we can pass a Federal statute which can be modified if we find it \nis not perfect gives us an option to do something responsible without \ninvading the sanctity and province of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  In addition, I suggest that protecting the rights of victims, as \nimportant as it is, must be taken into consideration with base \nconstitutional rights and protections for the accused as well in this \nfree society, recalling the premise of criminal justice in America: \ninnocence until guilt is proven. That is something which is painful to \nstand by at times, but it is as American as the Constitution which \nguarantees it.\n  I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate and to my friend, the \nSenator from New York, who I see is on the floor, that we should think \ntwice before proceeding with this amendment to the Constitution. I will \njoin my colleagues during the course of this debate in further \ndiscussion of the merits of this proposal. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois for saying, but taking one exception, we ought to think \ntwice about this matter. Dare I hope we might think once. It comes \nwholly unexpected to us, a massive departure from two centuries of \nconstitutional practice, a measure--one amendment which was longer than \nthe whole of the Bill of Rights, and there is not a single Member on \nthe other side of the aisle listening, wishing to speak, present. There \nare three of us on the Senate floor with the Constitution in our hands \nin a matter of 27 hours--the casualness.\n  George Will said on Sunday that we were cluttering the Constitution. \nWe do things palpably ill advised. In the House, they put us on a 1-\nyear balanced budget back into an agricultural cycle, long since gone. \nThere was no mention whatever of the rights of the accused, about which \nwe were very concerned. A people should be concerned when Government \naccuses someone, and that is why we have the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and \nFourteenth amendments. Then to have this endless, tedious, complex \namendment about victims' rights and, as the Senator says, no definition \nwhatever of what a victim is.\n\n  I say to those not present on the opposite side--and there are, of \ncourse, supporters on this side--the capacity of American culture in \nthis stage to think of new forms of victimhood is unprecedented. It has \nbeen a characteristic of the culture for a generation now to find \nvictims and to declare oneself a victim and demand compensation and \nconsideration therefore. It may become a permanent feature of American \nculture. I do not know. I doubt it. But it is at high moment now and \nwould this amendment--oh, my goodness. And for the law schools, yes, \nand for those who design and build courthouses, oh, sure, and judges--\nthere will be no more judges held up in this Senate. We will need \ndouble the Federal judiciary in no time at all.\n  How could we have come to the point where we have so little sense of \nour history, as the Senator from Illinois so rightly said. James \nMadison did not think a bill of rights was necessary since the \nConstitution only gave powers, specifically enumerated powers, to the \nFederal Government. What it was not given, it could not do. Still, \nGeorge Mason and others persuaded him and prudence--a hugely important \naspect of good government--prudence said: Well, why not have a bill of \nrights? And we have learned to be glad that we did.\n  Do my colleagues recall the impeachment trial we went through a year \nago? I was struck by the managers--fine persons all--but how little \nreference they gave to the Constitution which provides for impeachment. \nI may be mistaken--I hope I am--but I did not hear one reference to \nMadison's notes which he kept during the Convention in Philadelphia, or \nthe notes of the one day in which the impeachment clause was settled.\n  On that day, it was stated, for example, the most important \nimpeachment of the age then was the impeachment of Warren Hastings \ngoing on in London. Edmund Burke, well known here as a supporter of the \ncolony's rights, managed the case by the House of Commons in the House \nof Lords. The point was made by Mason that Hastings was not accused of \na crime. That was not why he was being impeached. It was abuse of \noffice. Hence, we have the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' High \ncrimes.\n  Now. Do my colleagues know what the references were in that debate? \nThey were to Hollywood movies. And do my colleagues remember Marlene \nDietrich in ``Witness for the Prosecution''? Are we trivializing our \noath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against \nall enemies foreign and domestic? It is scarcely to be believed.\n  Why are the seats empty on the other side? I cannot be certain, but I \noffer a thought, and I would be happy to hear differently. The \nadministration is negotiating with the sponsors because the \nadministration has indicated a willingness to support this atrocity, \nthis abomination, this violation of all we have treasured in two \ncenturies and more.\n  That the administration should do this is something I could not \nimagine I would ever see. Yet we have it in writing that they are \nprepared to do it. I only hope the negotiations break down.\n  I shall have more to say at another time. But I just wanted to make \nthis comment. Now I leave the floor. Our revered senior Senator from \nVermont will be the only one remaining. I do not doubt he will have \nthoughts to disclose. But even he will eventually find himself somewhat \ndistracted by the fact that no one is listening. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer is here. But there will not be another soul present \nwith such attention and energy as we take up a matter of the greatest \npossible importance, which is amending the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the distinguished senior Senator from \nNew York would yield to me before leaving?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope all Senators get a chance to read what the \ndistinguished Senator said. He is recognized as one of\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nthe foremost historians of this country and certainly of the Senate. He \nis so right: We are talking about amending the Constitution, and nobody \nis here to talk about it.\n  I say to my friend from New York, there have been 11,000 proposed \namendments to the Constitution that have been brought before the \nCongress. Article V speaks of amending the Constitution when necessary.\n  The Senator from New York is a far greater student of history than I, \nbut does he think that by any stretch of the imagination--we have had \ncivil wars; we have fought in world wars; we have gone through \nPresidential assassinations; we have done all these things--we have \never come close to 11,000 times in the history of this great Nation \nwhere it has been necessary to amend the Constitution?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We have not, sir, as is evidenced by the fact that I \nbelieve we have done it 18 times including the Bill of Rights, which \nwas basically part of the Constitution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from New York, it is the Senate that is \nthe saucer that cools the passions. That should make us slow up and \nlook at these things.\n  I wonder what would have happened if, say, during all those times, 10 \npercent of those amendments had gone through. That would be 1,100 \namendments. If 1 percent went through, there would be over 100 \namendments. What a different country this would be with much less \ndemocracy, if we would be a democracy at all.\n  The first amendment in our little pocketbooks of the Constitution is \nonly four or five lines. The first amendment really protects the \ndiversity of this country to make sure we remain a democracy, that we \nhave the right to practice any religion we want, or none if we want--\nboth thoughts are protected--that we can say what we want, that we can \nassemble and petition our Government. All of that is protected. Yet we \nhave something that, when we print out this proposed amendment, goes on \nfor something like 60 lines.\n  I am a lawyer. I loved doing appellate work. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer is a distinguished former attorney general. I am sure \nhe would love to do appellate work. I can tell you right now, this is a \nlawyer's dream. We might as well quadruple the number of courts, the \nnumber of judges. They would not keep up with the appeals that would \ncome just from this one amendment alone.\n  It is hard for me to emphasize enough, and I hate to hold up the \nSenator from New York on this, but there is nobody else here to express \nmy frustration to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Please.\n  Mr. LEAHY. He and I are on the same side of this. I have the \nprivilege, as I said earlier, of being the 21st Member of the Senate, \nin all its history, to cast 10,000 votes. Some votes were important; a \nlot were not important. But I thought it was pretty impressive--10,000 \nvotes. Even with all the unimportant ones, even after all of them, I \ndid not vote enough to have voted on all the proposed constitutional \namendments. There have been 11,000.\n\n  Our highly respected and beloved two most senior Members of this \nbody, Senator Thurmond and Senator Byrd, have cast 15,000 votes. They \nare about the only ones who might have cast enough votes. But those \nvotes encompassed all kinds of things.\n  Here we are talking about changing the Constitution at the drop of a \nhat. Some of us--Republicans and Democrats alike, conservatives and \nliberals--ought to stand up and say: We will pass statutes; we will \nexperiment. If we are wrong, we will change the statutes; we will \nchange the law. But we will not amend the Constitution. No matter that \nthe proposal comes from the left or the right, no matter what it is, we \nshould not pass it unless it is, as the Constitution says, necessary.\n  This resolution is not necessary for the security and for the \ncontinuation of the world's greatest democracy.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just make a closing remark.\n  Not meaning to be disrespectful, but there is a joke, a witticism, if \nyou like, that says libraries file the French Constitution under the \nheading of periodicals: It comes; it goes; it comes; it goes.\n  We have a treasure here, the oldest written Constitution on Earth. It \nhas preserved a republic which is without equal. There are two nations, \nthe United States and Britain, that both existed in 1800 and have not \nhad their form of government changed by violence since then. We live in \na world where a century ago there were approximately, as I count, 8 \nnations on Earth that both existed then and have not had their form of \ngovernment changed by violence since.\n  If we are to trivialize the Constitution because of passing \nenthusiasms about this economic theory, that economic theory, we risk \nthe stability of this institution.\n  I make just one reference to the fact that several years ago we \npassed a law providing for a Presidential line item veto on \nlegislation. It was elementally unconstitutional. The Senate passed it. \nThe House passed it. The President signed it.\n  Three of us--our revered senior Democratic Member, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Levin, and I--brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, which in good time held that the line item veto \nwas indeed unconstitutional. The government appealed to the Supreme \nCourt that as members of Congress we did not have the requisite \nstanding.\n  Then in the following term, the veto had been exercised. We clearly \ndid have standing. We went there as amici. And, bang, the Court said: \nThis is unconstitutional.\n  Does the President not have lawyers? Are there no counsel on the \nJudiciary Committee here and in the House? It is something that \nelemental.\n  Sir, we are approaching a dangerous moment in the history of the \nRepublic. As I leave the floor, as I am required elsewhere, I leave the \nSenator from Vermont who is alone defending the Constitution of the \nUnited States. He is alone on the Senate floor. There is not a single \nperson here who supports this monstrosity, this abomination, willing to \ncome forward and say why.\n  Does that not say something?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from New York. He and I have been friends for \nover a generation. I for one have learned from him and have been \ninspired by him. He is so right on this. This debate is treated as a \nmatter of such passing moment that nobody is here. I want them to have \na chance to come back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime for the quorum be charged not against any individual Senator but \nagainst the overall 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield my time under the pending measure to \nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, 1 hour. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum not be \ncharged to either side at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose S.J. Res. 3, the \nvictims' rights constitutional amendment. I agree with the goals of the \nproponents of the amendment. We have to do more to protect and enhance \nthe rights of victims of crime. But I disagree with the particular \nmeans they have chosen to bring about that end. We do not need to amend \nthe Constitution to protect victims. We can protect the rights of \nvictims by enforcing current State and Federal laws. We can protect the \nrights of victims by providing the needed resources to prosecutors and \ncourts to allow them to enforce and comply with existing laws. We can \nprotect the rights of victims by enacting additional statutes, if \nneeded, to deal with remaining concerns or any issues that\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\nmight arise in this regard in the future.\n  The framers of the Constitution made the process of amending the \nConstitution very difficult. Those who propose to change that long-\nlived and successful charter bear a heavy burden. I have thus opposed \nproposals to amend the Constitution, and especially the Bill of Rights, \neven when the subject of the amendment was very close to my heart, as \nit was with the recent proposal to amend the Constitution to allow for \nmandatory campaign spending limits. Similarly, I believe deeply in the \nneed to ensure that our criminal justice system treats victims fairly, \nbut I do not believe we have to amend the Constitution to do so.\n  Throughout history, Members of Congress have thought of more than \n11,000 different ways to amend the Constitution--as of this last \nrecess, 11,045, by one count. Luckily, only 27 have become part of our \nnational charter. Ten of those, the Bill of Rights, were part of the \npackage of ratification, and two, the ones on prohibition, canceled \neach other. Three others followed the enormous upheaval of the Civil \nWar and addressed the wrongs of slavery and inequality that spawned \nthat conflict. But the pace at which Members have introduced and \nproposed amendments has picked up in modern times. More than half of \nthe constitutional amendments proposed in the entire lifetime of our \nNation have come in the last 40 years. Fewer were proposed in the first \n173 years of our Nation. This Senate has now considered three so far in \nthis session alone--and the year is still young.\n\n  In a sense, there is a certain lack of humility about proposing so \nquickly to amend the Constitution. To propose to change the \nConstitution now is to say we have come up with an idea that the \nframers of that great charter did not, or that we have come to a \nconclusion on how our Government should work fundamentally different \nfrom the one they had and fundamentally different from the one all the \nCongresses since have had. We should come hesitantly, if we do, to the \nconclusion that we know better than they did. Yes, there will come \noccasions where times have changed, as with women's right to vote, and \nwe need to bring the Constitution up to date; but it is hard to \nconsider the basic calculus of prosecutor, defendant, and victim to \nhave changed this much since the foundation of the Republic.\n  I have to admit that of the constitutional amendments I have seen \nproposed in recent Congresses, this is less objectionable in some \nrespects than most. But I still have significant concerns about the \nprospect of amending the Constitution, even for this very worthy \npurpose. We must use the constitutional amendment process sparingly. \nBefore taking the grave step of amending our country's founding \ncharter, we have to make sure we have exhausted all statutory \nalternatives. When it comes to victims' rights, we are far from \nexhausting those statutory alternatives. We currently have Federal and \nState laws protecting victims. Indeed, many States have passed their \nown constitutional amendments to protect victims, including my own \nState of Wisconsin--a proposal that I voted for when I was in the \nWisconsin State Senate.\n  According to the proponents of this constitutional amendment, these \nexisting laws are not being fully enforced. I would say we should \ntherefore see to it that the existing laws are enforced. Let us enact \nlegislation to improve the existing law, and let us provide the needed \nresources to prosecutors and courts to comply with existing laws. That \nis where the real struggle lies. Only when we have exhausted these \nlegislative avenues should we possibly consider a constitutional \namendment.\n  Let's address this important issue one step at a time. Statutes \nprotecting victims are on the books in each and every State. Amendments \nto State constitutions have been adopted by at least 31 States. At the \nFederal level, prudent legislation has already been enacted and \nadditional legislation proposed. Let us work with the current law and \nproposals to improve our Federal laws. In fact, additional statutory \nprotections for victims have been introduced during this Congress by \nChairman Hatch and by the ranking member and Senator Kennedy. I believe \nthese represent the right direction in which to go.\n  Chairman Hatch has introduced the Victims' Rights Act of 1999. \nSenators Leahy and Kennedy have introduced the Crime Victims Assistance \nAct. Senator Leahy announced an improved version of that bill, taking \ninto account many suggestions made by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I understand Senator Leahy will offer his bill as a \nsubstitute to this constitutional amendment, if the majority leader \nallows Senators to exercise their traditional rights to offer \namendments.\n\n  Enforcing and enacting comprehensive Federal statutes is the best way \nto protect victims. The Leahy-Kennedy bill will accomplish the same \ngoals the proponents of this amendment want, but it will do it faster \nand also protect the integrity of the Constitution. The Leahy-Kennedy \nbill includes the right for a victim to be heard at the detention and \nsentencing stages, the right to be notified of escaped or released \nprisoners, and the right to be heard during consideration of a plea \nagreement. These are sensible protections that victims can see take \neffect in only a matter of weeks--the time it takes for consideration \nand passage of a statute--not years from now when maybe two-thirds of \nthe Congress approves and three-fourths of the States ratify a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Another reason I oppose this measure is that a constitutional \namendment, as you well know, is far less flexible than a statute when \nprovisions must be improved over time. A constitutional amendment \ncannot easily be modified. Changing it at all--even one letter of it--\nwould again require the approval of two-thirds of the Congress and \nratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures. This is a real \nproblem in this case because there are numerous uncertainties about the \neffect of this amendment. Even the sponsors are finding things they \nwant to change. Each time this amendment has been brought before the \nJudiciary Committee, it has been different. In fact, the amendment was \nmodified as recently as last spring when we marked it up in the \nConstitution Subcommittee. At that time, my good friend, Senator \nAshcroft, successfully offered an amendment to include the rights of \nvictims to be involved in the pardon process. Such a change has \ninspired a good deal of criticism from the executive branch, which is \nconcerned with its impact on the exclusive power of the President to \ngrant pardons.\n  Whatever one thinks of the change to the amendment, it is the sort of \nthing that ought to give us pause when we are dealing not with a \nstatute but with what is likely to be a permanent constitutional \namendment. What if Senator Ashcroft had not realized that this change \nwas needed until after the pending proposed constitutional amendment \nwas already adopted? What if, instead, we had approved the victims' \nrights amendment in the last Congress, as I am sure its sponsors would \nhave preferred? Then, to change the amendment, Senator Ashcroft would \nhave been required to get two-thirds of the Congress and three-fourths \nof the State legislatures to agree to the change.\n  The pardon issue isn't the end of the matter. Other Senators have \nraised concerns about the specifics of this amendment; for example, its \nfocus on the victims of violent crimes rather than all victims of \ncrime. If any further changes are needed, we will have to, again, go \nthrough the lengthy and difficult process of amending the constitution. \nI have no doubt that further changes will be necessary. I have heard \nthe main authors of this constitutional amendment saying with some \npride that there have been 63 versions of this amendment. They offer \nthat as a sign that this is a very well-honed, carefully drafted piece \nof legislation or amendment. What I suggest it means is that it is \nhighly volatile, likely to change, and likely to be inappropriate for \nthe Constitution, even after it is ratified, given all the changes that \nhave been made and the problems with it. This constitutional amendment \nreally reads as a statute. It is almost as long as the entire Bill of \nRights. It is full of terms and concepts that will undoubtedly provoke \nyears of litigation and years of attempts to overturn a court decision \nthat one group or another doesn't like.\n\n  It even contains an extraordinary clause that might be called the \n``emergency eject button.'' The Government\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\ncan ignore the amendment. Remember, this language will be in the \nConstitution. The Government can ignore the amendment to achieve a \n``compelling interest.''\n  What if the prosecutors in a high-profile case sought to avoid the \nimpact of the amendment and the courts determined the justification \nthey gave did not rise to the level of a compelling interest? If we, as \na Congress, agreed with the prosecutors, we would not be able to pass a \nstatute to override that judicial ruling because it would have to \nactually pass a constitutional amendment to deal with the problem.\n  It is clear that despite years of effort that have gone into this \namendment, it will have to be fine-tuned in the future. We fine-tune \nstatutes all the time, but we all know constitutional amendments can't \nreally be fine-tuned. That is a big problem the Senate needs to face up \nto.\n  This amendment also poses major federalism problems. I am troubled \nthis amendment could well result in extensive oversight of State \ncriminal justice systems by the Federal courts. Victims who believe \ntheir rights have not been recognized in State court proceedings will \nundoubtedly file lawsuits in Federal district courts. Federal courts \nwill end up second-guessing the decisions of State prosecutors or \njudges about how long a case took to get to trial or what victim should \nbe notified of a bail hearing. That is why the Conference of Chief \nJustices, representing the chief justices of the supreme courts of all \nof our States, oppose this amendment and strongly prefer that we deal \nwith this problem statutorily.\n  The State chief justices have also expressed concern that this year's \nversion of the amendment, as opposed to previous versions, allows \nCongress, but not the States, to pass legislation implementing the \namendment. They appropriately note that the States can better determine \nwhat laws are needed to implement the amendment, as it is the operation \nof their own criminal justice system that is really at issue. But that \nwould again lead to precisely the patchwork of laws and protections \nvarying from State to State that the sponsors of this amendment wish to \navoid and claim is the reason they need a constitutional amendment.\n  I cannot emphasize enough that I am deeply committed to protecting \nthe victims of crime. As a State senator in the Wisconsin State Senate \nin 1991, I voted in favor of amending the Wisconsin State Constitution \nto include protections for victims. As I have noted, most States have a \nState constitutional protection for victims, and every State in the \ncountry has at least a statute to protect victims.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention to the example of Wisconsin because \nthe Wisconsin State Constitution repeatedly clarifies that the rights \ngranted to the victim in the Wisconsin Constitution are not intended to \ndiminish the rights of the accused. The Wisconsin amendment contains \nlanguage that explicitly forbids victims' rights from impairing the \nrights of the accused that are otherwise guaranteed by law. \nUnfortunately, the victims' rights amendment before this body does not \ncontain a similar provision.\n  For that reason, I offered an amendment during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup that would have included a clarification similar to \nthe Wisconsin language. It is troubling and puzzling to me that the \nmajority of the Judiciary Committee did not agree with that amendment \nbecause they stated over and over again in defense of this amendment \nthat it would in no way derogate the rights of the defense. If that is \nso, why did they oppose such a simple clarification that we found so \nuseful when passing a similar provision in Wisconsin?\n  When, in the wake of the Boston massacre, John Adams defended the \nBritish soldiers accused of committing the killings there, he said:\n\n       [I]t [is] more beneficial that many guilty persons should \n     go unpunished than one innocent person should suffer.\n\n  Surely, if there is a central pillar of the American system of \njustice, this is it: Above all, we must protect the rights of the \ninnocent.\n  That is why our Constitution enshrines limitations on the State and \nprotections of the individual whose liberties the State would seek to \ncurtail.\n  Sadly, even with our manifold protections for the rights of the \naccused, history has demonstrated that time and again America has on \noccasion brought innocence itself to the bar and condemned it to jail \nor even to die.\n  Many proponents of the amendment before the Senate today state \ncategorically that the rights of victims and the rights of the accused \ncan comfortably coexist. They claim the amendment would not reduce the \nrights of the accused. They may be right, although I fear that cases \nmay arise where judges will believe that to give the amendment force \nwill require a lessening of protections for the accused. Be that as it \nmay, the proponents of this amendment have refused to make this \nprotection of the rights of the accused crystal clear by writing that \nintent into the amendment itself. Until they do, it is not unreasonable \nfor Senators to fear that this constitutional amendment in some cases \nwould actually end up curtailing the legitimate rights and liberties of \ndefendants in courts of law.\n  For those who believe in individual freedom and civil liberties, this \nshould be troubling, indeed.\n  The Constitution should be modified sparingly, where no other \nalternative provides an adequate solution. That showing has not been \nmade. The laws on the books now should be fully enforced. Courts and \nprosecutors should be given the resources they need to protect victims \nunder current law. Congress and State legislatures should enact \nadditional legislation where needed to give additional protection.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting prudent, statutory \nsafeguards for victims. But I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nvictims' rights amendment to the Constitution.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2458 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to address the pending so-called \nvictims' rights constitutional amendment.\n  There is no question but that there are instances when victims of \ncrimes in this country are not heard as they should be heard. Our \ncriminal justice system does not work perfectly. But these duties are \ngiven to local judges and local district attorneys. They are elected \nofficials. In most cases, they are responsible to the people in their \njurisdictions. It is in their interest to make sure victims are treated \nappropriately.\n  Certainly, in most cases, the defendants are not the ones who have \nthe public support on their side. It is certainly the victims. In most \ncases, it is in the interest of those charged with the responsibility \nof notifying victims of proceedings in court and treating them as they \nshould be treated in carrying out those responsibilities.\n  Having said that, we must acknowledge that some things slip through \nthe cracks. We have a constitutional amendment that is proposed \nbasically to cover those instances when these local officials let \nthings slip through the cracks and victims are not notified of court \ndates or sentencing or parole hearings. The sentiment is \nunderstandable, but if we look a bit closer, we have to conclude that a \nconstitutional amendment to address this problem is not the way to go. \nIt is constitutional overkill, to say the least.\n  All 50 States have recognized we can do better in terms of victims, \nwe can notify them when important things happen with regard to the \ntrial of a defendant, and all 50 States have passed legislation, \nconstitutional amendments, or both, to address this problem.\n  Even still, we in Washington, DC, say we are going to pass a \nconstitutional amendment, in effect mandating--an unfunded mandate at \nthat--mandating these States behave in certain ways to take care of \nthis problem.\n  People say: State laws and State constitutions still do not always \nwork. There are still some cases where people are not notified, even \nthough the State constitution and the State statute require it. A \nconstitutional amendment will, in some way, solve that problem.\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\n  I suggest there is no reason to believe whatsoever that in individual \ncases where this problem still persists, a Federal constitutional \namendment will do any better than a State constitutional amendment will \ndo in ensuring those rights.\n  I believe this amendment will interject complexity into the judicial \nprocess, will cause increased litigation, and will actually have the \neffect of harming victims more than helping victims. The primary \ninterest of a victim of a crime is to make sure a guilty defendant is, \nin fact, found guilty and properly punished. This constitutional \namendment will make the procedure by which the DA's around the country \nare trying to prosecute these defendants more complex, more costly, \nmore time consuming in many respects, and ultimately will harm the very \nend in which the victim is most interested, and that is seeing justice \ndone and a guilty defendant found guilty by our court system.\n  This constitutional amendment gives nine new rights to a new category \nof people. The Constitution sets out our form of government. The Bill \nof Rights basically is restrictions on the power of that Government. It \ntells the Government things they cannot do because we have been mindful \nof the down sides of an all-powerful federal government. We have set \nforth specific things the Government may not do toward individuals. \nThat has usually been the purpose of amendments to our Constitution; \nthat is, again, limiting the Government in what they can do with regard \nto the individual. This constitutional amendment creates nine new \nrights on behalf of a new category of people; that is, so-called \nvictims.\n\n  It has taken, in some cases, 200 years, or thereabouts, to have our \ncourts pass on the issues that have come about because of the wording \nof our Constitution and the wording of the Bill of Rights--what is a \nreasonable and unreasonable search and seizure, for example.\n  This will, in language that is more lengthy than most of the \namendments in the Bill of Rights, create additional complexity and \nraise additional questions that can only be resolved by courts of law. \nIt will be many years before issues as to how this works are resolved. \nWho is a victim, how do you define a victim? For example, suppose we \nhave a battered woman who is on trial for stabbing her husband. What if \nshe is the defendant? What if the husband was, in fact, attacking her? \nWho is the victim in that case? The reasonable notice victims are \nsupposed to get to court proceedings, it sounds good on its face, but \nwhat is reasonable notice? We have hundreds and hundreds of cases of \ntrying to decide what is reasonable.\n\n  In another context, what if a victim is not notified of a court \nproceeding on time? Or what if they say they are not but perhaps they \nhave been? They may come in and say: This proceeding you have just \nfinished, I did not get notice of it.\n  The district attorney may say: Yes, we did give you notice.\n  They may say: No, you did not.\n  The district attorney may say: Yes, we did.\n  They may say: It was not reasonable notice.\n  The prosecutor may say: We gave you so many days.\n  All of these issues ultimately will have to be decided by a court \nthat should be devoting its attention to the proceedings in the case, \nalong with the district attorneys devoting their attention to \nprosecuting the defendant and not having these collateral issues making \ntheir job that much more difficult.\n  To understand the potential mischief of this constitutional \namendment, I think you have to really understand our system and the way \nit is set up under the Constitution.\n  The Constitution was mindful of the inherent problems with a \ncentralized government. Our founding forefathers' experience with a \npowerful government, with a king, led them to decide we would have a \nfederal system whereby the States would have certain rights. They \ndecided against a national police state. We have certain defined \nFederal responsibilities with regard to law enforcement. But there is \nno inherent police authority in the Constitution for the Federal \nGovernment. The basic police authority is out in the States. We do not \nwant a national police force in this country or a centralized policing \nauthority for every kind of crime that might occur. Murder, robbery, \nrape, burglary--those are crimes that are handled at the State level.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of the offenses in this country are \nprosecuted at the State level, not the Federal level. That is not the \nFederal Government's business. Absent the relatively few truly Federal \ncriminal cases that we have, these State offenses are prosecuted at the \nState level. They are prosecuted by district attorneys and assistant \ndistrict attorneys all over the country. They are given a good deal of \ndiscretion as to how they handle these cases.\n  Mind you, in most cases these people are elected officials in their \nlocal communities. They have every reason to want to do the right \nthing. They take an oath to uphold the law. They have an interest in \nmaking sure everybody is treated fairly. It does not always happen, but \nit is a system we are dealing with here. We cannot address every \nparticular instance that might come along. It is a system with which we \nare concerned.\n  This is our system. District attorneys decide when to plea bargain. \nDistrict attorneys have to decide how strong their case is. Only they \nwill know how strong their case is, in making a decision whether to \naccept a plea bargain.\n  Sometimes, when you have multiple defendants, district attorneys have \nto make a decision to make a deal with one defendant for more lenience \nin exchange for testimony against another defendant. All of these are \ndiscretionary things that in our system we give local district \nattorneys the right to do.\n  It is basically a system involving two parties; that is, the State, \nor the people, on the one hand, and the criminal defendants on the \nother.\n  What this constitutional amendment would do is change that whole \nsystem in many material respects. Instead of having a two-party system, \nwhere you have a prosecutor, or the State, or the people, and a \ncriminal defendant, you would now have three parties. You would have \nthe prosecutor, the defendant, and the victim.\n  At every meaningful stage of the criminal trial, you would have all \nof these three parties vying for the court's attention to have their \ninterests expressed. It is complicated enough, as anybody who has ever \nbeen a prosecutor, an assistant U.S. attorney at the Federal level or \nassistant district attorney, can tell you.\n  It is complicated enough when you just have two parties. You are \ntrying to do the right thing. You are trying to prosecute the case. For \nthe person who you believe is guilty, who has been indicted, you are \ngoing to bring them to trial. The defendant has not been convicted yet, \nbut you believe they are guilty or you would not be prosecuting them. \nBut you also know the limitations of your case.\n  You also know how many other defendants there are out there. You also \nknow whether or not this guy you have before you is a small fry or a \nbig fish. You also know there might be a chance of getting to someone \nbigger.\n  All those kinds of things you know are very complicated, very \ndifficult. The defendants file motions for continuances. The defendants \nfile motions to suppress evidence, if there is a search warrant \ninvolved. There are motions to dismiss and all those kinds of things.\n  Here we come along with this constitutional amendment and inject a \nthird party into the process, third parties who certainly have an \ninterest in the outcome, third parties who are allowed to attend, third \nparties who want to see that justice is done. But a constitutional \namendment would not just say, let's give these third parties these \nrights, let's try to do them right, let's try to make sure they have \ntheir voices heard; we would, by amendment, put this in the \nConstitution of the United States, just like the first amendment on \nfree speech or the fifth amendment on due process or the sixth \namendment on the right to counsel.\n  We would elevate the rights of a victim, with whom we are all \nsympathetic, up there with the prosecutor and the defense in trying to \njuggle all of this business of giving notice and having a right to be \nin the courtroom at every stage of the game. The judge is going to have \nto decide whether or\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\nnot notice has been given correctly at all the right times, whether or \nnot the right people are in the courtroom. All this new complexity \ninjected in an already complex system.\n  As well meaning as it is, I think the result of it is going to be, as \nI said, more complexity, more litigation for people who believe the \nConstitution has not been followed, that they have not been given the \nright kind of notice, or they were late for court and they did not get \nto sit in the courtroom, or something of that nature. It is going to \nwind up hurting the ultimate interest of victims more than helping.\n  Under the constitutional amendment, the victim, as we would \nultimately define a victim--as I said, it is not going to be that easy \nin many cases--would have a right to come in and object to a deal the \ndistrict attorney might want to make.\n  Only the district attorney may know certain information. For example, \nlet's say there is a gang involved and you have one cooperative \nwitness. When the victims come in and object to the deal, the district \nattorney cannot stand up and say, this is the reason we are doing this, \nbecause everybody else would hear it. It would compromise possibly \nanother case.\n  Or if the victim comes in and objects to a plea bargain with a \nparticular defendant, the district attorney cannot get up and say, the \nreason we did this, Your Honor, is we really do not have much of a \nchance, and we are lucky to get this. He cannot do that because he may \nhave to, in fact, go to trial. As happens sometimes, the judge is \nsympathetic and says: We agree with the victim. We are not going to \naccept this deal.\n  The district attorney is sitting there, unable to explain it fully on \nthe one hand and then, on the other, having to go to trial, and in some \ncases, when in States that have such rules, has gone to trial and \nactually lost the case. So the attorney, instead of getting some \npunishment for a guilty defendant, has actually had to go to trial and \nat the trial, you have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt--a high \nstandard of proof--and the defendant walks because they were unable to \nmake the deal that they were trying to make.\n  Under this amendment, there is a provision that is extremely \ntroublesome; that is, that it becomes a constitutional right for a \nvictim to be in court at all times during the proceeding. In most \ncases, in just about all States at one time, it was the rule. In fact, \nthey just call it the rule. Every lawyer knows when you are trying a \ncase, you say: Your Honor, I would like to impose the rule. When that \nhappens, all of the other witnesses leave the courtroom because you \ndon't want your witnesses to be hearing other witnesses testify. It \nmight tailor their testimony. If somebody on your side of the case is \ntestifying a certain way about how something happened, it makes sense \nthat it is not in the interest of justice to have the other witnesses \nsitting there listening to that so when they get on the witness stand, \nthey are not tempted to tailor their testimony and avoid any \ncontradictions that the other side might take advantage of. It is kind \nof a horn book procedure.\n  What this amendment would do would say that the victim could sit in \nthe courtroom and listen to all of the other witnesses testify. If the \nprosecutor decided to put the victim on last, they could listen to \nevery one of the witnesses testify before the victim in the courtroom \ntook the stand. That goes against experience and common sense and \ncommon practice for about 200 years in this country. We have to keep in \nmind that at this stage of the game, this defendant has not been \nconvicted of anything. As angry as we might be at the defendant or as \nmuch as we think he might be guilty, we have to remember he hasn't been \nconvicted of anything. In this country, everybody gets a fair trial.\n  If one of our loved ones was accused of something and we thought the \naccuser had their own reasons for accusing our loved one and we saw \nthem sitting in the courtroom listening to all the witnesses talk about \nexactly how this happened and exactly how that happened and then they \ntook the stand and kind of melded all the testimony together to make it \nall consistent and wrap it up in one big bow, I think we would be \nconcerned about that. The trial judge at least ought to have the \ndiscretion of making a determination as to who sits in the courtroom \nand who does not. The Federal Government does not have any business \nmicromanaging the trial of these lawsuits in every general sessions \ncourt in every little town in the country. That is what this \nconstitutional amendment would do.\n  It would upset the balance we have always had in this country of a \nprosecutor, a defendant, tried in a State court with local rules. There \nhave always been constitutional provisions the States have to abide \nby--there is no question about that--free speech, search and seizure, \nall of that, but we don't have a unitary government, we have a system \nof federalism whereby States decide these local cases and State judges \nmake those decisions. We come along with a constitutional amendment \nthat creates nine new rights, about 2\\1/2\\ pages of new Constitution, \nand goes totally away from the concept that we have had for 200 years \nin this country, the concept of federalism.\n  I think this proposal is another step down the road toward a Federal \ntakeover of our criminal justice system. For most of America's history, \nFederal involvement in criminal law was limited to national issues. Yet \nin this age of mass media and saturation coverage, Congress and the \nWhite House are ever eager to pass Federal criminal laws. Chief Justice \nRehnquist has said this. To appear responsive to every highly \npublicized societal ill or sensational crime, the Congress acts in \nthese areas and creates more and more Federal crimes out of what should \nbe State and local offenses.\n\n  We have reached the point where nobody really knows how many Federal \ncrimes now exist. Nobody can really calculate them, but we keep piling \nthem on, more and more. We have undoubtedly surpassed an old estimate \nthat we had awhile back of 3,000. A hearing I chaired last year \nreviewed an American Bar Association task force report from leaders in \nthe criminal justice system who counseled restraint in federalizing \ncrime control.\n  Justice Brandeis once said:\n\n       Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with \n     serious consequences to the Nation. It is one of the happy \n     incidents of the federal system that a single courageous \n     State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and \n     try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the \n     rest of the country.\n\n  That is the system we have. States address these issues in different \nways. Why should we, as the Federal Government, impose one size fits \nall on a populace that is not in agreement on exactly what that should \nbe? Why should the States not have the leeway to do what States have \nalways done in our system?\n  Last but not least, this is a solution looking for a problem for the \nmost part. Every State in the Union has addressed this issue. We have \nbecome more mindful that in some cases victims are not getting the \nattention they need. So every State in the Union has taken a look at \nthis. We think the system works out pretty well. For the most part, our \npublic officials are doing what they are supposed to do.\n  Some States have gone so far as to change their constitutions. Some \nStates in the middle have passed legislation. But every State, one way \nor another, has addressed this, doing what States are supposed to be \ndoing, responding to the demands of their local citizens. My State of \nTennessee changed its constitution with regard to this. There is \nabsolutely no need for us to federalize this particular area of \ncriminal law.\n  Finally, my primary concern, besides the ones of upsetting our \nconstitutional framework and system that we have enjoyed in this \ncountry for so long, is that--because of the complexity, because of the \nincreased litigation and problems that we can't even anticipate now \nwith a three-party procedure instead of a two-party procedure, \nquestions that will have to be resolved by courts not knowing what kind \nof delays all this is going to produce and messing up our system and so \nforth--we will wind up in many cases hurting a victim's interests more \nthan we will help them. As I said from the outset, the victim's primary \ninterest is to make sure that a defendant who is guilty in fact be \nfound guilty in\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\na fair, efficient way that is uncomplicated, uncluttered, and that does \nnot go on forever.\n  Therefore, I urge that we reject this constitutional amendment. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Tennessee for \nwhat he said. He is a very thoughtful Senator with great respect for \nwhat the Senate's role is in our whole Federal system. We miss him on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. I think that can be fairly said by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle because of his thoughtful \ninvolvement and debate. I note that when he was there, he raised \nsimilar issues. His voice was one that helped shape the debate. I thank \nhim for it. I compliment him for it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I understand that under the cloture rules, I \nam afforded 1 hour of debate time. I designate Senator Daschle to \ncontrol my hour.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. J. Res. 3, \nthe proposed constitutional amendment to establish certain rights for \nvictims of violent crime. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant legislative proposal introduced by Senators Kyl and \nFeinstein.\n  I have always cherished the basic freedoms established by the United \nStates Constitution. This precious document provides important rights \nto every American--rights which have encouraged their active \nparticipation in the functions of our Republic. For example, the First \nAmendment encourages free speech and association, while the 19th and \n26th Amendments were ratified to protect the voting rights of women and \neighteen-year-old citizens.\n  As we debate the merits of the proposed Crime Victims Constitutional \nAmendment, I am reminded of the constitutional rights guaranteed to \npersons accused of crime. These include the right: to a speedy and \npublic trial by jury; to know the nature of the accusation; to confront \nwitnesses; to counsel; and rights against excessive bail, fines, or \ncruel or unusual punishment. These rights promote the involvement of \nthe accused in court and should not be diminished by Congressional \naction.\n  In recent years, Congress has enacted legislation that seeks to \nestablish certain rights for victims of crime, including the 1990 \nVictims Rights and Restitution Act, which required federal law \nenforcement agencies to make their best efforts to ensure that crime \nvictims are treated with fairness and respect. Most recently, we \nenacted the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 and the Victims \nRights Clarification Act of 1997, which sought to allow crime victims \nto observe court proceedings even if they were expected to testify \nduring the sentencing hearing. Additionally, all fifty states now have \neither constitutional amendments or statutes that seek to protect the \nrights of crime victims.\n  Despite these efforts by Congress and the States, I am very concerned \nthat the United States Constitution does not protect the rights of \nvictims and promote their involvement in the criminal justice process. \nIn my view, the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment is the most effective \nway to address the current imbalance between the rights of defendants \nand victims within the Constitution. As a constituent from St. Paul \nrecently wrote, the proposed amendment will, ``Prevent victims from \nbeing victimized twice. First, by the crime, then by the judicial \nsystem when they learn that those accused have all the rights.'' These \nconcerns are shared by the Department of Justice, constitutional \nscholars, and various victim advocates such as the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime \nvictims is not a new concept. As my colleagues may know, it was first \nrecommended in 1982 by President Reagan's Task Force on Victims of \nCrime. Since its initial introduction during the 104th Congress, \nSenators Kyl and Feinstein have worked tirelessly to improve this \nproposal and preserve the rights of defendants and the authority of \nprosecutors. Importantly, the Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional \nAmendment received strong, bipartisan support upon its passage by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee earlier this month.\n  I would not support a proposal to change the fundamental character of \nthe Constitution or eliminate the basic freedoms that it provides to \nAmericans. However, I also believe that the rights of crime victims are \nnot trivial to the needs of our nation and are worthy of protection \nunder the Constitution. Passing additional laws or state constitutional \namendments that may be ignored by federal and state court comes at the \nexpense of those who have fallen victim to violent crime and who expect \nequal justice from the criminal justice system.\n  In addition, we must not forget that many crime victims are afraid of \nbeing victimized again and face retaliation by criminal offenders. We \nmust ensure that victims feel respected throughout the criminal justice \nprocess. I believe establishing certain constitutional rights for crime \nvictims will help to encourage greater reporting of crimes and \ncooperation with law enforcement. The Crime Victims' Constitutional \nAmendment would allow for greater participation in the criminal justice \nsystem in a manner completely consistent with constitutional amendments \nthat have established a citizen's right to participate in other \ngovernment processes.\n  I respectfully disagree with those who suggest that the Crime \nVictims' Constitutional Amendment conflicts with the principle of \nfederalism. As someone who has worked to maintain the distinction \nbetween federal and state responsibility, I am pleased that this \namendment provides an appropriate level of flexibility to the States. \nSpecifically, this amendment would allow the States to pass legislation \nto define ``victims of crime'' and ``crimes of violence.'' It would \nalso allow States to determine the degree of ``reasonable'' notice to \npublic proceedings or the release or escape of a criminal offender that \nwill be provided to crime victims.\n  Ultimately, it will be three-quarters of the States that must decide \nwhether to consider and ratify this amendment. Passage of this \namendment will not impose any rights upon the States without careful \nand lengthy consideration by the State legislatures. In fact, this \namendment has been endorsed by 49 of our nation's Governors, the \nelected officials who are most concerned about unnecessary federal \nmandates being imposed upon the States. Additionally, the Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO) has indicated that this amendment will not impose \nadditional costs upon the States.\n  I also understand the concerns of those who suggest that the Crime \nVictims' Rights Amendment will disadvantage defendants during court \nproceedings. However, the amendment does not deprive the accused of any \nof their constitutional rights. It would ensure respect and basic \nfairness for crime victims through a constitutional right to be \nnotified of court proceedings; to attend all public proceedings; to be \nheard at crucial stages in the process; to be notified of the \noffender's release or escape; to consideration for a trial free from \nunreasonable delay; to an order of restitution; to have the safety of \nthe victim considered in determining a release from custody; and to be \nnotified of these basic rights.\n  In proclaiming the first ``Victims Rights Week'' in 1981, President \nReagan stated, ``For too long, the victims of crime have been the \nforgotten persons of our criminal justice system. Rarely do we give \nvictims the help they need or the attention they deserve. Yet the \nprotection of our citizens--to guard them from becoming victims--is the \nprimary purpose of our penal laws. Thus, each new victim personally \nrepresents an instance in which our system has failed to prevent crime. \nLack of concern for victims compounds that failure.''\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that the Crime Victims' Rights \nAmendment will help to restore public confidence in the criminal \njustice system and give crime victims the protection they deserve. The \nhigh number of crime victims in our society underscores the need to \npass this amendment and send it to the States for their careful \nconsideration. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this \nimportant public safety initiative.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as the Senate once again considers an \namendment to the United States Constitution, this time to protect the\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nrights of crime victims, I ask that George Will's column from Sunday's \nWashington Post be printed in the Record in its entirety. He offers a \nwell-reasoned analysis of the concerns the proposed amendment raises.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 23, 2000]\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n                            Tinkering Again\n\n       Congress's constitutional fidgets continue. For the fourth \n     time in 29 days there will be a vote on a constitutional \n     amendment. The House failed to constitutionalize fiscal \n     policy with an amendment to require a balanced budget. The \n     Senate failed to eviscerate the First Amendment by empowering \n     Congress to set ``reasonable limits'' on the funding of \n     political speech. The Senate failed to stop the epidemic of \n     flag burning by an amendment empowering Congress to ban flag \n     desecration. And this week the Senate will vote on an \n     amendment to protect the rights of crime victims.\n       Because many conservatives consider the amendment a \n     corrective for a justice system too tilted toward the rights \n     of the accused, because liberals relish minting new rights \n     and federalizing things, and because no one enjoys voting \n     against victims, the vote is expected to be close. But the \n     amendment is imprudent.\n       The amendment would give victims of violent crimes rights \n     to ``reasonable'' notice of and access to public proceedings \n     pertaining to the crime; to be heard at, or to submit a \n     statement to, proceedings to determine conditional release \n     from custody, plea bargaining, sentencing or hearings \n     pertaining to parole, pardon or commutation of sentence; \n     reasonable notice of, and consideration of victim safety \n     regarding, a release or escape from custody relating to the \n     crime; a trial free from unreasonable delay; restitution from \n     convicted offenders.\n       Were this amendment added to the Constitution, America \n     would need more--a lot more--appellate judges to handle \n     avalanches of litigation, starting with the definition of \n     ``victim.'' For example, how many relatives or loved ones of \n     a murder victim will have victims' rights? Then there are all \n     the requirements of ``reasonableness.'' The Supreme Court--\n     never mind lower courts--has heard more than 100 cases since \n     1961 just about the meaning of the Fourth Amendment's \n     prohibition of ``unreasonable'' searches.\n       What is the meaning of the right to ``consideration'' \n     regarding release of a prisoner? And if victims acquire this \n     amendment's panoply of participatory rights, what becomes of, \n     for example, a victim who is also a witness testifying in the \n     trial, and therefore, not entitled to unlimited attendance? \n     What is the right of the victim to object to a plea bargain \n     that a prosecutor might strike with a criminal in order to \n     reach other criminals who are more dangerous to society but \n     are of no interest to the victim?\n       Federalism considerations also argue against this \n     amendment, and not only because it is an unfunded mandate of \n     unknowable cost. States have general police powers. As the \n     Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed, the federal \n     government--never mind its promiscuous federalizing of crimes \n     in recent decades--does not. Thus Roger Pilon, director of \n     the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, \n     says the Victims' Rights Amendment is discordant with ``the \n     very structure and purpose of the Constitution.''\n       Pilon says the Framers' ``guarded'' approach to \n     constitutionalism was to limit government to certain ends and \n     certain ways of pursuing them. Government, they thought, \n     existed to secure natural rights--rights that do not derive \n     from government. Thus the Bill of Rights consists of grand \n     negatives, saying what government may not do. But the \n     Victims' Rights Amendment has, Pilon says, the flavor of \n     certain European constitutions that treat rights not as \n     liberties government must respect but as entitlements \n     government must provide.\n       There should be a powerful predisposition against \n     unnecessary tinkering with the nation's constituting \n     document, reverence for which is diminished by treating it as \n     malleable. And all of the Victims' Rights Amendment's aims \n     can be, and in many cases are being, more appropriately and \n     expeditiously addressed by states, which can fine-tune their \n     experiments with victims' rights more easily than can the \n     federal government after it constitutionalizes those rights.\n       The fact that all 50 states have addressed victims' rights \n     with constitutional amendments or statutes, or both, \n     strengthens the suspicion that the proposed amendment is (as \n     the Equal Rights Amendment would have been) an exercise in \n     using--misusing, actually--the Constitution for the \n     expressive purpose of affirming a sentiment or aspiration. \n     The Constitution would be diminished by treating it as a \n     bulletin board for admirable sentiments and a place to give \n     special dignity to certain social policies. (Remember the \n     jest that libraries used to file the French constitution \n     under periodicals.)\n       The Constitution has been amended just 18 times (counting \n     ratification of the first 10 amendments as a single act) in \n     211 years. The 19th time should not be for the Victims' \n     Rights Amendment. It would be constitutional clutter, \n     unnecessary and, because it would require constant judicial \n     exegesis, a source of vast uncertainty in the administration \n     of justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2851-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 85th \nanniversary of the 1915 Genocide of the Armenians by the Turkish \nGovernment. As so many of you are aware, between 1915 and 1923 more \nthan one and a half million Armenians perished from atrocities \ncommitted against them. Yet the brave Armenian people persevered.\n  As the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, I am, of course, very \nfamiliar with the historic ties that have bound Armenians to the \nLebanese. We have sheltered and strengthened one another in time of \nneed. As peoples we have become close because the experience of being \nforced from one's home and homeland is not new to either of us.\n  Through mass deportations, starvation, disease, and outright \nmassacres, Armenians have carried their heads high, as they carried on \ntheir way of life or carried their culture to new lands. The strength \nand pride in Armenian heritage have kept alive the memory of those who \nperished in the genocide. I rise today to pay tribute to that strong, \nproud heritage.\n  As a constant symbol of the strength and perseverance through which \noppressed peoples survive, the Armenian genocide must serve as a \nreminder that we must never forget the atrocities of the past, lest \nthey be repeated.\n  The Senate Immigration Subcommittee, which I chair, recently held \nhearings on the status of Albanian refugees in Kosovo. I must say that \nI was impressed with the strength and faith of these people in the face \nof the great hardships visited on their people. And I was reminded of \nanother people ``cleansed'' from its homeland by brutal invaders.\n  But too few Americans are in a position to make that comparison. In \nthe 85 years since the massacre of Armenians began, another great crime \nhas been committed--the crime of keeping the truth from the world.\n  This was a crime against all people, because it denied them the \nlessons to be learned from that tragic tale. But most of all it was a \ncrime against all Armenians, alive and dead. For even the dead have at \nleast one right--that of having their story told.\n  The 1.5 million Armenians who died deserve to have the truth of their \nsuffering known. Only when we know the horror that they went through \ncan we comprehend the gravity of the crime. Only then will the rights \nof the dead be fulfilled. This is why we must make sure younger \ngenerations understand what happened and ensure that it never happens \nagain.\n  Eighty-four years ago the world had the opportunity to prevent the \nArmenian holocaust. But the world did not act. While there was much \ntalk, there was no real help for the Armenians. If only we had known \nthen that tyranny must be opposed early and steadfastly, perhaps this \nand future acts of genocide could have been prevented.\n  But the world does not learn easily. Even today, massacres take place \naround the world, with people murdered not for what they have done but \nfor whom they are.\n  And we must wonder about the final goals of those who continue the \nblockade of Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh. We must make known to the \nworld our opposition to such policies. We must fight to defend Section \n907, cutting off American aid to those enforcing the embargo. And we \nmust not allow the lure of cheap oil from the Caspian, an illusion, \nreally, lead us away from the path of truth and justice.\n  To do justice to the memory of those who died we must see to it that \njustice is done to the living, to those who survived them. That means \ndoing justice to Armenia, as well as to Armenians and other refugees.\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\n  Today, I would like to join the Armenian-American community in \nremembering the horrors of the Armenian Genocide. We all would profit \nby reflecting on the strength of the Armenian people to persevere \nthrough this awful period in history.\n  But today is not only a day to mourn those lost in this genocide but \nalso a day to celebrate the resilience of the people of Armenia as they \nbuild a new democracy. Finally freed from communist imperialism, \nArmenia has quickly become one of the most democratic of the former \nSoviet Republics and has made great strides to adopt a market economy. \nI am gratified at the many cultural exchanges taking place between our \ntwo nations.\n  As chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee I also am gratified at \nall the wonderful examples of success through hard work that have been \nprovided by Armenian immigrants. Such stories make the argument for a \nkind and open policy toward refugees, victims of latter-day massacres, \nmuch stronger.\n  I salute all Armenians today, I salute their predecessors who \nsuffered so grievously, and I salute their struggle to let the truth be \nknown.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday, April 24, marked the 85th \nanniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide. I rise today to \nacknowledge and commemorate this terrible crime and to help ensure that \nit will never be forgotten.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and \nunconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an eight year period, 1.5 \nmillion Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from \ntheir homes, their property and land confiscated.\n  As Americans, we are blessed with freedom and security, but that \nblessing brings with it an important responsibility. We must never \nallow oppression and persecution to pass without condemnation. By \ncommemorating the Armenian genocide, we renew our commitment always to \nfight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a message that the \nworld can never allow genocide to be perpetrated again.\n  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the \nliving. Out of the ashes of their history Armenians all across the \nworld have clung to their identity and have prospered in new \ncommunities. My State of California is fortunate to be home to a \ncommunity of Armenian-Americans a half a million strong. They are a \nstrong and vibrant community whose members participate in every aspect \nof civic life, and California is richer for their presence.\n  Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian genocide; let their \ndeaths not be in vain. We must remember their tragedy to ensure that \nsuch crimes can never be repeated. And as we remember Armenia's dark \npast, we can take some consolation in the knowledge that its future is \nbright with possibility.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 85th \nAnniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Each year we need to remember and \nhonor the victims, and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to \nhave with us today.\n  During the 8-year period from 1915 to 1923, approximately 1.5 million \nArmenians were killed and hundreds of thousands were driven from their \nhomes. April 24, 1915 serves as a marking point for the government-\norchestrated carnage that took place under the Turkish Ottoman Empire. \nOn this date, over 5,000 Armenians were systematically hunted down and \nkilled in Constantinople. This number includes some 600 Armenian \npolitical and intellectual leaders who were taken to the interior of \nTurkey and systematically murdered.\n  A Polish law professor named Raphael Lemkin was the first to call the \natrocities committed upon the Armenian people during period of 1915 to \n1923 the ``Armenian Genocide.'' Lemkin is also credited with coining \nthe word ``genocide'' and making genocide a crime under international \nlaw. In 1939, Professor Lemkin escaped Poland during the Nazi invasion. \nLemkin would ultimately lose 49 members of his family during the \nHolocaust. Until his death in 1959, Lemkin worked for the adoption of \nthe U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the crime of \nGenocide, which was ratified by the United States in 1988. Through this \nindividual, these dark periods of Jewish and Armenian history have been \njoined in the important cause of remembrance.\n  Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the \nArmenian people will not be in vain. That is surely the highest tribute \nwe can pay to the Armenian victims and a way in which the horror and \nbrutality of their deaths can be given redeeming meaning. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in remembering the Armenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2852-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2852-S2853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAIR PAY FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we continue to wage our ongoing battle \nin Congress for a fair increase in the minimum wage for millions of \nworkers across America, it is important to understand that low-income \nworkers in all parts of the country are doing all they can themselves \nto obtain fair increases in pay from their employers.\n  One of the most important examples in recent weeks has been the \nstrike by janitors in Los Angeles, who were seeking a long overdue \nreasonable increase in wages during this time of remarkable prosperity \nfor most Americans.\n  At the beginning of last week, an excellent column by respected \njournalist David S. Broder appeared in The Washington Post and many \nother newspapers across the country, calling national attention to the \nstrike, and emphasizing the issues of fundamental fairness at the heart \nof this dispute. Mr. Broder noted recent reports of the lavish salary \nand bonus packages totaling millions or even tens of millions of \ndollars a year available to the top executives of major firms across \nthe country, and he compared these extraordinary benefits with the low \nsalaries of the janitors in this dispute, whose lives ``are lived on \nthe ragged edge of poverty.''\n  I had the opportunity to meet with many of the striking workers and \ntheir union leaders on a visit to Los Angeles during the recess, and to \nexpress my support for them in their battle and to commend them for \ntheir courage.\n  Fortunately, a tentative agreement on the issues in the strike was \nreached over the weekend, and a settlement granting a significant pay \nincrease and other benefits was overwhelmingly approved by a vote of \nthe workers yesterday. The President of the local union called the \nagreement ``the beginning of a new era for organized labor.''\n  Justice for these janitors means progress toward justice for all \nworking men and women across America. Their cause was just, and because \nof timely and important articles like David Broder's, more and more \npeople across America are becoming aware of these fundamental issues \nand their extraordinary importance for our society.\n  I commend Mr. Broder for his eloquent analysis and insight, and I ask \nunanimous consent that his column in The Washington Post on April 16, \nentitled ``Of Janitors and Billionaires,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 16, 2000]\n\n                      Of Janitors and Billionaires\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       LOS ANGELES--The janitors on strike at the office buildings \n     near the downtown hotel where I stayed for a couple days last \n     week were the most polite picketers I have ever seen. The \n     largely Latino groups of men and women standing on the plaza \n     from which several of the city's highest office towers rise \n     greeted visitors with elaborate courtesy and seemed genuinely \n     grateful when anyone accepted one of their handouts \n     explaining why they had stopped using their brushes and \n     brooms.\n       It was about money, they said, about struggling to support \n     their families and themselves at a pay scale ranging from $7 \n     to $8 an hour--about $300 a week before taxes.\n       The Service Employees International Union, representing \n     about 8,500 janitors, called the strike to back up its demand \n     for raises of $1 an hour each year for the next three years. \n     If granted, that would allow members of these overnight crews \n     to make the magnificent sum of about $21,000 a year in 2003.\n       The janitorial service companies that have contracts with \n     these towering buildings, filled with banks, law firms and \n     corporate offices, were counter-offering raises of about one-\n     third that size, also spread over three years.\n       This is part of the overlooked reality of this era of \n     record prosperity--a story that receives far less attention \n     in the press and on television than the gyrations of the\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\n     Nasdaq. Understandably so, for the Nasdaq determines the \n     value of the stock options held by the high-tech millionaires \n     who are the ``masters of the universe'' in the new economy, \n     the stars whose spectacular success draws envious glances \n     from those Americans who cannot imagine enjoying such riches, \n     unless they hit the lottery or have a spectacular run of luck \n     on one of the TV game shows.\n       As Shawn Hubler, a Los Angeles Times columnist, noted last \n     week, ``the janitors' strike . . . has brought to the surface \n     something deeply resonant about the lives, now, of all 1.3 \n     million of the region's working poor.'' Hubler described how \n     the janitors arrive to begin their tedious, wearying chores \n     just after most of the tenants have left the building, and \n     how she watched one late-working executive push open the door \n     to a freshly cleaned bathroom, with nary a nod of \n     acknowledgment to the woman janitor who had her equipment \n     cart just a few feet away. ``There is a dimension now,'' \n     Hubler wrote, ``in which whole human beings can be rendered \n     invisible, just erased.''\n       Ralph Ellison described the phenomenon as experienced by \n     black folks in his novel of the last generation, ``Invisible \n     Man.'' But we imagine we have become more sensitive, more \n     aware in our time. Not so. There are millions of people whose \n     work makes our life easier, from busboys in the restaurants \n     we patronize to orderlies in the hospitals we visit, but \n     whose own lives are lived on the ragged edge of poverty. Most \n     of us never exchange a sentence with these workers.\n       Meanwhile, the rich get steadily richer. The wall Street \n     Journal, not exactly a radical publication, printed its \n     annual survey of executive pay on April 6. Reporter Joann S. \n     Lublin cited a study of 350 major firms, conducted by William \n     M. Mercer Inc., a New York compensation consulting firm. It \n     found that the median salary and bonus package for the top \n     executives of those firms in 1999 was $1,688,088. That's \n     about $120,000 higher than it was in 1998 and just about what \n     80 of the striking janitors combined would make three years \n     from now--if they got what they are asking. But it's only \n     one-hundredth as much as the $170 million in salary, bonuses \n     and stock options the highest-paid executive in the survey, \n     L. Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco International, made in 1999.\n       How do you justify those extremes? the Journal quotes \n     Jeffrey D. Christian, head of a Cleveland executive \n     recruiting firm, as explaining that the business heads he \n     meets ``all want the same opportunity for extreme wealth \n     creation and legacy creation as their dot-com counter-parts. \n     It's billionaire envy.''\n       Another article in the special section--and remember this \n     is the Wall Street Journal, not Mother Jones--reported about \n     the increasing use of bonus guarantees to recruit or retain \n     executives. One boss named Thomas Evans ``will collect as \n     much as $10 million if his vested stock options would yield a \n     profit of less than that by August 2002,'' the Journal said. \n     And then there are the sweetheart deals, in which outside \n     directors on a firm's compensation committee grant lavish \n     salary increases or stock options to the CEO, who in turn \n     arranges lucrative consulting contracts for those same \n     directors.\n       It's doubtful many of the striking janitors have read the \n     Journal's special section. If they did, they wouldn't be \n     quite so polite.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2853-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL READING PANEL\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on April 13, 2000, the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation received the report of the National Reading Panel. The \nsubcommittee also heard testimony from Dr. Duane Alexander, Director of \nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Dr. Kent \nMcGuire, Assistant Secretary of Education, Office of Educational \nResearch and Improvement; and Dr. Donald N. Langenberg, Chairman of the \nNational Reading Panel and Chancellor of the University System of \nMaryland.\n  The National Reading Panel was created as a result of legislation I \nintroduced in 1997, titled the ``Successful Reading Research and \nInstruction Act.'' Subsequently, the report accompanying the Fiscal \nYear 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act called on the National Institute of Child \nHealth and Human Development and the Department of Education to form a \npanel to evaluate existing research on the teaching of reading to \nchildren, identify proven methodologies, and suggest ways for \ndissemination of this information to teachers, parents, universities \nand others.\n  I was convinced at the time that there was an absence of consensus on \na national strategy for teaching children to read. Meanwhile, we had \nstatistics which showed that 40 to 60 percent of elementary students \nwere not reading proficiently and there seemed to be no plan to help \nremedy the situation.\n  The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 had mandated research on \nwhy children have difficulties learning to read. The National Institute \nof Child Health and Human Development had conducted this research and \nin 1997, they had some answers. However, Congress hadn't asked for the \nresults and the information was literally trapped in the academic and \nresearch world.\n  Since 1997, we've made some progress. Today more people know that \nreading research exists, but very few of us are able to decipher what \nit means, or how to translate it into meaningful practice.\n  Mr. President, what most parents want to know is simple, ``How can I \nmake sure my child will learn to read?'' Until now, the response to \nthat question was often vague, and the so-called ``expert'' or \n``research based'' methods were conflicting. Consequently, there is a \ngreat deal of confusion among parents, teachers and school \nadministrators about improving reading skills of children. Meanwhile, \nthe Federal government has spent nearly $100 million on programs which \none researcher described as, ``at best, it shouldn't hurt.''\n  The National Reading Panel identified over 100,000 studies on a \nvariety of topics related to reading instruction. It held regional \nhearings to receive testimony from teachers, parents, students, \nuniversity faculty, educational policy experts and scientists who \nrepresented the population that would ultimately be the users of its \nfindings. The panel used the information from these hearings and their \npreliminary research to identify five topics for intensive study: \nalphabetics; fluency; comprehension; teacher education and reading \ninstruction; and computer technology and reading instruction.\n  The panel then narrowed its review to materials which met a defined \nset of rigorous research methodological standards. It is the \ndevelopment of these standards which the panel describes as ``what may \nbe its most important action.'' By finding successful techniques that \nmeet the same kind of scientific review that are used to test medical \ntreatments, the panel presents its recommendations with a confidence \nthat has never before been applied to the teaching of reading.\n  One of the National Reading Panel's objectives was to ensure that \ngood research results were readily available. On April 13, the report \nwas sent to every Senator and Member of Congress. Within the next few \nweeks, the report and supporting documentation will be delivered to \nstate education officials, colleges and universities, and public \nlibraries. A long-term strategic plan that will address wider \ndissemination and classroom implementation will be ready by next fall. \nIt is my hope that the report of the National Reading Panel will guide \nus in making informed decisions on reading issues.\n  I commend the efforts of the National Reading Panel and I hope \neducators will implement their recommendations and use the new teaching \nmethods and programs outlined in the report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2853-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2853-S2856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nROLE OF INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY IN COUNTERING PROLIFERATION \n                           OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this week the sixth Nonproliferation Treaty \nReview Conference opened in New York.\n  At the last conference five years ago countries agreed to extend \nindefinitely the treaty. I recently introduced, along with Senators \nBaucus, Kerry, Roth, Bingaman, Kerrey, Kohl, and Schumer, Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 107, expressing support for another successful \nreview conference. A similar bipartisan resolution will be introduced \nin the House. I hope my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee \nwill consider this resolution as quickly as possible.\n  Some delegates to the conference have suggested that the United \nStates is not as strongly committed as it once was to arms control, \nciting as examples the Senate failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty (CTBT) and Administration negotiations with the Russians to \nmodify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. I wish, as do many of my \ndistinguished colleagues, that the CTBT had been ratified. I hope that \nit will be. Nevertheless, I believe all my colleagues, regardless of \ntheir position on this issue, share a strong and abiding interest in \npursuing arms control agreements and making the\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nworld more secure from threats from weapons of mass destruction.\n  As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright observed in here address to \nthe delegations to the conference ``the United States is part of the \ninternational consensus on nuclear disarmament.'' We have taken \nconsiderable steps with our allies to reduce our nuclear weapons \narsenal and have made a commitment to further reductions with the \nRussians.\n  I share the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's concern--\nexpressed at the Review Conference--that ``nuclear conflict remains a \nvery real and very terrifying possibility at the beginning of the 21st \ncentury.'' The nuclear weapons testing by India and Pakistan in 1998 \nare added reasons to be worried.\n  Equally disturbing are reports that Iran is still pursuing secretly a \nnuclear weapon and long range missile program. While we develop a \nnational missile defense program to protect us against limited attacks, \nwe must strengthen those arms control regimes which help to contain the \nspread of weapons systems to states who may wish to harm us.\n  One of the steps that the United States and other states can take is \nto strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The \nNonproliferation Treaty (NPT) made the IAEA safeguards system the \nverification arm of the NPT. While the IAEA does provide some technical \nassistance to countries for the peaceful use of nuclear technology, it \nalso inspects the nuclear inventories of non-nuclear weapon members of \nthe NPT to ensure there are no diversions to weapons use.\n  The Gulf War disclosed for the first time an Iraq nuclear weapons \nprogram which was being carried out despite IAEA inspections. This \ndisclosure provided new impetus to strengthening the IAEA inspection \nsystem. The IAEA has developed a strengthened safeguards program which \nconsists of more intrusive and aggressive inspections. The agency also \nproposes a new inspection protocol giving its inspectors more authority \nto collect information. Some 46 countries have signed the protocol \nwhich the United States helped develop.\n  But the increase in membership in the IAEA and the strengthened \ninspection system has meant more demands on IAEA inspectors and \nfacilities. I asked the Congressional Research Service to prepare a \nbrief on the IAEA to explain its new functions. Zachary Davis, CRS's \nSpecialist in International Nuclear Policy, is to be commended for his \nwork on this subject. I urge my colleagues to read his analysis--\n``Nuclear Weapons: Strengthening International Atomic Energy Agency \nInspections.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record \nin full, following my remarks. The IAEA deserves our full support and \nthe NPT Review Conference deserves our full attention. Again, I urge my \ncolleagues to express their support by co-sponsoring S. Con. Res. 107.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Nuclear Weapons: Strengthening International Atomic Energy Agency \n                              Inspections\n\n    (By Zachary S. Davis, Specialist, International Nuclear Policy \n               Resources, Science and Industry Division)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an \n     international organization established to achieve two goals. \n     First, it operates an international inspection system to \n     provide assurances that nuclear materials and technology in \n     use for civilian purposes are not diverted to make nuclear \n     weapons. Second, the IAEA provides assistance in civilian \n     applications of nuclear technology for energy, agriculture, \n     medicine and science. The IAEA is strengthening its \n     inspection system to cope with countries such as Iraq and \n     North Korea that established covert nuclear weapons programs \n     and refused to cooperate with inspections, despite their \n     membership in the Nonproliferation Treaty.\n       The strengthened safeguards system provides IAEA inspectors \n     with greater access to a wider range of nuclear activities. \n     New technologies will improve inspectors' ability to detect \n     undeclared nuclear activities. A new protocol to the standard \n     IAEA inspection agreement gives inspectors more information \n     and access. However, these improvements will require \n     additional resources from member states. This report outlines \n     the IAEA mission and describes efforts to improve it. It will \n     be updated as events merit.\n\n\n        background: iaea inspections and the ``nuclear bargain''\n\n       The IAEA was established in 1957 as part of President \n     Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program to provide independent \n     assurances that the spread of civilian nuclear technology did \n     not also promote the spread of nuclear weapons. Exporters of \n     nuclear technology such as the United States asked the IAEA \n     to apply safeguards on nuclear technologies, such as \n     reactors, and materials, such as nuclear fuel, to make sure \n     that the purchasers did not use them to make nuclear weapons. \n     The IAEA gained new responsibilities in 1970 when the \n     Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) designated the IAEA safeguards \n     system as the global verification mechanism for the NPT. \n     The Agency also provides technical assistance for \n     countries to use nuclear technology for energy, medicine, \n     agriculture, and scientific research. The balance between \n     technical assistance and nuclear safeguards is often \n     referred to as the ``nuclear bargain:'' in return for \n     receiving civilian nuclear technology, recipient nations \n     agreed to international safeguards.\n       Organization. The Director General of the IAEA is Mohomed \n     ElBaradei, a U.S.-trained, Egyptian diplomat who served many \n     years as head of the IAEA legal department. The main policy-\n     making body is the Board of Governors, which has 35 members, \n     including states with advanced nuclear programs. The General \n     Conference of all 131 members meets annually to debate Agency \n     positions, programs and priorities.\n       Inspections Based on Inventories, Not Risk of Diversion. \n     All non-nuclear weapon members of the Nonproliferation Treaty \n     agree to allow the IAEA to inspect their nuclear inventories. \n     Each country provides an initial declaration and regular \n     reports on its inventory, which the IAEA then inspects on a \n     regular basis. The amount of inspection efforts is determined \n     by how much nuclear material a country has. Under this \n     formula, countries with large civil nuclear programs such as \n     Japan, Germany, South Korea, and Canada receive the most \n     attention, while countries possessing much smaller amounts of \n     nuclear material such as Iran and Iraq receive much less \n     attention.\n       The Agency's members and its founding statutes do not allow \n     it to shift inspection resources from currently trusted \n     countries that possess large amounts of nuclear material, \n     such as Japan, to focus on countries with small but growing \n     nuclear programs that are considered to be proliferation \n     risks, such as Iran. One way to address this problem is \n     through across-the-board increases in the Agency's global \n     inspection system, although IAEA members have insisted for \n     many years on maintaining a zero-growth budget.\n       Weapons States and Non-NPT Members. The five legally \n     recognized nuclear weapon states (Britain, France, China \n     Russia, United States) are not obligated to accept \n     inspections, but in practice do allow some access to some \n     facilities on a voluntary basis. Nearly all non-weapon states \n     that possess nuclear capabilities accept comprehensive \n     safeguards. Only a few countries (India, Israel, Pakistan, \n     Cuba) have not joined the NPT, but even these are members of \n     the IAEA and accept safeguards at selected facilities.\n       Numbers of inspections. The IAEA conducts thousands of \n     inspections annually. In 1998 the Agency performed 2,507 \n     safeguards inspections at 897 facilities and other locations \n     worldwide. At the end of 1998, 222 safeguards agreements were \n     in force in 138 states (and Taiwan). This includes safeguards \n     agreements with 126 states pursuant to the NPT. (The NPT has \n     187 member states, but many of these are developing countries \n     that do not posses nuclear material or facilities that need \n     to be inspected.) The quantities of nuclear materials and \n     numbers of facilities under IAEA safeguards are growing \n     steadily. As a result of growing stocks of nuclear \n     materials, IAEA resources are being stretched thinner and \n     may not keep pace with this growing demand.\n\n\n                         Successes and Failures\n\n       A few NPT member states have violated their obligations and \n     diverted civilian nuclear technology and materials to covert \n     weapons programs.\n       Iraq. Iraq was a party to the NPT for many years, but used \n     its civil nuclear program to disguise an extensive nuclear \n     weapons program. IAEA inspectors did not learn the full \n     nature and extent of Iraq's nuclear weapons program until the \n     Gulf War, when Allied forces attacked many undeclared nuclear \n     installations. After the war, the United Nations Security \n     Council created the Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) to \n     account for and eliminate Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological weapons and missiles. The IAEA headed the nuclear \n     inspections. Iraq quit cooperating with UNSCOM in 1999; \n     efforts to reestablish inspections in Iraq have been blocked \n     by Russia and France in the Security Council, although IAEA \n     inspectors were allowed to inspect nuclear material remaining \n     in Iraq in January 2000.\n       North Korea. North Korea acceded to the NPT in 1985, but \n     refused to accept safeguards until 1992. When North Korea \n     finally allowed safeguards inspections, it provided \n     incomplete and contradictory information and then blocked \n     IAEA access to key sites. The IAEA quickly discovered the \n     discrepancies and reported Pyongyang's noncompliance to the \n     United Nations Security Council, which urged North Korea to \n     comply, but took no further action. North Korea refused \n     access and threatened to quit the NPT. Nevertheless, North \n     Korea remains obligated under\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\n     the NPT to allow IAEA inspections, despite its noncompliance. \n     The IAEA has repeatedly called upon North Korea to comply \n     with its NPT safeguards obligations. Under the 1994 Agreed \n     Framework between the United States and North Korea, the IAEA \n     monitors the shut-down of North Korea's declared nuclear \n     facilities, but is not able to apply full safeguards. \n     However, North Korea must fully comply and allow the IAEA to \n     resolve all outstanding inspection questions before the \n     Agreed Framework can be fully implemented.\n       Inspections in Iraq and North Korea provide many lessons \n     for strengthening the IAEA safeguards system. Inspections in \n     South Africa after that country declared in 1991 that it had \n     dismantled its 6 nuclear weapons and joined the NPT also \n     helped the Agency learn how to improve its ability to detect \n     hidden nuclear activities and account for undeclared \n     activities such as those possessed by South Africa. Many \n     analysts expect the IAEA to be tested next in Iran, which has \n     a growing nuclear program but denies any interest in \n     acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\n\n                          How Safeguards Work\n\n       Each non-weapons member of the NPT signs an agreement with \n     the IAEA authorizing the Agency to keep track of the nuclear \n     materials in the country and provides the IAEA with an \n     inventory of its nuclear materials. IAEA inspectors verify \n     the declared inventories and make periodic visits to make \n     sure all the material can be accounted for. Agency inspectors \n     check records and take samples at reactors, fuel storage \n     facilities, and other nuclear installations to verify the \n     accuracy and completeness of each country's declared \n     inventory. Inspectors take a variety of measurements of \n     nuclear materials to verify their content (see below). The \n     Agency has a laboratory near its headquarters in Vienna, \n     Austria, where samples are analyzed. It also sends samples \n     to approved laboratories in several countries, including \n     the United States, for expert analysis. Inspectors attach \n     seals and tags to critical equipment to detect \n     unauthorized access. The Agency also installs video \n     cameras to monitor activities at nuclear facilities \n     throughout the world.\n       When questions arise about a country's nuclear inventory, \n     the Agency can request additional information and/or more \n     access to facilities. Normally, additional information can \n     resolve questions. However, in the past, inspectors have not \n     always pressed member states to resolve outstanding issues, \n     and states like Iraq and North Korea have attempted to take \n     advantage of the Agency's disinclination to confront member \n     states about incomplete or incorrect information. Recent \n     improvements in IAEA safeguards, however, are intended to \n     fill gaps and correct past deficiencies.\n\n\n                        strengthened safeguards\n\n       Since the early 1990s, the IAEA has been upgrading its \n     safeguards system to prevent a repeat of problems encountered \n     in Iraq and elsewhere. Most importantly, the Agency is taking \n     steps to detect undeclared nuclear activities such as found \n     in Iraq. Strengthened Safeguards, formerly referred to as the \n     93+2 Program, consists of legal, technical, and political \n     measures which are outlined below.\n       Information. Inspectors rely on information provided by the \n     states themselves, on information collected by the Agency \n     from the states and from open source information, and \n     information provided to the Agency by member states. Prior to \n     the Gulf War, member states had not provided intelligence \n     information to the IAEA. However, the Agency has increasingly \n     received and used intelligence provided by member states, as \n     well as expanding its use of open source information from a \n     variety of sources. Those types of information were critical \n     in detecting discrepancies in North Korea's initial \n     declaration of its inventory of nuclear material and in \n     uncovering the full extent of Iraq's nuclear program. \n     Recently the Agency has begun to use commercial satellite \n     imagery to augment its information data bases.\n       Access. One problem highlighted by the Agency's failure to \n     detect Iraq's extensive covert nuclear weapon program was the \n     limitations that member states put on its access to \n     facilities. In the past, the IAEA focused almost exclusively \n     on accounting for nuclear material, and did not pay much \n     attention to related equipment and installations. The IAEA \n     has reasserted its authority to gain access to all facilities \n     housing nuclear activities. However, additional authority is \n     needed and would be authorized by the new protocol inspection \n     agreement (see below).\n       Technology. The Agency is upgrading its inspection \n     equipment with the help of the United States and other member \n     states. Upgrades include new cameras and remote monitoring \n     equipment, more accurate measuring tools, and new methods of \n     detecting minute quantities of nuclear material in soil, \n     water, plants and air that can be collected from numerous \n     locations. The IAEA is also beginning to use commercial \n     satellite imagery to monitor developments at nuclear \n     installations.\n       Political and Financial Support. The IAEA depends on \n     support from member states to be effective. Contributions to \n     the regular budget are apportioned on the United Nations \n     scale of assessments. Most of the technology and equipment it \n     uses is contributed by members. Its budget is limited and \n     divided among several missions that are popular with certain \n     members, such as nuclear safety and technical assistance. \n     Given its budget constraints, the Agency depends on special \n     voluntary contributions to support programs of particular \n     interest to certain members, including advanced safeguards \n     and arms control.\n       Enforcement. Even when the IAEA discovers noncompliance, it \n     can only report to the United Nations Security Council. \n     Enforcement is a political decision of the Security Council \n     and its members.\n\n\n                     additional safeguards protocol\n\n       An important part of the Strengthened Safeguards effort is \n     a new inspection protocol that gives Agency inspectors more \n     authority to collect more information about a wider range of \n     nuclear activities (uranium mining, imports, exports, etc.), \n     to use more intrusive inspection methods, and to expand their \n     access to undeclared activities. The additional information \n     and access is required to reduce the risk of undeclared \n     nuclear activities going undetected, as they did in Iraq.\n       The United States, which played a primary role in \n     formulating the new inspection protocol, agreed to accept \n     some of the new measures on selected U.S. activities to \n     persuade others to sign it. The four other nuclear weapon \n     states also agreed to sign the protocol and implement it. The \n     United States, as a nuclear weapons state under the NPT, is \n     not obligated to open its facilities for inspection and can \n     exclude any sites it chooses from IAEA inspection. By early \n     2000, 46 countries had signed the Additional Protocol. The \n     U.S. version of the Protocol will be submitted to the Senate \n     for its consent to ratification before taking effect in the \n     United States.\n\n\nnew inspection missions: excess weapons materials and fissile material \n                             cutoff treaty\n\n       In addition to the growing number of civil nuclear \n     facilities and growing stockpiles of materials under IAEA \n     safeguards, the IAEA is being assigned new missions to \n     support arms control agreements.\n       Excess Weapon Materials: The Trilateral Initiative. The \n     United States and Russia each have many tons of excess \n     nuclear weapons materials--highly enriched uranium and \n     plutonium. The stockpiles of excess materials are growing as \n     more nuclear weapons are dismantled under the terms of arms \n     control agreements. The United States and Russia each \n     declared hundreds of tons of weapons materials as excess and \n     asked the IAEA to verify that this material is not reused to \n     make nuclear weapons. The IAEA agreed to work with Russian \n     and U.S. experts to develop a special verification \n     arrangement to allow the Agency to verify the materials \n     without revealing sensitive weapons-related information. \n     The arrangement, called the Trilateral Initiative, is \n     funded by the Departments of Energy and State. The \n     Trilateral Initiative can support arms control agreements \n     such as START II and a proposed START III by providing \n     independent verification that weapons materials are \n     removed from military stockpiles and are not reused for \n     nuclear explosives.\n       Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT). The Clinton \n     Administration proposed negotiating a multilateral treaty to \n     stop further production of highly enriched uranium or \n     plutonium for use in nuclear explosives. Such a treaty would \n     cap the amount of weapons materials, and therefore limit the \n     number of weapons that could be made from existing stocks. \n     The IAEA is widely viewed as the most likely inspection \n     agency for such a treaty. Although an FMCT has broad \n     international support, negotiations are stalled at the \n     Conference on Disarmament, a branch of the United Nations \n     located in Geneva, Switzerland. New funding would be \n     required.\n\n\n                    iaea budget and budget problems\n\n       The IAEA annual budget is about $226 million. The budget is \n     divided among several major programs including safeguards, \n     safety, and technical assistance. Member states' \n     contributions are determined by the United Nations scale of \n     contributions and are combined in the Agency's annual budget. \n     The Agency also receives voluntary contributions from member \n     states targeted to support specific programs or projects.\n       U.S. Contribution. The United States provides about 25% of \n     the IAEA regular budget. In 1999 the U.S. assessed \n     contribution was $49 million. The United States also provided \n     a voluntary contribution of $40 million, mainly to support \n     activities related to the Strengthened Safeguards System. The \n     United States also provided less than $1 million from the \n     Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund to upgrade IAEA \n     inspection equipment. U.S. contributions to the IAEA are \n     funded through the State Department's 050 account.\n       Stretching the Resources. While the members of the IAEA are \n     tasking it with additional responsibilities, many resist \n     providing additional funds to pay for Strengthened \n     Safeguards, expanding inspections, improving nuclear safety, \n     and for new arms control missions such as the Trilateral \n     Initiative. The U.S. practice of paying its dues at the end \n     of the U.S. fiscal year (instead of by calendar year, as \n     requested by the IAEA) puts further strain on the Agency. \n     With stocks of nuclear material growing in many countries, \n     some of which pose proliferation concerns, at some point the \n     IAEA's resources may be stretched so far that the Agency can \n     not fulfill all of its functions. Declining credibility of \n     IAEA safeguards could weaken their deterrent and detection \n     functions and possibly undermine nuclear nonproliferation \n     efforts.\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\n                              legislation\n\n       Congress has consistently supported the IAEA and has \n     authorized and appropriated funds for the Agency since its \n     inception in 1956. In recent years Congress has continued \n     support for strengthening the safeguards system and through \n     voluntary contributions. However, legislation has also been \n     proposed to withhold portions of the voluntary U.S. \n     contribution to the IAEA to signal displeasure with IAEA \n     programs that benefit particular member states such as Iran \n     and Cuba.\n\n\n                         for additional reading\n\n       IAEA documents are available on their web site: http://\nwww.iaea.org/worldatom.\n       International Atomic Energy Agency, ``Safeguards and \n     Nonproliferation,'' IAEA Bulletin, volume 41, number 4, 1999.\n       Zachary Davis, International Atomic Energy Agency: \n     Strengthen Verification Authority?

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on some important \nevents that took place here in Washington last week while many of us \nwere back home meeting with our constituents.\n  For the past 25 years, we've had an annual Spring ritual in \nWashington. I'm not referring to the cherry blossoms. Every April, the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank hold their joint \nmeeting. Bankers and finance ministers from around the world travel to \nWashington to talk about the global economy, exchange rates, poverty \nreduction, and the so-called ``international financial architecture.''\n  These are tremendously important subjects. But the talks are highly \ntechnical, and the results are shrouded in the vague language of \ndiplomatic communiques. The meetings don't produce startling \nbreakthroughs. For most people they are hard to understand. So the \nannual IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington have rarely generated much \nnews, and the participants liked it that way.\n  This year was different. A coalition of activists vowed to descend on \nWashington to disrupt the meetings. More than 1,700 journalists \nregistered to cover the event. Few of those journalists came to report \non IMF discussions of extended funds facilities or economic \nstabilization criteria. They were hoping for the kind of news that \nprotesters made at last year's WTO meetings in Seattle when they closed \nthe city down.\n  But those who came to Washington hoping for Seattle-style violence \nwere disappointed. Both the police and the demonstrators are to be \ncommended for that. Those who came here hoping to throw the meetings \noff track were also disappointed. Unlike the WTO ministerial in \nSeattle, the IMF meetings did not attract a big crowd of protestors. \nThe labor unions stayed home. The big environmental groups were absent. \nSo the meeting took place pretty much as scheduled, albeit with some \ninconvenience and no dramatic events. Business as usual.\n  There was one underlying theme among those who did come: a feeling \nthat international economic institutions undermine the interests of \nordinary citizens. I heard that on the streets of Seattle last \nDecember, when protestors took aim at the world's main trade body. And \nI heard it again last week when they focused on the IMF and the World \nBank. The demonstrators had no confidence that those institutions are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  This lack of confidence concerns me greatly. It exists not only here \nat home, but also in many other countries. I believe that America must \nlead an effort to restore faith in the economic institutions we have \nworked so hard to build over the past fifty years, economic \ninstitutions that have served our country and our people. The World \nTrade Organization. The IMF. The World Bank. And we in the Congress \nshould lead that effort.\n  Look at the evidence here at home. In the trade arena, I've seen a \nrapid decline in the domestic consensus in favor of open markets. One \nresult is that we've been unable to renew the President's fast track \ntrade negotiating authority. Morever, the lack of a domestic consensus \nhas undermined our ability to lead in the WTO. It has weakened our \nbargaining power. Other members, especially the EU and Japan, take \nadvantage of our weakened position and resist opening up their markets \nto the production of American workers and farmers.\n  In the financial arena, last week's demonstrations showed that \nAmericans are losing faith. They don't think that the IMF and the World \nBank serve the needs of the people, especially the most vulnerable here \nand in other countries. Instead, they believe that the institutions \nserve the needs of the big and the rich. The IMF and the World Bank \nstand accused of mismanaging the Asian financial crisis through \nmisguided policies which needlessly lowered the living standards of \nmillions of people, throwing many of them back into poverty. They stand \naccused of mismanaging the Russian economy.\n  Are these criticisms justified? It's difficult for Americans to \njudge. These institutions do not operate in the daylight of public \nscrutiny. Although they exist on taxpayer funds, they do not hold \nthemselves accountable to taxpayer concerns. America is the biggest \nshareholder in both the IMF and the World Bank. And the lack of \ntransparency has seriously undermined American public confidence in \nboth the IMF and the World Bank.\n  Over the past week I've read and heard a number of condescending \nremarks about the protestors. They've been called naive, poorly \ninformed, misguided. But the concerns they express are real and are \nshared by many Americans who did not march down Pennsylvania Avenue. We \nneed to take these concerns seriously, because they express a strong \nundercurrent in American thinking.\n  In my talks with representatives from the business, environmental and \nlabor communities, I find that strong centrist elements seek practical \nsolutions. We in the Congress can supply the political leadership to \nfirm up this middle ground on the issues of trade and finance, trade \nand labor, trade and the environment, and restore confidence in the \ninternational trade and financial system. It is an important \nundertaking.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Senate \nResolution 287, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding U.S. \npolicy toward Libya. It is of grave concern to me that the United \nStates is currently considering a change in its ``Travel Ban'' policy \nwith Libya, prior to the resolution of the Pan-Am 103 Bombing trial.\n  Libya is a state sponsor of terrorism and a global agent of \ninstability. Two Libyan intelligence operatives, with prior terrorist \nactivity convictions, are now on trial for the explosion of Pan Am \nflight 103 in 1988 and the loss of 270 lives, 180 of them Americans. \nLibya is engaged in one the most advanced Bio-Chemical efforts in the \nthird world, including the acquisition of delivery vehicles. It has \nrepeatedly engaged U.S. military forces, including an attempted missile \nattack on U.S. military installations in Italy in 1986.\n  Taking into account its past behavior, we all agree that Libya has a \nlong way to go to become a member of the family of law-abiding nations. \nLibya must take concrete actions to provide its sincerity. It must show \ncomplete adherence to the Pan Am 103 Judicial Authorities in Hague. If \na conviction is reached, Libya must accept responsibility for any court \njudgement and make full payment to all judgement creditors. It is my \nsense that Libya must prove its vigilant and sincere cooperation in \nanti-terrorism efforts.\n  U.S. policy towards Libya must remain balanced. The ``Travel Ban'' is \nan important tool and should not be abandoned without clear \njustification. A verdict is not yet at hand; I urge you to await the \nconclusion of the Pan Am 103 trial, and calculate our steps from there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2856-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2856-S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FLAG DESECRATION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to this amendment. As \na graduate of the United States Military Academy and a former officer \nin the Army, I view the American flag with a special reverence borne by \nexperience. I am deeply offended when people burn or otherwise abuse \nthis precious national symbol, and I believe that we should teach young \npeople to respect the flag.\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\n  I also feel, however, that the values and beliefs that the American \nflag represents are more important than the cloth from which the symbol \nis made. Prominent among these beliefs are the right to voice views \nthat are unpopular and the right to protest. It is these fundamental \nvalues, reflected in our Constitution, that have distinguished our \nNation for more than 200 years. It is these beliefs that give our flag \nits great symbolic power.\n  Flag burning is despicable. However, the issue before us is whether \nour great charter document, the Constitution, should be amended so that \nthe Federal Government can prosecute the handful of Americans who show \ncontempt for the flag. To quote James Madison, is this a ``great and \nextraordinary occasion'' justifying the use of a constitutional \namendment?\n  I would argue no, this is not such an occasion. This is an answer in \nsearch of a problem. According to Professor Robert Justin Goldstein, a \nnoted author on this topic, there have been only 200 reported incidents \nof flag burning during the entire history of our country--that is less \nthan one a year. There is no epidemic of flag burnings plaguing our \nnation.\n  Others have said that flag burning is representative of a general \ndecay of American values and patriotism, and something needs to be done \nabout it before it is too late. I would argue the way to encourage \npatriotism is through encouraging civic involvement, not constitutional \namendments. It almost goes without saying that people who are proud of \ntheir country will be proud of their flag.\n  I am still moved by the statement made by James Warner, a decorated \nMarine flyer who was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese from 1967 to \n1973, about flag burning:\n\n       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph \n     of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     ``There'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No,'' I said, ``that proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.''\n\n  And I think that is the essence of this debate for me. We live in a \ndemocracy, not a dictatorship. The flag symbolizes a political system \nthat allows its people, through their actions and words, to express \nwhat they think and feel, even when the government or a vast majority \nof others disagree with them. I oppose this amendment because I believe \nthat while attempting to preserve the symbol of the freedoms we enjoy \nin this country, it actually would harm the substance of these \nfreedoms.\n  Finally, this amendment to the Constitution is technically \nproblematic. The language of the amendment is vague and fails to offer \na clear statement of just what conduct the supporters of the amendment \npropose to prohibit, or to advise the American people of the actions \nfor which they may be imprisoned. There is no definition of what a \n``flag'' is for purposes of this amendment, or any consensus regarding \nthe meaning of ``desecration.'' This leaves the Supreme Court to \nclarify these meanings, the same court that supporters believe erred in \nprotecting flag burning as freedom of speech in the first place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2857-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I applaud Tufts University for \nfurthering the values of leadership, citizenship, and public service, \nby founding a University College of Citizenship and Public Service. By \ncreating this new college, Tufts' President, Dr. John DiBiaggio, is \nfostering an attitude of ``giving back'' to supplement the University's \nvision that `active citizen participation' is essential to freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  Tufts has a history of commitment to civic education, having founded \nthe Lincoln Filene Center for Citizenship and Public Affairs over 50 \nyears ago. The largest student organization on the Medford campus is \nthe Leonard Carmichael Society, a community service group, which boasts \nabout 1,000 members. Recently, Tufts has hatched the ``United Leaders \nfor a Better Tomorrow,'' a new student organization that aims to \nencourage young people to pursue careers in public service. With \nchapters starting across the country, this group of young leaders seeks \nto re-enlist those Americans interested in public service in using \npublic office as a vehicle for change.\n  Tufts University is now renewing its commitment to public service \nwith an entrepreneurial spirit. Tufts is not adding a stand-alone \ncollege, composed of its own buildings and faculty. Instead, the \nuniversity is creating a `virtual college,' one ``without walls;'' \nchallenging itself to infuse all classroom instruction with the ideas \nof citizenship and public service.\n  According to Tufts' President Dr. John DiBiaggio, the tangible impact \nwill mean that a major in child development who is mentoring \nkindergarten kids in a poor community could also participate in \nlegislative advocacy to improve conditions in that community or, a \nTufts student who wants to be a chemist will have an opportunity to \nmeasure pollution in nearby waterways, determine the sources of this \npollution and then create a local team to clean them up.\n  The need for a college of public service has never been greater. \nWhile Tufts students, Massachusetts residents, and citizens nationwide \nare volunteering at record rates, voter participation rates continue to \nfall. Just two stops away on the T's red line, the ``Vanishing Voter \nProject'' at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government measures \nthe depth of the public's cynicism and apathy towards public service. \nLast week, according to the Vanishing Voter Project's Voter Involvement \nIndex, only 19% of the American public paid any attention to the \nPresidential race. In fact, at no time during the Presidential \nPrimaries--one of the most hotly contested races in years--did the \nnumber of Americans paying attention to the race rise above 46%. In the \nworld's leading democracy, in an age where limitless information is \navailable at our fingertips, we can do better.\n  More than ever, it is critical that we restore and maintain civil \nsociety. We need voters that are educated and engaged. Tapping the \ncutting edge of the New Economy's budding e-commerce, Tufts is \npartnering with eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar. eBay, is now the world's \nleading person-to-person online trading community. Omidyar's ten \nmillion dollar investment in the College of Public Service includes \nfinancial aid packages for 24 undergraduates every year, enhanced \npublic and private sector internship opportunities, citizenship-based \ncareer workshops, and a senior honors program in civic activism. Mr. \nPresident, Tufts University's College of Citizenship and Public Service \nand its partnership with eBay's Pierre Omidyar illustrates the \npossibilities provided by technological innovation. The promise of a \ntechnology based digital democracy is that billions of people will \nengage in business, receive their news, and even vote, directly and\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\ninstantly. Our challenge for this new age is to continue to foster \nvalues of public service, community, and citizenship, in order to \nconstantly renew and re-engage our citizenry and our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2858-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2858-S2859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RETIREMENT OF THE CHANCELLOR OF VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, JOE B. WYATT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on April 29 the Vanderbilt \nUniversity community will honor Joe B. Wyatt, who will retire this \nsummer after a long and distinguished career as Chancellor of that \nprestigious university. I rise today to pay tribute to Chancellor \nWyatt. His significant contributions have not only benefitted the \nNashville campus, but also have had a very positive impact on the State \nof Tennessee and, indeed, our entire nation.\n  Joe Wyatt's tenure as head of Vanderbilt, which extends back to 1982, \nhas been marked by substantial growth at the University: new \nconstruction and renovation on campus; tremendous expansion of the \nrenowned Medical Center; major increases in the levels of research \ngrants; and a quantum leap in the university's endowment.\n  Today, Vanderbilt University and Medical Center is the largest \nprivate employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the \nstate. It generates an estimated annual economic impact of more that \n$2.2 billion to the area. Among the 19,000 Vanderbilt alumni who live \nin Middle Tennessee are numerous leaders in business, government, law, \neducation and medicine. And many of these young men and women were \nhanded their diplomas by Joe Wyatt before moving on to make a mark in \ntheir chosen fields.\n  Equally important, Mr. Wyatt's stewardship has been marked by the \nacademic and intellectual growth of the University. He has helped \nattract a world-class faculty that is consistently recognized \nnationally and internationally for its research and teaching \nexcellence. In addition, he recognized, earlier than most, the \npotential impact of new technology on our society and education, and he \nfacilitated the development of research programs that cut across \nvarious academic disciplines, reflecting changes in the real world and \nmaximizing the University's academic resources.\n  Personally, in making my own decision of whether to come to \nVanderbilt to join the staff at Vanderbilt University Medical Center as \nAssistant Professor in cardiothoracic surgery, it was Joe Wyatt's \nsupport of a vision of establishing a multi-organ, multi-disciplinary \ntransplant center at Vanderbilt that encouraged me to come back to \nNashville. His commitment to seeing that vision become a reality led to \nthe establishment of the Vanderbilt Transplant Center which since that \ntime has served thousands of patients throughout the Southeast.\n  During Joe Wyatt's 18 years of service at Vanderbilt, the university \nhas evolved steadily from a highly regarded regional institution to a \ntruly national institution, widely known for its excellence in a wide \narray of undergraduate and graduate fields. Today, it is among the top \nranks of research universities in the United States, with a student \nbody that represents all 50 states and more than 90 foreign countries.\n  Chancellor Wyatt is widely regarded today as a senior statesman of \nthe research university community. His deep commitment to higher \neducation issues is exemplified by his participation in, and leadership \nof, many national advisory groups and policymaking organizations. For \nexample, he has served the last two years as chairman of the \nGovernment-University-Industry Research Roundtable of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. He also is the current chairman of the \nUniversities Research Association and chairs a blue ribbon panel on \nquality standards for the non-profit organization, New American \nSchools. In addition, he serves on the Business Higher Education Forum, \nthe Council on Competitiveness and the Advisory Committee of the Public \nAgenda Foundation.\n  Mr. President, Joe B. Wyatt has made contributions in many areas, but \nI think his greatest legacies will be in the following three areas:\n  First, he has fostered greater communication and cooperation among \nthe three sectors most involved in our nation's unique research \nenterprise--universities, the federal government and industry.\n  Chancellor Wyatt is the Chairman of a group at NSF devoted to \nbringing government, universities and businesses together in a \ncollaborative effort to improve our nation's research effort.\n  Second, he has promoted increased awareness of the great \nresponsibility of our schools of education to ``teach the teachers'' \nwho prepare America's youth for the challenges of tomorrow.\n  Chancellor Wyatt supported a controversial provision in the Higher \nEducation Act of 1998 to hold colleges of education accountable for \ntheir students' performance as teachers. This provision, and Chancellor \nWyatt's deep commitment to improving our nation's colleges of \neducation, will have a lasting impact not just on higher education, but \non our entire elementary and secondary school system.\n  Third, he has generated, through personal example, renewed commitment \nto volunteer community service by all members of the university \ncommunity.\n  Today, Vanderbilt undergraduates are engaged in volunteer programs in \nunprecedented numbers. It was no accident that, when they recently came \nto say farewell to Vanderbilt alumni in the Washington, DC, area, Joe \nand Faye Wyatt spent the day at an inner-city elementary school, \nworking alongside 75 alumni in a reading and storytelling program with \nlocal third-graders.\n  I include for the Record an article from the Vanderbilt Register On-\nLine. The article further details Joe B. Wyatt's many accomplishments \nover a span of nearly two decades as Chancellor of the University. \nThroughout this period, he has maintained a sharp focus on two things \nthat really matter . . . two things that are enduring in our society: \nquality education of our nation's youth and service to the broader \ncommunity. And he has done so with honor, decency and credibility.\n  We wish Joe and Faye Wyatt the very best, and give them heartfelt \nthanks for their service to Vanderbilt University.\n  The article follows:\n\n       Joe B. Wyatt, Vanderbilt University Chancellor, 1982-2000\n\n       When Alexander Heard retired in 1982, the board named Joe \n     B. Wyatt to succeed him. As Chancellor, Wyatt sought to place \n     Vanderbilt in the very top tier of American universities.\n       Wyatt, a Texan, holds degrees in mathematics from Texas \n     Christian University and the University of Texas. He was vice \n     president for administration at Harvard University--and \n     father of a Vanderbilt sophomore--when he was selected as \n     Vanderbilt's sixth Chancellor. As a computer scientist and \n     executive, he brought to the University his concept that \n     information technology is a strategic resource of \n     accelerating global importance in education, research and \n     patient care.\n       In addition to his influence in technology, Wyatt pushed \n     the University community to unprecedented levels of \n     involvement in volunteer community service. Alternative \n     Spring Break was founded in 1987 by a handful of students \n     with Wyatt's support. In spring 1999, more than 300 \n     undergraduates participated in the program's 22 domestic and \n     three international sites. With funding from the Chancellor's \n     discretionary fund, the non-profit Break Away: The \n     Alternative Break Connection was founded in 1991 by \n     Vanderbilt graduates to help colleges across the country \n     start alternative spring breaks. Today, half of all \n     Vanderbilt undergraduates are engaged in volunteer programs, \n     and the number of service organizations has exploded.\n       The term ``national university'' has taken on an expanded \n     meaning under Wyatt. He has led a national effort to improve \n     elementary and secondary education in the nation's public and \n     private schools, and at home he has made the Vanderbilt \n     student body the most diverse in history. Students hail from \n     all 50 states and 91 foreign countries. Minority enrollment \n     in Vanderbilt's four undergraduate schools has nearly tripled \n     in the past 10 years. In the fall of 1999, minority students \n     accounted for almost 20 percent of the undergraduate \n     population, as compared to slightly less than 7 percent in \n     1987, while the overall enrollment has remained fairly \n     constant. Over the same period, the number of minority \n     students in the graduate and professional schools continued \n     to increase.\n       In 1989, for the first time, Vanderbilt's undergraduate \n     programs were ranked among the top 25 national universities \n     overall in the U.S. News & World Report survey, placing 24th. \n     Vanderbilt continues to be ranked in the top 25, placing 20th \n     in 1999. In U.S. News' 1999 graduate school rankings, Peabody \n     College was ranked sixth among schools of education; the Owen \n     Graduate School of Management was ranked 25th among business \n     schools; the law school was ranked 16th; and the School of \n     Medicine was ranked 16th.\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\n       During Wyatt's term as Chancellor, the Medical Center \n     expanded most dramatically, now accounting for more than 70 \n     percent of the University's income and expenses and employing \n     almost half of the full-time faculty, more than half of the \n     part-time faculty, and the majority of staff.\n       Since 1982, Vanderbilt has acquired or built one-third of \n     the campus--more than four million square feet of mostly new \n     construction. This does not include the one million \n     additional square feet of renovations to existing facilities, \n     and major projects on the drawing board.\n       Wyatt spent much of the early '90s working with trustees \n     and staff in The Campaign for Vanderbilt, the most ambitious \n     fund-raising effort in the institution's history. This latest \n     campaign, which ended in 1995, raised $560 million. Now, \n     because of the work of Wyatt and others, Vanderbilt has an \n     endowment of $1.8 billion. Its operating budget has grown to \n     $1.3 billion. Sponsored research has more than quadrupled \n     since 1981, from $42 million to $214 million, placing \n     Vanderbilt 33rd among U.S. colleges and universities in \n     federal research and development funding, according to the \n     National Science Foundation.\n       One of Wyatt's most significant accomplishments as \n     Chancellor has been the improvement in the quality of \n     Vanderbilt's faculty. The criteria for faculty appointment, \n     promotion and tenure have been strengthened twice during his \n     administration, making it clear that excellence in \n     scholarship, teaching and service are required for all \n     members of the faculty. The number of endowed faculty chairs \n     has increased from 39 in 1982 to more than 100 today, and \n     faculty salaries have continuously increased as well.\n       On April 23, 1999, Wyatt announced that he would retire as \n     Chancellor in July 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2859-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO INNOVATORS IN FIVE VERMONT HIGH SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to \neducators in five Vermont high schools whose collaborative work in \nschool improvement will help high school teachers and administrators \nacross the country understand how to support high school reform. The \nhigh schools and their educators include: Montpelier High School--Owen \nBradley, David Gibson, and Charlie Phillips; Otter Valley High School \nin Brandon--Nancy Cornell, Ellie Davine, and Bill Petrics; South \nBurlington High School--Tim Comoli, Sheila Mable, and Janet Bossange; \nEssex High School--Kevin Martell, Sue Pasco, and Brian Nelligan; and \nMount Abraham High School in Bristol--Tom Tailer, John Vibber, David \nRoyce and Mary Sullivan.\n  These people are outstanding educators who understand how to build \npartnerships between the community and school that enrich the \nexperience of their students. All five of these high schools have \nProfessional Development School partnerships with the University of \nVermont, collaborating to prepare new teachers and support veteran \nteachers on behalf of school renewal. Each of them has learned to use \nlocal resources to bring high school students into meaningful contact \nwith adults in the surrounding community, making learning a part of \nlife. All five schools are discovering how to link local innovations \nwith the national effort to help all high school students meet high \nstandards of performance. The Northeast and Islands Regional \nEducational Laboratory at Brown University (LAB), a program of The \nEducation Alliance at Brown University, with the support of the U.S. \nDepartment of Education will publish and disseminate a description of \ntheir work and the results of the work in The Dynamics of Change in \nHigh School Teaching: Instructional Innovation in Five Vermont \nProfessional Development Schools, which will be released this summer. \n(Clarke, et al, 2000)\n  The Montpelier Story, a publication excerpted from the book and \navailable now through the LAB, is the story of the success of dedicated \neducators in collaboration with community partners and other resources \nin providing new, student-centered learning opportunities to the young \npeople they serve.\n  At Montpelier High School, Owen Bradley, David Gibson, Charlie \nPhillips and the entire faculty have redesigned the curriculum to \nsupport Personal Learning Plans for each student in the school. \nMontpelier students use their Personal Learning Plans to select courses \nand to develop community-based learning projects that help them meet \ngraduation requirements and carry them toward their individual goals in \nways that fit their unique talents and aspirations. The work at \nMontpelier has already inspired schools across Vermont and spilled over \nthe borders to Maine and beyond, where it serves as a model for \nredevelopment of curricula and advising to increase contact between \nstudents and adults.\n  Under the leadership of Nancy Cornell, Ellie Davine and Bill Petrics \nformed a team at Otter Valley High School with the purpose of designing \na standards-based course for students in the school who needed to \nunderstand how geography and local decision making affect land use in \nVermont. By giving each student a topographic map of 100 acres in the \nState and leading them through the process of land-use assessment and \nplanning required by Vermont's environmental laws, they illustrated the \napplication of knowledge and skills in local community development \nefforts.\n  Over a period of 15 years at South Burlington High School, Tim Comoli \nand Sheila Mable, both of the English Department, developed a state-of-\nthe-art media lab that engages students in designing multi-media \npresentations of professional quality for public service organizations \nin their community. Development of the media lab provoked a complete \nrevision of the district's technology education plan, creating a model \ntechnology program for the State.\n  At Essex High School, Kevin Martell, Sue Pasco and Brian Nelligan \nhave worked for more than a decade to design and refine an integrated \ncourse in history and English that engages students in examining the \nevolution of human culture from 10,000 BC to the present. By fitting \ncourse assignment to the individual learning styles of the students who \nfill their classrooms, they have been able to create a challenging \ncourse in which high school students teach each other, and learn to \nexpress their views in a wide variety of media.\n  Tom Tailer, John Vibber and a host of partners at Mount Abraham Union \nHigh School developed a physics unit on Newton's Laws that they \nexpanded over a decade into a simulation of armed, global aggression. \nHaving made ``weapons'' that launch tennis balls over great distances, \nMt.

Mr. President, Governor Don Sundquist of the \nState of Tennessee has proclaimed April 16-22, 2000, as ``National \nAssociation of Retired Federal Employees Week'' in order to focus \nattention on the many accomplishments of Tennessee's retired Federal \nemployees. In recognition of the important public service performed by \nFederal retirees, I ask my colleagues to join Governor Sundquist and me \nin acknowledging the contributions retired Federal employees have made \nto this Nation and their continued dedication to our communities.\n  Beginning in 1882, a non-partisan civil service system was \nestablished granting Federal employees the protections of a merit \nsystem, eliminating the spoils system and basing Federal employment \ndecisions on merit rather than political connection. It is in this \nspirit that Federal employees, over the course of almost 120 years, \nhave served the public interest. Their professional lives have been \ndedicated to performing and carrying out the responsibilities of the \nFederal Government.\n  In an effort to improve the civil service, and in recognition of \ncivil servants' efforts on behalf of the Federal Government, Congress \nenacted in 1920 the first comprehensive employer-sponsored retirement \nplan - the Civil Service Retirement System. This system has served the \ncountry well since then and its successor, the Federal Employee \nRetirement System, serves as a\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nbenchmark in evaluating pension and retirement plans.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I can \nattest to the effectiveness of NARFE members in making the case for \nequitable retirement and health benefits for the more than two million \nfederal retirees and their survivors.\n  My State of Tennessee is home to more than 37,000 Federal retirees. \nThese folks, like all federal retirees, served their country through \ntheir commitment to public service. Federal retirees deserve our \nNation's thanks for the dedication they have shown. I hope all my \ncolleagues will join me today saluting Federal retirees for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2860-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE GREATER DETROIT BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL RECEIVES \n         2000 GENDER AND RACE DIVERSIFICATION EXCELLENCE AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on May 2, 2000, the Great Lakes \nConstruction Alliance will hold its annual Gender and Race \nDiversification Excellence Awards dinner. Each year, the G.A.R.D.E. \nAwards are given to labor owners and contractor organizations which \nhave made significant efforts in improving the recruitment and \nretention of women and people of color in the unionized construction \nindustry. Each award winner has developed, or engaged in, some \nsubstantial program with the goal of furthering opportunities for women \nand people of color, which is one of the fundamental principles upon \nwhich the Great Lakes Construction Alliance was founded.\n  Nominees are judged by a jury of construction industry \nrepresentatives. To be considered for the G.A.R.D.E.

Ultimately, the \nawards are given to those programs which have made significant efforts \nto improve the recruitment and retention of women and people of color \nin the unionized construction industry. The recipients of the 2000 \nG.A.R.D.E. Awards are the Human Rights Department of the City of \nDetroit, the Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, \nand the Comerica Park Construction Management Team.\n  The Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, with \nBarton-Malow acting as program manager, formed twenty construction \nmanagement teams, which together coordinated over 750,000 hours of \nservice during the Detroit Public Schools Summer Emergency Maintenance \nProgram. 130 minority students, thirty-seven percent of whom were \nfemale, participated in the Summer Emergency Maintenance Program. The \ntwenty construction management teams provided these students with the \nopportunity to work directly with prime contractors in a multitude of \ncapacities, including administrative activities, painting, electrical, \nmechanical, and plumbing. Students were also assigned a mentor who \nhelped them develop objectives and document their work experiences. The \nconstruction management teams also prepared outcome reports, which \nprovided guidance for educators to continue support of the students' \ninterests once the school year began.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the Greater Detroit Building and \nConstruction Trades Council, and the members of the twenty construction \nmanagement teams, for their willingness to help these students. \nUndoubtedly, their efforts had a profound impact on the lives of each \nand every one of them. Furthermore, this is the type of work that must \nbe done if the revitalization of Detroit is truly to come about. On \nbehalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Greater \nDetroit Building and Construction Trades Council on receiving the 200 \nGender and Race Diversification Excellence Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2860-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE BATTLE CREEK ENQUIRER HONORS MS.

These awards are given annually to \nindividuals who ``Don't wait around for George to do it.'' Recipients \nare recognized for their leadership, and they are usually individuals \nwho have spearheaded projects. Ms. Trumbull is being honored because \nshe is the volunteer founder and president of Amber Alert of Michigan, \na nonprofit organization in Battle Creek which works to create an \neffective communication system between local police and radio stations \nto immediately alert community members in the event of a child \nabduction.\n  The first few hours after an abduction has occurred are the most \ncrucial in recovering the child, and the implementation of this \neffective emergency broadcast plan has the potential to save the lives \nof many children. The organization, which started in the Dallas/Fort \nWorth area in the memory of Amber Hagerman, has since spread throughout \nthe country. It has done so because of the incredible efforts of \nindividuals like Robin Trumbull.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Ms. Trumbull on this \nworthwhile cause, and I think I can safely say that all residents of \nMichigan owe her a debt of gratitude for the work she has done to save \nchildren from being abducted, and to help recover those who have been \nabducted as quickly as possible. Because of her efforts, and her \ndedication to the children of Michigan, the Amber Alert program has \nbeen kicked off successfully.\n  I applaud Ms. Trumbull for bringing this wonderful program to the \nState of Michigan. I also applaud the Battle Creek Enquirer for \nacknowledging her tireless efforts to do so. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Robin Trumbull on receiving \nher George Award.

The recipients of the 2000 \nG.A.R.D.E. Awards are the Human Rights Department of the City of \nDetroit, the Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, \nand the Comerica Park Construction Management Team.\n  Comercia Park is the new home of the Detroit Tigers. It is a \nbreathtaking, state-of-the-art facility. In my somewhat biased opinion, \nit is not only the newest, but also the nicest, stadium in the Major \nLeagues. Its construction would not have been possible were it not for \nthe efforts of the many people who helped to build it. The construction \nof Comerica Park was a conglomerate effort, which was led by the \nConstruction Management Team of Hunt, Turner, and White, Tigers General \nManager John McHale, Jr., and aided by many Detroit City organizations: \nthe Downtown Development Authority, the Minority Business Development \nCouncil, the African American Association of Business Contractors, and \nthe Majority Business Initiative.\n  The Comerica Park project, with the cooperation of the aforementioned \nindividuals and organizations, and also Detroit residents, targeted \nspecific\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\ngroups for participation in its completion. The program resulted in the \nparticipation of 25 percent minority businesses, five percent women-\nowned businesses, 34 percent Detroit-based businesses, and 25 percent \nsmall businesses. Workforce utilization resulted in minorities \ncomprising 38.15 percent of employees constructing the stadium. Women \ncomprised 4.28 percent, and another 30.53 percent were residents of \nDetroit.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the diverse group of people who were \nresponsible for the building of Comerica Park. The stadium stands as a \nsymbol of the hope that I think many Detroit residents now feel for \ntheir city. More importantly, all Michigan residents can take pride not \nonly in the final product, but in the production itself. On behalf of \nthe entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Comerica Park \nConstruction Management Team on receiving a Gender and Race \nDiversification Excellence Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2861-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE WAVERLY WARRIORS WIN THE MICHIGAN HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION \n                  CLASS A BOYS BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nmembers of the Waverly Warriors Boys Basketball Team, who defeated \nDetroit Pershing 75-63 to win the Michigan High School Athletic \nAssociation Class A State Championship. This victory brought Waverly \nHigh School its first ever state title. More importantly, it brought \nthe entire west side of Lansing together, as it was an experience \nenjoyed not only by the players on the team, or even the students of \nthe school, but by the entire community.\n  Coach Phil Odlum's team went 25-2 on its way to capturing the state \ntitle. The Warriors were led by seniors Marcus Taylor and Cortney \nScott, who will attend, respectively, Michigan State University and the \nUniversity of Iowa on basketball scholarships in the fall. Seniors \nTerry Reddick, Melvin White, and Chris Miller rounded out the starting \nfive. These five players were backed by an extremely solid bench, both \nin the remaining players on the team and in the community support they \nreceived.\n  In the hierarchy of athletic competition, Mr. President, high school \nathletics represent the last time a community is able to look out onto \nthe playing field, or, in this case, court, and say, ``These are our \nkids.'' There is an attachment there, and also, I think, a certain \nlevel of pride, that cannot be found at higher levels of play. A \ncommunity can embrace a team as its own because that is what it truly \nis. And the west side of Lansing did embrace these kids. Clad in bright \nyellow t-shirts, a large band of Waverly supporters staked a claim on \nthe northernmost side of the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan, \nand cheered on their Warriors.\n  This community spirit and support played a large role, perhaps not in \nthe on the court success of the team, but definitely in the overall \nenjoyment of their accomplishment. I am sure that the championship was \nmade all the more special for the players when their victory lap was \nhalted by a sea of yellow shirts. And for all the students and \ncommunity members who occupied those yellow shirts, I am sure it was \njust as wonderful an experience seeing kids that they grew up with, or \nwatched grow up, successfully complete their run for the title. And \nthis, Mr. President, is the aspect of high school athletics that is \ntruly irreplaceable.\n  Mr. President, I applaud both Lansing Waverly and Detroit Pershing on \nthe completion of very successful seasons. And, on behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate the Waverly Warriors on winning \nthe 2000 M.H.S.A.A. Class A Boys Basketball Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2861-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LATIN AMERICANS FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, INC., ANNUAL \n                          RECOGNITION LUNCHEON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

On May 2, 2000, LA SED will \nhold its annual Recognition Luncheon, an event which provides the \norganization the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of outstanding \nHispanic citizens of the Detroit community.\n  It is appropriate that the theme of this year's luncheon is, ``21st \nCentury: Hispanics Count in Detroit's Future.'' Since its founding in \n1969, LA SED has been instrumental in ensuring that Hispanic citizens \nplay a large role in the Detroit community. And now, Mr. President, \nthere is finally an excitement about the future of the city of Detroit \nthat has not been evident for quite some time. There is a real feeling \nthat the city's future is going to look brighter than the past. And \ngroups like LA SED, who outwardly display their own optimism for the \nfuture of Detroit, and for the integral role that Hispanics can play, \nand have played, in this picture of success, are a large reason for the \nexcitement.\n  Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, it has \nbeen my pleasure to hold hearings on the positive contributions \nimmigrants make to this country in areas such as science, the arts, and \nthe armed forces. It was my pleasure to sponsor legislation awarding \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon, a Mexican immigrant \nwho heroically saved the lives of men in his platoon during the Vietnam \nWar. And though I have my critics, their unfounded attacks will have no \nimpact on my defense of America's tradition as a nation of immigrants. \nOrganizations like LA SED illustrate to me everyday that in this \nregard, I am doing the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I extend my warmest regards and appreciation to Jane \nGarcia, chairperson of the luncheon, and also a wonderful friend whom I \nhave had the pleasure of working with over the years. I would also like \nto acknowledge Mr. Anthony F. Early, President and C.E.O. of Detroit \nEdison, who will be the keynote speaker of the Recognition Luncheon. \nFinally, I thank everyone who is involved in making LA SED such a \ntremendous and effective organization. On behalf of the entire United \nStates Senate, I wish LA SED continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2861-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2861-S2862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY OF DETROIT RECEIVES 2000 GENDER \n               AND RACE DIVERSIFICATION EXCELLENCE AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Their solution to this \nproblem was to implement a Construction Workforce Diversity Program, \naltering the monitoring guidelines of Executive Order 22. The new\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nguidelines aim at maximizing the number of Detroit residents, \nminorities, and women in the construction industry while maintaining \nthe quality of the end product. They have achieved success in this \nregard through increased enrollment in pre-apprentice and apprentice \nprograms; through the establishment of partnerships with residents, \nbusiness leaders, trade associations, unions, and ecumenical community \ncity agencies; through the development of an internal information \nnetwork; and through the review and validation of certified payrolls, \nskilled trade reports and subcontractor reports.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the Human Rights Department \nto diversify the City of Detroit's workforce. Their efforts serve as a \nwonderful example to other agencies in Detroit and throughout the State \nof Michigan.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wisconsin relative to the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act and the Federal Poultry Products Inspection \n     Act; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 13\n\n       Whereas, currently, federal law prohibits cattle, sheep, \n     swine, goat, chicken, turkey, duck, goose and guinea fowl \n     products that are inspected under state meat inspection \n     programs from being shipped across state lines, while federal \n     law allows state-inspected ostrich, venison, buffalo and \n     pheasant to be shipped across state lines; and\n       Whereas, foreign meat products may be shipped freely among \n     the states; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin has 300 state-inspected plants, none of \n     which is allowed to market products in interstate commerce \n     due to an outdated federal law; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin and the United States are currently \n     suffering from a hog market crisis, including a closure of \n     packing facilities and a reduction in slaughter activity, due \n     in part to these outdated interstate restrictions; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Federal \n     Poultry Products Inspection Act are restricting the \n     opportunity for these small plants to expand their markets \n     across state lines, provide additional slaughter capacity for \n     pork producers and increase the demand for their products; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, the assembly concurring, That the \n     members of the Wisconsin legislature request Congress to \n     address problems in the meat-processing industry concerning \n     packing, processing and marketing capacities; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Wisconsin legislature \n     request Congress to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and \n     the Federal Poultry Products Inspection Act to allow for \n     interstate shipment of all state-inspected meats; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the senate chief clerk shall provide copies \n     of this joint resolution to the President of the Senate and \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United \n     States and to each of the senators and representatives from \n     Wisconsin.\n\n       POM-456.

A bill to enhance Department of Education efforts to \nfacilitate the involvement of small business owners in State and local \ninitiatives to improve education; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    small business employment and education enhancement act of 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, the Small \nBusiness Employment and Education Act of 2000, which is designed to \nenhance federal efforts to facilitate the involvement of small business \nowners and entrepreneurs in state and local initiatives to improve the \nquality of education programs for our young people.\n  Mr. President, last year, the Small Business Committee, of which I am \na member, held a hearing on the challenges facing the small business \ncommunity as a result of the failure of many of our educational \ninstitutions to teach students the basic skills that are necessary to \nsucceed in today's work environment. The committee heard testimony from \na number of small businesses and organizations about this growing \nproblem.\n  And just how big is the problem? A 1999 American Management \nAssociation survey on workplace testing found that approximately 36 \npercent of employees tested for basic skills were found to be deficient \nin these skills, and small businesses reported deficiency rates well \nabove the national average. Sixty percent of AMA-member companies \nreported that the availability of skilled manpower was scarce, and 67 \npercent believe that the shortages will continue.\n  A 1999 NFIB report found that 18 percent of NFIB members report that \nfinding qualified labor is the single most important problem facing \ntheir business today.\n  Likewise, a 1999 poll of U.S. Chambers of Commerce found that 83 \npercent reported the ability--or lack thereof--to find qualified \nworkers was among their biggest concerns, and 53 percent said education \nis the single most pressing public policy issue to them.\n  This information clearly illustrates that the business community, and \nsmall businesses in particular, have an important stake in the \neducation of our youth. One of the most fundamental needs that any \ngrowing business faces is the need for employees with basic skills, and \nconcerns have been expressed by the small business community that many \nstudents are not graduating with the basic skills in reading, writing, \nmathematics, and science--skills that need to succeed in today's \nworkplace or become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the growth of high-skilled \njobs is outpacing growth in all other fields. We must not allow basic \nskills to slip away if we are to remain competitive in an increasingly \naggressive and technology-based global market.\n  Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and as we \nauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we must take into \naccount the needs of businesses, and small businesses in particular. To \nthat end, locally-driven initiatives are crucial. In order to create \njobs, we must encourage small business expansion and foster small \nbusiness entrepreneurship, and I believe that education initiatives are \nkey to this.\n  Under the Small Business Employment and Education Enhancement Act, \nthe Department of Education would disseminate information and \nfacilitate the sharing of information designed to assist small \nbusinesses in working with school systems to improve our education \ninstitutions. For example, the agency would publish guidance materials, \nbest practices, checklists and other materials on the World Wide Web, \nin Department of Education publications and articles, letters, links to \nrelated World Wide Web sites, public service announcements, and through \nother means at the Department's disposal.\n  The Department of Education would establish a centralized database of \nmaterials and act as a clearinghouse for information on initiatives \nthat have proven successful.\n\n  The Secretary of the Department of Education would also establish an \nOffice of Small Business Education to promote efforts to address the \nneeds of small businesses through education programs. This division \nwould work to remove any existing impediments to partnerships between \nschool systems and small businesses, and propose solutions to \neducation-related problems facing small businesses.\n  The goal of the bill I am introducing today is to facilitate \npartnerships between communities and businesses. I believe it should be \neasy for communities that are interested in designing business/school \npartnerships to get the information they need on how to do so. With \naccess to kinds of sources envisioned in this legislation, communities \nwould be able to model a program after a proven approach.\n  In addition, my bill authorizes technical assistance to be \nadministered by the Office of Small Business Education to be used to \nprovide guidance to small businesses, small business organizations, \nschools systems, and communities working cooperatively to enhance the \nteaching of basic skills.\n  The bill would also establish tax credits to encourage companies to \nprovide work study, internship, or fellowship opportunities for \nstudents and teachers.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision directing the Department of \nEducation to conduct a study and report to Congress on the challenges \nfacing small businesses in obtaining workers with adequate skills; an \nassessment of the impact on small businesses of the skills shortage; \nthe costs to small businesses associated with this shortage; and the \nrecommendations for the Secretary on how to address these challenges.\n  Mr. President, I hope this legislation will provide a foundation for \ncooperative initiatives between small businesses and school systems, \nand I look forward to working with the Senate Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee and others as we prepare to reauthorize the \nelementary and secondary education act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2458. A bill to designate the facility of the Unites States Postal \nService located at 1818 Milton Avenue in Janesville, Wisconsin, as the \n``Les Aspin Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n  legislation naming the janesville post office in memory of les aspin\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrename the United States Post Office in my home town of Janesville, \nWisconsin in honor of Les Aspin. I am joined by my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl. This bill is a companion to legislation \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Paul Ryan, who represents the \nFirst District of Wisconsin, which includes Janesville.\n  This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of Les' first campaign for \nthe First Congressional District seat in Wisconsin. I was a junior at \nJanesville Craig High School at the time, and I signed up as a \nvolunteer on Les' campaign. He won that election after a tough recount \nin the primary, defeating the incumbent Congressman.\n  Following the campaign, I interned in his district office in \nJanesville during the summers of 1971 and in 1972. I am proud to say \nthat during the next 25 years, Les and I had a continuing friendship, \nas he carved out a distinguished career in the United States House of \nRepresentatives, eventually rising to become the Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, while I prepared for and began my own career.\n  Les Aspin served his country ably in many capacities. As an Army \ncaptain, he worked as an analyst in the Pentagon; he served on the \nstaff of President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors; he \nrepresented Wisconsinites for 22 years in Congress; he enthusiastically \ntook on the giant task of steering the Defense Department into the \nuncharted waters of the post-Cold War era. Mr. Aspin served as \nSecretary of Defense under President Clinton and, at the time of his \ndeath in 1995, he was the chair of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, working on needed reforms in our intelligence \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, Les Aspin was a man I deeply respected and admired, \nand I felt a profound sense of loss at his passing. Renaming the \nJanesville post office in his honor is a fitting way to remember a man \nwho spent his life serving the people of Wisconsin and of the\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nUnited States. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2458\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF LES ASPIN POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 1818 Milton Avenue in Janesville, \n     Wisconsin, shall be known and designated as the ``Les Aspin \n     Post Office Building''.\n       (b) Referrences.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Les Aspin Post Office Building''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nWisconsin in introducing this legislation to honor the memory of Les \nAspiin. Long before I entered politics, Les Aspin was a good friend of \nmine. I had the good fortune to serve with Les Aspin in Congress and to \nwork with him when he served as Secretary of Defense. Les Aspin was \ntruly dedicated to public service. He was genuinely challenged by the \npolicy making process, and he was not hesitant in bringing his great \nintellectual gifts to bear on the problems of our time. He was a master \nof the Sunday morning talk shows, expounding on the issues of the day \nwith his trenchant analyses. As chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Les Aspin was one of the most influential voices on U.S. \ndefense policy.\n  His ascension to the chairmanship of the House Armed Services \nCommittee was not without rancor, but even those who disagreed with Les \nrespected his verve and determination.\n  When we lost Les Aspin, we lost a man of great vision. He was one of \nthe few who realized that we needed a completely new way of thinking \nabout national security policy in the post-cold-war era. He had the \ncapacity to think through the difficult issues involved in developing \nsuch a policy. And, he was unrelenting in making us deal with those \nissues.\n  Even though Les Aspin became a powerful national figure, he never \nforgot his roots. Les represented the 1st Congressional District for 22 \nyears and he cared deeply about the people of his district. He was \naggressive in pursuing projects that would benefit the people of \nWisconsin and he left no stone unturned in helping resolve constituent \nproblems. He especially recognized the importance of reliable postal \nservice in small and big towns alike. He was known to become personally \ninvolved in responding to complaints from constituents about postal \nservice, often attending meetings across the district on postal issues. \nLes became intimately involved when the Janesville Postal Office was \nmoved from downtown, working to ensure that service was retained for \nall, especially small businesses and other postal patrons who relied on \nthe downtown post office. Thus, naming the Janesville Post Office after \nLes Aspin is a most fitting tribute to his many years of service to the \npeople of the First Congressional District.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope for its \nspeedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Helms, Mr. Warner, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Burns, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Grams, Mr. Mack, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Gorton, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 2459. A bill to provide for the award of a gold medal on behalf of \nthe Congress to former President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy \nReagan in recognition of their service to the Nation; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  the reagan congressional gold medal\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is with a deep sense of honor that I \nrise today to introduce legislation awarding former President and Mrs. \nRonald Reagan the Congressional Gold Medal. Very few Americans have had \nas profound an impact upon this Nation and the world as this remarkable \ncouple have.\n  In his eight years in office, President Reagan restored American's \nsense of pride and set us squarely on the course of prosperity we still \nenjoy today. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Soviet Empire \nthat brought an end to the Cold War. Who could forget his ringing \nchallenge from Berlin's Bradenburg Gate, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down \nthis Wall!'' By 1989, to the amazement of the world, Germany was \nunified, and the Wall became a memory. Reagan's character, wit, and \neloquence as the ``Great Communicator'' brought honor to the Office of \nthe President and endeared him to us all.\n  As First Lady, Nancy Reagan's contributions were equally significant \nin their own right. She not only bestowed elegance and grace upon the \nWhite House, but she also brought critical leadership to righting the \nscourge of illegal drugs. Tirelessly encouraging our Nation's youth to \n``Just Say No,'' Mrs. Reagan was instrumental in successfully reducing \nthe rate of illegal drug use among our children.\n  The Reagans have continued to inspire us even after their years in \nthe White House. President and Nancy Reagan have confronted his \nAlzheimer's disease with the same dignity and bravery they displayed in \noffice. Their fight inspires hope in millions of Americans who also \nmust struggle with this disease. Our thoughts and best wishes for them \nare constant.\n  The leadership and dedication that President and Mrs. Reagan provided \nthis Nation will undeniably endure throughout the course of human \nevents. It is now time for a grateful people and Nation to say, ``Thank \nyou.'' I am very appreciative of my many colleagues who join me today \nin sponsoring this legislation and invite others to join us in honoring \nPresident and Nancy Reagan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the payment of rewards to individuals \nfurnishing information relating to persons subject to indictment for \nserious violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             expansion of rewards program to include rwanda\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nauthorize payment of rewards to individuals furnishing information \nrelating to persons subject to indictment for serious violations of \ninternational humanitarian law in Rwanda. This bill would add the \nmasterminds of the Rwandan genocide to the list of individuals our \nrewards program is helping to track down, and this legislation will \nsend those individuals a clear message--that there is no impunity for \ngenocide, that the world will not forget, and that they cannot evade \njustice forever.\n  Six years ago today, a headline ran on the front page of the New York \nTimes reading--``Rwandan Refugees Describe Horrors After a Bloody \nTrek.'' The lead-in read as follows:\n\n       Their clothes are blood-soaked, and their wounds are eerily \n     similar. Pursued by fear, the 450 or so men, women and \n     children in the makeshift hospital here made the same journey \n     across the border from Rwanda, nursing the deep gouges made \n     by the machetes that struck their skulls, necks and hands.\n\n  Six years ago today the media was just waking up to the horror \nunfolding in Rwanda, although the killing had been going on for weeks. \nSix years ago today, the reporters filing their stories from Burundi \nand Zaire were still cautious about the word ``genocide.'' They still \nreferred to ``ancient tribal hatreds'' as the source of the \nincomprehensible violence engulfing the tiny central African country. \nSix years ago today, the death toll in the Rwandan genocide continued \nto mount while the international community stood by and watched, \ndespite clear warnings, and despite the International Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that committed \nsignatories to act. Six years ago, U.S. leadership failed, the \ninternational community floundered, and the global bond of basic human \ndecency broke, leaving the people of Rwanda to face terror alone.\n  Mr. President, we know today that the genocide was not a series of \nspontaneous acts; it was not about crowds gone wild or tribal \nbloodlust. It was carefully planned and centrally directed. Extra \nmachetes had been imported, militias groups were in place, and \nincitements to murder had become a regular element of programming on \nthe hate-radio station. The planners targeted not only ethnic Tutsis, \nbut also politically moderate Hutus who threatened their grip on power. \nWe know today that individual people--leaders and planners--are \nresponsible for the deaths of some 800,000 people, and that the blame \nfor these atrocities cannot be heaped on some imagined cultural failing \nor the flaws of the human heart in general.\n  Holding those individuals responsible for the genocide accountable \nfor their actions is the only remaining opportunity for the \ninternational community to do the right thing with regard to the events \nof 6 years ago. For this reason, I have consistently supported the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, known as the ICTR. The ICTR \nwas created by the United Nations Security Council in November 1994 to \nprosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations \nof international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda during 1994. Its \nstructure mirrors that of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia, the ICTY.\n  I have come to this floor in the past to raise the issue of parity \nbetween the ICTY and the ICTR. In particular, I have pointed out that \nwhereas the ICTY has the authority to prosecute individuals for serious \nviolations of international humanitarian law committed since 1991 \nthrough the present, the ICTR's mandate covers only those acts \ncommitted within Rwandan borders during 1994. Last year, the Senate \napproved an amendment that I offered to the State Department \nauthorization bill requiring a report on the merits of expanding the \nmandate to the ICTR in space and time, both to deter further abuses and \nto hold the perpetrators of the continuing atrocities in the Great \nLakes accountable for their actions.\n\n  Even if we accept the confines of the current mandate, I fear that \nthe ICTR is being given short shrift. Under current U.S. law, the \nSecretary of State can confer with the Attorney General and, through \nthe rewards program that offers incentives to turn in terrorists and \nother international villains, pay a reward to any individual furnishing \ninformation leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of any \nperson who is the subject of an indictment of the ICTY. Similarly, the \nreward may be made to any individual furnishing information leading to \nthe transfer to or conviction by the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor the Former Yugoslavia. But there is no such provision for the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n  It is situations like these that feed perceptions of a double-\nstandard in American foreign policy, wherein African lives are somehow \nless valuable than European ones, and African atrocities are somehow \nmore acceptable. That perceived double-standard undermines American \ncredibility and casts doubt on our commitment to the values we hold \nmost dear, the values at the very foundation of our national identity.\n  The ICTR is not perfect, but it has been responsible for the first \nconvictions for the crime of genocide ever to be issued by an \ninternational court. It has been the first international body to \nrecognize rape as a crime of genocide. And knowledgeable observers \nagree that it has made a great deal of progress since its early days, \nand that it has gone further to bring ``big fish\" to justice than the \nICTY. But more needs to be done. I will submit for the Record an \narticle from the most recent issue of The Economist, headlined ``Still \nWanted,'' which details some of the challenges the international \ncommunity faces in bringing the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide to \njustice. The United States should assist in these efforts. And the \nexisting law that I propose amending ensures that the State Department \nand the Department of Justice--not the U.N.--will govern the offering, \nadministration, and payment of rewards. Six years after the Rwandan \ngenocide, six years after the slaughter of 800,000 people, including \nthose indicted by the ICTR in the rewards program is the very least we \ncan do.\n  I yield the floor, and ask unanimous consent that the bill and \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXPANSION OF REWARDS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE RWANDA.\n\n       Section 102 of the Act of October 30, 1998 (Public Law 105-\n     323) is amended--\n       (1) in the section heading, by inserting ``OR RWANDA'' \n     after ``YUGOSLAVIA'';\n       (2) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``or the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda'' after \n     ``Yugoslavia''; and\n       (3) in subsection (c)-\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' immediately after ``Reference.--\n     ''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For the purposes of subsection (a), the statute of \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda means the \n     statute contained in the annex to Security Council Resolution \n     955 of November 8, 1994.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, Apr. 22, 2000]\n\n                              Still Wanted\n\n       Will Felicien Kabuga or Tharcisse Renzaho ever be brought \n     to justice? They are still at large, among several hundred \n     other senior Rwandans who in 1994 planned and promoted the \n     genocide of up to 1m people. Mr. Kabuga was a businessman who \n     financed the murderous Hutu militias, supplied them with \n     machetes and was part owner of Radio Mille Collines, the \n     radio station that broadcast the orders for genocide. Colonel \n     Renzaho was the governor of the capital, Kigali. He directed \n     the killing squads there, ordering them to make sure that \n     ``none can escape'', and he was a member of the committee \n     that co-ordinated the slaughter throughout the country.\n       So far, 44 people have been detained by the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\n     based in Arusha in Tanzania. Seven have been convicted, of \n     whom six are on appeal. The prosecutor is still looking for \n     about 35 people. Although names are not published for fear of \n     alerting men on the run, Mr. Kabuga and Colonel Renzaho are \n     almost certainly on the list. Arrested or hunted, they are \n     still only a small proportion of the people who planned and \n     executed the fastest and most orderly genocide in history.\n       While the UN tribunal grinds on in Arusha, the Rwandan \n     government is busy bringing genocide criminals before its own \n     courts. If the main perpetrators are to be caught, and the \n     evidence found to convict them, the two should co-operate. \n     But their relationship, though it now shows signs of \n     improvement, has long been unhappy. The government objects, \n     among other things, to the money spent on the tribunal, which \n     it feels could have been better used to rebuild a justice \n     system in Rwanda.\n       The government has so far detained more than 120,000 people \n     accused of genocide, of whom over 2,000 have been convicted \n     and 300 sentenced to death. At the end of last year, it \n     produced a list of 2,133 people suspected of planning or \n     directing the genocide. Most of them are still at large.\n       Many of the missing villains are in Congo. Senior military \n     officers fled there after their genocidal government was \n     defeated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which now rules the \n     country. In Congo, they regrouped soldiers and militiamen \n     responsible for the killing. Since Rwanda became involved in \n     Congo's civil war, many of the Rwandan militiamen are \n     fighting on the side of president Laurent Kabila, against the \n     Congolese rebels who, in their turn, are backed by the \n     Rwandan government. So long as Congo's fighting continues, \n     the missing Rwandans will be difficult to arrest--and they \n     are making sure that the war continues.\n       Others are in Tanzania. Hutus from both Rwanda and Burundi \n     are well established in the administration of western \n     Tanzania from where, probably without the knowledge of the \n     central government, they protect some of the killers. Others, \n     again, are scattered around the world, some with false \n     identities. Mr. Kabuga was said to have been spotted in \n     Switzerland but is now thought to be in Kenya. Colonel \n     Renzaho is probably in Congo. Governments do not seem to be \n     making much effort to find them. Those who have been \n     discovered--in Britain, America, France, Belgium and \n     Denmark--have often been unmasked by journalists.\n       By contrast, western security services expend considerable \n     energy on tracking down war criminals from the conflicts in \n     former Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal in The \n     Hague has so far issued over 90 indictments, and arrested \n     more than 40 suspects, of whom 15 have been sentenced. It has \n     named 29 people it is still looking for. So far as is known, \n     they are all still in the region, either in power in Serbia \n     or hiding in Bosnia.\n       It is much harder to find the dispersed Rwandans. Moreover, \n     even if they were caught and sent to the tribunal, gathering \n     evidence to prosecute them would be difficult. Persuading \n     witnesses to leave their homes and come to Arusha to give \n     evidence, and then providing them with protection when they \n     return, is fraught with trouble.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator John Breaux, in \nintroducing legislation that would establish the Cat Island National \nWildlife Refuge in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. Cat Island is one \nof the last remaining tracts in the Lower Mississippi River Valley that \nis still influenced by the natural dynamics of the river. The 36,500 \nacre site supports one of the largest densities of virgin bald cypress \ntrees in the entire Mississippi River Valley. The site is also the home \nof the nation's largest cypress tree. Cat Island is important habitat \nfor several declining species of songbirds and thousands of wintering \nwaterfowl. The site is also home to the Louisiana black bear and high \npopulations of deer, squirrel, turkey, and furbearing mammals such as \nmink and bobcats. We introduce this important legislation with the \npurpose of preserving and enhancing this valuable natural resource for \nour nation and generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I recently had the good fortune of visiting Cat Island \nwith Senator Breaux and representatives from the U.S. Department of the \nInterior, and I must tell you I was overwhelmed by the breathtaking \nbeauty and bountiful natural resources of this site. Cat Island truly \nrepresents one of the most valuable and productive wildlife habitats in \nthe United States. The site has high value for public uses such as \noutdoor recreation, environmental education, ecotourism, hunting, and \nfishing.\n  There has been a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for protecting and \nenhancing the natural resources of Cat Island. Citizens and elected \nofficials from the State of Louisiana, representatives from national \nenvironmental conservation organizations and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService have supported our efforts in developing this important \nlegislation. The Police Jurors of West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, \nhave passed a resolution in support of establishing the Cat Island \nNational Wildlife Refuge. The Governor of Louisiana and the Secretary \nof the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries have endorsed \ncreating the refuge. The Nature Conservancy of Louisiana has generously \nagreed to underwrite the operation and maintenance cost for the Fish \nand Wildlife Service during the first three years of operation of the \nrefuge. The conservation organization will also facilitate the \nacquisition of the site and the transfer of ownership to the Fish and \nWildlife Service. Most recently, the President allocated $4 million in \nhis fiscal year 2001 budget for land acquisitions at the Cat Island \nsite.\n  Mr. President, Cat Island clearly represents one of the best examples \nof Louisiana's unique natural heritage and is deserving of inclusion in \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System. This legislation supports the aims \nof the Lower Mississippi River Aquatic Resources Management Plan and \nthe Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture under the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Landrieu in \noffering legislation to establish the Cat Island National Wildlife \nRefuge in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana.\n  The Mississippi River has provided for the commerce, transportation, \nand nourishment that has sustained Louisianians for over 300 years. \nOver time, communities have adapted to the unique environment that \nexists near the River. Today marks a milestone in the effort to \npreserve one of the last remaining tracts in the lower Mississippi \nValley that is still influenced by the natural dynamics of the great \nRiver.\n  The area known as Cat Island is the southernmost unleveed portion of \nthe Mississippi River. It is actually a peninsula of bottomland \nhardwood forest adjacent to the River and located thirty miles north of \nour state capital at Baton Rouge. It supports one of the highest \ndensities of virgin bald cypress trees in the entire Mississippi River \nValley, including the nation's champion cypress tree, which is 17 feet \nwide and 53 feet in circumference. By designating this area as a \nNational Wildlife Refuge, we aim to protect the habitat of several \ndeclining species of forest songbirds, thousands of wintering \nwaterfowl, and breeding ground for Wood Ducks. The area also supports \nhigh populations of deer, squirrel, turkey, and furbearers such as \nbobcat and mink.\n  The Cat Island Project represents a collaborative effort among \nseveral entities who have remained committed to its conservation. The \nNature Conservancy spearheaded the effort, marshaled public support \nfrom Louisianians of all stripes, and worked diligently to secure the \nnecessary funding for the initial acquisition of land from commercial \nand private landowners in the area. In fact, the Migratory Bird \nCommission provided the seed money to begin the acquisition process. \nSenator Landrieu and I have worked hard to find appropriate sources of \nfederal funding to contribute to the cause, and we are delighted that \nthe President has included $4 million for the Cat Island Project in his \nbudget request for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We have enjoyed \nthe support of officials from the Department of the Interior as well. \nAssistant Secretary David Hayes visited the site of the planned refuge \nalong with Senator Landrieu and me in February. As I said, this project \nis the result of the good faith, dedication and continued cooperation \nof many players. I express my sincere gratitude and congratulations to \nall who have been involved.\n  The final piece in the completion of this project is the designation \nof the land as a National Wildlife Refuge. I am proud to offer \nlegislation that will ensure the conservation of wild Louisiana for \nfuture generations to experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Res. 294\n\n       Whereas the Internet is one of the most effective tools \n     available for purposes of education and research and gives \n     children the means to make friends and freely communicate \n     with peers and family anywhere in the world;\n       Whereas the new era of instant communication holds great \n     promise for achieving better understanding of the world and \n     providing the opportunity for creative inquiry;\n       Whereas it is vital to the well-being of children that the \n     Internet offer an open and responsible environment to \n     explore;\n       Whereas access to objectionable material, such as violent, \n     obscene, or sexually explicit adult material may be received \n     by a minor in unsolicited form;\n       Whereas there is a growing concern in all levels of society \n     to protect children from objectionable material;\n       Whereas the technological option for parents or guardians \n     to filter, block, or review objectionable Internet material \n     is available and effective;\n       Whereas information on Internet filtering or blocking \n     technology is unavailable to many parents or guardians; and\n       Whereas the Internet is a positive educational tool and \n     should be seen in such a manner rather than as a vehicle for \n     entities to make objectionable materials available to \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2000 as ``Children's Internet Safety \n     Month'' and supports its official status on the Nation's \n     promotional calendar; and\n       (2) supports parents and guardians in promoting the \n     creative development of children by encouraging the use of \n     the Internet in a safe, positive manner with the aid of \n     Internet filtering and blocking technologies.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a resolution \ndesignating October 2000 as ``Children's Internet Safety Month'' on our \nnational promotional calendar. This resolution, which I am submitting \nalong with my colleague, Senator McCain, recognizes the valuable \ninformation and opportunities for creative development provided by the \nInternet. It supports parents and guardians as they work to promote \nchildren's intellectual growth by encouraging safe, positive internet \nuse with the aid of Internet filtering and blocking technologies.\n  Filtering and blocking technologies can help parents and guardians \nprotect their children from objectionable material. This is \nparticularly important in those frequent instances when such material \nis obtained by accident, via unsolicited correspondence. With more than \n5,000 new web sites appearing on the Internet each day, we must \nrecognize the problems raised by the significant number of sites \ncontaining objectionable material (defined as material that is violent, \nobscene or sexually explicit). Unfortunately, one-third of all Internet \nweb sites are devoted to objectionable material. This presents our \nnation with a moral challenge: to find the means to sustain the \nwonderful freedom of the Internet while protecting children from \nunwanted and potentially harmful Internet material.\n  By designating October 2000 as ``Children's Internet Safety Month'' \non the nation's promotional calendar, we can help parents, guardians, \nand concerned community leaders in their efforts to provide responsible \nInternet protection for our children. We can focus public attention on \nthis important issue and encourage development of positive, community \nbased programs and events highlighting the need to protect children \nfrom objectionable Internet material.\n  This resolution will help empower the young people of the Internet \nGeneration to share ideas and dreams; and to do so free from unwanted \nand intrusive, objectionable Internet material.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2873-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2873-S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 295--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n    CARRYING OF FIREARMS INTO PLACES OF WORSHIP OR EDUCATIONAL AND \n                SCHOLASTIC SETTINGS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself Mr. Daschle, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reid, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Robb, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Wyden, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nSarbanes, and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following resolution, which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 295\n\n       Whereas repeated incidents of senseless and horrific gun \n     violence have led many Americans to conclude that neither \n     they nor their children can feel completely secure anywhere \n     at anytime anymore;\n       Whereas the epidemic of gun violence in our Nation has \n     invaded schools, youth sporting events, places of worship, \n     and other spaces that the American people once thought of as \n     sanctuaries of safety;\n       Whereas these shootings have shattered the confidence of \n     parents and educators and clergy in their ability to protect \n     children from the increasingly dangerous world around them;\n       Whereas in response to this trend, Congress previously \n     acted to protect America's children by prohibiting the \n     possession of firearms in school zones;\n       Whereas no American adult or child should have to fear for \n     their safety when studying, praying in their places of \n     worship, or participating in any other activities at or \n     related to their schools or places of worship;\n       Whereas it is the obligation of America's elected leaders \n     to do all they can to protect our children from harm and \n     ensure that adults and children alike can learn, play, or \n     pray in safety; and\n       Whereas there is no rational reason for anyone other than a \n     law enforcement officer to carry a gun into a place of \n     worship, a school, or a school-related event: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     carrying of firearms into places of worship or educational \n     and scholastic settings should be prohibited.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the first anniversary of the Columbine \nmassacre has been a time for great contemplation and reflection--\ncontemplation of the horror and tragedy of that event, and reflection \non what has become of the safety and security so many of us once took \nfor granted. From Paducah, Kentucky, to Jonesboro, Arkansas, to \nSpringfield, Oregon, to Mount Morris Township, Michigan, to Littleton, \nColorado, the surreal has too often become mortally real. Senseless, \nhorrific and seemingly random gun violence has invaded all corners of \nour nation. These incidents have shattered our collective sense of \nsecurity. What's worse, they have done so with respect to the very \nplaces where we and our children have the right to feel most secure: \nour schools and our places of worship.\n  There are many facets to this problem--a media culture that \ndesensitizes our children to violence, a feeling of hopelessness that \ninvades too many of our children and the often too easy accessibility \nof firearms. We must address all of these problems, and I hope we soon \nwill start to do so by taking action on the long-stalled juvenile \njustice bill with its several sensible gun-safety provisions and its \nmeasures aimed at the culture of violence surrounding our children.\n  But there is one more thing we can do for ourselves and our children: \nrestore a sense of sanctuary and safe haven to spaces where guns have \nno place. Ask parents, educators or congregants, and they'll say every \ncommunity is entitled to at least a few sites of sanctuary, where they \ncan honor their families and their God without fearing for their safety \nor their lives. But the reality is that at least 22 states permit gun \nowners to carry concealed weapons into places of worship, and many \nallow them at school events off campus.\n  Why does anyone other than a law enforcement or security officer need \nto carry a firearm into these spaces? Why at this moment of such \nconcern about gun violence do we want to add to it the potential for \nmore terror and tragedy in what should be our safest places? Why after \nat least a dozen shootings in American churches and synagogues over the \nlast five years do we want to invite another?\n  Making clear that guns have no place in what are supposed to be \nsanctuaries would put the law on the right side of reason. It would \nhelp diminish the odds that another Columbine is around the corner. And \nit would reassure the American people that it is possible for us to \ncome together on common ground to fight this threat to our safety and \nsecurity.\n  With these thoughts in mind, and with the Million Mom March against \ngun violence soon to occur in Washington, I am today joining a \ncoalition\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\nof more than 25 Members in submitting a resolution expressing our \nsupport for prohibitions on firearms in schools, scholastic settings, \nand places of worship. This resolution would make a clear statement \nthat, like most Americans, we in the Senate believe that Saturday Night \nSpecials do not belong in Sunday School classes or any other place \nwhere families are learning, playing or praying.\n  This in the end is not an ideological or constitutional issue, but a \nquestion of common sense. We can respect the rights of law-abiding gun \nowners while also acknowledging that bullets and Bibles don't mix. This \nis not a hard line to take. Nor should it be a hard line to draw, in \norder to provide safe havens for our families.\n  It is time for the Senate to go on record and say that there are \ncertain places in our society that must be safe havens from even the \nthreat of violence, spaces where we and our children can go to pray and \nplay with the confidence that safety and security will follow. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2874-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 296--DESIGNATING THE FIRST SUNDAY IN JUNE OF EACH \n               CALENDAR YEAR AS ``NATIONAL CHILD'S DAY''\n\n  By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Bond, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Grams, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Mack, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nJohnson, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Liberman, Mrs. \nBoxer, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 296\n\n       Whereas the first Sunday of June falls between Mother's Day \n     and Father's Day;\n       Whereas each child is unique, a blessing, and holds a \n     distinct place in the family unit;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should celebrate \n     children as the most valuable asset of the United States;\n       Whereas the children represent the future, hope, and \n     inspiration of the United States;\n       Whereas the children of the United States should be allowed \n     to feel that their ideas and dreams will be respected because \n     adults in the United States take time to listen;\n       Whereas many children of the United States face crises of \n     grave proportions, especially as they enter adolescent years;\n       Whereas it is important for parents to spend time listening \n     to their children on a daily basis;\n       Whereas modern societal and economic demands often pull the \n     family apart;\n       Whereas, whenever practicable, it is important for both \n     parents to be involved in their child's life;\n       Whereas encouragement should be given to families to set \n     aside a special time for all family members to engage \n     together in family activities;\n       Whereas adults in the United States should have an \n     opportunity to reminisce on their youth to recapture some of \n     the fresh insight, innocence, and dreams that they may have \n     lost through the years;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     emphasize to children the importance of developing an ability \n     to make the choices necessary to distance themselves from \n     impropriety and to contribute to their communities;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should emphasize to \n     children the importance of family life, education, and \n     spiritual qualities;\n       Whereas because children are the responsibility of all \n     people of the United States, everyone should celebrate \n     children, whose questions, laughter, and dreams are important \n     to the existence of the United States; and\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children will emphasize to the people of the United States \n     the importance of the role of the child within the family and \n     society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first Sunday in June of each year as \n     ``National Child's Day''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \ndesignates the first Sunday in June as National Child's Day.\n  Our children are our future. I believe that most of my colleagues \nwould agree that our children are, indeed, this nation's most precious \nresource--a resource that should be cherished and protected.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, over five million of America's children go to \nbed hungry at night.\n  In the last ten years there has been a 60 percent increase in the \nnumber of children in or in need of foster care services.\n  Many children in America face crises of grave proportions, especially \nas they enter their adolescent years.\n  We must make a commitment to reverse these trends. We must take the \ninitiative to make each child in this nation a child who is loved, \ncared for and appreciated for his or herself.\n  The establishment of a National Child's Day will give all of us the \nunique opportunity to focus on our children's needs and to recognize \ntheir accomplishments.\n  National Child's Day will encourage families to spend more quality \ntime together and will highlight the special importance of the child in \nthe family unit.\n  This simple, yet important, resolution will foster family \ntogetherness and ensure that our children receive all of the love, \nsupport, and attention that they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in establishing National Child's Day \nthis year and for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2874-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2874-S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENT SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BAYH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3102\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table)\n  Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Edwards, and Mrs. Murray) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (H.R. 6) to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate the marriage penalty by \nproviding that the income tax rate bracket amounts, and the amount of \nthe standard deduction, for joint returns shall be twice the amounts \napplicable to unmarried individuals; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Today, in the Washington Post, there was a story \nheadlined ``U.S. Arms Policy is Criticized at the United Nations.'' The \noccasion of the criticism comes at the beginning of the conference to \nreview the status of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which opened \nyesterday at the United Nations in New York. This conference occurs \nonce every 5 years. It is a conference on the status of the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. I would like to read the first paragraph of \nthe story in the Washington Post because it is really quite a sad day \nwhen our country is described in the following way:\n\n       After years of championing international attempts to halt \n     the spread of nuclear weapons, the United States found itself \n     on the defensive today as a broad alliance of arms control \n     advocates, senior United Nations officials, and diplomats \n     from nonnuclear countries charged that Washington is blocking \n     progress toward disarmament.\n\n  Well, that is not something any of us aspires to hear. I hope and I \nbelieve that many of my colleagues want the United States to be seen as \na leader in trying to stop the spread of nuclear\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nweapons and in trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this \nworld. Regrettably, others view the actions of the United States--\nespecially in the last few years--as actions that are not actions of a \nleader in trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  We have made some progress over recent years in reducing the number \nof nuclear weapons. I want to describe how because I think it is \nimportant to understand it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show two items on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of metal that comes from \nthe wing strut of a Russian TU-160 Backfire bomber. This bomber carried \nnuclear weapons during the height of the cold war. This bomber was a \nthreat to the United States of America.\n  How is it that I stand on the floor of the Senate holding a piece of \na wing strut from a Russian bomber? Did we shoot it down? No. It was \nactually sawed off the wing. Giant, rotating metal saws cut the wings \noff this bomber. Why? Because we negotiated an agreement with the \nRussians to reduce the number of bombers and missiles and nuclear \nwarheads in Russia. We reduced our stockpile and our delivery \nmechanisms, and they reduced theirs. So without shooting down a bomber \nthat carried nuclear bombs that threatened America, I now have in my \nhand a piece of a wing from a Russian bomber--because arms control \nworks. We know it works.\n  This chart shows what arms control has done in recent years. In the \n1980s we ratified the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in \nthe 1990s we ratified the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or \nSTART I. When we started the process in the mid-1980s, the Russians--or \nthen the Soviet Union--had about 11,000 nuclear weapons on long range \nmissiles. Today Russia has about 5,000. That means that 6,000 warheads \nare now gone. Many of those warheads were probably carried in the \nRussian Backfire bomber this piece comes from. So 6,000 warheads no \nlonger threaten the United States of America.\n  Do you know what that represents--6,000 warheads with the kind of \nstrength and power of the nuclear warheads the Russians used to build? \nThat is equal to 175,000 Hiroshima bombs. Let me say that again. We \nhave actually negotiated the reduction of nuclear warheads in the \nRussian arsenal, and 6,000 warheads are gone. Those 6,000 warheads \nrepresented the equivalent of 175,000 atomic bombs dropped on \nHiroshima. That is quite remarkable.\n\n  This is a small container of ground-up copper wire. This copper wire \nused to run through a Russian ballistic missile submarine. This type of \nsubmarine, a Typhoon class submarine that snaked under the waters \nthroughout the world carrying 20 missiles, with 10 nuclear warheads on \nthe tip of each of those missiles, aimed at the United States of \nAmerica. This copper wire, before it was ground up, used to course \nthrough this Typhoon submarine. But now I have the wire from a Typhoon \nsubmarine ground up in a small vial. How did I get that? Did we sink \nthis submarine? Did we go to war with Russia and sink this submarine? \nNo. This was dismantled, brought up to the port, and then engineers, \ncarpenters, and others took this apart piece by piece, and this \nsubmarine doesn't exist anymore.\n  This submarine was taken apart as part of the Nunn-Lugar program to \nreduce delivery systems and nuclear weapons in the old Soviet Union and \nin what we now refer to as Russia. We have spent $2.5 billion on the \nNunn-Lugar program. We have actually paid for the destruction of \nRussian bombers. We have paid for the destruction of Russian \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, 5,000 nuclear warheads, 471 ICBMs, \nand 354 ICBM silos, 12 ballistic missile submarines.\n  I have had charts on the Senate floor that show a plot of ground in \nthe Ukraine where a missile silo existed with a nuclear warhead aimed \nat the United States of America, and now the silo is gone. I have held \nup a piece of metal from the hinge of the silo on the floor of the \nSenate. That hinge and that missile silo are now scrap metal. The silo \nis gone, the missile is gone, the warhead doesn't exist, and there is \nnow a plot of ground with sunflowers. Where a nuclear missile used to \nrest, sunflowers now grow. That is progress. That is real progress in \nreducing the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  What about the future? If this is what has happened and this is \nsuccess, what about the future? Well, this success occurred under \ndecisions by Congress--not in the last several years, but years before \nthat--in which we said: We are the leaders in arms reduction and arms \ncontrol. Our country wants to provide leadership. We want to reduce the \nnumber of warheads, reduce the number of bombers and missiles, reduce \nthe tensions. And we have done that.\n  But in the last several years, something dramatic has changed in the \nCongress. No. 1, we saw the Senate defeat the Comprehensive Nuclear \nTest Ban Treaty. It was almost unthinkable to me, but this Senate said: \nThis country doesn't want to ratify a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty even though we have already decided that the United States is \nnot going to test nuclear weapons. We decided that unilaterally some 6 \nor 7 years ago. So we are not testing nuclear weapons. A treaty that \nhas been signed by over 150 nations, negotiated over many years, \nratified by most of our allies, was not ratified by the Senate because \nwe have Senators who say, no, we don't think that is in the country's \ninterest.\n  Well, if it is not in this country's interest to reduce the stockpile \nof nuclear weapons and to stop the testing of nuclear weapons, stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons around the world, what on earth is in this \ncountry's interest? After the Senate failed to ratify that treaty, \nthose who voted against the treaty blamed everyone but themselves. That \ntreaty languished in the committee here in the Senate for over 2 years \nwithout a day of hearings--not one. Then it was brought to the floor on \na preemptory basis, given short shrift in debate, and killed.\n\n  Those who killed that treaty should not have taken much pleasure in \nputting this country in the position of failing to exert leadership \nwith respect to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and the ban on \ntesting nuclear weapons all around the world.\n  Last week, the Russian Duma ratified START II. Prior to that, the \nRussians passed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. While that \nis happening, this country is talking about building a national missile \ndefense system and trying to negotiate with Russia changes in the \nantiballistic missile system which in many ways is the linchpin for all \nof this progress in arms control and arms reduction.\n  And what happens? Yesterday at the United Nations we have diplomats \nlooking at Russia and saying: You are making a lot of progress here, \nRussia. You have passed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. You \nratified that treaty, you passed START II, congratulations.\n  And the United States: You have lost your edge, you are not doing \nmuch. You seem to be retreating on the question of whether you care \nabout arms control. You seem to be stepping back from your commitment \nof stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and working as hard as you \nworked previously to reduce the number of delivery vehicles and reduce \nthe number of nuclear weapons.\n  I regret that is the case. That should not be the case. It cannot be \na judgment of conservatives or liberals or Democrats or Republicans to \nbelieve that somehow it falls to someone else to be a leader in the \nworld to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Do we worry that the \nnuclear club--a rather small club in this world consisting of nations \nthat possess nuclear weapons--do we worry that is going to proliferate, \nthere will be more and more nations that possess nuclear weapons, and \nmore and more nations that have the mechanism or the wherewithal to \ndeliver those nuclear weapons? We should certainly worry about that.\n  Even with START II, the U.S. and Russia will each have about 3,500 \nnuclear weapons. Hopefully we will begin negotiations of START III and \nagree to much lower levels. As we do that, we have people in this \nChamber who want to focus not on arms control but on building some kind \nof a national missile defense system, some sort of a shield to prevent \nAmerica from being attacked by a rogue nation.\n  We need to understand the only country in the world that possesses \nthe\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nstrength and the nuclear power to destroy our way of life is Russia. \nThey still have thousands of nuclear weapons. We ought to engage with \nthem in an aggressive START III negotiation and continue the progress \nof bringing down the number of nuclear weapons in the two major nuclear \nsuperpowers--Russia and the United States. We ought to continue that.\n  I know we have people here who don't sleep at night because they are \nworried that North Korea might threaten a small slice of the United \nStates. But they should realize that, No. 1 A national missile defense, \nif deployed, will be horribly costly. No. 2, it will not protect this \ncountry against this kind of a threat. Those people say to the American \npeople that Congress will fund a national missile defense program to \ndefend against a rogue nation--North Korea, they suggest, Iraq or Iran. \nThe fact is, the least likely threat that a rogue nation would have \naccess to is an intercontinental ballistic missile. If it acquires \naccess to a nuclear weapon, it is far more likely to deploy it as a \nsuitcase bomb put in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car at a dock in New \nYork City, rather than putting it on the tip of an intercontinental \nballistic missile and having any notion of being able to fire it with \naccuracy.\n  It is much more likely they would acquire a cruise missile, which \nwould be easier to acquire, much less costly, and not as technically \ndifficult to deploy. Of course, the national missile defense system \nwouldn't do anything to defend against that. It is much more likely a \nrogue nation would find it more attractive to use a deadly vial of \nchemical or biological agents to threaten a superpower.\n\n  We face a myriad of threats. There is no question about that. The \nbiggest threat, in my judgment, is this country stepping away from its \nresponsibility to lead and stop the spread of nuclear weapons around \nthe world, and this country stepping away from its responsibility to \ndecrease the number of nuclear weapons and decrease the launchers and \ndelivery systems for those nuclear weapons.\n  My fervent hope is that we will agree that last year's vote by which \nthe Senate defeated ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty should not signal to anyone in the world that this country is no \nlonger interested in these issues. We must decide again, even though \nthere is not an appetite by some in the Senate to do so, we must decide \nagain that leadership in arms control is this country's responsibility. \nIt is upon our shoulders that this responsibility falls. No one else \ncan exert this leadership with the capability of the United States.\n  If we don't exert leadership, what we will end up building new \nnuclear weapons, building new defensive systems. We will start a new \narms race. We will see more spending on nuclear weapons by China. We \nwill see more spending on offensive weapons by Russia. We will see \nother countries joining the nuclear club because they will believe they \nshould acquire nuclear weapons to represent their interests. We will \nsee our allies depart from us on these issues because they believe \nabrogation of the ABM Treaty is very unwise.\n  I think the majority of the American people believe the biggest \nthreat to our future is the nuclear threat, the threat of a nuclear \nattack by an ever-increasing number of countries who acquire nuclear \nweapons.\n  We know what works. Arms control works, negotiation works, destroying \nanother superpower's bombers through negotiation by sawing off the \nwings, dismantling submarines that carry nuclear weapons: we know that \nworks. It is far better to do that than to engage in the horror of a \nnuclear war from which this world will not, in my judgment, survive.\n  Think for a moment about the devastation visited upon Nagasaki and \nHiroshima and go back to what I discussed earlier--the reduction in \n6,000 nuclear warheads that has been negotiated and accomplished. That \nis just the first step, a big step, but just the first step. It \nrepresents the reduction in nuclear warheads equivalent to 175,000 \nbombs the size of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.\n  The reason I come to the floor at the end of the day is simply to say \nwe ought not take any pride as a country in seeing an article in the \npress of the United States suggesting somehow we have lost our will to \nlead on this issue. We can come to the floor and debate 100 things in \n100 days. Some of them are big; some of them are small. None are more \nimportant, in my judgment, than addressing the issue of the spread of \nnuclear weapons. Just because we have people now serving in Congress \nwho have an unending appetite to keep building new weapons, an unending \nappetite to spend more money on new weapons, does not mean those who \nbelieve in arms control and believe real progress in arms control will \nmake this a safer world in which to live, should step aside and say: \nYes, you win; go build your weapons.\n  We ought not do that, but we ought to wage the fight for a safer \nworld by having this country exhibit the leadership it needs to \nexhibit, that it should responsibly exhibit, for the safety of all the \npeople who live in this world.\n  I will have more to say about this subject at another time. But on \nthe eve of the meeting of the NPT Review Conference in New York, I \nwanted to talk about these issues. I want to say that some in Congress \nbelieve very strongly and feel very deeply the future of our children \nand grandchildren and the future of this country rests on those who \nbelieve in arms control prevailing in this Senate, despite the recent \nevents, despite the debate we have heard in the last couple of years. \nThis issue is not over. Those of us who believe as I do are not going \nto go away. We hope this country will assume some sensible mantle of \nleadership in this important area.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2879-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2879-S2880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE NUCLEAR WASTE BILL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand at this time the President \nis considering vetoing the nuclear waste bill that passed here by a \nsubstantial majority. That is very troubling to me. It is time for us \nto dispose of nuclear waste. We have the capability. The citizens of \nAmerica, through their electric bills, have paid billions of dollars to \nbuild this waste disposal area out in the Nevada desert to place this \nnuclear waste--which is not explosive. It is simply radioactive and it \nis placed in the right kind of containers and will be placed in the \nground of the desert of Nevada where we exploded 1,000 bombs on top of \nthe ground in developing our nuclear bombing capability. But every \nnuclear electric-generating plant in America produces some waste. That \nwaste is being stored on site. We agreed some years ago to create this \nfund and to store this waste. Now, every time we come to this Senate, \nevery time this debate comes up for a vote, a majority votes for it and \nthe President ends up vetoing it and we fall just short of the number \nof votes to override that veto.\n  Through an unusual number of circumstances, I have become somewhat \nfamiliar with the concerns involving energy and nuclear power in \nAmerica. I formed a very clear opinion of what we have to do if we are \ngoing to meet the demands for power and the demand to clean up the \natmosphere. The Kyoto treaty, which the President signed and the Vice \nPresident supported, the executive branch made an amazing agreement \nthat we would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent from \n1990 levels by 2012 or 2010--the exact year escapes me.\n  Since that time, our demand for energy has increased. Since 1990, our \nemissions of greenhouse gases have increased by 8 percent. By the year \n2012, if we were to comply with the agreement the President tried to \ncommit us to, we would have to reduce, from this day, 15 percent of our \ngreenhouse gas emissions when we know our demands for energy are going \nto increase between now and 2010. This is a box we cannot get out of; \nnot under present plans.\n\n  There was a marvelous 2-hour show on Sunday night on public \ntelevision's ``Frontline'' on greenhouse gases and the potential of \nglobal warming. They went over all the issues at that time. I think it \nwas tilted slightly more than the science indicates that we are in a \nperiod of global warming, but it does appear we may be. We need to be \nthinking about that. But the scientists and\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nexperts I have talked with say we cannot meet those goals without \nnuclear power.\n  Mr. President, 20 percent of the electricity in this country is \nproduced by nuclear power, but we have not approved a new plant since \nthe 1970s. France has over 60 percent--soon to be 80 percent--of its \npower generated by nuclear power. Japan also has a large percentage \ngenerated by it. In the United States, we have never lost a life as a \nresult of nuclear power. Nuclear power produces, as you know, no \npollution for the atmosphere--zero. Huge amounts--20 percent--of our \nelectric power is produced by nuclear power with no emissions out \nthere.\n  We have a crisis in our energy policy with regard to fuel oil and our \ndomestic production since 1992, when this administration took office. \nThe reason I am talking about that is I believe there is a no-growth, \nantienergy policy that is made a part of our American policy under the \nClinton-Gore administration. They do not believe in production of \ngreater amounts of energy. We have reduced our domestic production of \noil by 17 percent since 1992. Yet our demand for oil and gasoline has \nincreased 14 percent. That is a shocking figure. That is why we are so \nmuch more dependent on the Middle East, OPEC, for oil and gas. That is \nwhy they are able to demand higher prices. Maybe the gas companies \nadded a few cents on a gallon, but almost all of that was a direct \nresult of their demand for oil from the Middle East and Venezuela and \nthe OPEC nations, and we virtually pay double for it.\n  What that means is if your gasoline has gone up from $1 to $1.45 at \nthe gas pump, that extra 45 cents is going outside of America to one of \nthese OPEC nations. It is a drain on the wealth of this country, and I \nsubmit it does suggest it could threaten the economic prosperity we are \nenjoying today.\n  How can we meet our environmental goals? How can we do that without \nthinking broadly about what is occurring? We heard recently the Vice \nPresident saying, with regard to nuclear power, that he does not \nsupport an increased reliance on nuclear power for electricity \ngeneration. He does not support an increased reliance on nuclear power \nfor electricity generation, but he would keep open the option of \nrelicensing existing nuclear plants. I think that is a stunning \nstatement. That is a no-growth policy. We are going to limit greenhouse \nemissions but we are not going to allow any increase in nuclear power.\n  Another one of his stunning proposals is to not drill any further for \nnatural gas in the deep Gulf of Mexico. There are great reserves of \nnatural gas there. Natural gas, even if it breaks out of our pipeline, \ndoes not pollute as does oil. It is not sticky. It evaporates. It is \nnot a real dangerous pollutant. And when it burns, it is the most \nefficient burning of all fossil fuels and produces the least amount of \npollution. If we move to a cleaner energy source, natural gas is it. \nBut the Vice President, who opposes nuclear power, now is opposing \ndrilling for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. That he explicitly \nstated during his campaign in New Hampshire. In fact, he said he would \nconsider rolling back the leases that have already been issued. So this \nis a dangerous time for us.\n\n  I hope we are not moving to make unwise decisions that would, in \neffect, result in the drying up of our supply of energy and raising the \nprice of energy for every American and having that money go overseas to \nforeign nations. We need to produce more nuclear power. I will be \ntalking more about that in the future.\n  My plea is to the President: Do not veto this bill. Let's keep \nAmerica as a strong nuclear-powered country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/25/senate-section/article/S2880-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
