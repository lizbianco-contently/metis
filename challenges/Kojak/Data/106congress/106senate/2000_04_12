Mr. President, I am going to begin my remarks. We had \noriginally intended for Senator Cleland to begin this dialog. But I am \ngoing to go ahead since he has been detained. Then he can follow me. I \ndo not think that is going to upset the order at all.\n  I thank my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, for \nthis continued initiative and for his leadership in continuing our \nbipartisan foreign policy dialog.\n  As I said back in February during our first discussion, our objective \nis to try to achieve greater attention, focus, and\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\nmutual understanding--not to mention a healthy dose of responsibility--\nin this body in regard to America's global role and our vital national \nsecurity interests. Our goal was to begin a process of building a \nbipartisan coalition, a consensus on what America's role should be in \ntoday's ever-changing, unsafe, and very unpredictable world.\n  This is our second dialog. We will focus today on how we can better \ndefine our vital national interests.\n  In doing our homework, both Senator Cleland and I have been doing a \nlot of reading and pouring over quite a few books and articles and \ncommentaries and reports and legislation and speeches and position \npapers and the like. If it was printed, we read it.\n  We have also been seeking the advice and counsel of everybody \ninvolved--in my case, the marine lance corporal about to deploy to \nKosovo, to the very serious and hollow-faced old gentleman I visited at \na Macedonian refugee camp, as well as foreign dignitaries and the \nmilitary brass we admire and listen to as members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and all of the current and former advisors and experts and \nthink tank dwellers and foreign policy gurus and intelligence experts. \nNeedless to say, our foreign policy and national security homework \nuniverse is ever expanding and apparently without end. I hope I didn't \nleave anybody out.\n  We both now have impressive bibliographies that we can wave around \nand put in the Record and we can recommend to our colleagues to prove \nthat our bibliography tank, as it were, is pretty full. We have very \nlittle or no excuse if we are not informed.\n  There was another book I wanted to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues. Its title is ``Going for the Max.'' It involves 12 \nprinciples for living life to the fullest, written by our colleague and \nmy dear friend, with a most appropriate and moving foreword from the \nSenate Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie. This is a very easy and enjoyable \nread with a very inspirational message.\n  Chapter 10 of Max's book states--and this is important--that success \nis a team effort, that coming together is a beginning, keeping together \nis progress, and working together is a success.\n  That is a pretty good model for our efforts today and a recipe for us \nto keep in mind in this body as we try to better fulfill our national \nsecurity obligations and to protect our individual freedoms.\n  Thank you and well done, to my distinguished friend.\n  Senator Cleland, in his remarks, will quote Owen Harries, editor of \nthe publication, the National Interest. He will point out the need for \nrestraint in regard to exercising our national power. Editor Harris \nwarned--and this is what Senator Cleland will say--\n\n       It is not what Americans think of the United States but \n     what others think of it that will decide the matter.\n\n  When we are talking about ``matter,'' the ``matter'' in this case is \nstability and successful foreign and national security policy. I could \nnot agree more. Senator Cleland will go on to quote numerous statements \nfrom foreign leaders and editorials from leading international \npublications and commentaries from respected observers around the \nglobe, from our allies and from the fence sitters and our would-be \nadversaries.\n  Sadly, I have to tell my colleagues that all were very critical of \nU.S. foreign policy. The basic thrust of the criticism, as described by \nSenator Cleland--and he will be saying this. Again, I apologize that I \nstarted first. In the order of things, we are sort of reversing this. I \nam giving him a promo, if that is okay. At any rate, Senator Cleland \nwill state:\n\n       The United States has made a conscious decision to use our \n     current position of predominance to pursue unilateralist \n     foreign and national security policies.\n\n  Senator Cleland is right. Dean Joseph S. Nye of the Kennedy School of \nGovernment and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nInternational Security Affairs warns about the CNN effect in the \nformulation and conduct of our foreign policy; the free flow of \ninformation and the shortened news cycles that have a huge impact on \npublic opinion, and placing some items at the top of the public agenda \nthat might otherwise warrant a lower priority; diverting attention from \nthe A list of strategic issues of vital national security. What am I \ntalking about? What does this criticism really suggest?\n\n  We need to take the spin off. We need to take off our rose-colored, \nhegemonic glasses and take a hard look at the world and what the world \nthinks of us. I have a suggestion. It would only take Senators 10 \nminutes a day. Every Member of the Senate can and should receive what \nare called ``Issue Focus Reports.'' These are reports on foreign media \nreaction to the world issues of the day. They are put out by the State \nDepartment. We at least should be aware of what others think of us and \nour foreign policy. Unfortunately and sadly, it is not flattering.\n  For instance, the February 24 Issue Focus detailed foreign commentary \nfrom publications within our NATO allies, those who comprised Operation \nAllied Force in Kosovo, headlines of 39 reports from 10 countries. If \nmy colleagues will bear with me a moment, these are some of the \nheadlines. This is the Issue Focus I am talking about. It is a very \nshort read. Senators could have that or could have this report at their \ndisposal every week. Again, these are leading publications--some \nliberal, some conservative, some supportive of the United States and \nsome not. Just as a catch-as-catch-can summary, listen to the \nheadlines:\n\n       Kosovo Unrest--A Domino Effect; Another War?; Wither \n     Kosovo?; Holding Back The Tide Of Ethnic Cleansing; Losing \n     The Peace; By The Waters of Mitrovica; West Won The War, But \n     Now Faces Losing The Peace; Holding Fast In The Kosovar Trap; \n     Speculation On U.S. Domination In The Balkans; Whoever \n     Believed In Multi-Ethnic Kosovo; Kosovo Calculations; The \n     U.S. Is Playing With Fire; The West Is Helpless In Kosovo; \n     Mitrovica, The Shadow Of The Wall Is Back; Military \n     Intervention Against Serbia A Mistake; U.S. and Europe Are \n     Also Clashing In Mitrovica; Kosovo Chaos Is A Trap For NATO; \n     A Failure That Burns; The Difficult Peace.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  This kind of reading would help us a great deal in understanding how \nothers really think of us. The March 24 Issue Focus, based on 49 \nreports from leading newspapers and publications in 24 countries, \nassessed the U.S. and NATO policy 1 year after Operation Allied Force \nin the bombing of Kosovo. Summed up, the articles conclude it is time \nto ask some hard questions. Some unsettling headlines--again, this is a \nwide variety of publications from all ideologies and the whole \npolitical spectrum:\n\n       A War With No Results; No End To The Kosovo Tragedy; \n     Europe's Leaders Warned Of A New Crisis; The West Fiasco In \n     Kosovo; Halfway Results; A Year Later: Where Do We Stand; A \n     Victory Gambled Away; No Sign Of Will For Peace; Making \n     Progress By Moving Backwards In The Balkans.\n\n  Again, it goes on and on.\n  I don't mean to suggest that we should base our foreign policy on \nforeign headlines or perceived perception with regard to criticism in \nforeign countries. If we take the spin off, I think a case can be made \nthat we are seeing a world backlash against U.S. foreign policy no \nmatter how well-intentioned.\n  A timely article last month by Tyler Marshall and Jim Mann of the Los \nAngeles Times summarized it very well when they said:\n\n       The nation's prominence as the world's sole superpower \n     leaves even allies very uneasy. They fear Washington--\n\n  By the way, I certainly include the Congress--\n\n       has lost its commitment to international order. America's \n     dominant shadow has long been welcomed in much of the world \n     as a shield from tyranny, a beacon of goodwill, an \n     inspiration of unique values. But, ten years after the \n     collapse of Communism left the United States to pursue its \n     interests without a world rival, that shadow is assuming a \n     darker character. In the State Department, it is called the \n     hegemony problem, a fancy way of describing the same \n     resentment that schoolchildren have for the biggest, \n     toughest, richest and smartest kid in school.\n\n  The Marshall and Mann article goes on to say that America is \nsuffering from a bad case of ``me first,'' that during the \nadministration years we have seen a lot of focus and it has been on new \nobjectives, pressing American commercial interests, the championing of \ndemocracy--certainly nothing wrong with that--and then the \nintervention, militarily, to protect human rights. They state the goals \nthat concern the foreign leaders are less than the manner in which they \nhave been pursued, a manner that appears inconsistent and\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nsporadic and capricious. The article cites very serious backlash. \nThirty-eight nations rallied to fight Iraq in 1991. Only Britain \nanswers to the call today. Today, the French--our oldest ally--along \nwith China, India, and Russia, have all discussed independently, or in \nconsultation, ways to counter the balance of the enormity of American \npower.\n  Japan is making plans to develop an independent military capability. \nIn Europe, pro-Americanism is on the wane. European leaders cut their \nteeth on the protests of the 1960s, not the American aid packages of \nthe 1950s. The situation in Russia is especially perilous with Russians \nseeing secondhand treatment--by their definition--with the U.S. in \nregard to their continued economic morass, NATO expansion, Kosovo, and \nthe American condemnation of Moscow's war against Chechnya.\n  Under the banner of the law of unintended effects, Washington Post \ncolumnist Charles Krauthammer opined the cost of our occupancy of \nBosnia and Kosovo which has already cost tens of billions of dollars, \ndrained our defense resources, and strained a hollow military which is \ncharged with protecting vital American strategic interests in such \ncrises areas as the Persian Gulf, the Taiwan Strait, and also the \nKorean peninsula. But he cited another cost, as he put it, more subtle \nand far heavier. He said that Russia has just moved from the \ndemocratically committed, if erratic, Boris Yeltsin to the dictatorship \nof the law, as promised by the new President, former KGB agent Vladimir \nPutin. I have his article. It is called ``The Path to Putin.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The Path to Putin\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       In late February, as the first anniversary of our \n     intervention in Kosovo approached, American peacekeepers \n     launched house-to-house raids in Mitrovica looking for \n     weapons. They encountered a rock-throwing mob and withdrew. \n     Such is our reward for our glorious little victory in the \n     Balkans: police work from which even Madeleine K. Albright, \n     architect of the war, admits there is no foreseeable escape. \n     (``The day may come,'' she wrote on Tuesday, ``when a Kosovo-\n     scale operation can be managed without the help of the United \n     States, but it has not come yet.'')\n       The price is high. Our occupations of Kosovo and Bosnia \n     have already cost tens of billions of dollars, draining our \n     defense resources and straining a military (already hollowed \n     out by huge defense cuts over the last decade) charged with \n     protecting vital American strategic interests in such crisis \n     areas as the Persian Gulf, the Taiwan Strait and the Korean \n     Peninsula.\n       But there is another cost, more subtle and far heavier. \n     Russia has just moved from the democratically committed, if \n     erratic, Boris Yeltsin to the ``dictatorship of the law'' \n     promised by the new president, former KGB agent Vladimir \n     Putin. Putin might turn out to be a democrat, but the man who \n     won the presidency by crushing Chechnya will more likely \n     continue as the national security policeman of all the \n     Russias.\n       What does that have to do with Kosovo? ``Without Kosovo, \n     Putin would not be Russian president today,'' says Dimitri \n     Simes, the Russia expert and president of the Nixon Center.\n       The path from Kosovo to Putin is not that difficult to \n     trace. It goes through Chechnya. Americans may not see the \n     connection, but Russians do.\n       Russians had long been suffering an ``Afghan-Chechen \n     syndrome'' under which they believed they could not prevail \n     in local conflicts purely by the use of force. Kosovo \n     demonstrated precisely the efficacy of raw force.\n       Russians had also been operating under the assumption that \n     to be a good international citizen they could not engage in \n     the unilateral use of force without the general approval of \n     the international community. Kosovo cured them of that \n     illusion.\n       And finally, Russia had acquiesced in the expansion of NATO \n     under the expectation and assurance that it would remain, as \n     always, a defensive alliance. Then, within 11 days of \n     incorporating Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, NATO \n     was launching its first extraterritorial war.\n       The Russians were doubly humiliated because the Balkans had \n     long been in their sphere of influences with Serbia as their \n     traditional ally. The result was intense anti-American, anti-\n     NATO feeling engendered in Russia. NATO expansion had \n     agitated Russian elites; Kosovo inflamed the Russian public.\n       Kosovo created in Russia what Simes calls a ``national \n     security consensus:'' the demand for a strong leader to do \n     what it takes to restore Russia's standing and status. And it \n     made confrontation with the United States a badge of honor.\n       The dash to Pristina airport by Russian troops under the \n     noses of the allies as they entered Kosovo was an unserious \n     way of issuing the challenge. But the support this little \n     adventure enjoyed at home showed Russian leaders the power of \n     the new nationalism.\n       The first Russian beneficiary of Kosovo was then-Prime \n     Minister Yevgeny Primakov. But it was Prime Minister Putin \n     who understood how to fully exploit it. Applying the lessons \n     of Kosovo, he seized upon Chechen provocations into \n     neighboring Dagestan to launch his merciless war on Chechnya. \n     It earned him enormous popularity and ultimately the \n     presidency.\n       One of Putin's first promises is to rebuild Russia's \n     military-industrial complex. We are now saddled with him for \n     four years, probably longer, much longer.\n       The Clinton administration has a congenital inability to \n     distinguish forest from trees. It obsesses over paper \n     agreements, such as the chemical weapons treaty, which will \n     not advance to American interests one iota. It expends \n     enormous effort on Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo, places \n     of (at best) the most peripheral interest to the United \n     States. And it lets the big ones slip away.\n       Saddam Hussein is back building his weapons of mass \n     destruction. China's threats to Taiwan grow. The American \n     military is badly stretched by far-flung commitments in \n     places of insignificance. Most important of all, Russia, on \n     whose destiny and direction hinge the future of Eastern \n     Europe and the Caspian Basin, has come under the sway of a \n     cold-eyed cop, destroyer of Chechnya and heir to Yuri \n     Andropov, the last KGB graduate to rule Russia.\n       Such is the price of the blinkered do-goodism of this \n     administration. We will be paying the price far into the \n     next.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Charles Krauthammer points out in the article--and I \nwill read a little of it--that, basically, what the Russians thought \nwas the path from Kosovo to Putin is not that difficult to trace. It \ngoes through Chechnya.\n  Americans may not see the connection, but the Russians do. The \nRussians have been operating under the assumption that to be a good \ninternational citizen, they could not engage in the unilateral use of \nforce without the general approval of the international community. \nWell, Kosovo certainly cured them of that illusion. Finally, Russia \nacquiesced in the expansion of NATO under the expectation and assurance \nthat it would remain always a defensive alliance. I am not arguing the \npros and cons of that, but simply the reaction in Russia. Russians were \ndoubly humiliated because the Balkans had long been in their sphere of \ninfluence, with Serbia as their traditional ally. The result was an \nintense anti-American, anti-NATO feeling engendered in Russia, and NATO \nexpansion had really agitated the Russian elites, and Kosovo inflamed \nthe Russian public.\n  So Kosovo created what has been called a national security consensus. \nThe demand for a strong leader to do what it takes to restore Russia's \nstanding and status made the confrontation with the United States a \nbadge of honor. I will tell you, in going to Moscow and talking with \nRussian leaders regarding the very important cooperative threat \nreduction programs that happened to come under the jurisdiction of my \nsubcommittee, you get a lecture on Kosovo for a half hour even before \nyou have a cup of coffee. So this article has some merit.\n  In regard to Mr. Krauthammer's article:\n\n       The first Russian beneficiary of Kosovo was then-Prime \n     Minister Primakov. But it was Prime Minister Putin who \n     understood how to fully exploit it. Applying the lessons of \n     Kosovo, he seized upon the Chechen provocations into \n     neighboring Dagestan to launch his merciless war on Chechnya. \n     It earned him enormous popularity and ultimately the \n     presidency.\n       We are now saddled with him for four years, probably \n     longer, much longer.\n\n  We hope the man without a face--which is how some describe Putin--we \nhope we can work with him and build a positive relationship. I think \nunder the law of unintended effects, this is a good example.\n  In China, obviously, the political wounds fester in the wake of the \nU.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade; the Taiwan issue, \ncharges of espionage, and the criticism of human rights; and continued \ncontroversy over whether or not Congress will approve a trading status \nthat will result in the U.S. simply taking advantage of trade \nconcessions that the Chinese have made to us.\n  In Latin America, the lack of a so-called fast-track authority and \nU.S. trade policy is muddled. You can drive south into Central America \nand into trade relations with our competitors in the European Union. My \nfriend from\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\nNebraska, Senator Hagel, who will join us in about an hour, put it this \nway:\n\n       It worries me, first, because most of us are not really \n     picking this up on our radar--this sense that we don't care \n     about what our trading partners or allies think. It is going \n     to come back and snap us in some ways. It will be very bad \n     for this country.\n\n  Well, the criticism from the Marshall and Mann article becomes very \nharsh when they cite why the U.S. has become so aloof. I am quoting \nhere:\n\n       * * * a President who engages only episodically on \n     international issues and too often has failed to use either \n     the personal prestige or the power of his office to pursue \n     key foreign policy goals. * * * a Congress that cares little \n     about foreign affairs in the wake of the Cold War and seems \n     to understand even less. * * * a poisonous relationship \n     between the two branches of our Government putting \n     partisanship over national interests * * * an American \n     public inattentive to world affairs and confused by all of \n     the partisan backbiting now that the principal reference \n     point--the evil of communism--has all but vanished as a \n     major threat.\n\n  Indeed, that is a pretty harsh assessment. Aside from all the \ncriticism and 20/20 hindsight--and it is easy to do that, trying to \nchart a well-defined foreign policy course is more complicated and \ndifficult today than ever before. Both Senator Cleland and I understand \nthat. As chairman of the newly created Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it \nseems as if we have a new emerging threat at our doorstep almost every \nday. I am talking about the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, rogue nations, ethnic wars, drugs, and terrorism.\n  Concluding our second hearing on the subcommittee this session, and \nagain asking the experts, ``What keeps you up at night?'' the answer \ncame back: ``Cyber attacks and biological attacks'' from virtually any \nkind of source, and the bottom line was not if, but when.\n  So it is not easy, but if we are worried about proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, we should also be worried about the \nproliferation of overall foreign policy roles, not to mention the role \nthe U.S. should play in the world today.\n  Some may say events of the day will determine our strategy on a case-\nby-case basis. That seems to be the case. But I say that is a dangerous \npath, as evidenced by adversaries that did not or will not believe we \nhave the will to respond.\n  Former National Security Adviser, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, put it this \nway in a speech at the Brookings Institution National Forum, and he \nsaid this in response to some questions:\n\n       The nature of our approach to foreign policy also changed \n     from, I would say, from foreign policy as a continuing focus \n     of the United States, which it had been for the 50 years of \n     the Cold War, to an episodic attention on the part of the \n     United States, and thus without much of a theme, and further \n     to that, a foreign policy whose decisions were heavily \n     influenced by polls, by what was popular back home or what \n     was assumed to be popular.\n\n  General Scowcroft went on to say:\n\n       So at a period when we should have been focusing on \n     structures to improve the possibility that we could actually \n     make some changes in the way the world operated, and some \n     improvements, we have frittered away the time. I think never \n     has history left us such a clean slate as we had in 1991. And \n     we have not taken advantage of it.\n       One point on looking ahead from here. I think we have begun \n     engaging on a fundamental transformation of the international \n     system with insufficient thought.\n       We, NATO, President Clinton, the U.N. Secretary General, \n     are moving to replace the Treaty of Westphalia, replacing the \n     notion of the sovereignty of the nation-state with what I \n     would call the sovereignty of the individual and \n     humanitarianism. That is a profound change in the way the \n     world operates. And we're doing it with very little analysis \n     of what it is we're about and how we want this to turn out.\n\n  Evidenced by the Charles Krauthammer article.\n  Again I quote from the general:\n\n       In Kosovo, just for example, we conducted a devastating \n     bombing of a country in an attempt to protect a minority \n     within that country. And, as a result, we're now presiding \n     over reverse ethnic cleansing. What's the difference between \n     Kosovo and Chechnya?\n\n  That is a question not many of us want to ponder.\n\n       How many people must be placed in jeopardy to warrant an \n     invasion of sovereignty? Where? By whom? How does one set \n     priorities among these kind of crises?\n\n  And, events of the day, again dominated by the so-called CNN effect, \nignore the same kind of core questions posed by General Scowcroft and \nreflected again in an article by Doyle McManus the Washington Bureau \nChief of the Los Angeles Times: When should the United States use \nmilitary power?\n  President Clinton has argued in the Clinton Doctrine that Americans \nshould intervene wherever U.S. power can protect ethnic minorities from \ngenocide. I would add a later UN speech seemed to indicate a backing \noff from that position.\n  How will the United States deal with China and Russia, the two great \npotentially hostile powers?\n  What is the biggest threat to our nation's security and how should \nthe U.S. respond? Weapons of mass destruction head the list of course, \nbut the President has added in terrorism, disease, poverty, disorder to \nthe list.\n  I know about the Strategic Concept of NATO, when that was passed \nduring the 50-year anniversary last spring in Washington. Those of us \nwho read the Strategic Concept and all of the missions that entailed--\nmoving away from a collective defense--we were concerned about that. We \nasked for a report as to whether that obligated the United States to \nall of these missions.\n  Finally, we received a report from the administration of about three \npages. The report said we are not obligated and not responsible. If we \nare not responsible for the Strategic Concept of NATO, what are we \ndoing adopting it?\n  When the U.S. acts, should it wait for the approval of the United \nNations, seek the approval of our allies, or strike out on its own?\n  However, my colleagues, the biggest question remains and it was \ndefined well by retired Air Force Brigadier General David Herrelko who \nwrote in the Dayton Daily News recently:\n  ``The United States needs to get a grip on what our national \ninterests are, what we stand for and what we can reasonably do in the \nworld before we can size our military forces and before we send them in \nharms way. We must hammer out, in a public forum, just what our \nnational priorities are.'' He says, and I agree, we cannot continue \nadrift. Consider this retired military man's following points:\n\n       More Americans have died in peacekeeping operations \n     (Lebanon, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia) than in military actions \n     (Iraq, Panama, Grenada and Yugoslavia).\n       We have a president seeking United Nations approval for \n     military intervention but skipping the dialogue with \n     Congress.\n\n  I might add, the Congress skips the dialog with the President.\n\n       We commit our military forces before we clearly state our \n     objectives.\n       We gradually escalate hostilities and we leave standing \n     forces behind.\n       Some 7,000 now in Kosovo, and the peacekeepers. When there \n     was no peace, they became the target.\n\n  General Herrelko ends his article with a plea: ``We are starved for \nmeaningful dialogue between the White House and the Congress.''\n  I agree Mr. President and would add we are starved for dialogue here \nin the Senate as well and that is why we are here.\n  And, as Senator Cleland has pointed out, our goal is not to achieve \nunanimity on each and every issue but to at least contribute to an \neffort to focus attention on our challenges instead of reacting \npiecemeal as events of the day take place.\n  And, goodness knows even if the foreign policy stadium is not full of \ninterested spectators, we do have quite an array of players. LA Times \nBureau Chief McManus has his own program:\n\n       Humanitarian interventionists, mostly Democrats and \n     President Clinton with Kosovo being the prime example. \n     Nationalist interventionists, mostly Republicans who would \n     intervene in defense of democracy, trade and military \n     security.\n       Realists, both Republicans and Democrats\n\n  I think Senator Cleland would be in that category.\n\n     skeptical about intervention but wanting the United States to \n     block any concert of hostile powers.\n       Minimalists, those who think the United States should stay \n     out of foreign entanglements and quarrels and save its \n     strengths for major conflicts.\n\n  Richard Haass, former foreign policy advisor in the Bush \nadministration and now with the Brookings Institution, has defined the \nplayers in the foreign\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\npolicy program much along the same lines as Senator Cleland did in his \nopening remarks during our first forum last month:\n\n       Wilsonians who wish to assist other countries achieve \n     democracy;\n       Economists, who wish to promote trade, prosperity and free \n     markets;\n       Realists, who wish to preserve an orderly balance of power \n     without worrying too much what kind of states are doing the \n     balancing;\n       Hegemonists who want to make sure the United States keeps \n     its status as the only superpower;\n       Humanitarians, who wish to address oppression, poverty, \n     hunger and environmental damage;\n       And, Minimalists, who wish to avoid spending time or tax \n     dollars on any of these matters.\n\n  I'm not sure of any of my colleagues would want to be identified or \ncharacterized in any one of these categories but again the key question \nis whether or not the members of this foreign policy posse can ride in \none direction and better define our vital national interests and from \nthat definition establish priorities and a national strategy to achieve \nthem.\n  Fortunately, as Senator Cleland has pointed out, some very \ndistinguished and experienced national security and foreign policy \nleaders have already provided several road maps that make a great deal \nof sense. What does not make a great deal of sense is that few are \npaying attention.\n  Lawrence Korb, Director of Studies of the Council on Foreign \nRelations, in a military analysis published in a publication called \n``Great Decisions'' has focused on the Powell Doctrine named after \nretired Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell, citing the dangers of \nmilitary engagement and the need to limit commitments to absolutely \nvital national interests. On the other hand, the sweeping Clinton \nDoctrine emphasizes a global policing role for the United States.\n  How do we reconcile these two approaches?\n  I am not sure there is only one yellow brick foreign policy road but \nthere are several good alternatives that have been suggested:\n  First, I am going to refer to what I call the ``Old Testament'' on \nforeign policy in terms of vital national interests. This is the \nCommission on America's National Interests, 1996.\n  Second, a national security strategy for a new century put out by the \nWhite House this past December. If you are being critical, or \nsuggesting, or if you have a different approach than the current \npolicy, as I have been during my remarks, you have an obligation to \nread this. The White House put this out as of December of 1999.\n  Third, adapting U.S. Defense to Future Needs by Ashton Carter former \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Security in the first \nClinton administration and currently professor of science and \ninternational affairs at Harvard.\n  We had him testify to this before the Emerging Threats Subcommittee \njust a month ago.\n  Fourth, defining U.S. National Strategy by Kim Holmes and Jon Hillen \nof the Heritage Foundation, a detailed summary of threats confronting \nus today with appropriate commentary about their priorities.\n  Fifth, transforming American Alliances by Andrew Krepinevvitch of the \nCenter for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.\n  He has been of real help to us in regard to the Emerging Threats \nsubcommittee, and also the full Committee on Armed Services.\n  Sixth, a highly recommended article ``Back to Basics: U.S. Foreign \nPolicy for the Coming Decade,'' by James E. Goodby, a senior fellow at \nthe Brookings Institution and former Ambassador to Finland and Kenneth \nWisebrode, Director of the International Security Program at the \nAtlantic Council of the United States.\n  In this regard, Messrs. Goodby and Weisbrode have summarized the \nconcerns of Senator Cleland and myself very well when they said:\n\n       The most common error of policymakers is to fail to \n     distinguish among our levels of interest, leading to an over \n     commitment to higher level interests. In other words, \n     strategic or second tier interests, if mishandled, can \n     threaten vital interests. But, strategic interests, if well \n     understood and acted upon, can support vital interests.\n\n  Goodby and Weisbrode do us a favor by following the example of others \nin prioritizing our vital national security interests:\n  First and vital, homeland defense from threats to well being and way \nof life of the American people. I can't imagine anyone would have any \nquarrel with that.\n\n  Second and strategic, I am talking about peace and stability in \nEurope and northeast Asia and open access to our energy supplies.\n  Third, and of lesser interest, although it is of interest, stability \nin South Asia, Latin America, Africa, and open markets favorable to the \nUnited States and to world prosperity.\n  The authors suggest how to accomplish these goals with what they call \nthree essential pieces of foreign policy balance:\n  First, stability and cohesion in Europe and between the European \nUnion and the United States; second, mature and effective relations \namong China, Russia, and the West to include first among all others, a \nregular forum to oversee the reduction of the risk of nuclear weapons; \nand third, systematic patterns of consultation and policy coordination \nof the States benefiting from the global economy and positive relations \nbetween those States and the developing world.\n  The authors also suggest the means to their ends by looking ahead and \nstressing the need for eventual NATO and Russian cooperation and \nstability, the need for a similar organization and effort between the \nUnited States and China, Japan, Russia, and Korea, and lastly, American \nsupport for the United Nations.\n  In a self-acknowledged understatement, they state this is going to be \na hard and tedious task. This is not easy. But it is absolutely \nnecessary.\n  Now, Mr. Goodby and Mr. Weisbrode are not critical per se, but they \nissue a warning and this is what we are trying to bring to the \nattention of the Senate. It is central to what Senator Cleland and I \nare trying to accomplish with these foreign policy and national \nsecurity dialogs.\n\n       The public perception and the private reality suggest \n     worrisome disorganization and a certain degree of impatience \n     with a foggy conceptual foreign policy framework. It is time \n     to return to the basic elements of the American role in the \n     world and to raise the public understanding of them.\n       American strategic planners and policymakers cannot afford \n     to be arbitrarily selective about where and when to engage \n     U.S. power. This would make our foreign policy aimless and \n     lose the support of the American people.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       We should set out each of America's interests and how they \n     best may be achieved with the cooperation of other powers. \n     However, this cannot take place until the executive and \n     legislative branches of government resurrect the workable \n     partnership in foreign affairs that once existed but exists \n     no more.\n\n  And Senator Cleland, my colleagues, that is why we are here today and \nthat is why we are involved in this forum. In my personal view, we are \nstarved for meaningful foreign policy and national security dialog \nbetween the White House and the Congress and within the Congress. The \nstakes are high.\n  I recall well the meeting in Senator Cleland's office between Senator \nCleland, myself, and Senator Snowe, worried about our involvement in \nthe Balkans. I had an amendment, we had an amendment; we passed both \namendments, setting out guidelines that the administration would \nrespond, saying that before we spend money in regard to the defense \nappropriations or in the authorization bill, hopefully we can establish \na better dialog, trying to figure out what our role was in regard to \nour constitutional responsibilities, I say to my good friend, without \nhaving to come to the floor with appropriations bills and have an \namendment and say you can't spend the money for this until you explain \nthis. That is no way to operate.\n  It seems to me we can do a much better job. The stakes are high.\n  As Carl Sandberg wrote of Americans: Always there arose enough \nreserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry \nthe Nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality.\n  I hope this dialog and these discussions, all of the priority \nrecommendations we have had from experts in the field, will help us \nbegin that fresh start. We cannot afford to do otherwise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart that \noutlines and prioritizes the vital national\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nsecurity interests of the United States as recommended by the many \nexperts and organizations I have discussed earlier in my remarks. This \nchart was prepared by Maj. Scott Kindsvater, an outstanding pilot in \nthe U.S. Air Force and a congressional fellow in my office.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                             DEFINING U.S. NATIONAL INTEREST\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Source                          Vital Interests                        Important Interests                        Other Interests\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n``A National Security Strategy  1.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I cannot express strongly enough what an \nhonor it is to be on the floor of the Senate and listen to my \ndistinguished colleague talk about the need for a meaningful dialog on \na subject that often gets put down at the bottom of the list when it \ncomes to public issues. I am reminded of a line from one of \nWellington's troops after the battle at Waterloo, after the battle was \nwon, that in time of war, and not before, God of the soldier, men \nadore; but in time of peace, with all things righted, God is forgotten \nand the soldier slighted.\n  Unfortunately, I think my dear colleague, Senator Pat Roberts, and I \nhave sensed that the vital interests of the United States, the \ninterests that cause us to go to war, the interests that compel us to \nfight for our vital national interests, these basic fundamental \nprinciples have been lost in the shuffle. Somehow they have been \nslighted and somehow the issue of foreign policy and defense has been \nshoved to the background. We have lost sight of the basis of who we are \nand what we are about as we go into the 21st century, which is why we \nhave tried through this dialog to call attention to this issue.\n  We have some wonderful colleagues joining in our dialog, including my \nfellow Vietnam veteran, Senator Kerrey, and Senator Hagel, as well as \nSenator Hutchinson and Senator Kyl.\n  For a few weeks, I wondered whether I was a little bit out of touch \nand wondered whether or not this dialog on American foreign policy and \nglobal reach was something that was out of touch with what was going on \nin the world. I went back home the last few days and in my own hometown \npaper in Atlanta I came across an article, a New York Times piece, \nAnti-Americanism Growing Across Europe.\n  Hello. Good morning. I realized that what I was seeing in a daily \nnewspaper was what I was attempting to engage here in terms of a \nperspective on our global reach, a sense that we were overcommitted in \nthe world and yet underfunded, a sense of mismatch between our ends and \nour means to achieve those ends. I realized we really were on target.\n  In my State, we say that even a blind hog can root up an acorn every \nnow and then. I think my distinguished colleague and I from Kansas have \nrooted up an acorn.\n  We are on to something. That is a reason why I am strengthened in \npursuing this dialog, and I am delighted we will have additional \nSenators entering into this dialog because unless we ourselves begin to \ndefine who we are as a nation, what we want out of our role as a \nnation, and where we want to go and how we exercise our power, unless \nwe decide it, it will occur by happenstance. We will move from crisis \nto crisis. We will not have a plan and we will end up in places in the \nworld where we know not of what we speak.\n  One of the quotes I have come across, one of the lines that continues \nto reinforce my view of my own concern and caution about America's \nexpanded role in the world, is from our first dialog back in February \nwhen Owen Harries, editor of the National Interests, summed up his \nviews on the appropriate approach for the United States in today's \nworld with the following comments: I advocate restraint because every \ndominant power in the last four centuries that has not practiced it, \nthat has been excessively intrusive and demanding, has ultimately been \nconfronted by a hostile coalition of other powers. Americans may \nbelieve that their country, being exceptional, need have no worries in \nthis respect. I do not agree. It is not what Americans think of the \nUnited States but what others think of it that will decide the \nmatter. Anti-Americanism is growing across Europe. The distinguished \nSenator from Kansas has accumulated, in a shocking way, some headlines \nfrom 40 or 50 newspapers among our allies and our friends, questioning \nour role, particularly in the Balkans, but questioning our exercise of \npower, as it were.\n\n  The foreign perspective is not one to which we generally devote much \nattention in the Congress, certainly after the cold war is over, but \nour attention to foreign affairs has been slight. We do not really \ndevote much attention to foreign affairs and consideration of our \nforeign policy options unless we are threatened.\n  I am delighted Senator Roberts is sitting as the chairman of the \nEmerging Threats Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee. He has \nhis\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\neye on the ball, certainly an emerging ball in terms of threats to our \ncountry. I think the overall threat is that we do not realize one could \noccur now that the cold war is over.\n  I think, also, one of the emerging threats, from my point of view, is \nthat we will overcommit and overexpand and overreact and, instead of \nbeing only a superpower working with others and sharing power, we will \nwind up imposing--by default, almost, in the power vacuums around the \nworld--a pax Americana that cannot be sustained by the will of the \npeople in this country--again, a mismatch between means and ends.\n  But it is important, as Mr. Harries suggests, to focus on this issue.\n  I have spent some time, over recent months, as has the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, reviewing what foreign opinion makers and leaders \nare saying about the United States. While we may think, as I do, that \nour country has not made a clear choice about our global role, the view \nfrom abroad is very different. Many people think we have chosen the \npath we are now on.\n  A Ukrainian commentator, in the Kiev newspaper Zerkalo Nedeli, wrote \nin April of last year:\n\n       Currently, two opinions are possible in the world-- the \n     U.S. opinion and the wrong opinion. . . .\n\n  He said the U.S.\n\n       . . . has announced its readiness to act as it thinks best, \n     should U.S. interests require this, despite the United \n     Nations. And let those whose interests are violated think \n     about it and draw conclusions. This is the current world \n     order or world disorder.\n\n  That, from Kiev.\n  The influential Times of India editorialized in July of last year:\n\n       New Delhi should not lose sight of the kind of global order \n     the U.S. is fashioning. NATO's policies towards Yugoslavia \n     and the U.S.-led military alliance's new Strategic Concept \n     are based on the degradation of international law and a more \n     muscular approach to intervention. Such a trend is certainly \n     not in India's interest.\n\n  So India has concluded: Why don't we go it alone? Why don't we \ndevelop ourselves as a nuclear power?\n  The President of Brazil was quoted on April 22 of last year in an \ninterview with a Sao Paulo newspaper as to his views about the United \nStates: While President Cardoso was generally sympathetic to the United \nStates and supportive of good bilateral relations between our two \ncountries, the President of Brazil nonetheless expressed certain \nmisgivings about our approach to international relations.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The United States currently constitutes the only large \n     center of political, economic, technologic, and even cultural \n     power. This country has everything to exert its domain on the \n     rest of the world, but it must share it. There must be rules, \n     even for the stronger ones. When the strongest one makes \n     decisions without listening, everything becomes a bit more \n     difficult. In this European war, NATO made the decision, but \n     who legalized it? That's the main problem. I am convinced \n     more than ever that we need a new political order in the \n     world.\n\n  I think I am correct that Jack Kennedy once indicated we would seek a \nworld where the strong are just and the weak preserved. Because we are \nstrong now, I think we have to have an inordinate sense of being just. \nBut these are all voices from countries that have not traditionally \nbeen close to the United States. Let's look, then, at some of our NATO \nallies, nations with whom we presumably share the closest relationships \nand common interests.\n  In a commentary from February of last year in Berlin's Die \nTageszeitung, a German writer observes:\n\n       There is a growing number of people with more and more \n     prominent protagonists who are at odds with American \n     supremacy and who are inclined to see the action of the State \n     Department as a policy of interests. And Washington is \n     offering no reason to deny the justification of these \n     reservations. As unilateral as possible and as multilateral \n     as necessary--that's the explicit maxim under which U.S. \n     President Bill Clinton has pursued his foreign and defense \n     policies in the last 2 years.\n\n  From Italy, an Italian general expressed the following view in the \nDecember 1999 edition of the Italian geopolitical quarterly LiMes:\n\n       The condition all the NATO countries as a whole find \n     themselves in is closer to the condition of vassalage with \n     respect to the United States than it is to the condition of \n     alliance. NATO is not able to influence the policy of the \n     United States because its existence in effect depends on it. \n     No member countries are able to resist the American pressures \n     because their own resources are officially at the disposal of \n     everybody and not just the United States.\n\n  What evidence do our foreign friends cite for such concerns? The \ninfluential left-of-center Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad wrote last \nOctober:\n\n       The U.S. Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty does not just represent a heavy defeat for President \n     Clinton. Far more important are the consequences for world \n     order of treaties designed to stop the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and hence boost world security. . \n     . .\n\n  According to this newspaper in the Netherlands:\n\n       Unfortunately, the decision fits in with a growing tendency \n     on the part of U.S. foreign policy to place greater emphasis \n     on the United States' own room for maneuver and less on \n     international cooperation and traditional idealism.\n\n  In a similar vein, the Times of London carried a commentary last \nNovember. It said:\n\n       The real fear is of an American retreat, not to \n     isolationism, but to unilateralism, exacerbated at present by \n     the post-impeachment weakness of President Clinton and his \n     standoff with the Republican Congress. That's shown by the \n     Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \n     the stalling of free trade initiatives, and the refusal to \n     pay arrears to the United Nations. The U.S. is seen as \n     wayward and inward-looking.\n\n  While there are some exceptions, the majority of statements I looked \nat expressed the view the United States has indeed made the conscious \ndecision to use our current position of predominance to pursue \nunilateralist foreign and national security policy.\n  When I first came to Washington 30-some-odd years ago as a young \nintern, I found out there could not be a conspiracy here. We are not \nthat well organized. There cannot be a unilateralist conspiracy in the \nworld by the United States--we are not that well organized. What has \nevolved is a sense in which we have moved from crisis to crisis and \nlooked at power vacuums and said, ``We need to be there.''\n  I like the notion that General Shelton has about the use of American \nmilitary power. He says:\n\n       We've got a great hammer, but not every problem in the \n     world is a nail.\n\n  I do like President Kennedy's insight, too, that there is not \nnecessarily an American solution for every problem in the world.\n  Yet we act as if there is. If one looks at the outcomes of recent \nAmerican foreign policy debates, it is easy to see how those viewing us \nfrom a distance might come to such a conclusion. Since I have come to \nthe Senate, the U.S. Government through the combined efforts of the \nexecutive and the legislative branches--what are, relatively speaking, \nnondiscussions, I might add--has made the following decisions: Withheld \nsupport from the international landmines treaty; rejected jurisdiction \nby the new international criminal court; been slow to pay off long \noverdue arrears to the United Nations; rejected the current \napplicability of international emissions standards set at Kyoto; \nrejected fast-track international trade negotiating authority for the \nPresident; rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, apparently \ncommitted to a national missile defense system which will violate the \nABM Treaty; and established a principle of ``humanitarian \nintervention'' where national sovereignty can be violated without \nUnited Nations sanction under certain circumstances.\n  My purpose here is not to argue for or against any of these \nindividual positions; for, indeed, I have supported some of them as, \nindeed, have virtually every Member of the Congress and the \nadministration. But, as far as I know, not one of us has supported them \nall.\n  If the Republican congressional majority has been largely responsible \nfor the actions rejecting multilateral commitments and entanglements in \nthe national security sphere, it is my party, the Democrats, who has \ntaken the lead in opposing international trade obligations, and the \nDemocratic administration which has espoused the cause of humanitarian \ninterventions in violation of national sovereignty. In short, the sum \ntotal of our actions has been far more unilateral than any of us would \nhave intended or carved out for ourselves.\n  This is relatively incoherent, and I can see why other nations might \nview us as more organized than we are.\n  It is also very damaging to our national interest and is one of the \nmajor motives for our efforts to promote this development of a \nbipartisan consensus\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nthrough these floor debates. We have to get back to some basic \nunderstanding of who we are and what we are doing in the world.\n\n  As was discussed in our first dialog, there are certainly some \nleading voices among America's foreign policy thinkers who do, indeed, \nadvocate a unilateralist course for America in the post-cold-war era, \nbut not even that group actually believes we have actually embarked \nupon that course. Very few believe we are willing to invest sufficient \nresources today to even pursue the somewhat less demanding \nmultilateralist approach which seems to have more support among our \nforeign policy establishment.\n  The direct danger to America from this mismatch between means and \nends, between our commitments and our forces, between our aspirations \nand our willingness to pay to achieve them is one of the central \nconcerns for our discussion today and one I will turn to later. \nHowever, I want to conclude these opening remarks with an observation \nabout indirect consequences of this situation with respect to the \ncredibility of American foreign policy abroad.\n  The chief of the research department of the Japanese Defense Agency's \nNational Institute for Defense Studies wrote in March of last year:\n\n       (O)pinion surveys in the United States show that people are \n     inclined to think that the United States should bear as \n     little burdens as possible even though the country should \n     remain the leader in the world. This thinking that the United \n     States should be the world's leader but should not bear too \n     much financial burden may be contradictory in context, but is \n     popular among Americans. This serves as a warning to the \n     international community that the United States might get at \n     first involved in some international operations but run away \n     later in the middle of the operations, leaving things \n     unfinished.\n\n  Because we do not have a comprehensive strategy, because we do not \ntalk to each other enough, because we do not have a proper dialog, \nparticularly in this body, and because we move from crisis to crisis in \nour foreign policy and come up with different solutions for different \nsituations without a clear understanding of who we are and where we are \ngoing, we are sending a mixed message to even our best friends.\n  To me, the case is clear: If we are to avoid misunderstandings at \nhome and abroad, if we are to prevent unwanted and unintended \nconclusions and consequences, as the distinguished Senator from Kansas \nmentioned, about our objectives, we have to pull together and forge a \ncoherent, bipartisan consensus to guide our country in the uncertain \nwaters of the 21st century. Those who came before us and built this \ncountry into the grand land it is today, and those who will inherit it \nfrom us in the years ahead deserve no less.\n  I am honored to yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Parliamentary inquiry: I believe I have 1 hour reserved \nin morning business and that the distinguished Senator from Georgia has \n1 hour; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours under the control of both \nSenators.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I inform my colleagues that Senator Hutchison of Texas \nand Senator Hagel will be taking part, and I think perhaps Senator \nKerrey will be coming to the floor. Senator Hagel will be arriving in \nabout 9 minutes. If my distinguished colleague wants to summarize any \nother comments or perhaps go over the Commission on America's National \nInterests, I think now is the time to do so, if he is prepared to do \nthat.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to add some additional comments, \nif that is all right with my distinguished colleague.\n  Earlier, I spoke about the mismatch between the goals of American \nforeign policy and the means we employ in achieving them. Whether one \nespouses a unilateralist or multilateralist approach, or something in \nbetween, most of those with a strong interest in American foreign \npolicy have major goals for that policy, whether in preventing the \nemergence of global rivals or in promoting the spread of democracy, \nwhether in halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction or in \nprotecting human rights. Yet today we devote a little over 1 percent of \nthe Federal budget for international affairs, compared to over 5 \npercent in 1962 in the middle of the cold war.\n  Of particular concern to me as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, since the 1980s we have gone from providing roughly 25 \npercent of the budget for national defense to 18 percent today. We have \nreduced the active-duty armed forces by over one-third but have \nincreased overseas deployments by more than 300 percent. I have often \nsaid we have, as a country, both feet firmly planted on a banana peel. \nWe are going in opposite directions. That cannot last. We have a \nmismatch between our commitments and our willingness to live up to \nthose commitments. We are sending a mixed message abroad.\n  What is the result of all of this? Newspapers reported that last \nNovember, for the first time in a number of years, the U.S. Army rated \n2 of its 10 divisions as unprepared for war. Why were they unprepared \nfor war? Because they were bogged down in the Balkans. That was never \npart of the deal going into the Balkans, that an entire U.S. Army \ndivision would be there for an indefinite period of time. No wonder \nthese other two divisions were unprepared for war because they had \nelements in the Balkans doing something else--not fighting a war, but \npeacekeeping missions.\n  The services continue to struggle in meeting both retention and \nrecruiting goals, and the service members and their families with whom \nI meet and who are on the front lines in carrying out the policies \ndecided in Washington are showing the visible strains of this mismatch \nbetween our commitments and our resources. They deserve better from us.\n  I hope other Senators had an opportunity to watch Senator Roberts' \ndiscussion of our national interests during our February 24 dialog. If \nnot, I commend my colleagues' attention to those remarks as printed in \nthe Congressional Record of that date.\n  In brief, he stated the opinion, which I share, that in the post-\ncold-war world, our country has had a hard time in prioritizing our \nnational interests, leading to confusion and inconsistency. He went on \nto cite the July 1996 report by the Commission on America's National \nInterests, of which he was a member, along with our colleagues Senators \nJohn McCain and Bob Graham and my distinguished predecessor, Sam Nunn.\n  Of particular relevance to our topic today of defining and defending \nour national interests, the Commission found:\n\n       For the decades ahead, the only sound foundation for a \n     coherent, sustainable American foreign policy is a clear \n     public sense of American national interests. Only a national-\n     interest-based foreign policy will provide priorities for \n     American engagement in the world. Only a foreign policy \n     grounded in American national interests will allow America's \n     leaders to explain persuasively how and why specific \n     expenditures of American treasure or blood deserve support \n     from America's citizens.\n\n  As my colleagues will note from the charts I have, the Commission \nwent on to divide our national interests into four categories. They \ndefined ``vital interests'' as those:\n\n       Strictly necessary to safeguard and enhance the well-being \n     of Americans in a free and secure nation.\n\n  And as Senator Roberts has discussed, and you can see on the chart, \nthey found only five items which reached that high standard.\n  In addition to attempting to identify our national interests, the \ncommission also addressed the key issue of what we should be prepared \nto do to defend those interests:\n\n       For ``vital'' national interests, the United States should \n     be prepared to commit itself to fight, even if it has to do \n     so unilaterally and without the assistance of allies.\n\n  But there is a lower priority than that.\n  Next in priority come ``extremely important interests''--these are \nnot vital; but they are extremely important--defined as those which:\n\n       . . . would severely prejudice but not strictly imperil the \n     ability of the U.S. Government to safeguard and enhance the \n     well-being of Americans in a free and secure nation--\n\n  And for which:\n     the United States should be prepared to commit forces to meet \n     threats and to lead a coalition of forces, but only in \n     conjunction with a coalition or allies whose vital interests \n     are threatened.\n\n  Next, third, we have another set of interests. These are called \n``just important interests.'' They are not vital, not\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nnecessary. These are important, which would have major negative \nconsequences:\n\n       The United States should be prepared to participate \n     militarily, on a case-by-case basis, but only if the costs \n     are low or others carry the lion's share of the burden.\n\n  Finally, last, comes the most numerous but lowest priority category \nof ``less important or secondary interests,'' which:\n\n       Are intrinsically desirable but that have no major effect \n     on the ability of the U.S. government to safeguard and \n     enhance the well-being of Americans in a free and secure \n     nation.\n\n  My colleagues in the Senate, this is exactly the kind of exercise--of \ndefining and differentiating our national interests, and of gauging the \nproper kind and level of response for protecting such interests--that \nwe need to be engaging in if we are to bring coherence and \neffectiveness to our post-cold war foreign and national security \npolicy. Everything is not the most important thing to do. Everything is \nnot necessarily in America's vital interest to do. It is, in my \njudgment, what we must do in considering our policies, particularly \ntoward the Balkans and now with a plan in Colombia to involve ourselves \nin a war against narcotraffickers in Colombia. We need to do several \nthings. We need to ask ourselves: How vital are our interests in those \nareas? And what are we willing to pay to protect those interests?\n\n  What about the role of other countries, who, for reasons of history \nand geography, may have even greater national interests at stake?\n  Senator Roberts pointed out back in February the similarities between \nthe Commission on America's National Interests list of ``vital'' \ninterests and related compilations by other groups and individuals. I \nbelieve, for example, that the commission's definitions of ``vital'' \nand ``extremely important'' national interests are quite compatible \nwith the relevant portions of the January 2000 White House ``National \nSecurity Strategy for a New Century.'' The conflicts will lie in \napplying these general principles to specific cases. That is what \nSenator Roberts and I intend to do with the remaining sessions of these \nglobal role dialogs, including such applications as the role of our \nalliances and the decision on when and how to intervene militarily.\n  However, from my perspective, though we may have some implicit common \nground as to our most important national interests and what we should \nbe prepared to do in defending them, in the real world where actions \nmust count for more than words and where capabilities will inevitably \nbe given greater weight than intentions, the picture we too often give \nto the world--of unilateralist means and narrowly self-interested \nends--and to our own citizens--of seemingly limitless aspirations but \nquite limited resources we are willing to expend in achieving them--is \nsurely not what we should be doing.\n  Samuel P. Huntington writes in the March/April edition of Foreign \nAffairs:\n\n       Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress nor the \n     public is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of \n     unilateral global leadership. Some advocates of American \n     global leadership argue for increasing defense expenditures \n     by 50 percent, but that is a nonstarter. The American public \n     clearly sees no need to expend effort and resources to \n     achieve American hegemony. In one 1997 poll, only 13 percent \n     said they preferred a preeminent role for the United States \n     in world affairs, while 74 percent said they wanted the \n     United States to share power with other countries. Other \n     polls have produced similar results. Public disinterest in \n     international affairs is pervasive, abetted by the \n     drastically shrinking media coverage of foreign events. \n     Majorities of 55 to 66 percent of the public say that what \n     happens in western Europe, Asia, Mexico, and Canada has \n     little or no impact on their lives. However much foreign \n     policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the United States \n     lacks the domestic political base to create a unipolar world. \n     American leaders repeatedly make threats, promise action, and \n     fail to deliver. The result is a foreign policy of ``rhetoric \n     and retreat'' and a growing reputation as a ``hollow \n     hegemon.''\n\n  One of my favorite authors on war and theorists on war, Clausewitz, \nput it this way:\n\n       Since in war too small an effort can result not just in \n     failure but in positive harm, each side is driven to outdo \n     the other, which sets up an interaction. Such an interaction \n     could lead to a maximum effort if a maximum effort could be \n     defined. But in that case, all proportion between action and \n     political demands would be lost: means would cease to be \n     commensurate with ends, and in most cases a policy of maximum \n     exertion would fail because of the domestic problems it would \n     raise.\n\n  I think we are maximally committed around the world. I think we have \nto review these commitments because I am not quite sure we have the \ndomestic will to follow through on them or the budgets to take care of \nthem. We do not want to risk failure.\n  Once again, I thank all of the Senators who have joined in today's \ndiscussion. I have benefitted from their comments, and encourage all of \nour colleagues of whatever party and of whatever views on the proper \nU.S. global role to join in this effort to bring greater clarity and \ngreater consensus to our national security policies through these \ndialogs. Our next session will be on the role of multilateral \norganizations, including NATO and the United Nations, and is scheduled \nto occur just after the Easter break.\n  During the Easter break I intend to go visit our allies and friends \nin NATO, in Belgium, to go to Aviano to get a background briefing on \nhow the air war in the Balkans was conducted, to go on to Macedonia and \ninto Kosovo itself to see our forces there. That would be over the \nEaster break. I will go back through London to get a briefing from our \nclosest ally, our British friends.\n  I hope to come back to the Senate in a few weeks with a more \ninsightful view of what we should do, particularly in that part of the \nworld, regarding our responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. First, again, I thank my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, for this continued initiative and his leadership \nin what we think is a bipartisan foreign policy dialog. I hope it is \nsuccessful.\n  We said back in February during our first discussion that our \nobjective was to try to achieve greater attention, focus, and mutual \nunderstanding--not to mention a healthy dose of responsibility--in this \nbody in regard to our global role.\n  I repeat again, in chapter 10 of the Senator's book that he has \nprovided to every Senator, with a marvelous introduction by our \nChaplain, the Senator stated that success is a team effort, that coming \ntogether is a beginning, keeping together is progress, and working \ntogether is success. That is a pretty good motto for our efforts today, \nas well as a recipe for our foreign policy goals.\n  I am very privileged to yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska, Mr. Hagel. He is a recognized expert in the field of \ninternational affairs, and more especially, a strong backer of free \ntrade. I seek his advice and counsel often on the very matters that we \nare talking about.\n  I am delighted he has joined us. I yield 15 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator and my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, first, let me acknowledge the leadership of \nmy colleagues from Georgia and Kansas for bringing attention and focus \nto an area that does not often get appropriate focus. It is about \ninternational affairs--the connecting rods to our lives in a world now \nthat is, in fact, globally connected.\n  That global community is underpinned by a global economy. There is \nnot a dynamic of the world today, not an action taken nor a consequence \nof that action, that does not affect America, that does not affect our \nfuture. I am grateful that Senators Cleland and Roberts have taken the \ntime and the leadership to focus on an area of such importance to our \ncountry.\n  I point out an op-ed piece that appeared in Monday's Washington Post, \nwritten by Robert Kagan, and I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 10, 2000]\n\n                       A World of Problems . . .\n\n                           (By Robert Kagan)\n\n       Call me crazy, but I think it actually would serve the \n     national interest if George W. Bush spent more time talking \n     about foreign policy in this campaign. Not to slight the \n     importance of his statements on the environment and the \n     census. But perhaps Bush and his advisers can find time to \n     pose a simple, Reaganesque question: Is the world a safer \n     place than it was eight years ago?\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\n       A hundred bucks says even James Carville can't answer that \n     question in the affirmative--at least not with a straight \n     face. A brief tour d'horizon shows why.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n       As the administration enters its final months, Saddam \n     Hussein is alive and well and Baghdad, pursuing his quest for \n     weapons of mass destruction, free from outside inspection and \n     getting wealthier by the day through oil sales while the \n     sanctions regime against him crumbles. The next president may \n     see his term dominated by the specter of Saddam Redux.\n\n\n                              the balkans\n\n       You can debate whether things are getting better in Bosnia, \n     or whether Kosovo is on its way to recovery or to disaster. \n     And Clinton deserves credit for intervening in both crises. \n     But Slobodan Milosevic is still in power in Belgrade, still \n     stirring the pot in Kosovo and is on the verge of starting \n     his fifth Balkan war in Montenegro. Milosevic was George Bush \n     Sr.'s gift to Bill Clinton; he will be Clinton's gift to Al \n     Gore or George Jr.\n\n\n                              china-taiwan\n\n       Even Sinologists sympathetic to the Clinton \n     administration's policies think the odds of military conflict \n     across the Taiwan Strait have increased dramatically. \n     Meanwhile, the administration's own State Department \n     acknowledges the steady deterioration of Beijing's human \n     rights record. Good luck to Al Gore if he tries to call China \n     policy a success.\n\n\n                         weapons proliferation\n\n       Two years after India and Pakistan exploded nuclear \n     devices, their struggle over Kashmir remains the likeliest \n     spark for the 21st century's first nuclear confrontation. If \n     this is the signal failure of the Clinton administration's \n     nonproliferation policies, North Korea's and Iran's weapons \n     programs come in a close second and third. Even the \n     administration's intelligence experts admit that the threat \n     to the United States has grown much faster than Clinton and \n     Gore anticipated. And where is the missile defense system to \n     protect Americans in this frightening new era?\n\n\n                           haiti and colombia\n\n       After nobly intervening in Haiti to restore a \n     democratically elected president in 1994, the administration \n     has frittered away the past 5\\1/2\\ years. Political \n     assassinations in Haiti are rife. Prospects for stability are \n     bleak. Meanwhile, the war in Colombia rages, and even a \n     billion-dollar aid program may not prevent a victory by \n     narco-guerrillas. When the next president has to send troops \n     to fight in Colombia or to restore order in Haiti, again, \n     he'll know whom to thank.\n\n\n                                 russia\n\n       Even optimists don't deny that the election of Vladimir \n     Putin could be an ominous development. The devastation in \n     Chechnya has revealed the new regime's penchant for \n     brutality.\n       Add to all this the decline of the armed forces--even the \n     Joint Chiefs complain that the defense budget is tens of \n     billions of dollars short--and you come up with a story of \n     failure and neglect. Sure, there have been some successes: \n     NATO expansion and, maybe, a peace deal in Northern Ireland. \n     Before November, Clinton could pull a rabbit out of the hat \n     in the Middle East. But Jimmy Carter had successes, too. They \n     did not save him from being painted as an ineffectual world \n     leader in the 1980 campaign.\n       Bush maybe gun-shy about playing up foreign policy after \n     tussling with John McCain in the primaries. But Gore is no \n     McCain. He is nimble on health care and education, but he is \n     clumsy on foreign policy. Bush may not be a foreign policy \n     maven, but he's got some facts on his side, as well as some \n     heavy hitters. Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Goerge Shultz and \n     Richard Lugar, instead of whispering in W.'s ear, could get \n     out in public and help build the case. John McCain could \n     pitch in, too.\n       The offensive can't start soon enough. The administration \n     has been adept at keeping the American people in a complacent \n     torpor: Raising the national consciousness about the sorry \n     state of the world will take time. And if Bush simply waits \n     for the next crisis before speaking out, he will look like a \n     drive-by shooter. Bush also would do himself, his party and \n     the country a favor if he stopped talking about pulling U.S. \n     troops out of the Balkans and elsewhere. Aside from such talk \n     being music to Milosevic's ears, Republicans in Congress have \n     been singing that neo-isolationist tune for years, and the \n     only result has been to make Clinton and Gore look like Harry \n     Truman and Dean Acheson.\n       Some may say it's inappropriate to ``politicize'' foreign \n     policy. Please. Americans haven't witnessed a serious \n     presidential debate about foreign policy since the end of the \n     Cold War. Bush would do everyone a service by starting such a \n     debate now. He might even do himself some good. Foreign \n     policy won't be the biggest issue in the campaign, but in a \n     tight race, if someone bothers to wake the people up to the \n     world's growing dangers, they might actually decide that they \n     care.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. Kagan is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment \nfor International Peace. He echoes what Senators Roberts and Cleland \nhave talked about; that is, the vital interests of our country in world \naffairs. He suggests that America's two Presidential candidates this \nyear, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, focus attention in the \nremaining months of this Presidential campaign on international issues. \nHe lays out a number of areas in the world that are of vital \nconsequence and concern to not only those particular regions but to the \nUnited States.\n  The point is, others are coming to the same conclusions and \nrealizations as our friends from Georgia and Kansas: that international \nrelations is the completeness of all of our policies--trade, national \nsecurity, economy, geopolitics. It is, in fact, a complete policy.\n  We are living in a most unique time in history, a time when \neverything is possible. We live in a time when we can do more good for \nmankind than ever in the history of the world. Why is that? It deserves \nsome perspective and some review.\n  Over the last 50 years, it has been the multilateral organizations of \nthe world, beginning with the visionary and foresighted leadership of \nHarry Truman after World War II and a Republican Congress, working \njointly to develop and implement multilateral policies and \norganizations such as the United Nations, such as what was born at \nBreton Woods, the IMF, the World Bank, trade organizations, \nmultilateral peace, financial organizations--all are imperfect, all are \nflawed. But in the real world, as most of us understand, the choice is \nseldom between all good, the easy choice, and all bad. Normally our \nforeign policy and every dynamic of that foreign policy, be it foreign \naid, be it national security interests, be it geopolitical interests, \nfalls somewhere between all good and all bad. It is a difficult \nposition to have to work our way through.\n  With this weekend's upcoming annual meetings for the IMF and the \nWorld Bank and the number of guests who will be coming to Washington--I \nsuspect not exactly to celebrate the IMF and the World Bank and the \nWorld Trade Organization and other multilateral organizations--it is \nimportant that we bring some perspective to the question that fits very \nwell into the larger question Senators Roberts and Cleland have asked; \nthat is, is the world better off with a World Trade Organization, with \na world trade regime, its focus being to open up markets, break down \nbarriers, allow all nations to prosper? And how do they prosper? They \nprosper through free trade. Underpinning the free trade is individual \nliberty, individual freedom, emerging democracies, emerging markets.\n  We could scrap the World Trade Organization, 135 nations, and go back \nto a time, pre-World War II, that essentially resulted in two world \nwars, where there would be no trading regime. Those countries that are \nnow locked in poverty have to go it on their own. That is too bad. We \ncan scrap the World Trade Organization. While we are at it, have the \nIMF and the World Bank added to any prosperity in the world? Have they \nmade mistakes? Yes.\n  Let's examine some of the underlying and most critical and realistic \ndynamics of instability in the world. We do know that when there is \ninstability, there is no prosperity and there is no peace. What causes \ninstability?\n  Let's examine what it is that causes instability. When you have \nnations trapped in the cycle of hopelessness and the perpetuation of \nthat cycle because of no hope, no future, poverty, hunger, pestilence, \nwhat do we think is going to happen? History is rather complete in \ninstructing us on this point: conflict and war. When there is conflict \nand war, is there an opportunity to advance the causes of mankind? No. \nWhy is that? Let's start with no trading. There are no markets. Do we \nreally believe we can influence the behavior of nations with no \ncontact, no engagement, no trade? I don't think so.\n\n  As many of our guests who are arriving now in Washington, who will \nparade up and down the streets, burning the effigies of our President \nand the Congress and the World Trade Organization and the IMF and the \nWorld Bank--and I believe sincerely their motives are pure; that they \nwish to pull up out of abject poverty the more than 1.5 billion people \nin the world today, which is a worthy, noble cause--I think the record \nover the last 50 years is rather complete in how that has been done to \nhelp other nations over the last 50 years do that a little differently\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nthan tearing down the multilateral institutions that have added to \nprosperity and a better life and a hope for mankind.\n  I will share with this body a couple of facts from the 1999 Freedom \nHouse survey. Most of us know of the organization called Freedom House. \nIt issued its first report in 1978. This is what Freedom House issued \non December 21, 1999: 85 countries out of 192 nations today are \nconsidered free. That represents 44 percent of the countries in the \nworld today. That is the second largest number of free countries in the \nhistory of man. That represents 2.34 billion people living in free \ncountries with individual liberties, 40 percent of all the people in \nthe world. Fifty-nine countries are partly free, 31 percent of the \ncountries. That represents 1.5 billion people living in partly free \ncountries, 25 percent of the world's population.\n  What are the real numbers? Seventy-five percent of the countries, \nlargest in the history of mankind, are living in either free or partly \nfree countries. Forty-eight countries not free. That represents 25 \npercent of the population of the world.\n  What does that mean? Let's go back and examine about 100 years ago \nwhere the world was. At the turn of the century, no country on Earth, \nincluding the United States, had universal suffrage. Less than 100 \nyears ago, the United States did not allow women to vote, and there \nwere other human rights violations we accepted in this country. My \npoint is, the United States must be rather careful not to moralize and \npreach to the rest of the world. Yes, we anchor who we are on the \nfoundation of our democracy and equal rights, but it even took America \n250 years to get as far as we have come.\n  So we should, if nothing else, at least be mindful of that as we \ndictate to other countries. Now, as we examine a number of the points \nthat have been made this morning and will be made throughout the next \nfew months about foreign policy, it is important for us to have some \nappreciation and lend some perspective to not only the tremendous \nprogress that has been made in the world today, and the hope we have \nfor tomorrow, and the ability and the opportunities we have to make the \nworld better--and it is fundamentally about productive capacity, \nindividual freedoms, trade, free markets, private investment, rule of \nlaw, rights, contract law, all that America represents, all that three-\nfourths of the world countries and population represent. It is \nsolutions, creative solutions, for which we are looking.\n  Creative solutions will come as a result of imaginative and bold \nleadership. As I have said often when I have been challenged about \nAmerica's role in the world and is America burdening itself with too \nmuch of a role--incidentally, what should our role be? That is a \nlegitimate debate. But I have said this: America has made its mistakes. \nBut think of it in this context. If America decides that its burden is \ntoo heavy, whether that be in the area of contributions to the United \nNations, to NATO, wherever we are around the world, as an investment, \nwe believe in markets, in freedom, in opportunity, in less war, less \nconflict, a future for our children, for whatever reason, if we believe \nwe are too far extended--and that is a legitimate question--and we will \nhave an ongoing dynamic debate on the issue and we should remind \nourselves of this--the next great nation on earth--and there will be a \nnext great nation if America chooses to recede back into the cold, gray \ndarkness of mediocrity--that next great, powerful nation may not be \nquite as judicious and benevolent with its power as America has been \nwith our power. That is not the world that I wish my 7-year-old and 9-\nyear-old children to inherit.\n  If there is an additional burden--and there is--for America to carry \non to be the world's leader, for me, it is not only worthy of the \nobjective to continue to help all nations and raise all nations' \nopportunities, but realistically, geopolitically, it is the only answer \nfor the kind of world that we want not just for our children but for \nall children of the world.\n  So rather than tear down organizations and tear down trade regimes \nand tear down organizations that are focused on making the world \nbetter, we should ask our friends who are coming to Washington this \nweek to give us creative solutions and be part of those creative \nsolutions.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for an opportunity to share some \nthoughts and hopefully make a contribution to what my friend from \nGeorgia and my friend from Kansas have been about today and earlier in \nour session. This will continue throughout this year because through \nthis education and this information and this exchange of thoughts and \nideas we will fundamentally broaden and deepen the foundation of who we \nare as a free nation and not be afraid of this debate in front of the \nworld. It is the debate, the borderless challenges of our time--\nterrorism, weapons of mass destruction, the scourge of our time, \nillegal drugs--that must be confronted and dealt with as a body of all \nnations, all peoples. Understanding and dealing with these fundamental \nchallenges and issues are in the common denominator, mutual self-\ninterest of all peoples.\n  Again, I am grateful for their leadership. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nvery valuable contribution and for taking part.\n  How much time does the Senator from Texas need? We have approximately \n25 minutes still remaining under morning business.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Up to 15 minutes, or if someone else is scheduled in, \nlet me know.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I will soon yield to the Senator from \nTexas. She has been a champion on behalf of our men and women in \nuniform. She is a former member of the Armed Services Committee, now a \nvery valued and influential member of the Appropriations Committee. \nThese are the folks who have the obligation and responsibility to pay \nfor a military that I believe today is stressed, strained, and somewhat \nhollow, unfortunately.\n  I think Senator Hutchison, probably more than any other Senator, has \nbeen very diligent expressing concern and alerting the Senate and the \nCongress and the American people as to our commitments abroad, what is \nin our vital national security interests, and the problems we have \ntalked about regarding an overcommitment.\n  The Senator has come to me on repeated occasions when proposing \namendments. Sometimes she has withdrawn them, and other times she has \nproceeded but always prompting a debate on the Senate floor where there \nliterally has been none in regard to our military policy and when we \ncommit the use of force. She has pointed out, I think in excellent \nfashion, the paradox of the enormous irony that we have in Bosnia where \nwe are supporting a partitioned kind of society among three ethnic \ngroups, or nationalities; whereas, just to the south, in Kosovo, our \ngoal is to somehow promote a multiethnic society where the divisions \nare at least equal to that in Bosnia.\n  Senator Hutchison not only comes to the floor and expresses her \nopinion, but her opinion is based on facts and on actually being \npresent in the area with which we are concerned. She has been a repeat \nvisitor to Bosnia, Kosovo, and every troubled spot I can imagine, \nincluding Brussels and Russia. She does more than talk to officials. \nSenator Hutchison, when she goes on a co-del, not only talks to the \nbriefing folks, but she actually goes out to the people involved and \ntalks about their daily lives, their individual freedoms, their \npocketbooks. She talks to these folks individually and gives us a \nhealthy dose of common sense and reality when she is reporting on it. \nWe are glad to welcome her to this debate. I yield the Senator 15 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for taking time \non the Senate floor to discuss an issue which is not before us this \nvery minute, but it is something that requires much more thought, much \nmore long-term debate in the Senate.\n  I commend the leadership of these two distinguished members of the \nArmed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis. Certainly, both have \nserved in our military quite honorably, and especially Senator Cleland, \nwho has given so much for our country. I say thank you for setting \naside this time. I look forward to participating on future\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\noccasions that you are setting aside for discussion of the big picture \nitems.\n  I think one of the problems we face today is we haven't truly come to \ngrips with what America's role in the world is in the post-cold-war \nera. The issues you are bringing forth are exactly what we should be \nsetting out in order to have a policy in the post-cold-war era that \nallows the United States to take its rightful place and do the very \nbest job we can for America and for our allies around the world.\n  It is an understatement to say that the United States is the world's \nonly superpower. In pure military terms, we are a colossus. Our troops \nare in Japan, Korea, throughout Europe, and in the Middle East. We \nguard countless other nations. We keep tyrants in check from Baghdad to \nPyongyang to Belgrade. No other nation has ever wielded such military \npower.\n\n  Leadership on this scale requires discretion, the confidence to know \nthe right course, and the will to pursue it--the confidence to know \nwhen not to engage but to encourage others to do so.\n  True leadership is striking out on a right course of action grounded \nin a central philosophy of advancing the American national interests. \nSimply put, both our allies and our enemies must know what to expect \nfrom the United States of America. We must always be strong. We must \nrely upon diplomacy to maintain much of our leadership. But when \ndiplomacy fails, global leadership may require the use of military \nforce.\n  When and how should the United States use our military power?\n  There was a time when the answer was clear. During the cold war, we \ndetermined we should only use military force when our vital national \ninterests were clearly threatened. In the cold war, there was a clear \nmilitary focus on a threat we could easily identify. We knew that if we \nacted, the Soviets would react. There was a clarity.\n  Today, however, because we are the only superpower, we are often \ncalled upon to act when there is a crisis anywhere in the world. \nLeadership in this instance requires much more discipline than in the \npast.\n  In our political system, that discipline comes from the checks and \nbalances that have been built into it.\n  The only clear authority our Constitution grants to the President in \ncommitting our forces to conflict is in the role of Commander in Chief \nto deploy troops. But equally clear in the Constitution, Congress alone \nhas the power to declare war, to raise and support an Army, and to \nprovide for the Navy.\n  Our framers couldn't have been more clear on this issue. They did not \nbreak with the monarchy in England to establish another monarchy in \nAmerica. They feared placing in the hands of the President the sole \npower to commit to war and also implement that war. Yet, especially in \nthe last 50 years, Presidents have sent our troops into conflict \nwithout formal declaration of war that would be required by Congress, \nand not only for emergencies such as repelling sudden attacks that were \nenvisioned by our founders.\n  Congress is being gradually excluded in its constitutional role in \nforeign policy. The consultation process is broken, and it must be \nfixed.\n  In a representative democracy such as ours, elected officials must \nstand up and be counted when the fundamental decisions of war and peace \nare made.\n  I believe it is important for Congress to reclaim its deliberate role \nintended by the Constitution. I have proposed limits on the duration \nand size of a force that can be deployed without congressional \napproval. I have proposed that the President be required to identify \nthe specific objectives of a mission prior to its approval by Congress.\n  Too often operations such as those we have seen in Bosnia, and now \nKosovo, become open ended with no milestone to measure success, no \nmilestone to measure failure, and no exit strategy.\n  It is the hallmark of this administration for the United States to go \ninto regional crises and displace friendly, local powers who share our \ngoal and could act effectively on their own. In Kosovo, we fought and \nsustained an unsustainable government. We are trying to prevent the \nrealignment of a region where the great powers have tried and failed \nmany times to impose their will on ancient hatred and atrocities.\n\n  In fact, I am interested in working with others to see if we can \naddress this issue. We must condition future peacekeeping funds on the \nrequirement that the administration reconvene the parties to the Dayton \npeace accords that ended in the Bosnia conflict, and those involved in \nthe Rambouillet talks that resulted in Kosovo, and other regional \ninterests.\n  We must review the progress we have made and begin developing a long-\nterm settlement based on greater self-determination by the governed and \nless wishful thinking by outside powers. This will probably involve \ntailoring the current borders to fit the facts on the ground. But this \nwill create the condition for a genuine stability and reconstruction. \nWhen we take up further funding of Bosnia and Kosovo, I am not going to \ntry to determine the outcome of these talks, but it is essential that \nwe reconvene the parties to see where we are. For Heaven's sake, that \nis a modest proposal from the world's only superpower.\n  Years ago, President Nixon laid out principles on how our military \nforces should be used overseas. Based upon his principles, I offer the \nfollowing outline for a rational superpower to try to bridge the \nethical question:\n  First, we should acknowledge that bold leadership means war is the \nlast resort--not the first. We cannot let our allies and our enemies \nsuck us into regional quicksand. This is what happened in Bosnia and \nKosovo. Our allies refused to act on their own, insisting they could \nnot take military action without a commitment of U.S. troops. That was \nnot the case. Our European allies have sophisticated military forces. \nWe should have been ready with backup assistance with heavy air and sea \nsupport, intelligence monitoring, supplies, and logistical \ncoordination, but they did not need our combat leadership for a \nregional conflict that could be contained by their own superb ground \nforces.\n  Second, we should not get involved in civil conflicts that make us a \nparty to the conflict. We learned this with tragic consequences in \nSomalia when we got in between warring forces trying to capture one \nwarlord. Yes, Serbia has a terrible leader. And it was tempting to \npunish him with our military force. But look who pays the price with \nmany innocent civilians in Serbia as well. Often these types of \nmissions are ones in which our allies can do a better job because \noftentimes it takes more money and it is less efficient for American \ntroops to do peacekeeping missions.\n  When we commit 10,000 troops, it is not 10,000 troops. It is 10,000 \ntroops on the ground and 25,000 troops in the surrounding perimeter to \nprotect them. This is because American troops are always the target \nwherever they are, as they were in Somalia and as they have been in \nKosovo. You are never going to hear me say we should not have the \nprotection force. Of course, we are going to have the protection force \nif our troops are involved.\n  I have heard it said by many in our military who come home from \noverseas that if there is an incident, it is going to be against us.\n  I have heard our military people say if they are walking with other \ngroups of military on parade, that people who are wishing to protest \nwill let the Turks go by, the French go by, and the Brits go by. They \nwait for the Americans to hurl the epitaphs. We have to have a \nprotection force. But that is not the case for many of our allies.\n  Third, why not help those who are willing to fight for their own \nfreedom? The administration seems to see no option between doing \nnothing and bombing someone into the stone age. There are, too often, \nother options. These options that we ignore, and sometimes even oppose, \ninclude local forces willing to fight for their own freedom.\n\n  In Bosnia, for example, since 1991, we have maintained an arms \nembargo on the Muslim forces who wanted, and begged, to be able to \nfight for themselves. I met with them many times. I have been to Bosnia \nand that region seven times. I am going again next week. I am going to \nhave Easter services with the great 49th Division, the reserve unit \nthat is in control of the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. Congress \nvoted to lift the arms embargo and allow the Muslims to have arms to \ndefend themselves, but the administration opposed it. For 3 years the \nMuslims and Croats were routed because\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\nthey could not fight. They didn't have the arms. But the Croats got the \narms, they ignored the arms embargo, and they fought back. When they \ndid, President Milosevic cut a deal.\n  I think we need to look at the option of helping people who are \nwilling to help themselves rather than keep a fight artificially \nunfair.\n  Fourth, we should not even threaten the use of troops except under \nclear policies. One clear policy should be if the security of the \nUnited States is at risk. When should we deploy our troops? We need a \nhigher standard than we have seen in the last 6 years. Look at the war \nin the Persian Gulf. The U.S. security interests were at stake. A \nmadman, with suspected nuclear and biological weapons, invaded a \nneighboring country and threatened the whole Middle East. It could have \nrealigned the region in a way that would have a profound impact on the \nUnited States and our allies and subjected the entire territory to \nchemical, biological, and perhaps nuclear weapons.\n  We, of course, should always honor our commitments to our allies. If \nNorth Korea invades the south, we are committed to helping our allies. \nWe also have a responsibility toward a democratic Taiwan, which has \nbeen under constant intimidation from Communist China. We have the \nworld's greatest military alliance, NATO, where we are committed to \ndefend any one of those countries that might be under attack from a \nforeign power.\n  It is in the U.S. interest that we protect ourselves and our allies \nwith a nuclear umbrella. Yes, we would use troops to try to make sure a \ndespot didn't have nuclear capabilities.\n  These are clear areas of U.S. security interests. However, the United \nStates does not have to commit troops on the ground to be a good ally. \nIf our allies believe they must militarily engage in a regional \nconflict, that should not have to be our fight.\n  The United States does not have to commit troops to be a good ally. \nIf our allies believe they must militarily engage in a regional \nconflict, that should not have to be our fight. We could even support \nthem in the interest of alliance unity. We could offer intelligence \nsupport, ``airlift,'' or protection of noncombatants. We do not have to \nget directly involved with troops in every regional conflict to be good \nallies.\n  When violence erupted last year in Indonesia, we got it about right. \nWe stepped aside and let our good ally Australia take lead. We helped \nwith supplies and intelligence, but it wasn't American ground troops \nfacing armed militants.\n  Instead, we should focus our resources where the United States is \nuniquely capable; in parts of the world where our interests may be \ngreater or where air power is necessary.\n  It is not in the long-term interest of our European allies for U.S. \nforces to be tied down on a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia or Kosovo \nwhile in some parts of the world there is a danger of someone getting a \nlong-range missile tipped with a germ warhead provided by Saddam \nHussein and paid for by Osama Bin Laden.\n  A reasonable division of labor--based on each ally's strategic \ninterests and unique strengths--would be more efficient and more \nlogical.\n  What has been the result of our unfocused foreign relations? \nQualified personnel are leaving the services in droves. In the past 2 \nyears, half of Air Force pilots eligible for continued service opted to \nleave when offered a $60,000 bonus.\n  The Army fell 6,000 short of the congressionally authorized troop \nstrength last year. We used up a large part of our weapons inventory in \nKosovo. We were down to fewer than 200 cruise missiles worldwide. That \nmay sound like a lot, but it's just a couple of days worth in Desert \nStorm.\n  So let's be clear that if we do not discriminate about the use of our \nforces it will weaken our core capabilities. If we had to send our \nforces into combat, it would be irresponsible to send them without the \narms they need, the troop strength they need, and the up-to-date \ntraining they must have. It takes 9 months to retrain a unit after a \npeacekeeping mission into warlike readiness.\n  As a superpower, the United States must draw distinctions between the \nessential and the important. Otherwise, we could dissipate our \nresources and be unable to handle either. To maximize our strength, we \nshould focus our efforts where they can best be applied. That is \nclearly air power and technology. This will be the American \nresponsibility, but troops on the ground where those operations fall \nshort of a full combat necessity can be done much better by allies with \nour backup rather than us taking the lead every time.\n  Any sophisticated military power can patrol the Balkans, or East \nTimor, or Somalia. But only the United States can defend NATO, maintain \nthe balance of power in Asia, and keep the Persian Gulf open to \ninternational commerce.\n  I thank the distinguished Senators Roberts and Cleland for allowing \nMembers to discuss these issues in a way that will, hopefully, help to \nsolve them in the long term.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, yesterday, as I listened to our Democrat \ncolleagues talking about the marriage penalty elimination, and their \nopposition to our bill, I got interested in this debate and eager to \nspeak on it.\n  I know we have not been able to work out an agreement yet to bring \nthe bill to the floor. I know our Democrat colleagues have refused to \nagree to limiting it to amendments relevant to the marriage penalty. We \nall know the easiest way to kill something around here is to pile a \nbunch of extraneous amendments on it.\n  I am hopeful we can work out these differences and that we can have a \nvote on eliminating the marriage penalty. The American people have a \nright to know where Members of the Senate stand on this critically \nimportant issue.\n  The repeal of the marriage penalty was adopted in the House by an \noverwhelming vote. I believe it should be repealed. I am hopeful the \nPresident will sign the bill, even though to this point in time he says \nhe will not. But rather than waiting around for some agreement to be \nmade--that may never be made--I felt I had something to say that ought \nto be heard on this issue.\n  What I would like to talk about today is, first, to set this debate \nwithin the context of the President's budget and basically highlight \nthe choice we are making between spending here in Washington, where we \nsit around these conference tables and make decisions to spend billions \nof dollars, and spending back home in the family, where the families \nsit around the kitchen table and try to decide how to spend hundreds of \ndollars or thousands of dollars for themselves.\n  I would like to talk about our repeal of the marriage penalty and why \nit is the right thing to do, why it is not just a tax issue, why it is \na moral issue. This is a moral issue we are talking about.\n  I want to talk about the so-called marriage bonus that some of our \ncolleagues have thrown up. I want to try to point out how it is one of \nthe more phony issues that has ever been discussed.\n  I want to talk about President Clinton's alternative to our repeal of \nthe marriage penalty.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the last form of bigotry that is still \nacceptable in America; that is, bigotry against the successful.\n  I would like to try to do all that in such a way as to deviate from \nmy background as a schoolteacher and be brief.\n  First of all, let's outline the choices we have. The President has \nproposed in his budget that we spend $388 billion over the next 5 years \non new Government programs and expansions of programs.\n\n  This is brand new spending. This is $388 billion the President's \nbudget says we ought to spend above the level we are currently \nspending, and we ought to do it on a series of new programs and program \nexpansions--about 80 new programs and program expansions.\n  We have proposed that we give the people of America $150 billion of \nthe taxes they have paid above the level we need to fund the Federal \nGovernment, and at the same time to save every penny of money that came \nfrom Social Security taxes for Social Security.\n  Many people who have followed this debate heard our Democrat \ncolleagues spend all of yesterday saying, it is dangerous, it is \nirresponsible, it is reckless to let the American people keep $150 \nbillion of this non-Social Security surplus we have in the budget \nbecause the American economy is generating more revenues than we need \nto pay for the current Government.\n  The question I would ask, and that I would ask Americans as they are \nsitting in front of their television screens or as they are sitting \naround the kitchen table doing their budget, is: How come it is \nirresponsible for us to let working families spend $150 billion more of \ntheir own money, but it is not irresponsible to let President Clinton \nand Vice President Gore and the Democrats spend $388 billion of their \nmoney? How come it is irresponsible when families get a chance to keep \nmore of what they earn, and yet it is not irresponsible to take more \nthan twice that amount of money and spend it in Washington, DC?\n  Why repeal the marriage penalty? Gosh, most people are shocked when \nthey discover that we have such a thing. Let me quickly point out, I do \nnot think anybody ever set out with a goal of imposing a penalty on \nmarriage.\n  When many of the provisions of the Tax Code were adopted, only 30 \npercent of adult women worked outside the home; now it is roughly 60 \npercent. The world has changed dramatically since much of the Tax Code \nwas written.\n  As Abraham Lincoln recognized long ago: To expect people to live \nunder old and outmoded laws is like expecting a man to be able to wear \nthe same clothes he wore as a boy. It just does not work.\n  No matter who set out to do it, we have in today's Tax Code a \nprovision of law that basically produces a situation where, if two \npeople, both of whom work outside the home, meet and fall in love and \nget married, they end up paying on average about $1,400 a year in \nadditional income taxes. Paradoxically, that is true if they meet, fall \nin love, and decide to get married on the last day of December. They \npay $1,400 more of income taxes for the right to live in holy matrimony \nfor one day. The number gets much bigger for working couples who make \nsubstantial income, and it gets bigger for working couples who make \nvery moderate income.\n  Today, if a janitor and a waitress--the janitor has three children; \nthe waitress has four children; they are both working; they are \nstruggling, trying to do the toughest job in the world, which is to \nmake a single-parent home functional--meet and fall in love and have \nthe opportunity to solve one of their great problems, by their getting \nmarried, they not only both lose their earned-income tax credit but \nthey end up in the 28-percent tax bracket. We literally have a \ndisincentive in the Tax Code for people to form the most powerful \ninstitution for human happiness and progress in history; that is, the \nfamily.\n  This obviously makes no sense. Nobody argues that it makes sense. \nEven the people who oppose repealing it agree that the Tax Code does \nnot make any sense. They simply want to spend the money that would be \ngiven back, and so they don't want to give it back. They don't say it \nmakes sense. They don't say it is fair.\n  I think it is not only unfair, it is immoral. How dare we have a Tax \nCode that penalizes people for getting married? So we want to repeal \nit.\n  Where does the penalty come from? I know people's eyes glaze over \nwhen we talk about numbers. I will not talk about many of them today, \nbut let me try to explain why it happens.\n  If you are single and filing your tax return, you pay at the 15-\npercent rate on income up until you earn $25,750. Let's say you and \nyour sweetheart both get out of school and begin teaching, and you both \nmake $25,000 a year, and you are both paying 15-percent marginal tax \nrates. If you get married, then, at a combined income of $43,000, \nroughly, you go into the 28-percent tax bracket.\n  So the first reason for the marriage penalty is that in the case of \nthese two young people who fell in love, got married, were making \n$25,000 each, they were paying 15-percent marginal tax rates each, and \nthey got married, $7,000 of their joint income is taxed at 28 percent.\n  Secondly, the standard deduction is such that you end up losing and \ngetting\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\na smaller standard deduction by getting married than if you stayed \nsingle.\n  The net result is, the standard deduction for a married couple is \nless than the sum of the two deductions for two individuals who are \nsingle. You get into the 15-percent tax bracket at a lower income. You \nget into the 28-percent tax bracket at a lower income.\n  The bottom line is, when you take into account that rather than \ngetting $8,600 in a combined standard deduction, you only get $7,200, \nand when you take into account that you get into the 28-percent tax \nbracket $7,000 sooner, the net result is, on average, for those \nAmericans who fall in love and get married, they pay on average $1,400 \na year for the privilege of being married.\n  We get rid of the marriage penalty for everyone. How do we do it? \nFirst of all, we say, whether you are single or whether you are \nmarried, you get the same standard deduction. If it is you and your \nwife filing a joint return, you get twice what you would have gotten \nfiling individually, or you get the combination of what she would have \ngotten and what you would have gotten. We then stretch the 15-percent \ntax bracket to assure that by getting married, married couples do not \nget pushed into a higher tax bracket. Then we stretch the 28-percent \ntax bracket to be sure that by getting married, people don't get pushed \ninto the 31-percent tax bracket.\n  The net result of our bill is, we totally repeal the \nmarriage penalty. As a result, the average taxpaying family in America \nwould get about $1,400 more that they could spend themselves on their \nown families.\n\n  I know every time we talk about appropriations here, spending money \nin Washington, people talk about compassion: We are spending money on \neducation, housing, nutrition, those things we are all for. By \nrepealing the marriage penalty and letting families keep $1,400 of \ntheir own money to spend on their own children, they are going to spend \nit on education, housing, and nutrition--the education they choose, the \nhousing they choose, and the nutrition they choose. That is what we \nwant to do.\n  The alternative is proposed by President Clinton. I want people to \nknow that when the President stands up and says, I am for repealing the \nmarriage penalty just as the Republicans are, only I want to do it \ndifferently, he is not quite leveling with you. You need to know that.\n  How can I possibly say such a thing? First of all, when you look at \nthe fine print of the President's tax cut, the first year, he raises \ntaxes by $10 billion; the second year, he raises taxes by $1 billion. \nAt the end of 5 years, which will be in the second term of the next \nPresident--or it could be two Presidents from now--finally, the Clinton \nplan will grant a grand total of a $5 billion tax cut. When the \nPresident is saying he gets rid of the marriage penalty, he is not \nleveling with you.\n  Let us talk about who is excluded. I am sure people know the code. If \nthey don't know the code, I want them to know it. Whenever President \nClinton and Vice President Gore and the Democrats want to deny people \nthe ability to keep money they earn, or whenever they want to raise \ntheir taxes, there is one label they always stick on them--they are \n``rich.'' Every time taxes are raised, if you listen to President \nClinton and Vice President Gore, we raised taxes on ``the rich.''\n  Go back and look at the President's tax increase he proposed in 1993. \nIt turned out that if you were earning $25,000 a year and were drawing \nSocial Security, you were rich. That is how they define rich. Then they \nhad tax increases on families making $44,000 a year. Ask yourself, how \ndid they get rich?\n  Well, when you looked at the way President Clinton and Vice President \nGore proposed their tax increase, to calculate who had to pay it, they \nadded what you would have to pay in rent to rent your home if you owned \nyour home, they calculated what your retirement had grown by, they \ncalculated the value of your health insurance, they calculated the \nvalue of your parking place. Some family in Texas making $44,000 a \nyear, thinking they were a long way from being rich, suddenly, with all \nof President Clinton's amazing ability to twist the facts, they were \nmaking $75,000 a year, if they owned their own home, owned their own \ncar, had a parking place at work, if they owned life insurance.\n  But the point was that supposedly they were rich. Now, I am sure if \nyou followed this debate, you have heard our Democrat colleagues say \nthat the Republican bill gives relief from the marriage penalty to \npeople who are rich. Well, who are they talking about?\n  Well, under the President's bill, he raises the standard deduction, \nthough not enough to eliminate the marriage penalty coming from it, and \nhe does nothing to eliminate the fact that young people, or people who \nare married, get into the 28-percent tax bracket $7,000 earlier. So \nwhen we stretch the 15-percent tax bracket, who are we helping that the \nPresident says is rich? It seems to me that is a reasonable question. \nWho are these rich people we are helping that the President's bill \nwould not give the tax relief to by stretching the 15-percent tax \nbracket?\n  Well, the people we are helping, as it turns out, are people who make \n$21,525 each. So that if you have a fireman and you have a dental \ntechnician and they meet and fall in love, under the President's notion \nof rich, you are rich. And to quote one of our Democrat colleagues: \n``You don't deserve to have this penalty eliminated because you don't \nneed it; you are rich.'' Under their bill, two people who get married \nand who each make $21,525 would be denied the relief we grant by \nstretching the 15-percent tax bracket.\n  Now, ultimately, I ask people, if you are making $21,525, are you \nrich? You may not think you are, but realize that when President \nClinton and Vice President Gore and the Democrats are talking about \nrich people, they are not talking about Rockefeller, they are not \ntalking about Mellon, and they are not talking about all of these new \nrich people who came from the information age; they are talking about \nyou if you make over $21,525.\n  Under the President's proposal, he gives no marriage penalty relief \nif one parent stays at home. So under the President's plan, if you \nsacrifice and give up things in order that one parent can stay at home, \nyou are rich. Under the President's proposal, you don't deserve any \nrelief under eliminating the marriage penalty. Let me quickly add, I \ndon't want to get into a judgment--and I am not going to--on whether \none parent should stay at home. My mama worked my whole life because \nshe had to. My wife has worked the whole lives of our children because \nshe had a career and she wanted to. I think people have to make the \ndecision for themselves. This is the point. You are not rich because \nyou make a decision that one of you should stay home and take care of \nyour children.\n  The President says that if you itemize your deductions--and about \nhalf of all families who make $30,000 or more itemize deductions, and \neverybody does that owns a home--you are rich and therefore you don't \nget marriage penalty relief. The President's plan would grant marriage \npenalty relief at a maximum of $43.50 the first year.\n  This is my point. Does anybody really believe that somebody making \n$21,525 is rich? Does anybody believe that every family in America \nwhere one of the parents stays at home with their children is rich? \nDoes anybody believe that every family who owns a home is rich? Does \nanybody believe that anybody who makes $30,000 a year and itemizes on \ntheir taxes is rich? I submit that nobody believes that. But why does \nthe President say it? Why does the Vice President say it? Why do our \nDemocrat colleagues say it?\n  Let me tell you the only thing I can figure out. The alternative to \nsaying that you are against repealing the marriage penalty, because it \ngoes to the rich, is to say you are against it because you want to \nspend it in Washington. I think what the President, the Vice President, \nand their supporters have concluded is that it is not viable to stand \nup on the floor of the Senate, or in front of a television camera \nanywhere, and say it probably is unfair that you are paying $1,400 for \nthe right to be married; but, look, we can spend the money in \nWashington better than you can, and it is better to let us keep it \nbecause we will spend it and we will make you better off. I don't think \nanybody would believe that and so, as a result, we see an effort to \nconfuse people by saying, well, look, we just don't want to give this \nto the rich. But who gets tax relief to eliminate the marriage penalty \nunder our bill and ends\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nup not getting the full relief under the President's bill? People \nmaking $21,525 each, people who choose to have one parent stay at home, \npeople who own their home or itemize deductions.\n\n  So the plain truth is, those are the people who are being called \nrich. I don't think that is an accurate portrayal of rich. But, look, \nwhat is wrong with being rich? I will address that in a moment. You \nhave heard, and you will hear again as this debate progresses, about a \nmarriage bonus. Let me not mince words. If there has ever been a \nfraudulent idea in any debate in American history, it is the marriage \nbonus. Clearly, some minion at IRS was ordered by a politician to give \na justification for continuing the marriage penalty, and after great \nexertion and twisting of logic, they came up with the concept of a \nmarriage bonus--that there are actually people getting a bonus from \nbeing married--an average of about $1,300, I think it is, for these \npeople who supposedly get the bonus.\n  What is this bonus? The bonus is the following thing. I have two \nsons; one is 24 and one is 26. They have been on my payroll for those \ncorresponding numbers of years. I, as many parents, look forward to \nthem being off my payroll. If a wonderful, successful girl came along \nand married one of them, she would get a marriage bonus. She would get \nto take a standard deduction by having them on her payroll instead of \nmy payroll. She would be able to file jointly with them and stay in the \n15-percent tax bracket, up to $43,000 a year. She would end up getting, \non average, about an $1,300 benefit by marrying one of my sons. I would \nlose the benefit, but would I complain? Would this be a great economic \ndeal for her? I mean, let's get serious. Can you feed, clothe, house, \neducate, and entertain somebody for $1,300 a year, or $1,400 a year, or \n$4,000 a year?\n  We insult the intelligence of the American people by talking about a \nmarriage bonus as if the piddling amount of deduction that people get \nwhen they marry someone who doesn't work outside the home as if somehow \nthat is a bonus to them, when it is a tiny fraction of what it costs, \nbasically, to care for someone in America.\n  Let me say I would be willing to supplement the marriage bonus that \nsomeone would get by taking one of my sons off my payroll. Maybe for \nlove someday it will happen. I hope so. But for economic reasons, \nnobody is going to marry somebody to get their standard deduction \nbecause they cannot feed them, house them, clothe them, and all the \nother things they need for them.\n  Let's not insult the intelligence of the American people by sighing: \nOh, yes, it is true that the average family with two members who work \noutside the home pay $1,400 of additional taxes for the right to be \nmarried, but there are these people who get a bonus. The bonus is a \nfraud. The tax penalty is very real.\n  I want to turn to the final question. It is one about which I have \nthought a lot and about which I feel very strongly. That is all this \nbusiness about, every time we debate anything related to the Tax Code, \nwe are always talking about rich people.\n  For some reason, the President and the Vice President and many \nmembers of their party believe you have to constantly divide Americans \nbased on their income. I strongly object to it because I think it is \nvery destructive of everything this country stands for.\n  There are a lot of things I have always admired about my mama. But \nthe one thing I think I admire the most is, when I was a boy and we \nwere riding around in a car, we would ride down the nicest street in \ntown, and my mama would almost always say, ``If you work hard and you \nmake good grades, someday you can live in a house like that.''\n  By the logic of the President and the Vice President and many members \nof their party, my mother should have been saying: Those are rich \npeople. They probably stole this money from us. It is outrageous that \nthey have this money. They don't deserve this money. We ought to take \nsome of this money away from them.\n  If we had some landed aristocracy, or something, maybe you could make \nthat argument. But the people who were living in those nice houses when \nI was growing up as a boy didn't get there by accident. Most of the \npeople didn't inherit that money, most of them earned it. Why should \nthey be singled out?\n  Under their logic, my wife's father would have been a rich person to \nbe singled out. Both his parents were immigrants. Neither of them had \nany formal education. He won $25 for an essay contest when he was a \nsenior on ``What I can do to make America a greater country.'' His \nessay was, the only part of America he could control was himself; the \nonly way he could make it a greater country was making something out of \nhimself.\n  He won $25 in 1932 for writing that essay. And he decided he was \ncoming to the mainland from Hawaii and was going to become an engineer.\n  He took a freighter from Hawaii, got on a train, met a boy going to \nan engineering school, went there, went out looking for a job, went to \na restaurant, and the guy at the restaurant said: You are in luck. \nThere is a guy coming here with a machine that says it will wash \ndishes. If you can outwash the machine, you have the job. Joe Lee \noutwashed the machine.\n  He went on, and 3 years later he had a degree in electrical \nengineering.\n  He became the first Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar \ncompany in the history of Hawaii.\n  Is he the kind of person we ought to hold up and say, He is rich?\n  He was president of the Rotary Club. He was president of the Little \nLeague. He was the head lay leader of his church.\n  Is that something in America where we single people out and say they \nare rich? I don't think so.\n  There is only one form of bigotry that is still acceptable in \nAmerica, and that is bigotry against the successful. It is bigotry \nagainst the people who, through their own exertions, succeed.\n  I would just like to say, obviously, it is a free country. If the \nPresident and the Vice President and people in their party who \nconstantly engage in this class warfare want to do it, they have a \nright to do it. But I don't think it is right. And I think they are \nstretching the truth to the breaking point when they claim that in \nrepealing the marriage penalty, as we do that, we are helping rich \npeople when in fact the President's proposal to ``eliminate the \nmarriage penalty'' denies marriage penalty relief to people who earn \n$21,525 a year.\n  Where I am from, that is not rich. But there is nothing wrong with \nbeing rich.\n  Look, if we are against the marriage penalty, aren't we against it if \na young lawyer and a young accountant meet and fall in love? Why should \nit exist for some people and not for others? Should marriage penalties \nbe paid by people who have high incomes and not by those with low \nincome?\n  Our position is very simple. The marriage penalty is wrong. It is \nimmoral. It should be repealed, and we are going to repeal it.\n  I hope the President will sign this bill. If he doesn't, we are going \nto have an election. If people want it repealed, they will know how to \nvote.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, having listened to \nspeeches all yesterday about the rich and how we were trying to help \nthem by repealing the marriage penalty. Let me simply say I thought \nsome response was needed. Let me also say I don't have any objection to \npeople being rich. I wish we had more rich people. When our programs \nare in effect, we will have more rich people because they will have \nmore opportunity. They won't be paying the death tax, and they won't be \npaying the marriage penalty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to follow the \nSenator from Texas and talk about one of the most important issues we \nare going\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\nto be considering this week. Especially for young families, this could \nbe one of the most important issues we are going to vote on maybe this \nyear. That is the question of waiving the marriage tax penalty.\n  The Senator from Texas has done an excellent job in laying out some \nof the concerns, some of the questions, and some of the boundaries of \nhow this is imposed and who is paying this tax.\n  Is it a fair tax? When you make a commitment to somebody to get \nmarried, should you also have to somehow make a commitment to Uncle \nSam? And that commitment is to pay higher taxes. That is not fair. It \nwould be like going into a store and buying a suit. The suit is $100. \nAnd they ask: Are you married? You say yes. They say: Well, that will \nbe $150.\n  Why would we pay more? Why would we penalize someone just because \nthey are married or if they are single?\n  I also want to give a lot of credit to Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nthe other Senator from Texas, for all the work over these last couple \nof weeks--working with her and others to highlight the problems with \nthe marriage penalty, whom it affects, and how much money it really \nmeans to those couples.\n  We just held a news conference outside the Capitol. Among those \nspeaking were, of course, representatives of a number of groups that \nrepresent working families across this country that are there \nsupporting it, along with the Senators who were there to support it; \nbut I think most importantly there were three couples who also came to \ntell their story, why they thought getting rid of this marriage tax \npenalty was so important, how they urged Congress to pass this bill, \nand not only urged the Congress to pass it but urged President Clinton \nto sign this into law.\n  Their stories were about young couples with one child and expecting \nanother and how, after they are married, they look at the tax forms and \nfind because they are married--young families not making a lot of \nmoney--their tax this year is going to be about $1,100 more because \nthey are married--nearly $100 in penalty every month for this young \ncouple.\n  Another couple from Maryland talked about the penalty they have--well \nover $1,400 a year. Again, why? Because they are married.\n  Go to the Tax Code, to the page referring to you, and look down the \nlines, and if you are married, there is a penalty.\n  As one man said, at many weddings across the country today there is \nan uninvited guest. That uninvited guest is the tax man. He says: Good, \nyou are getting married; when you fill out your tax forms this year, \nyou will pay more to Washington in taxes.\n  Some in the Senate who say we don't need to repeal this marriage tax \npenalty. As Senator Gramm of Texas says, some say they are rich people; \nthey can afford to pay this tax. Don't give them this break. They are \nrich.\n  They are the ones who are advocating somehow Washington needs these \ndollars more than the couples.\n  There are over 21 million couples across the country penalized at an \naverage of $1,400 a year just because they are married. A young couple \nSenator Craig and I will talk about, when Senator Craig comes back to \nthe floor, has a story I have heard a number of times; that is, the \ncouple planned on marrying toward the end of the year, but after \nfilling out their taxes and comparing it to what they would pay in \ntaxes next year because they were married, they have decided to put the \nwedding off at least for a couple of weeks beyond the December 31 date \nso as a couple they will not be penalized because they are getting \nmarried. This is a young couple who have made a decision based on \neconomics that because Uncle Sam wants to take a bigger bite out of \ntheir wallet, they are going to have to put off their plans to get \nmarried for at least several weeks just to get around the corner.\n  We have heard stories of friendly divorces where people have actually \ndecided to have a friendly divorce so they save some money. Or the \nstory of the 78-year-old man who called his wife of over 50 years and \nsaid: Do you want a divorce? She said: What are you talking? He said: I \nam at the tax man's office and if we get a divorce we could save a lot \nof money.\n  They didn't do it, but it is unfair that the couple is having to pay \nmore dollars in taxes because they are married.\n  There are going to be stories during this debate, as the Senator from \nTexas pointed out, that somehow there is a marriage bonus, many people \non one side are getting this bonus because they are married; or the \ncouple on this side who is being penalized. Somehow that is supposed to \nwash out and be fair and even. I don't think that is true. These \nfamilies should not be overtaxed, incur a tax penalty, only because \nthey have decided they are going to get married.\n  I hope, when we consider this legislation this week, we consider \nthese millions of families across the country who are paying on average \nabout $1,400 a year. Nearly $30 billion will be collected for \nWashington this year from these families. There is a belief that \nWashington needs this money more than the families do to raise their \nkids, to buy the clothes, to buy the food, to pay for the mortgage, to \nput away money for the education of their children. All this is so \nimportant, but Washington needs it more.\n  Several years ago, President Clinton was asked at a news conference \nif he thought the marriage tax penalty was fair. He said, no, it is not \nreally fair, or something to that effect. But the underlying message \nfrom the President was, even if it is not fair, Washington can use this \nmoney a lot more than the families can. Washington needs these dollars \nmore than the families need these dollars.\n  I hope, when we get a chance to vote on this, we remember these \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet, families looking for that extra \ndollar they can put into a savings account for their child's education, \nor just maybe buying something extra, maybe putting money away for a \nvacation or a night out for pizza, whatever is important to them. I \nthink $1,400 a year speaks loudly for them.\n  As I said, Washington might believe it needs the money more than \nthese families. However, if we have the families on the floor of the \nSenate, and one by one ask them if this is an important bill, are these \ndollars important to your family, could these dollars help out in your \nbudget decisions, or should we give the money to Washington and hope \nand pray that Washington will give a few of the dollars back? I think \nif we leave the dollars in the pockets of the families to begin with, \nthey will make the best decisions and they will not have to look to \nWashington or ask Washington or beg Washington for a few of the dollars \nto help them raise their families.\n  I defer to my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. I see our colleague from \nIllinois on the floor. I stepped back to do this colloquy with my \ncolleague from Minnesota.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota, hasn't the marriage penalty earned \na special contempt in our eyes from a firsthand experience involving \nour two offices?\n  Mr. GRAMS. The Senator from Idaho is correct. Two young people who we \ncare deeply about, one a dedicated employee in my office and one an \nemployee in the office of the Senator from Idaho, are among the latest \nvictims of this insidious provision of the Tax Code.\n  One of my legislative assistants is a young man from Minnesota. He \nworked for me in Minnesota and also here in Washington, DC, for over 5 \nyears. He is engaged to be married to a young woman in the office of \nthe Senator from Idaho, a native of Idaho who has worked in my \ncolleague's office for almost 3 years.\n  This young couple, very much similar to other couples all around the \nNation, is moved by faithful affections, shared values, common life \ngoals to become a family. But the Federal Tax Code is saying something \ndifferent to this young couple.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this couple are about the same ages as my \nown children. I say to everyone of my generation, they are a lot like \nall of our children and we want to see them succeed. They are like many \nyoung couples ready to start a new life together, as we have seen \ngeneration after generation.\n  They originally planned their wedding date for late this autumn this \nyear, but then friends actually started asking them, ``What about \ntaxes?'' So they did an interesting thing; they sat\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\ndown and computed their marriage penalty. Guess what. They found out \ntheir combined incomes together as a married couple would cause them to \nhave to pay out of their pockets an additional $1,400 more than they \nare currently paying as single people working on our two staffs.\n  We are talking about average earners. In fact, the marriage penalty \nfor our young Idaho-Minnesota couple is just about exactly the average-\nsized marriage penalty American couples are paying across the country, \nabout $1,400. That could be the cost of a honeymoon or a wedding gown \nor part of a college education, if properly saved and invested for \nchildren who might come as a result of this union.\n  It is critically important we deal with this issue. Yes, they have \ndelayed their wedding only a few weeks, but I asked my friend from \nMinnesota, does the Federal Government have any business forcing any \nkind of a decision such as this on families and couples?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I answer the Senator from Idaho by saying it does not. \nAgain, if there are those in the Senate who believe this is one of \nthose rich families who can afford to pay this tax, believe me, these \nare not rich young people. They are a hard-working young couple but by \nno means rich. They will work hard and probably will get there someday \nbut right now they are not.\n  It is the furthest thing from fairness. That is the Federal Tax Code. \nEven if this couple escapes the marriage tax penalty this year, they \nwill still have to pay next year and the next year and the year after, \nfor most of the rest of their lives, unless we change that, as we are \ntrying to do this week with the legislation before the Senate.\n  We are not talking about abstract tax policy. We are not talking \nabout economic theory. We are talking about average families, real \nfamilies, who are hurt every year by the marriage tax penalty. In many \ncases, we are not talking about a delay of a wedding. We are talking \nabout a Tax Code that says do not get married if your family may need \nthat second income because the IRS has first claim on that income.\n  I asked that member of my staff why they felt they needed to postpone \ntheir wedding a few weeks. He told me it did not make any sense for him \nand his fiance to fork over another $1,400 to the Federal Government.\n  Some might think that is cheating the Government, but he didn't think \nso. He said they already pay too much in taxes, and they simply cannot \nafford to give the Government even more of what is rightfully theirs. \nMy staff member said they can use that money for their wedding, they \ncan use it to help take a trip, or to plan for their family's future, \nrather than giving it to the Federal Government at a time when the \nGovernment simply does not need it. I think he made an excellent point.\n  Washington is taking this money from young couples at a time when it \ndoesn't need the money and these young couples do. I think it is not \nonly wrong but a disgrace that Washington has the large appetite for \nthe hard-earned money of people across America who simply want to get \nmarried, start a family, and to begin their lives together.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I do not think either my colleague from \nMinnesota or I could ever put romance in the Tax Code. But I hope we \ncan stop the Tax Code from punishing folks such as the two young folks \non our staffs we have talked about who are having to change their plans \nby postponing a wedding date by more than a month, contrary to their \nhearts, but because of the dictates of a heartless tax code.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I fully agree with Senator Craig. I ask for \nan additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will not object, but I believe time is \nbeing taken from the Democratic time; is that correct? The Republicans \nhave used all their time in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In a spirit of fairness, I will yield because I do want \nto respond to some of these wonderful assertions, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, to wrap up, our staff's story is not \nuncommon. There are many young couples who are forced to make similar \ndecisions.\n  The marriage penalty tax has discouraged women from marriage. It even \nhas led some married couples to get friendly divorces. They continue to \nlive together, but save on their taxes.\n  Dr. Gray Burtless of the Brookings Institution recently found that \nthe decline in marriage may be a major reason why income inequality has \nincreased across families. He believes that many poor unmarried workers \nsuffer because they do not have a spouse's income to help support their \nfamily.\n  The Economist magazine offered a possible implication of this \nfinding:\n\n       Mr. Burtless's research suggests that the Clinton \n     administration, rather than fretting about skills and trade, \n     would do better to encourage the poor to marry and make sure \n     their spouses work.\n\n  The family has been, and will continue to be, the bedrock of our \nsociety. Strong families make strong communities; strong communities \nmake for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax \ntreats married couples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees that the \nmarriage penalty is unfair.\n  Contrary to these American values, the Federal tax code contains 66 \nprovisions that can penalize married couples and force them to give \nmore of their income to Washington. The Government's own study shows \nthat 21 million American couples or 42 percent of couples incurred \nmarriage penalties in 1996. This means 42 million individuals pay \n$1,400 more in tax than if they were divorced, or were living together, \nor simply remained single--more taxes than they should have.\n  This was not the intention of Congress when it created the marriage \npenalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax schedules for married and \nunmarried people.\n  If we do not get rid of this bad tax policy that discourages \nmarriage, millions of married couples will be forced to pay more taxes \nsimply for choosing to commit to a family through marriage.\n  The marriage penalty is most unfair to married couples who are both \nworking, it discriminates against low-income families and is biased \nagainst working women. As more and more women go to work today, their \nadded incomes drive their households into higher tax brackets. In fact, \nwomen who return to the work force after raising their kids face a 50-\npercent tax rate--not much of an incentive to work.\n  The good news is, Congress is working hard to provide marriage \npenalty relief to married couples. American couples may finally get a \ncongressional blessing this year to eliminate the unfair marriage \npenalty taxes if our colleagues from the other side cooperate and join \nin our effort.\n  The marriage penalty repeal legislation which we currently debate \nwould eliminate the marriage penalty in the standard deduction; provide \nbroad-based marriage tax penalty relief by widening the 15-percent and \n28-percent tax brackets; allow more low-income married couples to \nqualify for the earned income credit; and preserve the family tax \ncredits from the bite of the alternative minimum tax which allow \nAmerican families to claim full tax credits such as the $500 per child \ntax credit, which I authored.\n  Millions of American families are still struggling to make their ends \nmeet. Repealing the marriage penalty will allow American families to \nkeep an average of $1,400 more each year of their own money to pay for \nhealth insurance, groceries, child care, or other family necessities.\n  Elimination of the marriage penalty tax brings American families one \nstep closer to the major tax relief they deserve. It is particularly \nimportant to note that this repeal will primarily benefit minority, \nlow- and middle-class families.\n  Studies suggest the marriage penalty hits African-Americans and \nlower-income working families hardest. Repeal the penalty, and those \nlow-income families will immediately have an 8-percent increase in \ntheir income.\n  It is unfair to continue the marriage penalty tax. There is no reason \nto delay the passage of the legislation. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate pass the marriage penalty relief legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what an interesting world we live in that \na Republican Senator and a Democratic\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\nSenator can look at a similar issue and see it in so many different \nways. I sit here incredulous at times when I hear Republicans on the \nfloor describe their view of the world. They live in a world where a \nyoung man and young woman fall in love and contemplate marriage and \nstart to make plans for their future but stop cold in their tracks and \nsay: Before we go a step further, we better go see an accountant.\n  I can barely remember my courtship with my wife. It was a long time \nago. But it never crossed my mind to go see a bookkeeper or accountant \nbefore I decided to propose marriage. We thought there was something \nmore to it. We knew there would be good times and bad, and we were \nprepared to make whatever sacrifice it took to live a life together. \nWhen I listen to my Republican colleagues, it sounds as if they want to \nchange the marriage vows from ``love, honor and obey, in sickness and \nin health'' to ``love, honor and obey, in sickness and in health, so \nlong as there is no income tax disadvantage.''\n  I do not think that is the real world of real people. Nor do I think \nwe can amend the Tax Code in a way that is going to create a great \nincentive for people to run out and get married. I think there are more \nbasic human emotions at stake. I think it trivializes a very sacred \ndecision by two people making an important decision in their lives to \nsuggest this is all about money and it is all about how many tax \ndollars you have to pay.\n  I will readily concede there is unfairness in the Tax Code. Yes, I \nwill concede it is fundamentally unfair for us to increase the taxes on \ntwo people because they are being married. But if you would listen to \nthe Republican logic, they grab this hook and take off and run out of \ntown with it.\n  Their proposal on the marriage tax penalty is so far afield from the \nargument you have heard on the floor, you just cannot recognize it. In \nfact, let's describe the situation. If two people are about to be \nmarried and their combined income, when they file a joint return, puts \nthem in a higher tax bracket, that is called a marriage tax penalty. \nHowever, if two people are married and their combined income puts them \nin a lower tax bracket, some would call that a marriage bonus. How does \nthat happen? Perhaps one person in the marriage is not working and the \nother one is; the combined income on a joint return merits a lower tax \nrate. If both of them are working, their combined income raises them to \na higher tax rate, a penalty.\n  We, on the Democratic side, believe we should eliminate the penalty, \neliminate the unfairness, eliminate the discrimination against married \npeople under the Tax Code. You would think from their arguments on the \nfloor that is where the Republicans are. But that is not what their \nbill says, not at all. In fact, when you look closely at their bill, \nyou find two amazing things: First, on the whole question of the \nmarriage tax penalty, there are about 65 provisions in the Tax Code \nthat could be associated with a marriage tax penalty. The Republicans, \nwho have given speeches all morning about the marriage tax penalty, \naddress how many of the 65 provisions? In the most generous definition: \nthree, leaving some 62 discriminations in the Tax Code against married \npeople untouched in the Republican bill.\n  The Democratic alternative addresses all 65.\n  So after all these pronouncements about ending Tax \nCode discrimination, the Republican bill falls flat on its face when it \ncomes to addressing the 65 different provisions in the Tax Code that \napply. The Democratic bill applies it to all 65.\n\n  The second thing that strikes you right off the bat is that the \nRepublican bill goes further than eliminating the marriage tax penalty. \nIt, in fact, creates an additional tax bonus for those not suffering \nthe penalty. We are not talking about couples who are calculating how \nmany days they have to wait to avoid paying taxes before they decide to \nget married. We are talking about couples who really benefit from \nmarriage, and their taxes go down--the Republicans add more tax cuts \nfor them.\n  Everybody loves a tax cut. If we could give a tax cut to every \nAmerican, that would be the dream of every politician. But the voting \npublic in America, the people watching this debate, have the right to \nstep back and say: How many of these tax cuts can we afford, as a \nnation, to give away? I think that is a legitimate point. The Finance \nCommittee in the Senate writes the tax laws, the committee that sent us \nthis bill that is pending. If you look at the minority views, from the \nDemocratic side, you find many Democratic Members believe the best \nthing we can do with our surplus is to pay down the Federal debt. That \nis my position. That is the position of the President and most \nDemocrats. Why is that important? Because today in America we will \ncollect $1 billion in taxes from individuals, families, and businesses, \nand that money will be used not to educate a child, to pay a soldier, \nor to build a highway; it will be used to pay interest on old debt of \nthe United States.\n  If we do not change that, it means my grandchild, who is now about 4 \nyears old, will continue to pay taxes, to pay interest on debt incurred \nby my generation to build our roads and educate our kids.\n  Some of us think the fairest thing we can do for future generations \nis to reduce the public debt with our surplus so that perhaps that $1 \nbillion tax bill each day will be reduced for future generations. \nRelieving this burden is a good gift to give our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  If one listens to the other side of the aisle, they do not want to \ntake the surplus and pay down the debt. They want to dream up more and \nmore tax cuts. The George W. Bush tax cut is so big, so massive, and so \nrisky that last week not a single Republican would vote for it on the \nSenate floor when I called for a vote.\n  He wants to spend--I hope I get these figures right--$1.3 trillion. I \nbelieve it was $400 billion or $500 billion more than the surplus. He \nobviously wants to reach deep into the Social Security trust funds to \npay for his tax cuts or to cut spending on basic services for \neducation, protection of the environment, and defense. Not a single \nRepublican would stand up for that, and I am glad they did not. Most \nAmericans know better.\n  The Senate Republicans now have a George W. Bush tax cut; they want \nto come in and keep hacking away at the surplus instead of putting it \nto reducing the national debt, which on the Democratic side we consider \nto be the highest priority.\n  The expected 10-year budget surplus, according to the Finance \nCommittee, is $893 billion. It is amazing that in a short period of \ntime, we can talk about those surpluses.\n  If this bill passes, the Republicans will have already spent over \nhalf that in this session on tax cuts. Instead of lowering the national \ndebt, reducing the tax burden on future generations, preserving Social \nSecurity and Medicare, they would have us continue on with tax cuts.\n  Take a close look at the Republican marriage tax penalty bill. First, \nthe tax cuts they offer are piecemeal rather than comprehensive. They \nare not fiscally responsible because we are not putting money away for \nreducing the national debt. More than half the taxpayer benefits in \ntheir bill go to people already receiving a tax bonus. These are not \npeople discriminated against; these are people doing well under the Tax \nCode, and they want to give them an additional tax cut.\n  They do not eliminate the marriage penalty, some 65 provisions; at \nbest, they only address 3. Here is the kicker about which they do not \nwant to talk. They have drawn their bill up in a way so that 5 million \nAmericans will actually pay higher taxes. Their intent was to reduce \nthe tax burden for married people. They went further than they had to. \nOn the bottom, the last page, take a look around the corner. Five \nmillion Americans end up paying higher taxes under the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  Isn't that something? Take a look at this on a pie chart to get an \nidea, from the Republican plan, how much is being spent on the actual \nmarriage tax penalty relief: 40 percent. Of the amount of money they \nhave put on the table--$248 billion roughly over 10 years in tax cuts--\n40 percent of it goes to marriage penalty relief; 60 percent goes to \npeople already receiving a bonus under the Tax Code for being married; \nand, of course, they raise taxes on 5 million Americans by increasing \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\n  On the Democratic side, we think there is a better alternative. In \nthe Finance Committee proposal, the one that will be before us, married \ncouples will be allowed to file separately or jointly, whatever \nbenefits them from a tax point of view. We fully eliminate all marriage \npenalties in the Tax Code --all of the 65 provisions. It is fiscally \nresponsible. The price tag is about $150 billion over 10 years, a \nlittle over half of what the Republican proposal costs. It does not \nexpand marriage bonuses, and it does not exacerbate the singles \npenalty.\n  Why do we want to reduce this idea of tax cuts? First, we think we \nshould be reducing the national debt, paying it down, which is good for \nthe economy, as Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve tells \nus. In so doing, we strengthen Social Security; most Americans agree \nthat is a pretty high priority for all families, married or not.\n  We also believe strengthening Medicare, which is something the \nRepublicans never want to talk about, is good for the future of this \ncountry, for the elderly and disabled. It is an absolute lifeline. We \nbelieve if we are careful and target tax cuts, there are some things we \ncan achieve which are good for this Nation.\n  One is a proposal which, in my State of Illinois, is very popular, \nwhich is the idea of the deductibility of college education expenses up \nto $10,000. It means if parents are helping their son or daughter \nthrough college and pay $10,000 of the tuition bill, they can deduct \nit, which means a $2,800 benefit to the family paying college expenses. \nThat is going to help a lot of families in my home State. I certainly \nthink that makes more sense than the Republican approach in the \nmarriage tax penalty bill which provides a bonus to people already \nreceiving the tax bonus.\n\n  The other item we think should be the prime focus when we talk about \ntargeting tax benefits relates to the prescription drug benefit which \nhas been talked about for years on Capitol Hill. The Medicare plan, \nconceived by President Lyndon Johnson and passed in the early sixties, \nwas a health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled which made a \nsignificant difference in America. Seniors live longer; they are \nhealthier; they have better and more independent lives. I have seen it \nin my family; most have seen it in theirs. We want it to continue.\n  There is a noted gap in that Medicare policy, and that noted gap is \nprescription drug coverage. Virtually every health insurance policy in \nAmerica now covers prescription drugs but not Medicare. The Republicans \nhave come in with all sorts of ideas for tax cuts, but they cannot come \nup with the money to pay for a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare.\n  We on the Democratic side think this should be the first priority, \nnot the last. In fact, we put a provision in our budget resolution, \nwith a contentious vote, I might add, to raise that to $40 billion to \npay for it. It has already been cut in half in the budget conference \ncommittee. There is no will on the Republican side for a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  They want to talk about a marriage penalty benefit for those who are \nnot suffering a penalty. We want to talk about a prescription drug \nbenefit for the elderly and disabled who are penalized every day when \nthey cannot afford to pay for their prescriptions.\n  Perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle do not understand \nthe depth of this problem. We have seniors in some States who are \nliterally getting on buses and riding to Canada to buy prescription \ndrugs because they cost half as much in Canada as they do in border \nStates such as North Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana. They understand \nthis. They want us to do something about it, but the first tax cut bill \nthat comes before us since we passed our budget resolution is not about \nprescription drugs, it is about a marriage penalty bonus for people who \nare not facing a marriage penalty.\n  I will tell you how bad this drug crisis is for seniors. Their \ncoverage is going down. About a third of seniors have great coverage on \nprescription drugs, a third mediocre, and a third none at all. At the \nsame time, the cost of these drugs is going up. There was a time when \ndrug prices went up once a year. Then the drug companies realized they \ncould hike their prices twice a year, then once a month, and then every \nother week. If my colleagues talk with pharmacists or doctors or \nseniors themselves, they will tell you exactly what I am talking about: \nPrescription drug costs are going up; coverage is going down.\n  Take a look at the type of bills seniors are facing. Prescription \ndrugs are a burden on moderate income beneficiaries: typical drug costs \nversus income. For a patient with heart trouble and osteoporosis, \ntypical drugs cost $2,400, 20 percent of pretax income--20 percent if \nthey are living at 150 percent of poverty. That is an income of about \n$12,000 a year.\n  High blood pressure--one can see the percentages go up: 20 percent, \n26 percent; arthritis and osteoporosis, 31 percent; high blood \npressure, heart disease, 40 percent. Heart disease and severe anemia, \nmore than a person's income.\n  In the city of Chicago, we had a hearing on prescription drug \nbenefits. Some of the stories that were told were memorable. I can \nrecall several organ recipients, transplant recipients, who came to us \nfacing monthly prescription bills of $1,000 or $2,000. These people, on \na fixed income, could not handle it. Medicare only covered it for 3 \nyears. They knew what the cost of prescription drugs meant because for \nthem it was a matter of life or death. Without their drugs, after \ntransplant surgery, they could not survive.\n  There were some who were not in a serious condition but they could \ntell me about $200, $400, and $500 a month in prescription drug costs. \nMany times, seniors then make a choice: Will they take the medicine or \nnot? Will they take half the prescription or the full prescription? \nWill they choose between food or medicine? That is a real world choice.\n  We on the Democratic side think a prescription drug benefit should be \nthe first priority out of the box. We believe we can pass marriage \npenalty relief that addresses the problem, solves it for the vast \nmajority of couples affected by it, and leaves enough money for a \nprescription drug benefit. That is our alternative to the Republican \nproposal.\n  The Republicans want it all to be on the side of marriage tax penalty \nrelief and marriage bonus. We think prescription drug benefits should \nbe part of it. That will be the choice on the floor for Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  Let's hear your priorities, whether or not you think a prescription \ndrug benefit should be a high priority. We certainly do.\n  Look at how drug costs are growing each year. I mentioned earlier, \nthey go up almost on a weekly basis: 9.7 percent in 1995; continuing to \ngrow to 16 percent in 1999.\n  Of course, drug companies are in business to make a profit. They need \nto make a profit for research to find new drugs. That is a given. I \naccept that. A company such as Schering-Plough, that sells Claritin, \nthat spends a third of its revenue on advertising--how many times have \nyou seen the Claritin ads on television, in magazines, in newspapers?--\nSpends only 11 percent of their revenue on research. We realize the \ncosts are going up for the advertising more than for the research.\n  We believe that as these costs continue to rise, seniors will \ncontinue to be disadvantaged. As I have mentioned, seniors --most of \nthem--are on a fixed income and really have nowhere to turn to pay for \nthese drugs.\n  Mr. President, 57 percent of seniors make under $15,000 a year; 21 \npercent make above that but under $25,000. You get to the categories of \nseniors who make over $25,000, and that is about one out of five \nseniors; four out of five make less. So as the prescription drug costs \ngo up, their ability to pay is being stretched.\n  We think this prescription drug benefit then will have a great \nadvantage for seniors. It will give them some peace of mind. The \ndoctors who prescribe these drugs will understand that their patients \nwill be able to afford them and take them.\n  What is the alternative? If an elderly person goes to see a doctor, \nand the doctor prescribes a drug, and the elderly person goes to the \npharmacy and finds out they cannot afford the drug, and they then do \nnot take the drug, and they get sick enough to go to the hospital, who \npays for the hospitalization under Medicare? Raise your hands, \ntaxpayers. We all do.\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\n  When someone gets sick and goes to the hospital, under Medicare, \ntaxpayers pay for it. Yet we do not pay for the prescription drugs to \nkeep people well and out of the hospital. That does not make any sense. \nIt does not make sense medically. No doctor, no senior, would believe \nthat is the best way to deal with this.\n\n  So we are talking about changing this system for the prevention of \nillness and disease, for the prevention of hospital stays, and for \nreductions in the costs to the Medicare program. It is a real cost \nsavings.\n  It isn't just enough, as I have shown from these charts, for us to \nprovide the benefit for seniors so they can pay for prescription drugs. \nWe have to deal with the whole question of pricing, the cost of these \ndrugs.\n  How will we keep these costs under control? People in my part of the \nworld, probably all across the United States, get a little nervous when \nyou talk about the Government being involved in pricing. They say: I am \nnot quite sure the Government should be doing that.\n  They have a right to be skeptical. But let's step back and take an \nhonest look at this. Is there price fixing now when it comes to the \ncost of drugs? Yes.\n  Insurance companies contact drug companies and say: If you want the \ndoctors under our insurance policy to prescribe your drugs, we will pay \nyou no more than the following cost. That is a fact of life. The \nbargaining is going on.\n  If these same drug companies take their drugs up to Canada to sell \nthem, the Canadian Government says: You cannot sell them in Canada \nunless we can establish the ceiling for your prices.\n  That is why the same prescription drugs--made by American companies, \nin American laboratories, by American technicians, approved by the Food \nand Drug Administration of the United States of America--when they \ncross that border, in a matter of minutes, they become a Canadian \nproduct sold at half the cost. That is why American seniors get on \nbuses and go up there, to buy those drugs at half the cost.\n  The Canadians speak out when it comes to the price of drugs, as do \nthe Mexicans and the Europeans and every other industrialized country \nin the world.\n  Oh, the Veterans' Administration here in the United States bargains \nfor drugs, too. We want to get the best deal for our veterans. We tell \nthe pharmaceutical companies: This is the maximum we will pay. They \nsell it to us.\n  The only group that does not have bargaining power is the seniors and \ndisabled under Medicare. They are the ones who pay top dollar for the \ndrugs in America. Is that fair? Is it fair that the people of moderate \nincome, of limited resources, are the ones who pay the highest price?\n  That is why we on the Democratic side believe a prescription drug \nbenefit should be the first tax cut that we consider, if you want to \ncall it that, because it affects a program such as Medicare.\n  But on the Republican side, no, it isn't a high priority. It isn't in \nthis bill. There is no money set aside for it. There isn't a sufficient \namount of money set aside for it in the budget resolution presently in \nconference.\n  That is the difference. It is a significant difference.\n  If you take a look at the prescription drug coverage by income level, \nhere is what you find. Those who are below the poverty level, 35 \npercent of them have no prescription drug coverage. For those barely at \npoverty and above, it is 44 percent. You will see that as you make more \nand more money, you have more and more likelihood that you will have \ndrug coverage.\n\n  The lower income Americans, the lower income seniors, and the \ndisabled are the ones who do not have prescription drugs protection.\n  We think the prescription drug benefit should really hit several \nprinciples. Any plan that does not is a phony plan. The plan should \ncover all. There should be universal coverage. Do not pick and choose. \nEvery American should be allowed to be covered under this plan. No. 2, \nit should have basic and catastrophic coverage. No. 3, it should be \naffordable.\n  We think if you put these together, you can come up with a \nprescription drug benefit the President has asked for, which the \nDemocrats in Congress support, and which the Republican bill before us \ndoes not even consider.\n  We will come back with an alternative, a Democratic substitute, to \ngive this Chamber a choice. You can take the Republican approach and \ngive tax cuts to those who do not need them or you can take the \nDemocratic approach and eliminate the marriage tax penalty for the vast \nmajority of young people who want to be married--all 65 provisions in \nthe Tax Code--and have enough money remaining to deal with a valid \nprescription drug benefit.\n  The difference is this. We buy the premise of what the President said \nin his State of the Union Address, that we happen to be living in good \ntimes but we should be careful about our future. If we are going to \nhave surpluses, let us invest them in things that count. Let us pay \ndown the national debt. Let us strengthen Social Security. Let us \nstrengthen Medicare and target the tax cuts where they are needed the \nmost.\n  Some of the Republicans are running around Capitol Hill like folks \nwith hot credit cards. They cannot wait to come up with a new tax cut--\nneeded or not needed. We think we have to be more careful. If we are \nmore careful, if we show some fiscal discipline, we can not only avoid \nthe deficits of the past, heaping them on the national debt, but we can \nbe prepared for any downturn in this economy as well. I think that is \nfiscally conservative--a term Democrats aren't usually allowed to use \nbut certainly applies in this situation--and it is fiscally prudent. It \nis the way a family deals with its situation. Before you run out and \npay for that big vacation, you might think about paying off some of the \ncredit card debt. I think a lot of families think that way. The \nRepublican leadership in the Senate does not.\n\n  Instead of paying down the debt of this country, they want to give \naway the tax revenues in a surplus, give it back to the people. They \ncan give it back, but still we will collect $1 billion a day in \ninterest on old debt.\n  The provision we will be bringing before the Senate during the course \nof this debate will offer those who are truly fiscally conservative on \nboth sides of the aisle a viable option. We are going to address all 65 \nprovisions in the Tax Code that have a marriage tax penalty effect. The \nRepublican bill goes after the standard deduction and partially \naddresses two others: Rate brackets and earned-income tax credits.\n  Among the 62 provisions the Republican bill does not address on the \nmarriage tax penalty but the Democratic optional, single-filing \nalternative does are adoption expenses. Doesn't that make sense, that \nwe wouldn't want to discriminate against couples who may want to adopt?\n  Child tax credits, think about that for a second. A couple wants to \nget married. They may have some children. We want to give them the \nchild care tax credit. The Republican bill doesn't protect them against \nthe discrimination that might be part of it.\n  Taxation of Social Security benefits, savings bonds for education, \nnone of these is covered by the Republican bill; IRA deductions, \nstudent loan interest deductions, elderly credits--the list goes on.\n  After their pronouncements and speeches about what a serious problem \nthis is, their bill really comes up short. It doesn't address the basic \nproblem. It provides tax cuts that are not asked for or needed. It \nshortchanges the opportunity to put money into a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  We think it is far better to take an approach which is fiscally \nprudent, conservative, sensible, and straightforward.\n  We also believe that during the course of this session we will be \nconsidering other targeted tax benefits. We can only have limited \namounts and still bring down this national debt, so let's spend the \nmoney where it will be the most effective: A prescription drug benefit, \nNo. 1; the deductibility of college education expenses, No. 2. If you \nsend a son or daughter to college, you will have a helping hand from \nthe Tax Code to pay for those growing expenses.\n  A third, which the President has proposed and which I think makes \nsense, is a long-term care credit. How many\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\npeople have parents and grandparents who are growing older and need \nadditional care? We know it is expensive. Because of that additional \nexpense, we want to provide a tax credit to help defray some of those \ncosts. Those are very real and serious family challenges.\n  As much has been said on the floor about the marriage penalty and the \nreverence for families, which I agree is the backbone of this country, \nlet's take a look at families in a little different context, not just \non wedding day but when those families are raising their children and \nsending them to college, when those families are caring about their \nparents and grandparents who meant so much to them. Our targeted tax \ncuts go after all of those elements because, on the Republican side, \nthey heap tax cuts on those who, frankly, do not need them, those who \nare not facing a marriage penalty. They cannot have enough money left \nto pay down our debt and have the resources for a targeted tax cut \nalong the lines I have suggested.\n  I see my colleague from Wisconsin has come to the floor. I know my \ntime is limited. I ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator has 16 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor to my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one thing observers of the Senate are \nnot likely to see today is anyone defending the marriage penalty. The \ntax code should not discourage the act of getting married, and it \nshould not encourage divorce.\n  There is widespread agreement that Congress should pass marriage \npenalty relief. The President's budget included a proposal to address \nthe marriage penalty. And last week, the Senate voted 99-1 in favor of \nsense of the Senate language calling on us to ``pass marriage penalty \ntax relief legislation that begins a phase down of this penalty in \n2001.''\n  The marriage penalty is particularly burdensome for lower-income \ncouples--and many young couples don't have much to spare. For some of \nthese couples, the amount of their taxes could actually affect their \ndecision whether or not to marry. Luckily, in the vast majority of \ncases, in the words of a recent law review article, love triumphs over \nmoney.\n  But in this debate that the majority has scheduled for the week \nbefore the April 15 tax deadline, one can be forgiven for harboring the \nsuspicion that more than marriage penalty relief is involved.\n  For one thing, on this subject on which there is a broad consensus, \nthe majority appears unwilling to work out a compromise with the \nPresident or with Democrats. Rather, the majority seems driven more to \ncreate election-year campaign talking points than real tax relief.\n  For another thing, on this bill, for the third time this year \nalready, the majority seems willing to plow ahead on major tax cut \nlegislation before even adopting its own fiscal plan in the form of a \nbudget resolution. To recount, in early February, the Senate passed a \n$103 billion tax cut as part of the bankruptcy bill. Then, in early \nMarch, the Senate passed another $21 billion tax cut for education \nsavings accounts. And now in April, the Senate is considering another \n$248 billion in tax cuts labeled as marriage penalty relief. So the \nmajority this year has already moved $372 billion in tax cuts--at an \naverage rate of $124 billion a month--before it has even adopted its \nbudget resolution.\n  And you need to add to that the approximately $80 billion in debt \nservices that tax cuts of such a size would require. That yields \nroughly $450 billion of the surplus that this Senate will have spent in \njust three months--an average of $150 billion a month. And that doesn't \neven count the health tax cut provisions that we can expect in the \nPatients Bill of Rights bill. And that also doesn't count the other \nmulti-billion-dollar reconciliation tax cut that the budget resolution \ncalls for no later than September 22.\n  Some said that the majority brought up the amendment to the \nConstitution to prevent flag burning when they did because the American \nLegion was having a convention that week. Now, it seems that they are \nbringing up the marriage penalty because tax day is coming. What the \nmajority chooses to call up seem more driven by the calendar than by \nlegislative sense.\n  Moving so many tax bills so early in the year raises another \nsuspicion as well--that if we waited, we would find that there is not \nenough money to do everything that the majority wants.\n  The Senate's consideration of a tax cut this size is also premature \nbecause the majority continues to push tax cuts before doing anything \nto extend the life of Social Security, before doing anything to extend \nthe life of Medicare, or before doing anything to make prescription \ndrugs available to seniors who need them.\n  Yes, Social Security is projected to run cash surpluses on the order \nof $100 billion a year for the next decade, but beginning in 2015, it \nis projected to pay out more in benefits than it takes in in payroll \ntaxes. Medicare Hospital Insurance benefit payments will exceed payroll \ntax revenues as early as 2007.\n  The tax cuts that the Senate has passed and that we debate today \nwould phase in so that their full impact would come just as the Nation \nbegins to need surpluses in the non-Social Security budget to help \naddress these Social Security and Medicare commitments.\n  In 2010, the marriage penalty bill before us today alone will cost \n$40 billion a year. Rather than pay down our debt to free up resources \nfor our coming needs, these tax cuts would add to our future \nobligations. To commit resources of this magnitude without addressing \nthe long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare is simply \nirresponsible.\n  The size of the tax cut before us today flows in large part from its \nscatter-shot approach. According to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, it delivers a comparable amount of benefits to those who \nenjoy marriage bonuses as to those who suffer from marriage penalties. \nAnd according to Citizens for Tax Justice, more than two-thirds of this \ntax bill's benefits would go to the fewer than one-third of couples \nwith incomes of more than $75,000. Are tax cuts for the well-off really \nour most pressing national need? A more targeted approach could save \nmoney and leave us better prepared to address our coming fiscal \ncommitments.\n  Our economy is strong and has benefitted from sound fiscal policy. \nMonday's papers reported that unemployment has remained below 4\\1/2\\ \npercent for fully two years now. The Nation continues to enjoy the \nlongest economic expansion in its history. And home ownership is at its \nhighest rate on record.\n  We have this strong economy in no small part because of the \nresponsible fiscal policy we have had since 1993. That responsible \npolicy has meant that the government has borrowed less from the public \nthan it otherwise would have, and indeed is projected to have paid down \nnearly $300 billion in publicly-held debt by October. No longer does \nthe government crowd out private borrowers from the credit market. No \nlonger does the government bid up the price of borrowing--interest \nrates--to finance its huge debt. Our fiscal policy has thus allowed \ninterest rates to remain lower than they otherwise would be, and \nbusinesses large and small have found it easier to invest and spur new \ngrowth.\n  Passing large tax cuts like the one before us today without \naddressing the long-run needs of Social Security and Medicare risks \nreturning to the budgets of 1992, when the government ran a unified \nbudget deficit of $290 billion and a non-Social Security deficit of \n$340 billion. It risks returning to the Congressional Budget Office's \n1993 projection of a unified budget deficit that would climb to $513 \nbillion in 2001, instead of the unified budget surplus of $181 billion \nand non-Social Security surplus of $15 billion that we now enjoy.\n  Any young couple would be well-advised to do a little financial \nplanning before entering into a marriage. We can ask the Senate to do \nno less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know there will be a lot of time for \ndebate\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\nlater today and tomorrow, and perhaps in the future, on the so-called \nmarriage penalty. I want to respond to two points that several of our \nRepublican colleagues have made with respect to the Finance Committee \nbill, the majority bill.\n  The first claim is that the Finance Committee bill, the majority \nbill, eliminates the marriage penalty. Not true. It does reduce the \nmarriage penalty for some people, to some extent, but it does not \neliminate the marriage penalty.\n  Why do I say that? Well, first, let me show you this chart. This \nchart basically shows, in the main, that there are 65 provisions in the \nTax Code that create a marriage tax penalty; 65 different provisions in \nthe code create the so-called marriage tax penalty, the inequity that \nmarried people pay. The Republican bill, the Finance Committee bill, \naddresses some of them. How many? Out of the total of 65, how many do \nyou suppose the Finance Committee addresses? A grand total of three. So \n62 of the provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that cause a marriage \ntax penalty are not addressed by the Finance Committee bill.\n  Let me give you an example. One is the deduction for interest on \nstudent loans. The phaseout for this begins at $40,000 for unmarried \nindividuals and about $60,000 for joint return filers. So if two young \npeople each earn $35,000 and they marry, they get hit harder by the \nphaseout. In other words, they pay a marriage tax penalty. It is not \ncovered by the Finance Committee bill. It is covered by the alternative \nto be offered by Senator Moynihan.\n  Another example in the Finance Committee bill is not covered. A \nmarriage tax penalty that is not taken care of is Social Security for \nseniors. The tax threshold for Social Security for seniors is $25,000 \nfor individuals and $32,000 for couples. Again, a marriage tax penalty. \nWhat does the Republican bill, the Finance Committee bill, do about \nthese provisions? Nothing. They are not among the three penalties the \nRepublican bill addresses. The Democratic proposal, in contrast, \naddresses all 65 marriage tax penalty provisions--all of them. Not 3, \nnot 4, not 5, but all of them, all 65.\n  So, again, the Finance Committee bill does not eliminate the marriage \ntax penalty. The Democratic alternative does.\n  There is a second point made on the floor today that I would like to \naddress. About half of the relief in the Finance Committee bill goes to \npeople who don't pay a marriage tax penalty today. They get a so-called \nbonus, or they get neither a penalty nor a bonus. That is this chart. \nThis chart shows that less than half of the relief in the majority bill \ngoes to the marriage tax penalty; that is, more than half goes to \npeople who don't have a marriage tax penalty, who are already in a \nbonus situation.\n  Some argue, well, gee, we should not penalize couples, such as those \nwith a stay-at-home spouse, by denying them the same tax cut we provide \nto couples who face a marriage tax penalty. Frankly, that is a red \nherring, as lawyers say. That is totally beside the point. Obviously, \nwe have nothing against people who receive a tax bonus. Nobody wants to \npenalize them. But let's be honest. If we are providing half the relief \nto people who don't pay a marriage tax penalty, it is simply not a \nmarriage tax penalty bill anymore; it is a tax cut bill, and we should \nevaluate the bill on that basis.\n  Let's talk about singles, for example. The marriage tax penalty \nrelief bill that we are talking about is going to proportionally put \nmore burden on individuals, single taxpayers, on widows who are not \nheads of households, widowers. They are going to be hit indirectly \nbecause of the action that will probably be taken at a later date on \nthis floor. In the main, this is not a marriage tax penalty bill out of \nthe Finance Committee; it is primarily a tax cut bill.\n\n  That kind of tax cut compared with other priorities may or may not \nmake sense. What about prescription drugs, long-term care, retirement \nsecurity? I don't think we have addressed those issues enough on this \nfloor; that is, trying to determine what our priorities should be, \ngiven the limited number of dollars we have in the budget surplus.\n  Another thing. Viewed as a tax cut, the majority bill is completely \narbitrary. There is no particular rhyme or reason to it. If you are \nmarried and pay a marriage tax penalty, you get a tax cut. If you are \nmarried and pay no marriage tax penalty, you get a tax cut. That is \nwhat the Finance Committee bill does, in the main. If you are married \nand get a tax bonus, you still get a tax cut. That is what the \ncommittee bill does.\n  If you are single, you get no tax cut. In fact, the disparity between \nmarried and single taxpayers widens to where it was before 1969.\n  Think about this for a moment. If you are married, have no children, \nyou are receiving the so-called marriage bonus, you get a tax cut. If, \non the other hand, you are a single mom and you have three kids, you \nget zero tax cut. Is that what we want to do?\n  So the Finance Committee bill doesn't eliminate the marriage penalty. \nIt simply does not. Sixty-two of the marriage penalties in the code are \nnot addressed by the Finance Committee bill. Only three are.\n  There are many others I have not mentioned which are very big and \nhave a very big effect.\n  In addition, the majority committee bill provides a large tax cut \nunrelated to the marriage tax penalty. It is a large tax cut which has \nnothing to do with the marriage tax penalty.\n  I am saying briefly, because my time is about to expire, that there \nare some major flaws in the majority bill. I have only touched on a \ncouple of them. There are many more which will be brought out later in \nthe debate.\n  I urge my colleagues, people around the country watching this on C-\nSPAN, other offices, and the press to take a good look at the majority \nbill because there are some real problems with it. I hope we can \nstraighten them out and fix them very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2575-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2575-S2586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORKER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report S. 2323 by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2323) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 to clarify the treatment of stock options under the Act.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the quorum call not be charged against \neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to speak on behalf of the \npending measure, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, which the Senate \nwill pass shortly.\n  This bipartisan bill will ensure that American workers can receive \nlucrative stock options from their employers--once considered the \nexclusive perk of corporate executives.\n  Senator Dodd and I have worked closely with Senators Jeffords and \nEnzi, Abraham, Bennett, and Lieberman, the Department of Labor, and \nothers to develop this critical bill.\n  We have the support of groups representing business and workers, as \nwell as Secretary Alexis Herman. In short, everybody wins with this \nproposal.\n  All over the country today, forward-thinking employers are offering \nnew financial opportunities--such as stock options--to hourly \nemployees.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that our 1930's vintage labor laws might \nnot allow the normal workers of the 21st century to reap these \nbenefits.\n  When we realized this, we decided to fix this problem. It would be a \ntravesty for us to let old laws steal this chance for the average \nemployee to share in his or her company's economic growth.\n  The Workers Economic Opportunity Act is really very simple. It says \nthat it makes no difference if you work in the corporate boardroom or \non the factory floor--everyone should be able to share in the success \nof the company.\n  In sum, the bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure \nthat employer-provided stock option programs are allowed, just like \nemployee bonuses already are.\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\n  Also, this legislation includes a broad ``safe harbor'' that \nspecifies that employers have no liability because of any stock options \nor similar programs that they have given to employees in the past.\n  I hope that this bill will be the first of many commonsense efforts \nto drag old labor and employment laws into the new millennium.\n  Mr. President, we need to pass this law. The Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors recently estimated that 17 percent of firms have introduced \nstock option programs.\n  They went on to say that over the last two years, 37 percent of these \nemployers have broadened eligibility for their stock option programs--\nallowing even more American workers to share in their employers' \nprosperity.\n  The Employment Policy Foundation estimates between 9.4 million and \n25.8 million workers receive benefits through some type of equity \nparticipation program.\n  This trend is growing, and given the current state of the economy, it \nis likely to continue to grow.\n  However, we have one last thing we have to do to make sure that \nAmerican workers can have this incredible opportunity--we have to pass \nthis bill.\n  Without it, our ``New Deal'' labor laws will strangle the benefits \nour ``New Economy'' offers to American workers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from \nthe United States Chamber of Commerce be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to express the support \n     of the United States Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest \n     business federation representing more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector and \n     region, for S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act.\n       Last year the U.S. Department of Labor issued an advisory \n     letter stating that companies providing stock options to \n     their employees must include the value of those options in \n     the base rate of pay for hourly workers. Employers must then \n     recalculate overtime pay over the period of time between the \n     granting and exercise of the options. This costly and \n     administratively complex process will cause many employers to \n     refrain from offering stock options and similar employee \n     equity programs to their nonexempt workers.\n       Clearly, the Fair Labor Standards Act needs to be \n     modernized to reflect the fact that many of today's hourly \n     workers receive stock options. For this reason, the Chamber \n     strongly supports S. 2323, which would exempt stock options, \n     stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase plan \n     programs from the regular rate of pay for nonexempt workers. \n     This carefully crafted legislation will provide certainty to \n     employers who want to increase employee ownership and equity \n     building by offering stock options and similar programs to \n     their hourly workers. We commend you for negotiating a bill \n     that is broadly supported and look forward to working with \n     you to ensure its passage as soon as possible in this \n     legislative session.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership in introducing S. \n     2323, legislation that is important to millions of American \n     workers and employers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsponsors' statement of legislative intent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Joint Statement of Legislative Intent by the Sponsors of S. 2323, the \n                    Worker Economic Opportunity Act\n\n\n                      I. Introduction and Purpose\n\n       The purpose of S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity \n     Act, is to allow employees who are eligible for overtime pay \n     to continue to share in workplace benefits that involve their \n     employer's stock or similar equity-based benefits. More \n     working Americans are receiving stock options or \n     opportunities to purchase stock than ever before. The Worker \n     Economic Opportunity Act updates the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     to ensure that rank-and-file employees and management can \n     share in their employer's economic well being in the same \n     manner.\n       Employers have provided stock and equity-based benefits to \n     upper level management for decades. However, it is only \n     recently that employers have begun to offer these programs in \n     a broad-based manner to non-exempt employees. Historically, \n     most employees had little contact with employer-provided \n     equity devices outside of a 401(k) plan. But today, many \n     employers, from a broad cross-section of industry, have begun \n     offering their employees opportunities to purchase employer \n     stock at a modest discount, or have provided stock options to \n     rank and file employees; and they have even provided outright \n     grants of stock under certain circumstances.\n       The Federal Reserve Board of Governors recently estimated \n     that 17 percent of large firms have introduced a stock \n     options program and 37 percent have broadened eligibility for \n     their stock option programs in the last two years.\\1\\ The \n     Employment Policy Foundation estimates between 9.4 million \n     and 25.8 million workers receive benefits through some type \n     of equity participation program.\\2\\ The trend is growing, and \n     given the current state of the economy, it is likely to \n     continue.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The tremendous success of our economy over the last several \n     years has been largely attributed to the high technology \n     sector. One of the things that our technology companies have \n     succeeded at is creating an atmosphere in which all employees \n     share the same goal: the success of the company. By vesting \n     all employees in the success of the business, stock options \n     and other equity devices have become an important tool to \n     create businesses with unparalleled productivity. The Worker \n     Economic Opportunity Act will encourage more employers to \n     provide opportunities for equity participation to their \n     employees, further expanding the benefits that inure from \n     equity participation.\n\n\n                II. Background and Need for Legislation\n\n     A. Background on stock options and related devices\n       Employers use a variety of equity devices to share the \n     benefits of equity ownership with their employees. As the \n     employer's stock appreciates, these devices provide a tool to \n     attract and retain employees, an increasingly difficult task \n     during a time of record economic growth and low unemployment \n     in the United States. These programs also foster a broader \n     sense of commitment to a common goal--the maintenance and \n     improvement of the company's performance--among all employees \n     nationally and even internationally, and thus provide an \n     alignment between the interests of employees with the \n     interests of the company and its shareholders. They can also \n     reinforce the evolving employer-employee relationship, with \n     employees viewed as stakeholders.\n       Employer stock option and stock programs come in all \n     different types and formats. The Worker Economic Opportunity \n     Act focuses on the most common types: stock option, stock \n     appreciation right, and employee stock purchase programs.\n       Stock Option Programs.--Stock options provide the right to \n     purchase the employer's securities for a fixed period of \n     time. Stock option programs vary greatly by employer. \n     However, two main types exist: nonqualified and qualified \n     option programs.\\3\\ Most programs are nonqualified stock \n     option programs, meaning that the structure of the program \n     does not protect the employee from being taxed at the time of \n     exercise. However, the mechanics of stock option programs are \n     very similar regardless of whether they are nonqualified or \n     qualified. Some of these characteristics are described below.\n       Grants. An employer grants to employees a certain number of \n     options to purchase shares of the employer's stock. The \n     exercise price may be around the fair market value of the \n     stock at the time of the grant, or it may be discounted below \n     fair market value to provide the employee an incentive to \n     participate in the option program.\n       Vesting. Most stock option programs have some sort of \n     requirement to wait some period after the grant to benefit \n     from the options, often called a vesting period. After the \n     period, employees typically may exercise their options by \n     exchanging the options for stock at the exercise price at any \n     time before the option expires, which is typically up to ten \n     years. In some cases, options may vest on a schedule, for \n     example, with a third of the options vesting each year over a \n     three-year period. In addition to vesting on a date certain, \n     some options may vest if the company hits a certain goal, \n     such as reaching a certain stock price for a certain number \n     of days. Some programs also provide for accelerated or \n     automatic vesting in certain circumstances such as when an \n     employee retires or dies before the vesting period has run, \n     where there is change in corporate control or when an \n     employee's employment is terminated.\n       Exercise. Under both qualified and nonqualified stock \n     option programs, an employee can exchange the options, along \n     with sufficient cash to pay the exercise price of the \n     options, for shares of stock. Because many rank-and-file \n     employees cannot afford to pay the cost of buying the stock \n     at the option price in cash, many employers have given their \n     employees the opportunity for ``cashless'' exercise, either \n     for cash or for stock, under nonqualified option plans. In a \n     cashless exercise for cash, an employee gives options to a \n     broker or program administrator, this party momentarily \n     ``lends'' the employee the money to purchase the requisite \n     number of shares at the grant price, and then immediately \n     sells the shares. The employee receives the difference \n     between the market price and the exercise price of the stock \n     (the profit), less transaction fees. In a cashless exercise \n     for stock, enough shares are sold to cover the cost of buying \n     the\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n     shares the employee will retain. In either case, the employee \n     is spared from having to provide the initial cash to purchase \n     the stock at the option price.\n       An employee's options usually expire at the end of the \n     option period. An employee may forfeit the right to exercise \n     the options, in whole or in part, under certain \n     circumstances, including upon separation from the employer. \n     However, some programs allow the employee to exercise the \n     options (sometimes for a limited period of time) after they \n     leave employment with the employer.\n       Stock Appreciation Rights.--Stock appreciation rights \n     (SARs) operate similarly to stock options. They are the \n     rights to receive the cash value of the appreciation on an \n     underlying stock or equity based security. The stock may be \n     publicly traded, privately held, or may be based on valued, \n     but unregistered, stock or stock equivalent. The rights are \n     issued at a fixed price for a fixed period of time and can be \n     issued at a discount, carry a vesting period, and are \n     exercisable over a period of time. SARs are often used when \n     an employer cannot issue stock because the stock is listed on \n     a foreign exchange, or regulatory or financial barriers make \n     stock grants impracticable.\n       Employee Stock Purchase Plans.--Employee stock purchase \n     plans (ESPPs) give employees the opportunity to purchase \n     employer stock, usually at up to a 15 percent discount, by \n     either regularly or periodically paying the employer directly \n     or by having after-tax money withdrawn as a payroll \n     deduction. Like option programs, ESPPs can be qualified or \n     nonqualified.\n       Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code \\4\\ sets forth the \n     factors for a qualified ESPP. The ability to participate must \n     be offered to all employees, and employees must voluntarily \n     choose whether to participate in the program. The employer \n     can offer its stock to employees at up to a 15 percent \n     discount off of the fair market value of the stock, \n     determined at the time the option to purchase stock is \n     granted or at the time the stock is actually purchased. The \n     employee is required to hold the stock for one or two years \n     after the option is granted to receive capital gains \n     treatment. If the employee sells the stock before the \n     requisite period, any gain made on the sale is treated as \n     ordinary income.\n       Nonqualified ESPPs are usually similar to qualified ESPPs, \n     but they lack one or more qualifying features. For example, \n     the plan may apply only to one segment of employees, or may \n     provide for a greater discount.\n     B. The Fair Labor Standards Act and stock options\n       The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \\5\\ (FLSA) establishes \n     workplace protections including a minimum hourly wage and \n     overtime compensation for covered employees, record keeping \n     requirements and protections against child labor, among other \n     provisions. A cornerstone of the FLSA is the requirement that \n     an employer pay its nonexempt employees overtime for all \n     hours worked over 40 in a week at one and one-half times the \n     employee's regular rate of pay.\\6\\ The term ``regular rate'' \n     is broadly defined in the statute to mean ``all remuneration \n     for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee.'' \\7\\\n       Section 207(e) of the statute excludes certain payments \n     from an employee's regular rate of pay to encourage employers \n     to provide them, without undermining employees' fundamental \n     right to overtime pay. Excluded payments include holiday \n     bonuses or gifts,\\8\\ discretionary bonuses,\\9\\ bona fide \n     profit sharing plans,\\10\\ bona fide thrift or savings \n     plans,\\11\\ and bona fide old-age, retirement, life, accident \n     or health or similar benefits plans.\\12\\ By excluding these \n     payments from the definition of ``regular rate,'' \\13\\ \n     Congress recognized that certain kinds of benefits provided \n     to employees are not within the generally accepted meaning of \n     compensation for work performed.\n       Thus, by excluding these payments from the regular rate in \n     section 207(e) of the FLSA, Congress encouraged employers to \n     provide these payments and benefits to employees. The \n     encouragement has worked well--employees now expect to \n     receive from their employer at least some of these benefits \n     (i.e., healthcare), which today, on average, comprise almost \n     30 percent of employees' gross compensation./14/ For similar \n     reasons, Congress decided that the value and income from \n     stock option, SAR and ESPP programs should also be \n     excluded from the regular rate, because they allow \n     employees to share in the future success of their \n     companies.\n     C. The Department of Labor's opinion letter on stock options\n       The impetus behind the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is \n     the broad dissemination of a February 1999 advisory opinion \n     letter \\15\\ regarding stock options issued by the Department \n     of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, the agency charged with \n     the administration of the FLSA. The letter involved an \n     employer's stock option program wherein its employees would \n     be notified of the program three months before the options \n     were granted, and some rank-and-file employees employed by \n     the company on the grant date would receive options. The \n     options would have a two-year vesting period, with \n     accelerated vesting if certain events occurred. The employer \n     would also automatically exercise any unexercised options on \n     behalf of the employees the day before the program ended.\\16\\\n       The opinion letter indicated that the stock option program \n     did not meet any of the existing exemptions to the regular \n     rate under the FLSA, although it did not explain the reasons \n     in any detail. Later, the Administration's testimony before \n     the House Workforce Protections Subcommittee explained that \n     the stock option program did not meet the gift, discretionary \n     bonus, or profit sharing exceptions to the regular rate \n     because, among other reasons, it required employees to do \n     something as a condition of receiving the options--to remain \n     employed with the company for a period of time.\\17\\ Such a \n     condition is not allowed under the current regular rate \n     exclusions. The testimony also noted that the program was not \n     excludable under the thrift or savings plan exception because \n     the employees were only allowed to exercise their options \n     using a cashless method of exercise, and thus the employees \n     could not keep the stock as savings or an investment.\\18\\\n       The opinion letter stated that the employer would be \n     required to include any profits made from the exercise of the \n     options in the regular rate of pay of its nonexempt \n     employees. In particular, the profits would have to be \n     included in the employee's regular rate for the shorter of \n     the time between the grant date and the exercise date, or the \n     two years prior to exercise.19\n       Section 207(e)'s exclusions to the regular rate did not \n     clearly exempt the profits of stock options or similar equity \n     devices from the regular rate, and thus from the overtime \n     calculation. Thus, the Department of Labor's opinion letter \n     provided a permissible reading of the statute. A practical \n     effect of the Department of Labor's interpretation was stated \n     by J. Randall MacDonald, Executive Vice President of Human \n     Resources and Administration at GTE during a March 2 House \n     Workforce Protections Subcommittee hearing on the issue: \n     ``[i]f the Fair Labor Standards Act is not corrected to \n     reverse this policy, we will no longer be able to offer stock \n     options to our nonexempt employees.'' 20\n       As the contents of the letter became generally known in the \n     business community and on Capitol Hill, it became clear that \n     the letter raised an issue under the FLSA that previously had \n     not been contemplated. It further became clear that an \n     amendment to the FLSA would be needed to change the law \n     specifically to address stock options.\n       A legislative solution was not only supported by employers \n     at the House hearing, it was also supported by employees and \n     unions. Patricia Nazemetz, Vice President of Human Resources \n     for Xerox Corporation, read a letter from the Union of \n     Needlework, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), the \n     union that represents many Xerox manufacturing and \n     distribution employees, in which the International Vice \n     President stated:\n       ``Xerox's UNITE chapter would strongly urge Congress to \n     pass legislation exempting stock options and other forms of \n     stock grants from the definition of the regular rate for the \n     purposes of calculating overtime. . . . It is only recently \n     that Xerox has made bargaining unit employees eligible to \n     receive both stock options and stock grants. Without a \n     clarification to the FLSA, we are afraid Xerox may not offer \n     stock options or other forms of stock grants to bargaining \n     unit employees in the future.'' 21\n       At the House hearing, the Administration also acknowledged \n     that the problem needed to be fixed legislatively in a \n     flexible manner, ``Based on the information we have been able \n     to obtain, there appears to be wide variations in the scope, \n     nature and design of stock option programs. There is no one \n     common model for a program, suggesting the need for a \n     flexible approach. Given the wide variety and complexity \n     of programs, we believe that the best solution would be to \n     address this matter legislatively.'' 22\n       The general agreement on the need to fix the problem among \n     these diverse interests led to the development of the Worker \n     Economic Opportunity Act.\n\n\n            III. Explanation of the Bill and Sponsors' Views\n\n       Congress worked closely with the Department of Labor to \n     develop this important legislation. The sections below \n     reflect the discussions between the sponsors and the \n     Department of Labor during the development of the \n     legislation, and the sponsors' intent and their understanding \n     of the legislation.\n     A. Definition of bona fide ESPP\n       For the purposes of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, a \n     bona fide employee stock purchase plan includes an ESPP that \n     is (1) a qualified ESPP under section 423 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code;23 or (2) a plan that meets the \n     criteria identified below.\n       1. Qualified employee stock purchase plans\n       Qualified ESPPs, known as section 423 plans, comprise the \n     overwhelming majority of stock purchase plans. Thus, the \n     intent of the legislation is to deem ``bona fide'' all plans \n     that meet the criteria of section 423.\n       2. Nonqualified employee stock purchase plans\n       As described above, section 423 plans are considered bona \n     fide ESPPs. Further, those ESPPs that do not meet the \n     criteria of section 423, but that meet the following criteria \n     also qualify as bona fide ESPPs:\n       (a) the plan allows employees, on a regular or periodic \n     basis, to voluntarily provide funds, or to elect to authorize \n     periodic payroll deductions, for the purchase at a future \n     time of shares of the employer's stock;\n       (b) the plan sets the purchase price of the stock as at \n     least 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time \n     the option is granted or at the time the stock is purchased; \n     and\n       (c) the plan does not permit a nonexempt employee to accrue \n     options to purchase stock at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of \n     fair market value of such stock (determined either at the \n     time the option is granted or the time the option is \n     exercised) for each calendar year.\n       The sponsors note that many new types of ESPPs are being \n     developed, particularly by\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\n     companies outside the United States, and that many of these \n     companies may also intend to apply them to their U.S.-based \n     employees. These purchase plans have several attributes which \n     make them appear to be more like savings plans than \n     traditional U.S. stock purchase plans, such as a period of \n     payroll deductions of between three and five years, or an \n     employer provided ``match'' in the form of stock or options \n     to the employee.\n       Further many companies are developing plans that are \n     similar to section 423 plans. The sponsors believe that it is \n     in the best interests of employees for the Secretary of Labor \n     to review these and other new types of plans carefully in the \n     light of the purpose of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act--\n     to encourage employers to provide opportunities for equity \n     participation to employees--and to allow section 7(e), as \n     amended, to accommodate a wide variety of programs, where it \n     does not undermine employees' fundamental right to overtime \n     pay. It is the sponsors' vision that this entire law be \n     flexible and forward-looking and that the Department of Labor \n     apply and interpret it consistently with this vision.\n     B. ``Value or Income'' is defined broadly\n       The hallmark of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is that \n     section 7(e)(8) provides that any value or income derived \n     from stock option, SAR or bona fide ESPP programs is excluded \n     from the regular rate of pay. For this reason, the phrase \n     ``value or income'' is construed broadly to mean any value, \n     profit, gain, or other payment obtained, recognized or \n     realized as a result of, or in connection with, the \n     provision, award, grant, issuance, exercise or payment of \n     stock options, SARs, or stock issued or purchased pursuant to \n     a bona fide ESPP program established by the employer.\n       This broad definition means, for example, that any nominal \n     value that a stock option or stock appreciation right may \n     carry before it is exercised is excluded from the regular \n     rate. Similarly, the value of the stock or the income in the \n     form of cash is excluded after options are exercised, as is \n     the income earned from the stock in the form of dividends or \n     ultimately the gains earned, if any, on the sale of the \n     stock. The discount on a stock option, SAR or stock purchase \n     under a ESPP program is likewise excludable.\n     C. The act preserves programs which are otherwise excludable \n         under existing regular rate exemptions\n       The Worker Economic Opportunity Act recognizes two ways \n     that employer equity programs may be excluded from the \n     regular rate. Such equity programs may be excluded if they \n     meet the existing exemptions to the regular rate pursuant to \n     Section 7(e)(1)-(7), which apply to contributions and sums \n     paid by employers regardless of whether such payments are \n     made in cash or in grants of stock or other equity based \n     vehicles, and provided such payment or grant is consistent \n     with the existing regulations promulgated under Section 7(e). \n     Employer equity plans also may be excluded under new section \n     7(e)(8) added by the Worker Economic Opportunity Act.\n       This is reaffirmed in new section 207(e)(8), which makes \n     clear that the enactment of section 7(e)(8) carries no \n     negative implication about the scope of the preceding \n     paragraphs of section (e). Rather, the sponsors understand \n     that some grants and rights that do not meet all the \n     requirements of section 7(e)(8) may continue to qualify for \n     exemption under an earlier exclusion. For example, programs \n     that grant options or SARs that do not have a vesting period \n     may be otherwise excludable from the regular rate if they \n     meet another section (7)(e) exclusion. This would be true \n     even if the option was granted at less than 85% of fair \n     market value. This language was not intended to prevent \n     grants or rights that meet some but not all of the \n     requirements of an earlier exemption in 7(e) from being \n     exempt under the newly created exemption.\n     D. Basic communication to employees required because it helps \n         ensure a successful program\n       For grants made under a stock option, SAR or bona fide ESPP \n     program to qualify for the exemption under new section \n     7(e)(8), their basic terms and conditions must be \n     communicated to participating employees either at the \n     beginning of the employee's participation in the program or \n     at the time of grant. This requirement was put into the \n     legislation to recognize that when employees understand the \n     mechanics and the implications of the equity devices they are \n     given, they can more fully participate in exercising \n     meaningful choices with respect to those devices. As \n     discussed below, this is a simple concept, it is not intended \n     to be a complicated or burdensome requirement.\n       1. Terms and conditions to be communicated to employees\n       Employers must communicate the material terms and \n     conditions of the stock option, stock appreciation right or \n     employee stock purchase program to employees to ensure that \n     they have sufficient information to decide whether to \n     participate in the program. With respect to options, these \n     terms include basic information on the number of options \n     granted, the number of shares granted per option, the grant \n     price, the grant date or dates, the length of any applicable \n     vesting period(s) and the dates when the employees will first \n     be able to exercise options or rights, under what conditions \n     the options must be forfeited or surrendered, the exercise \n     methods an employee may use (such as cash for stock, cashless \n     for cash or stock, etc.), any restrictions on stock purchased \n     through options, and the duration of the option, and what \n     happens to unexercised options at the end of the exercise \n     period. Pending issuance of any regulations, an employer who \n     communicated the information in the prior sentence is to be \n     deemed to have communicated the terms and conditions of the \n     grant. Similar information should be provided regarding SARs \n     or ESPPs.\n       2. The mode of communications\n       The legislation does not specify any particular mode of \n     communication of relevant information, and no particular \n     method of communication is required, as long as the method \n     chosen reasonably communicates the information to employees \n     in an understandable fashion. For example, employers may \n     notify their employees of an option grant by letter, and \n     later provide a formal employee handbook, or other method \n     such as a link to a location on the company Intranet. Any \n     combination of communications is acceptable. The intent of \n     the legislation is to ensure that employees are provided the \n     basic information in a timely manner, not to mandate the \n     particular form of communication.\n       3. The timing of communications\n       The legislation specifies that the employer is to \n     communicate the terms and conditions of the stock option, SAR \n     and ESPP programs to employees at or before the beginning of \n     the employee's participation in the program or at the time \n     the employee receives a grant. It is acceptable, and perhaps \n     even likely, that the relevant information on a program will \n     be disseminated in a combination of communications over time. \n     This approach allows flexibility and acknowledges that types \n     of participation vary greatly between stock option and SAR \n     programs, on the one hand, and ESPPs on the other.\n       For example, under an ESPP, an employee may choose to begin \n     payroll deductions in January, but not actually have the \n     option to purchase stock until June. By contrast, with an \n     option or SAR program, employees are given the options or \n     rights at the outset, but those rights may not vest until \n     some year in the future.\n       The timing of the communication is flexible, because often \n     it is difficult to have materials ready for employees at the \n     beginning of a stock option or stock appreciation right \n     program, immediately following approval by the Board of \n     Directors, because of confidentiality requirements. Thus, \n     within a reasonable time following approval of a stock option \n     grant by the Board of Directors, the employer is required to \n     communicate basic information about the grant employees have \n     received. For example, an initial letter may notify the \n     employees that they have received a certain number of stock \n     options and provide the basic information about the program. \n     More detailed information about the program may precede or \n     follow the grant in formats such as an employee handbook, \n     options pamphlet, or an Intranet site that provides options \n     information.\n     E. Exercisability criteria applicable only to stock options \n         and SARs\n       As discussed above, a common feature in grants of stock \n     options and SARs is a vesting or holding period, which under \n     current practice may be as short as a few months or as long \n     as a number of years. For a stock option or SAR to be \n     excluded from the regular rate pursuant to the Worker \n     Economic Opportunity Act, new section 7(e)(8) requires that \n     the grant or right generally cannot be exercisable for at \n     least six months after the date of grant.\n       For stock option grants that include a vesting requirement, \n     typically an option will become exercisable after the vesting \n     period ends. Some option grants vest gradually in accordance \n     with a schedule. For example, a portion of the employee's \n     options may vest after six months, with the remaining portion \n     vesting three months thereafter. Options may also vest in \n     connection with an event, such as the stock reaching a \n     certain price or the company attaining a performance target.\n       In addition, the sponsors recognize that a grant that is \n     vested may not be currently exercisable by the employee \n     because of an employer's requirement that the employee hold \n     the option for a minimum period prior to exercise. In other \n     words, there may be an additional period of time after the \n     vesting period during which the option remains \n     unexerciseable. An option or SAR may meet the exercisability \n     requirements of the bill without regard to the reason why the \n     right to exercise is delayed.\n       Further, if a single grant of options or SARs includes some \n     options exercisable after six months while others are \n     exercisable earlier, then those exercisable after the six \n     month period will meet the exercisability requirement even if \n     the others do not. The determination is made option by \n     option, SAR by SAR. In addition, if exercisability is tied to \n     an event, the determination of whether the six-month \n     requirement is met is based on when the event actually \n     occurs. Thus, for example, if an option is exercisable only \n     after an initial public offering (IPO) and the IPO occurs \n     seven months after grant, the option shall be deemed to have \n     met the provision's exercisability requirement.\n       However, section 7(e)(8)(B) specifically recognizes that \n     there are a number of special circumstances when it is \n     permissible for an employer to allow for earlier exercise to \n     occur (in less than 6 months) without loss of the exemption. \n     For example, an employer or plan may provide that a grant may \n     vest or\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\n     otherwise become exercisable earlier than six months because \n     of an employee's disability, death, or retirement. The \n     sponsors encourage the Secretary to consider and evaluate \n     other changes in employees' status or circumstances.\n       Earlier exercise is also permitted in connection with a \n     change in corporate ownership. The term change in ownership \n     is intended to include events commonly considered changes in \n     ownership under general practice for options and SARs. For \n     example, the term would include the acquisition by a party of \n     a percentage of the stock of the corporation granting the \n     option or SAR, a significant change in the corporation's \n     board of directors within 24 months, the approval by the \n     shareholders of a plan of merger, and the disposition of \n     substantially all of the corporation's assets.\n       The sponsors believe it important to allow employers the \n     flexibility to construct plans that allow for these earlier \n     exercise situations. However, this section is not intended to \n     in any way require employers to include these or any other \n     early exercise circumstances in their plans.\n     F. Stock option and SAR programs may be awarded at fair \n         market value or discounted up to and including 15%\n       Stock options and SARs generally are granted to employees \n     at around fair market value or at a discount. New section \n     7(e)(8)(B) recognizes that grants may be at a discount, but \n     that the discount cannot be more than a 15% discount off of \n     the fair market value of the stock (or in the case of stock \n     appreciation rights, the underlying stock, security or other \n     similar interest).\n       A reasonable valuation method must be used to determine \n     fair market value at the time of grant. For example, in the \n     case of a publicly traded stock, it would be reasonable to \n     determine fair market value based on averaging the high and \n     low trading price of the stock on the date of the grant. \n     Similarly, it would be reasonable to determine fair market \n     value as being equal to the average closing price over a \n     period of days ending with or shortly before the grant date \n     (or the average of the highs and lows on each day). In the \n     case of a non-publicly traded stock, any reasonable valuation \n     that is made in good faith and based on reasonable valuation \n     principles must be used.\n       The sponsors understand that the exercise price of stock \n     options and SARs is sometimes adjusted in connection with \n     recapitalizations and other corporate events. Accounting and \n     other tax guidelines have been developed for making these \n     adjustments in a way that does not modify a participant's \n     profit opportunity. Any adjustment conforming with these \n     guidelines does not create an issue under the 15% limit on \n     discounts.\n     G. Employee participation in equity programs must be \n         voluntary\n       New section (8)(C) of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act \n     states that the exercise of any grant or right must be \n     voluntary. Voluntary means that the employee may or may not \n     choose not to exercise his or her grants or rights at any \n     point during the stock option, stock appreciation right, or \n     employee stock purchase program, as long as that is in \n     accordance with the terms of the program. This is a simple \n     concept and it is not to be interpreted as placing any other \n     restrictions on such programs.\n       It is the intent of the sponsors that this provision does \n     not restrict the ability of an employer to automatically \n     exercise stock options or SARs for the employee at the \n     expiration of the grant or right. However, an employer may \n     not automatically exercise stock options or SARs for an \n     employee who has notified the employer that he or she does \n     not want the employer to exercise the options or rights on \n     his or her behalf.\n       Stock option, SARs and ESPP programs may qualify under new \n     section 7(e)(8) even though the employer chooses to require \n     employees to forfeit options, grants or rights in certain \n     employee separation situations.\n     H. Performance based programs\n       The purpose of new section 7(e)(8)(D) is to set out the \n     guidelines employers must follow in order to exclude from the \n     ``regular rate'' grants of stock options, SARs, or shares of \n     stock pursuant to an ESPP program based on performance. If \n     neither the decision of whether to grant nor the decision as \n     to the size of the grant is based on performance, the \n     provisions of in new section 7(e)(8)(D) do not apply. For \n     example, grants made to employees at the time of their hire, \n     and any value or income derived from these grants, may be \n     excluded provided they meet the requirements in new sections \n     7(e)(8)(A)-(C).\n       New section 8(D) is divided into two clauses. The first, \n     clause (i), deals with awards of options awarded based on \n     pre-established goals for future performance, and the second, \n     clause (ii), deals with grants that are awarded based on past \n     performance.\n       1. Goals for future performance\n       New section 7(e)(8)(D)(i) provides that employers may tie \n     grants to future performance so long as the determinations as \n     to whether to grant and the amount of grant are based on the \n     performance of either (i) any business unit consisting of at \n     least ten employees or (ii) a facility.\n       A business unit refers to all employees in a group \n     established for an identifiable business purpose. The \n     sponsors intend that employers should have considerable \n     flexibility in defining their business units. However, the \n     unit may not merely be a pretext for measuring the \n     performance of a single employee or small group of fewer than \n     ten employees. By way of example, a unit may include any of \n     the following: (i) a department, such as the accounting or \n     tax departments of a company, (ii) a function, such as the \n     accounts receivable function within a company's accounting \n     department, (iii) a position classification, such as those \n     call-center personnel who handle initial contacts, (iv) a \n     geographical segment of a company's operations, such as \n     delivery personnel in a specified geographical area, (v) a \n     subsidiary or operating division of a company, (vi) a project \n     team, such as the group assigned to test software on various \n     computer configurations or to support a contract or a new \n     business venture.\n       With respect to the requirement to have ten or more \n     employees in a unit, this determination is based on all of \n     the employees in the unit, not just those employees who are, \n     for example, non-exempt employees.\n       A facility includes any separate location where the \n     employer conducts its business. Two or more locations that \n     would each qualify as a facility may be treated as a single \n     facility. Performance measurement based on a particular \n     facility is permitted without regard to the number of \n     employees who are working at the facility. For example, a \n     facility would include any of the following: a separate \n     office location, each separate retail store operated by a \n     company, each separate restaurant operated by a company, a \n     plant, a warehouse, or a distribution center.\n       The definitions of both a business unit and a facility are \n     intended to be flexible enough to adapt to future changes in \n     business operations. Therefore, the examples of business \n     units set forth above should be viewed with this in mind.\n       Options may be excluded from the regular rate in accordance \n     with new section 7(e)(8)(D)(i) under the following \n     circumstances:\n       Example 1--Employer announces that certain employees at the \n     Wichita, Kansas plant will receive 50 stock options if the \n     plant's production reaches a certain level by the end of the \n     year (note that in order to fit within this subsection, the \n     grant does not have to be made on a facility wide basis);\n       Example 2--Employer announces that it will grant employees \n     working on the AnyCo. account 50 stock options each if the \n     account brings in a certain amount of revenue by the end of \n     the year, provided that there are at least 10 employees on \n     the AnyCo. account.\n       Employer 3--Employer announces that certain employees will \n     receive stock options if the company reaches specified goal.\n       New section 7(e)(8)(D)(i) also makes clear that otherwise \n     qualifying grants remain excludable from the regular rate if \n     they are based on an employees' length of service or minimum \n     schedule of hours or days of work. For example, an employer \n     may make grants only to employees: (i) who have a minimum \n     number of years of service, (ii) who have been employed for \n     at least a specified number of hours of service during the \n     previous twelve month period (or other period), (iii) who are \n     employed on the grant date (or a period ending on the grant \n     date), (iv) who are regular full-time employees (i.e., not \n     part-time or seasonal), (v) who are permanent employees, or \n     (vi) who continue in service for a stated period after the \n     grant date (including any minimum required hours during this \n     period). Any or all of these conditions, and similar \n     conditions, are permissible.\n       2. Past performance\n       New section 7(e)(8)(D)(ii) clarifies that employers may \n     make determinations as to existence and amount of grants or \n     rights based on past performance, so long as the \n     determination is in the sole discretion of the employer and \n     not pursuant to any prior contract. Thus, employers have \n     broad discretion to make grants as rewards for the past \n     performance of a group of employees, even if it is not a \n     facility or business unit, or even for an individual \n     employee. The determination may be based on any performance \n     criteria, including hours of work, efficiency or \n     productivity.\n       Under new section 7(e)(8)(D)(ii), employers may develop a \n     framework under which they will provide options in the \n     future, provided that to the extent the ultimate \n     determination as to the fact of and the amount of grants or \n     rights each employee will receive is based on past \n     performance, the employer does not contractually obligate \n     itself to provide the grant or rights to an employee. Thus, \n     new section 7(e)(8)(D)(ii) would allow an employer to \n     determine in advance that it will provide 100 stock options \n     to all employees who receive ``favorable'' ratings on their \n     performance evaluations at the end of the year, and it would \n     allow the employer to advise employees, in employee handbooks \n     or otherwise, of the possibility that favorable evaluations \n     may be rewarded by option grants, so long as the employer \n     does not contractually obligate itself to provide the grants \n     or in any other way relinquish its discretion as to the \n     existence or amount of grants.\n       Similarly, the fact that an employer makes grants for \n     several years in a row based on favorable performance \n     evaluation ratings, even to the point where employees come to \n     expect them, does not mean in itself that the employer may be \n     deemed to have ``contractually obligated'' itself to provide \n     the rights.\n       Some examples of performance based grants that fit within \n     new section7(e)(8)(D)(ii) are as follows:\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n       Example A--Company A awards stock options to encourage \n     employees to identify with the company and to be creative and \n     innovative in performing their jobs. Company A's employee \n     handbook includes the following: ``Company A's stock \n     option program is a long-term incentive used to recognize \n     the potential for, and provide an incentive for, \n     anticipated future performance and contribution. Stock \n     option grants may be awarded to employees at hire, on an \n     annual basis, or both. All full-time employees who have \n     been employed for the appropriate service time are \n     eligible to be considered for annual stock option \n     grants.''\n       Company A provides stock options to most nonexempt \n     employees following their performance review. Each employee's \n     manager rates the employee during a review process, resulting \n     in a rating of from 1 to 5. The rating is based upon the \n     manager's objective and subjective analysis of the employee's \n     performance. The rating is then put into a formula to \n     determine the number of options an employee is eligible to \n     receive, based on the employee's level within the company, \n     the product line that the employee works on, and the value of \n     the product to the company's business. Employees are aware a \n     formula is used. The Company then informs the employee of the \n     number of options awarded to him or her.\n       Managers make it clear to employees that the options are \n     granted in recognition of prior performance with the \n     expectation of the employee's future performance, but no \n     contractual obligation is made to employees. This process is \n     repeated annually, with employees eligible for stock options \n     each year based on their annual performance review. Most \n     employees receive options annually based upon their \n     performance review rating and their level in the company.\n       Example B--Company B manages its program similarly to \n     company A, with some notable exceptions. Company B has a very \n     detailed performance management system, under which all \n     employees successfully meeting the expectations of their job \n     receive options. The employee's job expectations are more \n     clearly spelled out on an annual basis than under Company A's \n     plan. Once a year, the employee undergoes a formal, written, \n     performance review with his or her manager. If work is \n     satisfactory, the employee receives a predetermined but \n     unannounced number of options. Unlike Company A, which \n     provides different amounts of options to employees based upon \n     a numeric performance rating, Company B provides the same \n     number of options to all employees who receive satisfactory \n     employment evaluations. Over 90 percent of Company B's \n     employees receive options annually, and in many years, this \n     percentage exceeds 95 percent.\n       In both Example A and Example B, the employers set up in \n     advance the formula under which option decisions are made; \n     however, the decisions as to whether an individual employee \n     would receive options and how many options he or she would \n     receive was made based on past performance at the end of the \n     performance period, but not pursuant to a prior contractual \n     obligation made to the employees. The fact that the employer \n     determines a formula or program in advance does not \n     disqualify these examples from new section 7(e)(8).\n     I. Extra compensation\n       The Worker Economic Opportunity Act also amends section \n     7(h) of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. Sec.  207(h)) to ensure that the \n     income or value that results from a stock option, SAR or ESPP \n     program, and that is excluded from the regular rate by new \n     section 7(e)(8), cannot be credited by an employer toward \n     meeting its minimum wage obligations under section 6 of the \n     Act or overtime obligations under section 7 of the Act. The \n     language divides section 7(h) into two parts, 7(h)(1) and \n     7(h)(2). Section 7(h)(1) states that an employer may not \n     credit an amount, sum, or payment excluded from the regular \n     rate under existing sections 7(e)(1-7) or new section 7(e)(8) \n     towards an employer's minimum wage obligation under section 6 \n     of the Act. When section 7(h)(1) is read together with \n     section 7(h)(2), it states that an employer may not credit an \n     amount excluded under existing sections 7(e)(1-4) or new \n     section 7(e)(8) toward overtime payments. However, consistent \n     with existing 7(h), extra compensation paid by an employer \n     under sections 7(e)(5-7) may be creditable towards an \n     employer's overtime obligations. This change shall take \n     effect on the effective date but will not affect any payments \n     that are not excluded by section 7(e) and thus are included \n     in the regular rate.\n     J. The legislation includes a broad pre-effective date safe \n         harbor and transition time\n       In drafting the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, the \n     sponsors hoped to create an exemption that would be broad \n     enough to capture the diverse range of broad-based stock \n     ownership programs that are currently being offered to non-\n     exempt employees across this nation. However, in order to \n     reach a consensus, the new exemption had to be tailored to \n     comport with the existing framework of the FLSA. The result \n     is a series of requirements that stock option, SAR and ESPP \n     programs must meet in order for the proceeds of those plans \n     to fit within the newly created exemption.\n       Because of the circumstances that give rise to this \n     legislation, the pre-effective date safe harbor is \n     intentionally broader than the new exemption. The sponsors \n     did not want to penalize those employers who have been \n     offering broad-based stock option, SAR and ESPP programs \n     simply because these programs would not meet all the new \n     requirements in section 7(e)(8). Thus, the safe harbor in \n     section 2(d) of the Act comprehensively protects employers \n     from any liability or other obligations under the FLSA for \n     failing to include any value or income derived from stock \n     option, SAR and ESPP programs in a non-exempt employee's \n     regular rate of pay. The safe harbor applies to all grants or \n     rights that were obtained under such programs prior to the \n     effective date, whether or not such programs fit within the \n     new requirements of section 7(e)(8). If a grant or right was \n     initially obtained prior to the effective date, it is covered \n     by the safe harbor even though it vested later or was \n     contingent on performance that would occur later. In \n     addition, normal adjustments to a pre-effective date grant or \n     right, such as those that are triggered by a \n     recapitalization, change of control or other corporate event, \n     will not take the grant or right outside the safe harbor.\n       On a prospective basis, the sponsors realized that many \n     employers would need time to evaluate their programs in light \n     of the new law and to make the changes necessary to ensure \n     that the programs will fit within the new section 7(e)(8) \n     exemption. Consequently, the sponsors adopted a broad \n     transition provision to apply to stock option, SAR and \n     ESPP programs without regard to whether or not they meet \n     the requirements for these plans set forth in the \n     legislation. Specifically, section 2(c) of the legislation \n     contains a 90-day post enactment delayed effective date. \n     The sponsors believe that the vast majority of employers \n     who offer stock option, SAR and ESPP programs to non-\n     exempt employees will be able to use the transition period \n     in section 2(d)(1) to modify their programs to conform \n     with the requirements of the legislation.\n       In addition, the sponsors felt that there were two \n     circumstances where a further extension of this broad \n     transition relief was appropriate. First, the legislation \n     recognizes that some employers would need the consent of \n     their shareholders to change their plans. Section 2(d)(2) \n     provides an additional year of transition relief to any \n     employer with a program in place on the date this legislation \n     goes into effect that will require shareholder approval to \n     make the changes necessary to comply with the new \n     requirements of section 7(e)(8). Second, the legislation \n     extends the transition relief to cover situations wherein an \n     employer's obligations under a collective bargaining \n     agreement conflict with the requirements of this Act. Section \n     2(d)(3) eliminates any potential conflict by allowing \n     employers to fulfill their pre-existing contractual \n     obligations without fear of liability.\n\n\n                     V. Regulatory impact statement\n\n       The sponsors have determined that the bill would result in \n     some additional paperwork, time and costs to the Department \n     of Labor, which would be entrusted with implementation of the \n     Act. It is difficult to estimate the volume of additional \n     paperwork necessitated by the Act, but the sponsors do not \n     believe that it will be significant.\n\n\n                    VI. Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 2. (a) Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act--The \n     legislation amends Section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec.  207(e)) by creating a new \n     subsection, 7(e)(8), which will exclude from the definition \n     of the regular rate of pay any income or value nonexempt \n     employees derive from an employer stock option, stock \n     appreciation right, or bona fide employee stock purchase \n     program under certain circumstances. Specifically, the \n     legislation adds the following provisions to the end of \n     Section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act:\n       (8) The new exclusion provides that when an employer gives \n     its employees an opportunity to participate in a stock \n     option, stock appreciation right or a bona fide employee \n     stock purchase program (as explained in the Explanation of \n     the Bill and Sponsor's Views), any value or income received \n     by the employee as a result of the grants or rights provided \n     pursuant to the program that is not already excludable from \n     the regular rate of pay under sections 7(e)(1-7) of the Act \n     (29 U.S.C. Sec.  207(e)), will be excluded from the regular \n     rate of pay, provided the program meets the following \n     criteria--\n       (8)(A) The employer must provide employees who are \n     participating in the stock option, stock appreciation right \n     or bona fide employee stock purchase program with information \n     that explains the terms and conditions of the program. The \n     information must be provided at the time when the employee \n     begins participating in the program or at the time when the \n     employer grants the employees stock options or stock \n     appreciation rights.\n       (8)(B) As a general rule, the stock option or stock \n     appreciation right program must include at least a 6 month \n     vesting (holding) period. That means that employees will have \n     to wait at least 6 months after they receive stock options or \n     a stock appreciation rights before they are able to exercise \n     the right for stock or cash. However, in the event that the \n     employee dies, becomes disabled, or retires, or if there is a \n     change in corporate ownership that impacts the employer's \n     stock or in other circumstances set forth at a later date by \n     the Secretary in regulations, the employer has the ability to \n     allow its employees to exercise their stock options or stock \n     appreciation rights sooner. The employer may offer stock \n     options or stock appreciation rights to employees at no more \n     than a 15 percent discount off the fair market value of the\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\n     stock or the stock equivalent determined at the time of the \n     grant.\n       (8)(C) An employee's exercise of any grant or right must be \n     voluntary. This means that the employees must be able to \n     exercise their stock options, stock appreciation rights or \n     options to purchase stock under a bona fide employee stock \n     purchase program at any time permitted by the program or to \n     decline to exercise their rights. This requirement does not \n     preclude an employer from automatically exercising \n     outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights at the \n     expiration date of the program.\n       (8)(D) If an employer's grants or rights under a stock \n     option or stock appreciation right program are based on \n     performance, the following criteria apply.\n       (1) If the grants or rights are given based on the \n     achievement of previously established criteria, the criteria \n     must be limited to the performance of any business unit \n     consisting of 10 or more employees or of any sized facility \n     and may be based upon that unit's or facility's hours of \n     work, efficiency or productivity. An employer may impose \n     certain eligibility criteria on all employees before they may \n     participate in a grant or right based on these performance \n     criteria, including length of service or minimum schedules of \n     hours or days of work.\n       (2) The employer may give grants to individual employees \n     based on the employee's past performance, so long as the \n     determination remains in the sole discretion of the employer \n     and not according to any prior contract requiring the \n     employer to do so.\n       (b) Extra Compensation--The bill amends section 7(h) of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 207(h) to make clear that \n     the amounts excluded under section 7(e) of the bill are not \n     counted toward an employer's minimum wage requirement under \n     section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act and that the \n     amounts excluded under sections 7(e)(1)-(4) and new section \n     7(e)(8) are not counted toward overtime pay under section 7 \n     of the Act.\n       (c) Effective Date--The amendments made by the bill take \n     effect 90 days after the date of enactment.\n       (d) Liability of Employers--\n       (1) No employer shall be liable under the FLSA for failing \n     to include any value or income derived from any stock option, \n     stock appreciation right and employee stock purchase program \n     in an non-exempt employee's regular rate of pay, so long as \n     the employee received the grant or right at any time prior to \n     the date this amendment takes effect.\n       (2) Where an employer's pre-existing stock option, stock \n     appreciation right, or employee stock purchase program will \n     require shareholder approval to make to the changes necessary \n     to comply with this amendment, the employer shall have an \n     additional year from the date this amendment takes effect to \n     change its plan without fear of liability.\n       (3) Where an employer is providing stock options, stock \n     appreciation rights, or an employee stock purchase program \n     pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that is in \n     effect on the effective date of this amendment, the employer \n     may continue to fulfill its obligations under that collective \n     bargaining agreement without fear of liability.\n       (e) Regulations--the bill gives the Secretary of Labor \n     authority to promulgate necessary regulations.\n       Submitted April 12, 2000 by the Sponsors of S. 2323.\n\n     Mitch McConnell.\n     Christopher J.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Dodd, is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate how the Chair pronounces that \nname so well. I am very grateful to the Chair.\n  I am deeply pleased to be joining my good friend and colleague from \nKentucky in authoring this legislation, along with several of our other \ncolleagues. Senator McConnell mentioned several of them. But certainly \nSenator Enzi, Senator Bennett, Senator Robb, Senator Murray, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Reed, Senator Kerrey, among others are also \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  I am also pleased to inform this body that the Clinton-Gore \nadministration is a strong backer of the Worker Economic Opportunity \nAct, which is presently before us.\n  We have one of those unique opportunities that is not always \navailable to us in this Congress of the United States; that is, we are \nactually going to do something this afternoon that couldn't have any \nrancor associated with it. It will make a difference in the lives, we \nthink, of millions of people who would like to share in the remarkable \nprosperity we are enjoying.\n  We are backed by the administration. It is a bipartisan effort in \nthis body. I am told that a similar version of this bill has been \nintroduced in the other Chamber, the House of Representatives.\n  This is actually something we may accomplish, and we are not packing \nthe galleries. It is not going to be a headline story tomorrow, but it \nwill make a difference in people's lives.\n  We are in a period of sustained economic growth, almost \nunprecedented, if not unprecedented, in the 210-year history of our \nNation. The unemployment rate today at 4.1 percent is the lowest it has \nbeen in 30 years. More than 21 million jobs have been created since \n1993.\n  I see my colleague and good friend from Wyoming here. He is one of \nthe cosponsors of this bill as well. I mentioned him earlier. We are \npleased he is with us.\n  We are enjoying almost unprecedented prosperity in the country along \nwith the remarkable results of low unemployment, the lowest in some \nthree decades. More than 21 million new jobs have been created in the \nlast 7 years in our Nation. Inflation is down, and real wages are \nrising and have grown in 5 consecutive years; again, almost an \nunprecedented record in our Nation's history.\n  For the first time in 50 years, the country posted three consecutive \nsurpluses. Think of that. For the first time in decades, we are \nwatching the deficit clock run in the opposite direction. Instead of \nhow much debt we are accumulating every minute and every second, we are \nnow reducing the national debt with the prospect of eliminating it by \nthe year 2013.\n  What greater gift could we give to the next generation than to burn \nthe national mortgage, if you will. The economy is roaring. It is \nproducing a prosperity in the confidence which very few people could \nhave imagined a few short years ago.\n\n  Factory workers, secretaries, and other nonexempt workers form the \nbackbone of companies, large and small, that are also making a \ndifference. These individuals have been driving our economy. It is the \nview of those who sponsor this bill since they are driving so much of \nthis economy, they ought not to have to take a back seat to anyone in \nsharing in the prosperity this economy has produced.\n  In today's new economy, many companies look for creative ways to \nrecruit, train, and reward employees. The Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors estimated approximately 17 percent of large firms in the \nUnited States introduced a stock option program and 37\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\npercent have broadened eligibility for the stock option programs in the \nprevious 2 years.\n  Ten years ago these options were a perk for the chief executive \nofficer and other corporate executives in the corporation. Less than 1 \nmillion people received stock options in the early 1990s. Today, \nbetween 7 and 10 million people across this country are offered stock \noptions. According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, more \nthan 6 million workers receiving options are nonexecutives. In a 1997 \nsurvey, NECO reported that the average option grant value was $37,000 \nfor professional employees, $41,000 for technical employees, and \n$12,500 for administrative employees.\n  This is very good for the long-term economic prospects in this \ncountry.\n  Clearly, the trend is that a broad cross section of companies offers \nstock option programs. In these changing times, I am concerned, as is \nmy colleague from Kentucky and others, about laws working for \nbusinesses and employees. We need to work with them to find new ways to \nreward working people. As the economy changes, it is only fitting we \nupdate our laws, as well. That is why I join with my colleagues, and \nwhy others have joined, why the administration has joined, to change \nthe 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is the benchmark of worker \nprotection laws. I want to make very clear that the bill that is before \nthe Senate today, S. 2323, does absolutely nothing to undermine the \nfoundation of that critical and important piece of legislation.\n  My colleagues in the administration determined that the 1938 law \nneeded to be amended in order to incorporate the emergence of stock \noption programs being offered to hourly employees. Our bill amends the \nFair Labor Standards Act to clarify that the gains from stock options \ndo not need to be included in the calculation of overtime pay. That is \nwhat the 1938 law said. That is where a lot of the confusion arose.\n  Our legislation strikes a balance between protecting employee rights \nand offering flexibility to employers. This bill excludes from the \nregular rate stock options, stock appreciation rights or bona fide \nstock purchase programs that meet specific vesting, disclosure and \ndetermination requirements. A safe harbor is in effect to protect those \ncompanies that already had established stock option programs for \nnonexempt employees, including those programs provided under a \ncollective bargaining agreement or requiring shareholder approval.\n  I would like to commend the staff for their hard work on this bill--\nSheila Duffy of my staff, Denise Grant with Senator McConnell, and \nLeslie Silverman and Elizabeth Smith with the HELP Committee.\n  This proposal has broad bipartisan, bicameral support between the \nexecutive and legislative branches.\n  I ask unanimous consent two letters, one from the Union of the \nNeedletrades, industrial and textile employees, and one from the ERISA \nIndustry Committee, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, \n           Rochester Regional Joint Board,\n                                Rochester, NYC, February 22, 2000.\n       To Whom It May Concern: I am writing on behalf of UNITE and \n     its approximately 5,300 United States bargaining unit \n     employees covered by a contract with Xerox Corporation. It is \n     our understanding that Congress is currently considering \n     legislation to clarify the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) \n     treatment of stock options and other forms of stock grants in \n     computing overtime for non-exempt workers Xerox' UNITE \n     chapter would strongly urge Congress to pass legislation \n     exempting stock options and other forms of stock grants from \n     the definition of the regular rate for the purpose of \n     calculating overtime.\n       It is only recently that Xerox has made bargaining unit \n     employees eligible to receive both stock options and stock \n     grants. Without a clarification to the FLSA, we are afraid \n     Xerox may not offer stock options or other forms of stock \n     grants to bargaining unit employees in the future. In \n     addition, without such a change in the law if options are \n     granted there could be tremendous differentials in the amount \n     of overtime each individual employee received based on what \n     he or she decides to exercise an option or sell stock. \n     However, our position that stock options should be exempt \n     from the regular rate for purposes of overtime in no way \n     diminishes our position that bargaining unit employees must \n     have the right to receive overtime pay for actual hours.\n       As we begin the 21st century, UNITE hopes more companies \n     will begin to provide all their employees with stock options \n     and other forms of stock. It is a great way to assure that \n     when the company does well the employees share the reward \n     through employee ownership. Thank you for your consideration \n     of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Gary J. Bonadonna,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     International Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 The ERISA Industry Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC April 10, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) strongly \n     urges you to support S. 2323, the ``Worker Economic \n     Opportunity Act.'' S. 2323 is expected to come before the \n     Senate for a vote during the week of April 10. Timely \n     enactment of this legislation is critical to the continued \n     viability of broad-based stock options and other similar \n     programs that provide employees with equity ownership in the \n     companies for which they work.\n       Introduced March 29 by Senator Mitch McConnell, the \n     ``Worker Economic Opportunity Act'' enjoys strong bipartisan \n     and bicameral support. The bill is the result of a \n     cooperative effort between congressional leaders, the \n     Department of Labor, and the business community.\n       Stock options increasingly are available to a broad range \n     of employees, not just executives. A recent survey by William \n     M. Mercer, Inc. reports a better than twofold increase since \n     1993 in the percentage of major industrial and service \n     corporations that have a broad-based stock option plan.\n       In spite of the growing enthusiasm for employee equity \n     ownership among employers and employees, an advisory letter \n     interpreting current law issued by the Department of Labor's \n     Wage and Hour Division has effectively stopped this movement \n     in its tracks.\n       According to the Department's interpretation of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, any gains from the \n     exercise of stock options recognized by rank and file workers \n     must be included in their ``regular rate of pay'' for \n     purposes of computing overtime wages. Thus, in order to \n     comply with the Wage and Hour Division's interpretation of \n     the FLSA, employers would be required to track stock options \n     granted to rank and file employees and recalculate their \n     overtime payments once the options have been exercised.\n       No rational employer will subject itself to this \n     impracticable burden. As a result, rank and file workers will \n     be denied the valued opportunity to become a stakeholder in \n     their employer's future.\n       S. 2323 is narrowly tailored to directly address the issues \n     raised by the Wage and Hour Division's advisory letter \n     without compromising any long-standing worker protections \n     under FLSA. Most important, this legislation will benefit \n     millions of working Americans by facilitating the continued \n     expansion of equity-based compensation programs. It should be \n     enacted without delay.\n       Thank you for considering our views. Please feel free to \n     call on us if you have any questions or need additional \n     information.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Mark J. Ugoretz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this bill is about fundamental fairness. I \nurge our colleagues to support this Worker Economic Opportunity Act to \ngive working Americans a chance to share in our Nation's prosperity.\n  I ask further unanimous consent that during the remainder of this \ndebate and the remainder of the day the bill be left open for \nadditional cosponsorships. We have 20 or 30, but I suspect there may be \nothers who would like their names associated with this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent cosponsorship of the bill be left open for the \nremainder of today's legislative business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Kentucky for their work on the bill being \npresented today. We are here today because we believe that all workers \nshould have the opportunity to share in the success of their companies \nand it is incredibly important we do all we can to make sure that this \nlegislation gets passed with the vote it deserves.\n  More and more employers are providing equity ownership opportunities \nto all of their employees and we are here today because we want to \nfoster this trend which is good for our workers and for our nation's \neconomic growth. The Worker Economic Opportunity Act will encourage \nthis trend by changing the Fair Labor Standards Act\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\nto address the needs of the 21st century.\n  Over the last ten years, we have witnessed tremendous change in the \nstructure of our Nation's economy in large part due to the birth of the \ninternet and e-commerce. The vitality of our economy is a tribute to \nthe creative and entrepreneurial genius of thousands of individual \nbusiness people and the indispensable contribution of the American \nworkforce.\n  As legislators during this exciting time, we are challenged to \nmaintain an environment that will foster the continued growth of our \neconomy. We must work to ensure that our laws are in sync with the \nchanging environment. However, many of the laws and policies governing \nour workplace have fallen out of sync with the information age and \nthere has been particular resistance to changing our labor laws. As \nchairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over workplace \nissues, I believe it is time to examine and modify these laws to meet \nthe rapidly evolving needs of the American workforce.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, was enacted in the \nlate 1930s, to establish basic standards for wages and overtime pay. \nWhile the principles behind the FLSA have not changed, its rigid \nprovisions make it difficult for employers to accommodate the needs of \ntoday's workforce. In early January, we discovered the problem that we \nare addressing here today. It is extremely important. We learned that \nthe sixty-year old law actually operates to deter employers from \noffering equity participation programs, such as stock options, to \nhourly employees.\n  These programs are most prevalent in the high tech industry, yet \nincreasingly employers across the whole spectrum of American industry \nhave begun to offer them. And, while these programs used to be reserved \nfor executives, recent data shows that they are making their way down \nthe corporate ladder. A recent Federal Reserve Board of Governors study \nfound that 17% of firms have introduced stock options programs within \nthe last two years and 37% have broadened eligibility for their stock \noption programs in the last two years.\n  Broad-based equity programs prove valuable to both employers and \nemployees. For employers, these programs have become a key tool for \nemployee recruitment, motivation and retention. Employees seek out \ncompanies offering these programs because they enable workers to become \nowners and reap the benefits of their company's growth.\n  When I first heard about the FLSA's application to stock options, I \nbecame very concerned about its impact on our workforce. I was pleased \nto discover that Senators McConnell, Dodd, and Enzi shared similar \nconcerns and that the Department of Labor also recognized that we had a \nproblem on our hands that would require a legislative solution. \nTogether we crafted the legislation we are debating here today.\n  We have also worked together on a Joint Statement of Legislative \nIntent on S. 2323 which is intended to reflect the discussions the \nsponsors had with the Department of Labor during the drafting of the \nlegislation, and the sponsors' intent and understanding of this \nlegislation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. It is a symbolic first step in the process of aligning our \nlabor laws with the new economy.\n  I commend the Senator from Wyoming who is one of the initial people \nwho understood the importance of this issue and who came forward to \nhelp other Members understand the dangers of the present situation and \nto bring about the bill we have before the Senate. I am happy to yield \nthe floor to my wonderful Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The distinguished Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the jurisdictional committee, \nfor this very important piece of legislation. I appreciate his allowing \nme to be the subcommittee chairman for the labor portion of that \ncommittee, which is referred to as the Employment, Safety and Training \nSubcommittee. We get to work on these kinds of issues on a regular \nbasis. In the past, it has been known as one of the more contentious \ncommittees. But I recommend people take a look and note it is one of \nthe more reasonable committees now, where we are reaching bipartisan \nsolutions to problems for people in the workplace. That has always been \nour intent. We are actually having some confidence in each other now \nand are able to achieve those sorts of things.\n  I am pleased to be able to rise today to speak in favor of S. 2323, \nthe Worker Economic Opportunity Act. The large number of bipartisan \ncosponsors on this bill says a great deal for both its importance and \nits balanced, fair nature. I commend the hard work of my colleagues, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator McConnell, and Senator Dodd, both in crafting \na solution on the issue and in garnering the bipartisan support for the \nbill.\n  Elizabeth Smith, the legal counsel for the Employment, Safety and \nTraining Subcommittee, has been one of the coordinators of the bill and \nhas helped us to bring it all together. That is not only coordination \nbetween the House and Senate, between Republicans and Democrats, but it \nis also with the administration. A few days ago we had an opportunity \nto gather and talk about this bill and Secretary Herman was there, and \nshe has played a role in getting this done.\n  The problem was brought to us from where it should come, and that is \nthe workers. Workers were being told that because of the labor laws, \ntheir employers may have to stop giving them stock options.\n  That is an important factor because stock options are seen as a way \nfor people throughout this country, workers throughout this country, to \nown a share of the company. The better the company does, the better \nthey do. It is a way that from their job, and the risk they take having \nthat job, employees get to benefit from the productivity and returns \nthey put into the business.\n  And, boy, some of these businesses are really doing well; \nmillionaires are being created overnight--and we want hourly workers to \nbe able to take advantage of those stock options.\n  A little flaw, because of the amount of time that has gone by since \nfair labor standards passed, said you will have to do some calculating \nso the value of that stock option shows up as a direct payment.\n  Nobody really knows what the value of those stock options are, \nparticularly at the time they receive them. They do know sometime down \nthe road, when they take advantage of them, and probably even further \ndown the road when they actually get to sell them, but there is a huge \nchange, hopefully, in the value of that stock between the time it is \nawarded to them and the time there is some value to it. So how do you \ncalculate that back in years, to the time they received it, to \ncalculate it into overtime? The difficulty of calculating it led the \ncompanies to say: We can't figure out a formula for doing it. The \nDepartment has a formula for doing it, but we can't possibly process \nthat through so we can avoid court action. So what we are going to do \nis we are going to end stock options. That is when the workers said to \nCongress: Solve this problem for us.\n  That is what brings everybody together for a solution, the people at \nthe far end asking that they be allowed to continue participating in \nthe prosperity of this country. That is what has happened in this \ninstance. We are here today because the workplace has changed for the \nbetter, but the labor statutes have not. Many employers now give stock \noptions, not only to the executives and the managers, they give it to \nsecretaries, factory workers, janitors, mailroom clerks--everybody. \nThose are the hourly employees who provide the critical support on \nwhich a company's success is built.\n  I am proud of those employers who give stock options to those \nemployees. They recognize the value of giving workers a stake in the \ncompany's business. They are leading the charge to move workplaces into \na new, modern era of better employer-employee relations. In fact, the \nline is dimming on who is the employer and who is the employee.\n  Unfortunately, the decades-old Fair Labor Standards Act has not kept \npace. This statute, drafted during a very different time in the history \nof the American workplace, threatened to prevent employers from giving \nhourly employees stock options. S. 2323 removes this threat and ensures \nthat\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\ncompanies can continue to give stock options to hourly employees so \nthey can share in the success of their employer and this country's \neconomic growth.\n  This legislation takes an important step toward bringing an outdated \nlabor statute up to date with the modern workplace. I am very concerned \nthere are many other examples of problems such as the one we are \nsolving today, examples of other obsolete restrictions in the 30- to \n60-year-old labor statutes that are stifling the development of the new \ncreative ways to benefit employees, such as the stock options program \nand telecommuting arrangements. We should be encouraging these advances \nin employer-employee relations, not stifling them. By passing this \nWorker Economic Opportunity Act we can provide encouragement. I hope we \ncan continue to look for ways to solve similar problems.\n\n  I am particularly pleased the Department of Labor has worked with us \nin this bipartisan group. As chairman of the Employment, Safety and \nTraining Subcommittee, I firmly believe cooperation between lawmakers \nand agency is the best way to develop practical solutions that benefit \nboth the employees and the businesses.\n  I want to mention we have been doing that for about 2 years now. We \npassed the first changes in OSHA in 27 years, a year and a half ago; \nlittle incremental changes that will make a difference to the workers, \nthat will make the workplace safer. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Recently we worked together on home inspections. OSHA, through a \nletter, had suggested they were going to go into the homes and check \nand see how telecommuters were operating. Home is the least safe place \nthere is. It worried a lot of companies about how they were going to do \nthe inspections without imposing on the privacy of their employees. \nEmployees were worried about companies coming into their homes. The \nDepartment and OSHA and Congress saw the error of that. The Department \nwithdrew the letter. Both OSHA and congress agreed that OSHA should not \nbe a threat to people working in their home offices. People who work in \ntheir homes really enjoy doing that. There are a lot of benefits to \nthem, many of which people who work in the District would understand \nbecause of the parking and the traffic problems. I was very pleased \nthat the agency and congress agreed on this.\n  Last week we had agreement on a funding proposal, a sense-of-the-\nSenate proposal that would have been on the budget agreement except for \na parliamentary move that was done at the last moment. But there was \nagreement on both sides that there needs to be not only enforcement of \nOSHA--which does get attention--but justification by OSHA of how it is \nreducing workplace illnesses and injuries and a discussion of the value \nof compliance assistance activities, which are extremely important.\n  There are 12,000 pages of OSHA regulations. It is difficult for a \nsmall businessman to make it through that many pages of that kind of \nrhetoric. So we have been trying to make it more incentive-based, so \nthe agency would participate more in telling them what they need to do \ninstead of beating them over the head for what they did not do. We \nthink, with a more cooperative program, there will be more safety in \nthe workplace; that employers will not live in fear of OSHA, but rather \nin anticipation of help from OSHA and an understanding of the way they \ncan keep their employees safe.\n  Those are a few of the things we are working together on to have a \nbetter workplace. This legislation is a key piece and a key beginning \nto a number of changes we can make to affect the workers of this \ncountry. I look forward to working together on similar measures in the \nfuture as we move toward the shared goal of better matching our Federal \nlaws to the needs of the modern workplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Wyoming for \nhis work not only on this bill but on the other legislation he \ndiscussed. I also commend him for his help in the review of existing \nlabor laws. The Senator understands the import of bringing our labor \nlaws in line with the needs into the 21st Century. I depend upon him, \nand he produces.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Worker Economic Opportunity Act. This bipartisan legislation, also \nsupported by the Department of Labor, will encourage employers to \nprovide stock options to all employees, not just executives, ensuring \nthat all of our workers will continue to have the opportunity for an \nownership stake in their company.\n  In recent years, there have been revolutionary changes in the \nworkplace, creating new opportunities for our working families--\nopportunities, which for a long time, frequently existed only for a \nselect privileged few. One of the most positive developments has been \nthe significant increase in the availability of stock option plans for \nworkers, specifically hourly workers.\n  The decades-old employment laws do not accommodate newer workplace \ninnovations and their application would unfairly punish hourly workers \nby making their stock-option programs disproportionately expensive and \ncomplex for employers. Subsequently, recent Department of Labor legal \ninterpretations and policies have threatened the availability of stock \noption plans for hourly employees.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that Congress send a clear message \nthat the positive developments taking hold around the country should be \nencouraged, not thwarted.\n  The Worker Economic Opportunity Act would send just a message, \nensuring that all employees will continue to have the opportunity to \nshare in the economic growth and success of their company formerly \nenjoyed only by corporate executives. Moreover, companies, especially \nsmaller companies with high capital costs in development, will be able \nto maintain the capital resources necessary to compete in the rapid \nevolving global economy and, at the same time, reward and retain highly \nqualified and valued employees.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nSenator McConnell for his work and dedication toward this legislation \nand the Department of Labor for recognizing the need to accommodate \ntoday's employee and workplace innovations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation, which has broad bipartisan support in \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  In recent years, we have seen substantial growth in the use of \nemployee equity programs such as stock options, stock appreciation \nrights, and employee stock purchase plans. This growth has not only \nbeen in the number of companies which offer such plans, but also in the \nemployees to whom such plans are available. While long used as a form \nof incentive for corporate executives, equity programs are now \navailable to more employees than ever. In fact, a 1998 survey by Hewitt \nAssociates found that in excess of two-thirds of large U.S. companies \noffered stock options to non-executive employees, and more than a \nquarter of these companies make such plans available to their entire \nworkforce.\n  Unfortunately, the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was enacted in \n1938, does not recognize the importance of stock options as an employee \nbenefit. Thus, when asked how to deal with stock options when \ncalculating overtime pay for hourly-wage employees, the Department of \nLabor ruled that the options would have to be included in the \ncalculations.\n  The end result of this decision left employers with two options: One, \ngo through the burdensome task of recalculating an employee's regular \npay rate, retroactively, based on the change in the value of the stock \nfrom the time the option was granted until it was exercised; or, two, \ndo not offer any form of equity program to any employee who is not \nexempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  Since complying with the Department of Labor's onerous ruling would \nnot likely be worth the benefit of offering an equity plan, the vast \nmajority of companies would be left to face option two, thus \neliminating the use of a benefit that is popular with both employers \nand employees.\n  Recognizing the need to remedy this matter, for the good of companies \nand workers alike, a bipartisan group of\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nlegislators worked to craft the bill we have before us today, the \nWorker Economic Opportunity Act. This legislation would exempt employee \nequity programs from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, just as profit sharing and holiday bonus plans are \nexempted. In addition, the bill protects employers who offered employee \nequity programs prior to the date this legislation is enacted.\n  This legislation will allow employers to offer the kind of benefits \nwhich will allow them to attract a quality workforce, while providing \nemployees with a benefit they truly want. It is all too rare for \nCongress to come up with a win-win solution to a problem, but in this \ncase we certainly have.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since its enactment in 1938, the Fair \nLabor Standards Act has played a fundamental role in ensuring a fairer \nstandard of living for all American workers. The act created basic \nrights for workers by establishing a federal minimum wage, a 40 hour \nwork week and overtime pay for additional hours. It also protects \nchildren from abusive working conditions and helps ensure that women \nand men receive equal pay. Throughout its existence, the act has been \nindispensable in improving the standard of living for vast numbers of \nAmericans.\n  The Department of Labor has effectively carried out its \nresponsibility to interpret the law with this purpose in mind. Given \nthe high value of the act in protecting workers' rights to a fair \nworkplace, Congress must remain vigilant to ensure that any changes in \nthis important law do not undermine the wage and hour protections \nguaranteed to workers under the act.\n  I support the current bill because it helps ensure that employers \ncannot misuse the act as an excuse to exclude rank and file workers \nfrom the stock option plans, stock appreciation rights, and stock \npurchase plans they provide to higher paid employees.\n  I commend Senator Dodd, Senator Jeffords, Senator Enzi, and Senator \nMcConnell for developing this narrow, but important, clarification of \nthe act. It is a needed modernization of the law, and it arose from \nunique circumstances. I am confident that the Secretary of Labor will \npromulgate regulations interpreting this bill in a way that protects \nthe fundamental right of workers to receive overtime pay and not be \nforced to work overtime to participate in stock plans. It is of the \nutmost importance that any change in the act serves to strengthen the \nprotections for workers, not weaken them.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nWorker Economic Employment Opportunity Act. Mr. President, every time \nwe turn around it seems that we hear about how strong our nation's \neconomy is right now--and how America's workers are daily facing new-\nfound employment opportunities. We are in a period of almost \nunprecedented prosperity and sustained economic growth. And the bill we \nare voting on today is a direct consequence of that growth.\n  It wasn't long ago that benefits such as stock options were available \nonly to the upper levels of management. Companies are now offering \nstock options as a way not only to attract, but to retain quality \nemployees at all levels. This is a way of providing fairness to our \nnations workers--the ones who manage the daily ins-and-outs of the \nbusiness, the ones who have quite literally built today's economy.\n  S. 2323 will clarify that providing stock options will not be counted \ntoward overtime pay for hourly employees. The vitality of our economy \nis a tribute to the hard work and creativity of these workers. \nAccordingly, it is unacceptable that the Fair Labor Standards Act would \nbe interpreted in a manner that would effectively preclude the offering \nof this valuable benefit to hourly employees who form the backbone of \nAmerican business.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act already exempts some employee benefits \nsuch as discretionary bonuses, health insurance, and retirement savings \nplans from overtime calculations. We do this to encourage employers to \nprovide these critically needed benefits and incentives for their \nemployees--stock options should be no different.\n  We should not hinder the ability of our nation's workers to \nparticipate in the economic success of the companies they are helping \nto building. If employers choose to offer profit-sharing options, they \nshould not be penalized when calculating over-time wages.\n  Mr. President, I support this critical clarification of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act and I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. \nThank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator \nMcConnell's stock options legislation, S. 2323, and commend him for his \nhard work on this issue. This legislation allows companies who \ncurrently offer non-salaried employees a stock options program to \ncontinue to incentivize their work force without the threat of \nsanctions of the U.S. Department of Labor.\n  This is an easy one to support. The United States is unique in the \nworld with regard to how our stock options and the wealth generated in \nour companies are shared with those who significantly participate in \ntheir creation. As in most of the rest of the world, it used to be that \nonly our top executives received stock options from their companies. \nToday, many high tech companies offer stock options to all of their \nemployees, from the clerk to the CEO. Particularly with regard to an \nindividual's retirement needs, stock options are a tremendous financial \nopportunity for all workers and their families. We must do everything \nin our power to preserve these positive wealth- and risk-sharing \ndevelopments in our economy.\n  Employees at every level should be allowed to reap the rewards of the \nsuccess of their company. All throughout the United States, it has \nbecome common place for employees to quit their job and go to work for \nprogressive companies who allow them to share in the wealth that their \ncorporations generate. I hear repeatedly from industrial companies \nwhose compensation structure is often very different, that they are \nlosing their most talented and valuable employees to these new, often \nhigh-tech, corporations. And Mr. President, that kind of competition \nfor employees benefits all Americans and it's a positive development.\n  The Department of Labor's ill-considered advisory opinion, threatened \nthis development, and would have resulted in the cessation of often \ngenerous stock option plans for non-managerial and non-professional \nemployees in many of America's most progressive corporations. It is \ncritical that we recognize the importance of these wealth- and risk-\nsharing developments to the health of the American economy and \ncarefully weigh each new regulation, interpretation, and law before we \nrashly risk the financial health and well-being of the hard-working \nfamilies who have everything to do with the level of productivity our \neconomy enjoys.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Worker Economic \nOpportunity Act, S. 2323. Stock options have traditionally been \ndistributed only to highly salaried executives, used as an incentive to \npromote hard work on behalf of the company. As a company's bottom line \nimproves due in part to the executive's efforts, the value of the \ncompany's stock increases, eventually rewarding the executive when he \nor she ultimately exercises the option and later sells the stock. I \nhave long maintained that stock options ought be provided to all types \nof employee--whether hourly or salaried, management or clerica--and not \njust the top brass. That is why I introduced the Ending the Double \nStandards for Stock Options Act last Congress, which would have \nencouraged corporations to adopt plans in which a minimum of 50% of all \noptions would go to non-management employees. After all, a company's \nsuccess depends on the efforts of more than just its executives.\n  I am hopeful that the Worker Economic Opportunity Act will encourage \nthe growth of broad-based employee stock option plans in corporate \nAmerica. The Act excludes stock options from overtime pay calculations \nfor hourly employees. Current law also excludes benefits like \ndiscretionary bonuses, employer-provided health insurance, and \nretirement benefits from overtime pay rates. But current law doesn't \naddress stock options. Last year, the Department of Labor indicated \nthat, without action by Congress, companies would likely have to \ninclude the value of stock options when figuring an hourly employee's \novertime\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\npay rate. Corporate America has argued that the administrative and \nfinancial burdens associated with such inclusion, given a huge number \nof different employees having different amounts of options with \ndifferent exercise dates and strike prices, outweigh the benefits of \nhaving a broad-based stock option plan.\n  This legislation is not inconsistent with my proposal to require the \nreporting of stock options as an expense on a company's financial \nstatements, a key part of the Ending the Double Standards for Stock \nOptions Act. Therefore, I support the Worker Economic Opportunity Act \nto remove a potential barrier to workers' participation in the \nprosperous American economy they helped create.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nnext 5 minutes the time be held open, and then at 2:05 p.m. I will \nyield back all the time on the measure, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat there be a period for morning business from 2:05 p.m. until 2:30 \np.m., with the time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senate is S. 2323.\n  The bill is before the Senate and open to amendment. If there be no \namendment to be proposed, the question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is looking over \namendments that Members on this side of the aisle want the opportunity \nto offer to the bill on the marriage tax penalty. I certainly hope the \nmajority leader will be able to accommodate us. After all, if we were \nusing the regular rules of the Senate, we could offer any and all \namendments; that is, the rules of the Senate provide Members can, in \nfact, offer amendments on bills that come before the Senate.\n  The Senator from Montana, who has done so much work on this marriage \ntax penalty issue, and I were talking about how much the procedure \naround here is like the House of Representatives with tremendously \nrestricted opportunities for debate and restricted opportunities to \noffer amendments. We are working very hard, on our side of the aisle, \nto fight for the right merely to put matters before the Senate. We may \nnot win every time, but the fact is we are here for a reason and that \nis to legislate; it is to bring these matters before the American \npeople in this forum called the Senate.\n\n  The bill purports to take care of the marriage tax penalty, but I \nhave big news for everyone: It does not take care of the marriage tax \npenalty. Why do I say this? I get this directly from Senator Moynihan's \nwork on this issue as the ranking member of the Finance Committee. We \nknow there are 65 marriage tax penalties in the code for all \ntaxpayers--65.\n  So if you really believe the marriage tax penalty is your biggest \npriority and that is all you want to do, that it is the most important \nthing as you look at the Tax Code--and, frankly, from my point of view, \nit is not the only thing I want to do and there are more important \nthings we can do to help the middle class in this country--the most \nhonest thing to do is repeal the penalty in these 65 occasions in which \nit appears in the Tax Code.\n  However, the GOP plan fully eliminates only 1 of these penalties, \npartially eliminates 2 others, and it leaves 62 marriage penalties in \nthe code.\n  We have a situation where we are told we can do away with the \nmarriage tax penalty, but when we look at the fine print, we are not \ndoing away with the marriage tax penalty at all. We are only doing it \nin one place, completely, where it appears, and partially in another \ncouple. And we are leaving 62 penalties in place.\n  So I do not really think this is a good way for us to proceed because \nit is so expensive and we have not taken care of the marriage tax \npenalty. It is another one of these risky tax schemes that is going to \ncome back to haunt us because it is going to rob us of debt reduction.\n  When you add it to all the tax bills that have already passed the \nSenate with majority support from the Republicans, it is breaking the \nback of the non-Social Security surplus. We will have no surplus. \nPretty soon, we are going to start eating into that surplus.\n  We are going to hear Senator Baucus talk about why he believes this \nplan is flawed. It actually hurts some people at the lower end of the \nscale. It does not do what it purports to do.\n  We are going to hear from Senator Bayh, who has another idea that is \ncertainly more affordable and would allow us to do other things we need \nto do for our people, such as the prescription drug benefit.\n  We now know for sure that our people are suffering because they \ncannot afford prescription drugs. If we listen to Senator Wyden, who \nhas spoken on this eloquently, we know our senior citizens are not \ntaking their prescription drugs. They are cutting their pills in half. \nThey risk getting strokes. They risk getting heart attacks. They cannot \nafford the prescription drugs.\n  While we are talking about a marriage tax penalty--and a lot of \nrelief goes to people who are earning a lot of money in this country--\nwhat about the prescription drug benefit? What about a tuition tax \nbreak for parents who are struggling to send their kids to college and \ncollege tuition goes up each and every year?\n  We cannot do these things in a vacuum. We have to look at the entire \npicture. We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to give tax breaks or do \nwe want all the money to go to debt reduction? I myself would like to \ngive targeted tax breaks that we can afford to the middle class, who \nneeds them, and use the rest of the money for debt reduction and for \ninvestments in our people, in our children.\n\n  In closing, there is something we can really do for married people \nhere, those at the lowest incomes who are working at the minimum wage, \nmore than 60 percent of whom are women. Raising the minimum wage would \ngo a long way to doing something good for people who are married and in \nthe low brackets. A tuition tax break for people who send their kids to \ncollege would go a long way to helping married people and their \nfamilies. A prescription drug benefit would help those families who are \nseeing their moms and dads struggling along, not being able to afford \nprescription drugs.\n  So the question we face, just to sum it up as we look at this \nRepublican plan, is this: Why would we do something that says it is \nrelieving the marriage tax penalty when it leaves 62 marriage tax \npenalties in place? Why would we do that? It is not real. We are \ntelling people we are doing something we are not doing. We are \nbackloading it. We are breaking the Treasury. We are eating into the \nnon-Social Security surplus. Why would we do that?\n  Why not look at a more modest plan? We have some ideas on that. We \nare going to hear about one of them today. Why don't we look at raising \nthe minimum wage? Why don't we look at the prescription drug benefit or \nthe tuition tax break for our families who are struggling to send their \nkids to college? Why don't we look at this economic recovery and \ntogether, both sides of the aisle, say we do not want to derail it by \ndoing these tax breaks, one after the other after the other after the \nother. They are adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  If our President were not so strong in saying let's keep this country \non a fiscally sound basis, we would be in a lot of trouble, if those \nbills had been signed.\n  I asked of the Senator from Montana yesterday--I was talking to his \nstaff--how many tax bills have already gone through here with the votes \nof the other side of the aisle. I think his staff told me it was about \n$500 billion at this point, $500 billion of tax breaks--by the way, \nmost of them to people who do not want them, who do not need them, who \nare asking us to keep the economy strong, reduce the debt, and do \ntargeted tax breaks for the people who really need them.\n  I hope the majority leader will accept these amendments we have come \nup with, allow us to debate as Senators, not turn us into the House of \nRepresentatives which gives its Members very few rights to offer \namendments. I hope we will reject this Republican plan because it does \nnot do what it says it does. It is fiscally irresponsible, and it stops \nus from doing the good things we need to do for our families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support legislation which would provide\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\ntax relief to the working families who are currently paying a marriage \npenalty. Such a penalty is unfair and should be eliminated. However, I \ndo not support the proposal the Republicans have brought to the floor.\n  While its sponsors claim the purpose of the bill is to provide a \nmarriage penalty relief, that is not its real purpose. In fact, only 42 \npercent of the tax benefits contained in the legislation go to couples \ncurrently subject to a marriage penalty. The majority of the tax \nbenefits would actually go to couples who are already receiving a \nmarriage bonus and to single taxpayers. As a result, the cost of the \nlegislation is highly inflated. It would cost $248 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  As with most Republican tax breaks, the overwhelming majority of the \ntax benefits would go to the wealthiest taxpayers. This bill is \ndesigned to give more than 78 percent of the total tax savings to the \nwealthiest 20 percent of the taxpayers. It is, in reality, the latest \nploy in the Republican scheme to spend the entire surplus on tax cuts \nwhich would disproportionately benefit the richest taxpayers. That is \nnot what the American people mean when they ask for relief from the \nmarriage penalty. With this bill, the Republicans have deliberately \ndistorted the legitimate concerns of married couples for tax fairness.\n  All married couples do not pay a marriage penalty. In fact, a larger \npercentage of couples receive a marriage bonus than pay a marriage \npenalty. The only couples who pay a penalty are those families in which \nboth spouses work and have relatively equivalent incomes. They deserve \nrelief from this inequity, and they deserve it now.\n  We can provide relief to the overwhelming majority of the couples \nsimply and at a modest cost. That is what the Senate should do. \nInstead, the Republicans have insisted on greatly inflating the cost of \nthe bill by adding extraneous tax breaks primarily benefiting the \nwealthiest taxpayers.\n  A plan that would eliminate the marriage penalty for the overwhelming \nmajority of married couples could easily be designed and cost less than \n$100 billion over 10 years. The House Democrats offered such a plan \nwhen they debated this issue in February. The amendment which Senator \nBayh intends to offer to this bill would also accomplish that goal. If \nthe real purpose of the legislation is to eliminate the marriage \npenalty for those working families who actually pay a penalty under \ncurrent law, it can be accomplished at a reasonable cost.\n  The problem we have consistently faced is that our Republican \ncolleagues insist on using marriage penalty relief as a subterfuge to \nenact large tax breaks unrelated to relieving the marriage penalty and \nheavily weighted to the wealthiest taxpayers. The House Republicans put \nforward a bill which would cost $182 billion over 10 years and give \nless than half the tax benefits to people who pay a marriage penalty. \nThat was not enough for the Senate Republicans. They raised the cost to \n$248 billion over 10 years. A substantial majority, 58 percent of the \ntax breaks in the Senate bill, would go to taxpayers who do not pay a \nmarriage penalty.\n  Nor is this the only tax bill the Republicans have brought to the \nfloor this year. They attached tax cuts to the minimum wage bill in the \nHouse of close to $123 billion and tax cuts to the bankruptcy bill in \nthe Senate of almost $100 billion. They have sought to pass tax cuts of \n$23 billion to subsidize private school tuition and reduce the \ninheritance tax paid by multimillionaires. Not including the cost of \nthis bill, the Republicans in the House and Senate have already passed \ntax cuts that would consume $443 billion over the next 10 years. The \nresult of this tax cut frenzy is to crowd out necessary spending on the \npriorities which the American people care most about--education, \nprescription drugs for senior citizens, health care for uninsured \nfamilies, strengthening Medicare and Social Security for future \ngenerations.\n  Finally, I want to bring another matter to the attention of the \nSenate. It is another marriage penalty, and that is, there are 13 \nStates--which represent 22 percent of the American people--that have \nlaws saying when one gets married, they lose the coverage under \nMedicaid they might otherwise have if they were single. For example, in \nthe State of Maine, one is eligible as a single person for Medicaid up \nto $14,000, but if it is a couple, each earning $7,000 so the family \nincome is $14,000, neither of them gets Medicaid coverage. That is true \nin 13 States.\n  If we are going to take a look at the marriage penalty for the \nwealthier individuals in this country, what about the marriage penalty \nfor some of the working poor who are trying to make ends meet? That is \nan issue I hope to have an opportunity to debate when we get into a \ndiscussion of the proposal put forward by the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes on an unrelated topic.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on the marriage penalty bill. I \nsuggest to the Senator, since there are no other Members on the floor, \nhe can take time off the majority side on the pending measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, since this is coming off our time on \nthe marriage tax penalty bill, I commend Senator Hutchison and all \nthose who have worked so diligently on both sides of the aisle and in \nthe House of Representatives to provide relief on this onerous and \nperverse provision in our Tax Code that puts the institution of \nmarriage in a disadvantageous position and costs American families \nthousands of dollars each year. It is something that should have been \neliminated long ago.\n  I look forward to supporting the Marriage Penalty Relief Act. I hope \nthere will be an overwhelming vote in the Senate for this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2588-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2588-S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MILITARY RECRUITER ACCESS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. \n2397, the Military Recruiter Access Enhancement Act of 2000. This bill \nis designed to assist armed services recruiters in gaining access to \nsecondary schools and school student directory information for military \nrecruiting purposes.\n  The matter of recruiting and retaining military personnel of the \nhighest quality and in the quantity needed to maintain the optimal \npersonnel strength of our armed services has been a topic of great \ninterest to myself and my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nPersonnel Subcommittee.\n  I have heard detailed testimony in hearings this year from top \nDepartment of Defense manpower officials and actual military \nrecruiters--those on the front lines doing the recruiting--regarding \nthe challenges of contacting and informing young people today about the \nbenefits of a career in the military. As I have contemplated the \ndetailed testimony received on the subject, it is clear there are \nseveral factors combining to make the tough job of recruiting young \npeople for military service even tougher.\n  We found the following: The combined effects of the strongest economy \nin 40 years, the lowest unemployment rate since the establishment of an \nall-volunteer force, and a declining propensity on the part of \nAmerica's youth to serve in the military make the recruitment of \npersons for the Armed Forces unusually challenging in the economic \nclimate in which we exist.\n  For the recruitment of high quality men and women, each of the Armed \nForces face intense competition from the other branches of the Armed \nForces. They face competition from the private sector, and they face \ncompetition from postsecondary educational institutions recruiting \nyoung people as well.\n  It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Armed Forces to meet \ntheir respective recruiting goals. Despite a variety of innovative \napproaches taken by recruiters and the extensive programs of benefits \nthat are available for recruits, recruiters have to devote \nextraordinary time and effort to fill monthly requirements for \nimmediate accessions.\n  Unfortunately--and this is, I think, dismaying and surprising to most \nAmericans--a number of high schools, thousands of high schools, have \ndenied recruiters for the Armed Forces access to the students or to the \nstudent directory information of those high schools.\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\n  In 1999, there were 4,515 instances of denial of access to the Army. \nThere were an additional 4,364 instances in the case of the Navy, 4,884 \ninstances in the case of the Marine Corps, and 5,465 instances of \ndenial of access to Air Force recruiters. In total, there were over 600 \nhigh schools across this country that denied access to at least three \nbranches of the services, the largest of those school districts is San \nDiego, CA.\n  As of the beginning of 2000, nearly one-fourth of all high schools \nnationwide did not release student directory information to Armed \nForces recruiters.\n  In testimony presented to the Committee on Armed Services of the \nSenate, recruiters of the Armed Forces stated that the single biggest \nobstacle to carrying out their recruiting mission is the denial of \naccess to directory information about students, for a directory listing \nof high school students is the recruiter's basic tool. When directory \ninformation is not provided by schools, recruiters must spend valuable \ntime, otherwise available for pursuing recruiting contacts, to \nconstruct a list from school yearbooks and other sources. This \ndramatically reduces both the number of students each recruiter can \nreach and the time available communicating with the students that the \nrecruiters can eventually locate.\n  The denial of direct access to students and denial of access to \ndirectory information unfairly hurts America's young people.\n  High schools that deny access to military recruiters prevent students \nfrom receiving all of the information on the educational and training \nincentives offered by the Armed Forces, thus impairing the career \ndecisionmaking process of students by limiting the availability of \ncomplete information on what options they have before them.\n  The denial of access for Armed Forces recruiters to students or to \ndirectory information ultimately undermines our national defense by \nmaking it harder for our Armed Forces to recruit young Americans in the \nquantity and of the quality necessary for maintaining the readiness of \nthe Armed Forces to provide national defense.\n  The bill I have introduced legislates a series of formal steps to be \ntaken with secondary schools that deny access to students or student \ndirectory information to recruiters.\n  Step 1: The Department of Defense will be required to send a general \nofficer or flag officer to visit the local education agency to arrange \nfor recruiting access within 120 days following a report of access \ndenial.\n  Should a school say, no, we are not going to let military recruiters \naccess, the first step is, negotiations. They would try to work this \nout. You would have a flag officer, or a general officer, who would go \nto the school, visit with the superintendent, the principal, the \ncounselors, and find out what the problem is.\n  Step 2: Should access still be denied, within 60 days of the visit in \nstep 1, the Secretary of Defense must then notify the State's chief \nexecutive--presumably the Governor--of the denial and request his or \nher assistance. A copy of this request is also sent to the Secretary of \nEducation.\n  Step 3: If access for recruiters is still not achieved a year after \nthe Governor has been notified--a full 18 months since the initial \ndiscovery that they are denying access--and if it is found that the \nschool in question denies access for two or more of the Armed Services, \nthat school will be placed on a list maintained by the Department of \nDefense and will be denied Federal funds until such time as recruiter \naccess is restored.\n  People may say that is having a heavy hand. May I say, there is no \nschool in America that ought to ever lose Federal funding under this \nlaw because no school should ever have to deny access to military \nrecruiters. There is an ample amount of time--a full 18 months--for \nnegotiations, discussion, in bringing in the Governor of the State, to \ntry the reconcile whatever problems there might be.\n  I think the importance of this bill cannot be overstated. We have an \nobligation to provide an environment for our recruiters that, at the \nvery least, places them on a level playing field with the recruiters of \ncolleges and universities and with representatives from private \nindustry.\n  Today, the recruiting of high school students actually starts in \njunior high school for colleges, for universities, and even for \nprivate-sector jobs. To say a recruiter cannot have contact until that \nstudent is out of high school puts them at an incredible disadvantage.\n  While DOD has had the ability to withhold Federal funding from \ncolleges and universities which denied access to military recruiters, \nthere has not been any significant recourse available at the secondary \nschool level.\n  In some cases, a few select administrators can make decisions about \nrecruiter access based on their own personal bias or lack of \nfamiliarity with the positive aspects of military service. These \n``gatekeepers'' effectively block information from students by denying \naccess to recruiters. These nonaccess policies may actually exist when \nthe community at large in the school's area is very much supportive of \nthe Armed Forces and recruiting efforts.\n  We must work collectively as a nation to keep our military  \n``connected'' with the people they serve. The concept of an all-\nvolunteer force will only continue to be successful when the \ncompensatory benefit package we offer young people is competitive and \nthe career information on current educational and financial incentives \nis readily available to potential recruits.\n\n  There are those who are understandably concerned about maintaining \nthe privacy of personal contact information. It is ironic, however, \nthat student directory information is often shared by high schools with \ncap and gown companies, college recruiters, and private industry \nrepresentatives, but denied to Armed Forces recruiters. We must take \nactive steps to eliminate that sort of bias, whether intended or not, \nand reestablish an equal footing for our Armed Forces recruiters with \nother groups seeking to contact students. We must remember that \nrecruiters represent the primary tool of not only the Department of \nDefense but Congress, as well, in fulfilling our constitutional \nrequirements to raise and maintain an army, the Armed Forces.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the recruiting professionals in all \nbranches of our Armed Forces are top-notch role models, fully capable \nof succeeding in their respective recruiting missions, but they need to \nhave a supportive and conducive contact environment.\n  This bill will provide school officials of institutions currently \nrestricting access to recruiters with additional incentive to improve \nor restore that access.\n  This bill will bring attention locally and nationally to the problems \nof access restriction to Armed Forces recruiters.\n  This bill sends a clear signal to DOD leaders and to the people of \nour country that we recognize the problem recruiters face in supporting \nthe concept of our all-volunteer force.\n  This bill provides a reasonable and calculated approach to improving \naccess with a phased escalation in the negative consequences for \nschools insisting upon perpetuating nonaccess policies. It is \nnonantagonistic, it is nonconfrontational, but it is firm.\n  This bill does not attempt to dictate local practices from \nWashington, as some may charge. This bill merely requires schools to \nprovide--and I quote from the bill's language--\n\n       . . . the same access to secondary school students, and to \n     directory information concerning such students, as is \n     provided generally to post-secondary educational institutions \n     or to prospective employers of those students.\n\n  We are just simply saying: Make the playing field level. If you are \ngoing to deny access to Army recruiters, Air Force recruiters, Marine \nrecruiters, Navy recruiters, then we expect the same denial would be \napplied across the board to private industry recruiters and to colleges \nand universities. If you are going to provide access to private \nindustry and to colleges and universities, likewise, that access must \nbe provided under this legislation to those seeking to recruit for our \nArmed Forces.\n  The size of our Armed Forces has decreased significantly over the \npast decade. The number of veterans is decreasing daily. Fewer and \nfewer young people today have a close relative or friend with military \nservice experience. We have in the Congress a corporate responsibility \nto make an extra effort to\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\ninvite young men and women to bring their talent into the service of \ntheir country and to take advantage of the outstanding educational and \ntraining benefits currently available. Few occupations offer the \npatriotic satisfaction of military service.\n  A healthy all-volunteer force does not just happen. When I asked \nrecruiters appearing before a recent Personnel Subcommittee hearing \nwhat Congress could do to help them bring the best and brightest into \ntoday's military, of course they responded that educational benefits \nwould help, they responded that health care benefits would help, they \nresponded that improving housing would  help. But equally important was \ntheir request for help in convincing parents and educators that \nenlisting their children and students was ``not the last choice'' but a \nfirst choice, and to help them gain access to students on school \ngrounds and access to student directory information.\n\n  In response to the DOD request for assistance, I would like to \nrespond in two ways:\n  First, by inviting all of my colleagues in the Senate, regardless of \nwhere they hail from, to join with me in pledging to visit one or more \nhigh schools in their home States this year and to promote military \nservice as an attractive career opportunity while addressing students \nand facility members. This is one positive step we can all take to \ndemonstrate our support for a healthy Armed Forces recruiting process.\n  Secondly, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, the Military \nRecruiter Access Enhancement Act of 2000, in an enthusiastic and \nbipartisan fashion. We want and need the brightest and the best to \nserve in our Armed Forces. I cannot help but think of the many \noutstanding citizens in all walks of life, indeed, including many of my \nesteemed colleagues right here in the Senate, who began their adult \nlives with service to our Nation in one of the branches of the Armed \nServices. We owe it to the recruiters of our services to do all we can \nto help them succeed in their tireless efforts to bring in quality men \nand women for the defense of our country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence and thank the Senator \nfrom Texas for her willingness to yield to me this time and for her \ntireless efforts on behalf of tax relief for the families in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2590-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2590-S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF ACT OF 2000--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Targeted \nMarriage Penalty Relief Act of 2000. I do so because I believe it \naffords us the best opportunity to deal with this problem in a way that \nwill relieve this penalty from the vast majority of Americans.\n  Approximately 80 percent of the Americans who currently pay the \nmarriage tax penalty would have their penalty eliminated entirely under \nour approach.\n  Secondly, I favor this approach because it allows us to deal with \nthis problem in the most affordable manner, also giving us the freedom \nto address other important issues that have faced our great country. I \nsupport the Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief Act of 2000 because it \nstrikes the right balance between fiscal responsibility and a socially \nprogressive policy, which I think is best for our country.\n\n  I support relief of the marriage tax penalty for several important \nreasons. First, as a matter of basic justice. It is not right that two \nindividuals should pay more in taxes simply because they are married. \nWhen our Tax Code falls into ridicule, compliance drops and the \nGovernment, as a whole, falls into disrepute. We should not allow this \nto happen. We can take an important step to preventing this from \nhappening by dealing with the marriage penalty problem.\n  Secondly, I support marriage tax penalty relief as a matter of social \npolicy. Marriages and families are the basic building blocks on which \nour society is built. Too many marriages today end in disillusion. Too \nmany families today are fractured because of the strains they face, \noften financial strains. If we can take action to strengthen families \nand marriages, to provide a sound and secure environment in which \nchildren can be raised, it is better for our country in a whole host of \nimportant ways.\n  I support the marriage tax relief provisions I speak to today as a \nmatter of economic policy. During prosperous times when we enjoy \nsurplus, it is only right that we share some of that hard-earned \nbenefit with those who have generated it in the first place: the \ntaxpayers of our country.\n  All of this is not to say we can afford just any approach to \nresolving the marriage penalty situation. We have to get it right. We \nhave to do it in a way that is affordable and balanced with the other \nneeds our country faces. This cannot be said of all the approaches \ncurrently before this body. Some of the approaches are poorly targeted, \nmore than we can afford and, in fact, do not deserve the title of \nmarriage tax penalty relief at all.\n  I admire the work done by the Democrats on the Senate Finance \nCommittee; in particular, the leadership of the ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan, and Senator Baucus. Their approach is truly targeted to \nending the marriage tax penalty problem. It is intellectually elegant, \nand I appreciate the work they have done in this regard. We have \nseveral practical issues we are working through, but their approach \ntruly deserves the title ``marriage tax penalty relief.''\n  The same cannot be said of the approach taken by the majority. Their \napproach claims to be a marriage tax penalty reduction bill but, as has \nbeen alluded to by several other speakers, more than half of the \nbenefits go to those who do not have a marriage tax penalty at all. \nMany things can be said about this proposal. Calling it a marriage tax \npenalty bill is not one of them.\n  Secondly, it is too slow. It is phased in over a 7-year period. Why \nshould we wait so long to give this important relief to the taxpayers \nof America? If it is truly a pressing problem, surely we can afford to \nact much sooner than that.\n  Third, it is regressive in nature. More than half of the benefits \nunder the approach taken by the majority go to those earning more than \n$100,000 a year.\n  I have no trouble with the wealthy in our society. In fact, I wish we \nhad more wealthy in the United States of America. But at a time when we \nhave to make difficult decisions and allocate scarce resources among \ncompeting priorities, I  think relief of the marriage tax penalty needs \nto be more squarely focused upon the middle class, an approach not \ntaken by the majority.\n\n  Finally, and most significant of all, is the issue of affordability. \nThe approach taken by the majority would use fully $248 billion over \nthe next 10 years to solve this problem, severely limiting our ability \nto deal with other pressing matters that face our country.\n  If you care about a drug benefit for Medicare, not only is the \nmajority position silent about your concerns, it in fact limits our \nability to do something about your concerns. If you care about making \ncollege more affordable by including a college tax deduction or credit \nto lower the cost of college, not only does the majority position do \nnothing to address your concerns, in fact it makes addressing your \nconcerns and reducing the burden of the college expense on working \nfamilies more difficult to accomplish. If you care about caring for the \nelderly, a sick parent or grandparent, not only is the majority \napproach silent about your concerns, it in fact makes it more difficult \nto deal with this important and pressing matter. If you care about debt \nrelief or about education reform, not only is the majority position \nsilent about your concerns, it in fact makes it more difficult to \nconsider.\n  Fortunately, there is another alternative, one that is targeted, one \nthat is immediate, one that is progressive, and one that is affordable. \nThe approach I speak to today, as the approach taken by the Democrats \nin the Senate Finance Committee, is a true marriage tax penalty relief \nbill. No one who does not currently pay a marriage tax penalty will be \neligible for a tax cut under this provision. It helps those who have \nthe problem get relief, which is the way it should be.\n  Secondly, the relief is immediate. In the first year of this \napproach, fully 51\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\npercent of Americans who pay a marriage tax penalty will have their \nmarriage tax penalty eliminated entirely. After 4 years, when this \napproach is fully implemented, more than 80 percent of the American \npeople, everyone making under $120,000 a year, will have their marriage \ntax penalty fully eliminated--100-percent elimination of the marriage \ntax penalty for everyone making $120,000 a year in just 4 years, not \nthe 7 proposed by the majority.\n  Third, this approach is progressive. Everyone making under $120,000 \nwill have the marriage tax penalty eliminated, and the majority, more \nthan half, of the benefits go to those making between $50- and $100,000 \na year. Working families, the middle class, those who are struggling \nmost can make ends meet.\n  Finally, on the issue of affordability, while the majority proposes \n$248 billion over 10 years to deal with this problem, our approach \nwould take only $90 billion--more than 80 percent of the problem \neliminated at only a fraction of the cost--thereby freeing up billions \nand billions of dollars to deal with other pressing matters that face \nour society.\n  Let me put this in perspective: the difference in cost of the \nmajority's position versus our position is $158 billion over 10 years. \nThe difference in cost would completely fund a Medicare drug benefit \nproposed by the President of the United States for every senior citizen \nacross our country qualifying for Medicare, helping to lower the cost \nof prescription drugs. Even if you don't adopt the President's approach \nto a Medicare drug benefit and instead adopt the less costly \nprovisions  proposed by the majority--let's take the Republican drug \nbenefit, costing around $70 billion over the next 10 years--you would \nstill have the ability to fully fund that and, in addition, adopt a \n$10,000 tax deduction for people with children in college, allowing \nthem to write off the first $10,000 of college tuition.\n\n  In addition, you would allow a $3,000 credit for senior citizens who \nare being cared for by their children or grandchildren, lowering the \ncost of long-term care for the elderly in our society. You would allow \nfor the $30 billion of education reform proposed by Senator Graham on \nthe floor of the Senate just last year.\n  Let me briefly review the affordability provisions. On the one hand, \nyou have a so-called marriage tax penalty relief bill that costs $248 \nbillion over 10 years, the majority of which goes to people who, in \nfact, don't pay the marriage tax penalty, or you can eliminate 80 \npercent of the marriage tax penalty, eliminate it entirely for everyone \nmaking under $120,000 and, in addition to that, fully fund the Medicare \ndrug benefit proposed by the majority, and fully fund the college \ntuition deduction proposed by Senator Schumer, and fully fund the long-\nterm elderly care credit proposed by myself and others, and fully fund \nthe money for education reform proposed by Senator Graham.\n  The choice is clear: a marriage tax proposal on the one hand that \ngoes to largely benefit those who don't pay the marriage tax penalty or \na marriage penalty relief proposal that eliminates the vast majority of \nthat problem and adds a Medicare drug proposal and makes college more \naffordable and provides for long-term care for the elderly and invests \nfunds in the quality of education. I believe the choice is clear.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and, again, commend the \nSenate Finance Committee Democrats for their dedication to this issue \nand the hard work they have devoted to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very important debate. I \nhope we are going to be able to move to pass this bill before people \nhave to write their checks during the weekend deadline for income taxes \nthis year.\n  Right now, there are negotiations underway between the Republicans \nand the Democrats about what kind of amendments should be offered. I \nvery much hope that the Democrats will agree to offer some relevant \namendments because I think there are surely legitimate disagreements \nabout how we would give marriage tax penalty relief. But I also hope we \nwill not have extraneous amendments offered, no matter how good the \ncause, which would take away from what President Clinton asked us to \ndo, and that is to send him a marriage tax penalty bill that does not \ninclude extraneous legislation. That is what we are attempting to do.\n  So I hope we can move forward into the amendment phase and talk about \nour differences. I think the distinguished Senator from Indiana wants \ntax relief for hard-working married couples. I think we may have a few \ndifferences, but in the end I suspect that he and I will both vote for \nthe bill that is passed out of this Senate; that is, if we can get to \nthe vote. That is what I hope we can do.\n  I think we need to be very careful in the debate, though, about \naccuracy and what the different proposals are going to do. I heard a \nSenator earlier today in debate say that this bill on the floor will \nbreak the Treasury. I think the distinguished Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer, perhaps didn't look at the numbers and didn't match it to \nthe budget resolution because, clearly, this not only doesn't break the \nTreasury, it doesn't even spend half of the allocation in the budget we \npassed last week for tax relief. In fact, it is $69 billion over 5 \nyears, and the budget we passed last week is $150 billion over 5 years. \nSo this is not even half.\n  We do hope to give tax relief to other people in our country. We want \nto eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We want to let seniors work if \nthey are between 65 and 70 and not be penalized for it, and that bill \nhas already been passed. We want small business tax cuts to make it \neasier for our small businesses to create the jobs that keep our \neconomy thriving. We would like to give education tax cuts. Under the \nleadership of Senator Coverdell, we passed education tax cuts that \nwould help people give their children the education enhancements that \nwould increase their education quality. All of these things fit within \nthe $150 billion tax relief in the budget that we passed last week.\n  I think this is quite responsible and I think it is long overdue. We \nare talking about a tax correction as much as anything, because it is \noutrageous to talk about people who are single, working; they get \nmarried and they don't get salary increases, but all of a sudden they \nowe $1,000 more in taxes. It is time to correct this inequity. That is \nexactly what the bill before us does. It corrects the inequity all the \nway through the 28-percent tax bracket. It helps people all the way \nthrough those income brackets.\n  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleague from Alabama if he \nwould like to speak. I don't know if others are waiting to speak, but \nhe was waiting earlier. I am happy to yield to him at this time because \nhe has been a leader in this effort.\n  How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Ten minutes would be fine.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will stop my remarks and yield to Senator Sessions \nfor 10 minutes from our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Texas for her stalwart \nleadership in this bill. The President of the United States said in his \nState of the Union Message that the marriage tax penalty should be \neliminated. Polling data shows that the overwhelming number of American \ncitizens believe it should be eliminated. I had a meeting and a press \nconference with a number of families in Alabama on Monday, and we sat \ndown and talked with them about the struggles they have. One couple had \neight children. They are paying additional taxes because they are \nmarried. Another couple had just gotten married and had a young child, \nand they are paying more because they are married. Those are the kinds \nof things that are unexplainable to the American people. They are \nunjustifiable in logic, fairness, and justice. On a fundamental basis, \nthe marriage tax penalty is an unfair and unjust tax. It is not that we \nare doing a tax reduction so much as we are eliminating a basic \nunfairness.\n  As I have said before, the challenge we are facing today is to \ncreate, as Members of this Senate, public policy that improves us as a \npeople, that helps us to be better citizens. On every bill that comes \nthrough, every piece of legislation that we consider, we need to ask \nourselves: Will this make us better\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\nor improve us as a nation? When we have legislation and laws in force \nthat give a bonus to people to divorce, we have something wrong.\n  I have a friend who went through an unfortunate divorce. They got \nthat divorce in January. I was told: Jeff, had we known about it and \nthought about it at the time, we could have gotten the divorce in \nDecember and we would have saved another $1,600 on our tax bill.\n  The Federal Government is paying a bonus to people who divorce. In \neffect, that is what our public policy does. If they are married, they \nare paying a penalty. It is $1,600, according to CBO, for an average \nfamily who pays this penalty, and $1,400, according to the Treasury \nDepartment, President Clinton's own Treasury Department, that says the \nfamilies who pay this penalty pay an average of almost $100 per month. \nThat is a lot of money. That is tax-free money that they could utilize \nto fix their automobile, get a set of tires, go to the doctor, take the \nkids to a ball game, or buy them a coke after a game, or go to a movie, \nand do the kinds of things families ought to do.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator, is the so-called marriage tax penalty \na consequence of getting married or is it a consequence of getting \nmarried and the proportion of incomes each spouse earns? I might ask \nthe question differently. How many people in America--if the Senator \nknows, and he may--get a bonus under our tax laws, not a penalty? What \npercentage of American taxpayers today receive a bonus as opposed to a \npenalty?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not sure about any bonus factor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is because when they get married, they pay less \ntaxes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, 21 million, I believe, pay more taxes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator, are there some people getting married \nand, as a consequence, pay less taxes?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is perhaps so.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is so.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is a factor, as the Senator indicated, relative to \nthe income that each person earns.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What we are trying to do is find a solution that solves \nthe problem of the disparity in what each spouse makes, which might \nthen cause the penalty. For example, we all know when you have a \nmarried couple and one spouse receives more income than the other--\nconsiderably more--the joint tax is going to be less than if they are \nfiling separately. We all know that. That is mathematically a given. \nThe consequence, though, of a married man and woman who earn roughly \nthe same amount is that couple pays more in taxes than they would pay \nif they were separate.\n  So what we are trying to do is solve the problem--if the Senator \nwould agree with me--and to make sure that when a man and woman get \nmarried, we address the problem created when the two people have \nsomewhat similar incomes, which then creates the penalty. So some who \nare married pay a penalty and some get a bonus. Aren't we only trying \nto solve the penalty problem for those couples who find themselves in a \npenalty position?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will just say this. The Senator is correct in saying \nthis legislation deals with the penalty provision and does not attempt \nto increase taxes on married couples, to try to reach some sort of \nideal level.\n  It is designed to provide relief from the penalty that occurs.\n  Does the Senator propose that we increase the taxes on those who may \nbe paying less because they are married?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If we are trying to solve the so-called marriage penalty \nproblem, then we should try to solve the so-called marriage tax penalty \nproblem.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We are solving the marriage tax penalty problem. You \nmay be complaining about the bonus some might get.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I could answer the question, on the other hand, if we \nwant to do something else in addition to solving the marriage tax \npenalty problem, that is a different debate, and we should try to \nfigure out how best to do that. As it is today, there are 25 million \nAmericans who find themselves in the penalty position when they get \nmarried. But there are 21 million Americans who find themselves in a \nbonus situation when they get married. It is about 50-50. It makes \nsense, I think, to try to give relief to those in the penalty \nsituation.\n  I am not sure if those who are already in the bonus situation need \nmore relief, as contained in the Finance Committee bill, the majority \nbill.\n  I was asking the Senator why we are doing that. Why are we doing more \nthan fixing the penalty?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think it would be a matter of some discussion if the \nSenator would like to have some hearings in the Finance Committee on \nwhether or not these bonuses occur. I don't think they are as \nsubstantial as the penalties may be. They are not. But, at any rate, if \nthe Senator wants to have hearings on whether they ought to be raised, \nthen I think that is something that is worthy of evaluation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This Senator is not advocating any increase in taxes; no \nway at all. I want to make that clear. I know the Senator didn't mean \nto imply that I was thinking of raising taxes because I am not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have a problem when two people are working and they \nare making $30,000 a year--just two, a man and woman. They fall in \nlove. They get married. At $30,000 a year each, they end up paying \nabout $800 more a year, which is $60 or $80 a month in extra tax simply \nfor getting married. I want to eliminate that. If somebody wants to \ndeal with the other problem, they can.\n  Frankly, I am beginning to observe there is a feeling on the other \nside that this bill needs to go away, that people are not willing to \nconfront it directly. I hope that is not so. I hope we can see this \nlegislation go forward.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might ask the Senator one more question, is it \nbetter to try to find some way to pay down the national debt at the \nsame time we are fixing the marriage tax penalty problem?\n  The Senator gave a hypothetical of a man and woman each earning \n$30,000. They get married and have to pay more taxes. That is not \nright. I totally agree that is not right. That ought to be fixed. \nSomebody who pays more income taxes as a consequence of getting married \nshould not be facing that situation, and we should, in the Congress, \nfigure out a way--as various proposals do--so a couple does not have to \npay any more income taxes as a consequence of getting married. I agree \nwith the Senator. That is not right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is exactly all it does. Does the Senator disagree? \nThis bill eliminates the penalty. That is what it intends to do. That \nis what the President says he supports. That is what the Senator from \nMontana says he supports. That is it.\n  I have the floor. I will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The 10 minutes yielded to the \nSenator from Alabama have expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 5 minutes so we can \ncontinue this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be glad to hear the Senator's question on the \npoint.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The question I am asking is this: More than half of the \nFinance Committee bill does not address the marriage tax penalty \nproblem. More than half goes to married couples who have no marriage \npenalty problem but who are already in a bonus situation.\n  I am asking the Senator: Most Americans would rather have the \nnational debt paid down. Doesn't it make more sense for us to address \nthe marriage tax penalty problem directly and to take the rest and help \npay down the national debt?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We are paying down the national debt in record amounts. \nAs the Senator knows, we are down $175 billion this year. That will \ncontinue. The tax reduction that would be affected by this bill \nrepresents only, let us say, a small fraction of the total surplus we \nwill be looking at in the next number of years.\n  If these so-called bonuses that the Senator refers to are primarily \ngiven to the one-income earner couple where a mother stays home and is \nnot working, they receive some benefit from that. I think the bonus is \nnot sufficient to make up for the fact that one of them stays at home.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n  Also, one of the most pernicious parts of this bill--the Senator from \nTexas has talked about this previously--is that we are attempting in \nAmerica today to break through the glass ceiling to have women move \nforward and achieve equal income in America. That is happening to a \nrecord degree. But under the present Tax Code, the more equal the \nmarriage partners are in income, the more tax penalty falls on them. In \na way, as a practical matter, it seems to fall against working women in \na way that you would not expect it to, and it is something we would not \nwant to see happen.\n  We have unanimous agreement that the marriage tax penalty is a matter \nthat ought not to continue. This legislation deals directly and \nsquarely with that. It doubles the standard deduction. It doubles the \nbrackets for married couples, which is the simplest and best way to \nachieve that. It will give hard-earned relief to married couples.\n  We had the spectacle reported of the witness who testified in the \nHouse committee that each year he and his wife would divorce before the \nend of the year, file separately, get the lower tax rate, and then \nremarry at the beginning of the next year.\n  We ought not to have tax policies that would make somebody feel as if \nthey could get ahead of the system and save money for their family by \ndivorcing every year. It is the kind of thing that is not healthy.\n  I appreciate the fact we are finally moving. I hope in a bipartisan \nway to see this bill become law.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, these are very interesting discussions. \nI think that for a long, long period of time people at the grassroots \nof America have understood there should not be a policy that hurts \npeople who join in bonds of matrimony. Everybody realizes that the \nstrength and foundation of our society is the family. The husband and \nwife are the strength of our society and the foundation of our society.\n  We have legislation before us that finally will end the penalty \nagainst people who marry and get hit with a higher level of taxation \nrather than two people who aren't married and filing separately making \nthe same amount of income.\n  Basically, we are talking about the issue of fairness--in this case, \nfairness within the Tax Code; economic fairness for people who are \nmarried.\n  For about 30 years, our Tax Code has been penalizing people just \nbecause they happen to be married.\n  This is, of course, a perfect example of how broken our Tax Code is, \nand perhaps is an example that can be given with many other examples of \nwhy there ought to be a broader look at greater reform and \nsimplification of the Tax Code. That debate is for another day. Even \nthough 70 percent of the people in this country feel the Tax Code is \nbroken and ought to be thrown out, there is not a consensus among the \nAmerican people whether a flat rate income tax, which about 30 percent \nof the people say we ought to have, or a national sales tax, which \nabout 20 percent of the people say we ought to have, should take the \nplace of the present Tax Code.\n  I use those two percentages to show there is not much of a consensus \nof what should take its place and therefore probably not enough \nmovement being reflected in the Congress for an alternative to the \npresent Tax Code. Therefore, we find ourselves refining the Tax Code \nwithin our ability to do it--a little bit here and a little bit there.\n  One of the most outstanding examples of something wrong with our Tax \nCode is that people pay a marriage penalty, pay a higher rate of \ntaxation because they are married as opposed to two individuals filing \nseparately. As with the earnings limitation that discriminated against \nolder Americans, a bill was recently signed by the President of the \nUnited States. This unfair marriage penalty needs to be dumped, as \nwell.\n  I applaud my side of the aisle because it took a Republican-led \nCongress to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, but the \nPresident of the United States was very happy to sign that Republican-\nled effort. To be fair to the other side, it eventually did pass \nunanimously. It is the same Republican-led Congress that is taking the \nlead in repealing the marriage penalty tax.\n  I listened to a number of comments from the minority side yesterday. \nI came away with the conclusion they want the American people to \nbelieve that the other side of the aisle is for getting rid of the \nmarriage penalty tax. Of course, the minority party had control of the \nCongress for decades and never once tried to repeal it. Even more \ninteresting, I am afraid we could be victims of the old bait-and-switch \nroutine. For instance, as this bill was being considered in the Senate \nFinance Committee, an amendment was offered by the minority to delay \nany marriage penalty relief until we fixed Social Security and \nMedicare. That is a ``manana'' type of amendment, meaning if we wait to \ndo these other things tomorrow before we have a tax cut, we are never \ngoing to have a tax cut.\n  We may see that amendment again on the floor of the Senate. Remember, \nin committee, all of the Democrats voted for delay until Social \nSecurity or Medicare was fixed, and all the Republicans voted to fix \nthe marriage penalty tax now. We all know neither the administration \nnor the Democratic side have comprehensive proposals to fix Social \nSecurity and Medicare. I have to admit, I am participating with two or \nthree Democrats on a bipartisan effort to fix Social Security, but the \nadministration has refused to endorse that bipartisan effort. There are \nalso bipartisan efforts in the Senate to fix Medicare, but the White \nHouse has not endorsed those bipartisan efforts.\n  Saying that Social Security and Medicare ought to be fixed before we \ngive some tax relief, and particularly tax relief through the marriage \npenalty tax, is like saying you don't want a tax cut. I am sorry to say \nat this late stage of this Congress, I don't think we will see from the \nClinton-Gore administration any efforts to fix these problems this year \nin a comprehensive way. When they say we ought to fix Social Security \nor Medicare first, it is a manana approach--put it off until later; \nthat day will surely never come if we follow that scenario.\n  The national leadership of the unions in America, the AFL-CIO \nleadership, put out their marching orders in a legislative alert making \nthese very same arguments that I am sure is only coincidental. They \nurge that the marriage penalty relief should be delayed until these \nother problems--presumably Social Security and Medicare--are solved.\n\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle say they are for marriage \npenalty relief but only some time in the unknown future. That is, in \nfact, Washington, DC, doubletalk that continues to make the American \npeople more cynical about whether Congress is ever determined and \nwilling and committed to deliver keeping our promises. Delaying this \ntax relief means no tax relief at all. I hope taxpayers across the \ncountry will let their Senators know they have had enough of this \ndoubletalk and that they will demand real action now, and sooner or \nlater we will get this bill brought to a final vote.\n  Another misguided argument used yesterday is that under the majority \nbill married couples get a tax cut but single mothers with kids \nwouldn't get one. This is a complicated aspect of the bill, but the \nargument is not correct. Senators making these arguments repeated it, \nbringing emphasis to it, as if something new has been discovered, that \nsome kind of smoking gun had been discovered. Unfortunately, for those \nMembers' arguments, the statements are inaccurate. An important part of \nour bill repeals the alternative minimum tax for over 10 million \npeople. Many helped in that provision will be single mothers.\n  There is something much more interesting about this argument; that \nis, the alternative that presumably will be offered by the other side \nof the aisle is the bill that flatout, without question, doesn't help \nsingle mothers at all. But that isn't even the most important point.\n  That important point is, if a single mother chooses to eventually get \nmarried--and since marriage is the foundation of our society, I think \nwe all agree that this is a good move, both for the mother and the \nchildren--then, under our bill, she will not be penalized for being \nmarried. There will not be a\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nhigher rate of taxation just because that single mother gets married. \nUnder current law, if she continues to work after being married, the \nGovernment is going to slap her and her husband with a big tax \nincrease. It is that sort of very bad situation our bill will \neliminate.\n  In addition, it is important to note the alternative, from our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, discriminates against stay-at-\nhome moms. Why should we have proposals before us indicating, if you \ndecide you want to stay at home and raise your kids, spend full time \ndoing it--probably the most important economic contribution you can \nmake to American society, and you are not going to get paid for it, but \nit is a great contribution to American society. It might not be much of \nan economic contribution to the family because there is no income going \nto come as a result of it, but it is good for American society for kids \nto have parents who are able to be at home with them.\n  So if you decide to stay at home with the kids, you are going to be \ndiscriminated against under the alternative from the Democrat side of \nthe aisle.\n  That proposal only helps two-earner couples. It not only doesn't help \nthose single mothers over whom the other side of the aisle cries \ncrocodile tears frequently, it hurts those families where one parent \ndecides to stay at home with the children. I hope all of you stay-at-\nhome parents out there listening understand what the Democratic \nalternative would do to your families.\n  It seems to me we should be helping people get married, encouraging \nmarriage--it is the solid foundation of our society --not penalizing \nthem for doing it. So, I hope we can get this bill to discussion \nwithout cloture. Obviously, there is a legitimacy for amendments from \nthe other side of the aisle. There is even probably legitimacy for \namendments from our side of the aisle. There ought to be agreement to \nthose amendments.\n  It is really time for the gridlock to be over, to move to this bill, \nto get to a final vote. Now is the time to pass this very important \nreform, and I urge the Members of this body to come together on \namendments, on limitations on discussions, and do what is right by \npassing this legislation.\n  Before I yield the floor, if I could do something for the leader: I \nask unanimous consent the debate only continue on the marriage tax \npenalty until 5 p.m. today, with the time equally divided, and the \nmajority leader recognized at the hour of 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is important to lay things out \nas to what this issue is and what it is not. There is a lot of talk \nthat this is a marriage tax penalty. There is even an implication by \nsome that there is something put in the Tax Code to penalize couples \nbecause they are married; that is, they have to pay more taxes. Of \ncourse that is not true. A little history, I think, is instructive as \nto why we are here and what perhaps some solutions might be.\n  When the income tax was enacted, the Congress treated individuals as \nthe unit of taxation, whether or not one was married. If somebody made \na certain amount of money, he or she paid income taxes. If he or she \ngot married, he or she was subject to the same rates, the same \nschedule. The individual was treated as the unit.\n  That was the case for a while. But many States in our Nation are \ncommunity property States. They have different laws which determine to \nwhat income a man or woman in married status is entitled. In community \nproperty States, the rule is any income earned by a spouse is \nautomatically community property and therefore is equally divisible. As \na consequence, in community property States, each, the man and wife, \nwould combine their incomes and file separately. That was upheld by the \ncourts. That created a big discrepancy between community property \nStates and common law States.\n  In common law States, an individual still had to pay the individual \nrates, whether or not he or she got married, which was just not fair. \nSo Congress in 1948 changed the law to make it fair. What did Congress \ndo? Congress in 1948 said: OK, we are going to double the deductions \nfor married couples as opposed to singles, so when you get married, you \ndo not pay any more taxes than you would pay if you were single. That \nwas the rule of thumb. The brackets for the married were doubled, and \nthe deductions were doubled.\n  That created another inequity. In this area of tax law, when you push \ndown the balloon someplace, it pops up someplace else. The inequity \ncreated was the inequity for individual taxpayers because individual \ntaxpayers say: Wait a minute, here I am as an individual taxpayer. I am \npaying up to 42 percent more in income taxes on the same income that a \nmarried couple earns. If the married couple earns $100,000, \nhypothetically, my taxes as a single individual earning $100,000 are up \nto 42 percent more than the couple's. That is not right.\n  Congress in 1969 agreed that was not right, so Congress went in the \nother direction. In 1969, Congress said: We are going to raise it, \nwiden the brackets, adjust the brackets for individuals so they are a \nlittle more in line with those for people who are married.\n  The rule of thumb was a tax paid by an individual could not be more \nthan 60 percent more than the taxes paid by a married couple. That was \nfine for a while. Then over the years we have a lot more couples where \nboth members of the family are earning more income.\n  This is a long way of saying when we make some change in the law \nhere, it is going to cause some inequity someplace else. It is a \nmathematical truth that we cannot have marriage neutrality and \nprogressive rates and have all married couples with the same total \nincome pay the same taxes. It is a mathematical impossibility to \naccomplish all three objectives. It cannot be done. So we have to make \nchoices. The choices are whether to tilt a little more in one direction \nor the other. The bill before the Congress now is a good-faith, honest \neffort to try to solve that problem.\n  There are different points of view. The bill passed out by the \nFinance Committee attempts to solve that problem one way. The provision \noffered by Senator Moynihan, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, had a different approach to solve that problem. Let me very \nbriefly lay it out so people have a sense of what the two different \napproaches are to solve the marriage tax penalty problem.\n  Recognizing that today, to be honest about it, more married couples \nreceive a bonus when they get married, not a penalty--or, to state it \ndifferently: More people, men and women, when they get married today, \nwill receive a bonus; that is, they will pay less taxes as a \nconsequence of getting married than they would individually.\n  It is true that about half of the people who get married end up \npaying more taxes, and that is called the marriage tax penalty. It is a \nconsequence of the progressive nature of our Tax Code, along with a \ndesire to be fair to widows and widowers and other single taxpayers, \nand to be fair to married taxpayers, making sure that some married \ntaxpayers, who have the same income as other married taxpayers, do not \npay more. It is a very hard thing to do.\n  The majority bill tries to solve it this way: It raises the standard \ndeduction. It raises the 15-percent and 28-percent brackets. It changes \nthe earned-income tax credit for lower income people. It makes no other \nchange. It is pretty complicated.\n  As a consequence, some people who are married and pay a marriage tax \npenalty will receive relief but not all will. This is a very important \npoint. The majority committee bill addresses only 3 of the 65 \nprovisions in the code which cause the marriage tax penalty. That is \nstandard deduction and the two brackets. That is all.\n  The chart behind me shows the situation. On the left is current law. \nThere are 65 provisions in the Tax Code today which cause a marriage \ntax penalty. The GOP proposal, which is the column in the middle of the \nchart, addresses only 3, leaving 62 provisions in the code which cause \na marriage tax penalty.\n  What is one of the biggest? Social Security, and it is a big one, \ntoo. It costs about $60 billion to fix. The majority\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\ncommittee bill says: No, we are not going to help you seniors. If two \nof you get married, you have to pay more taxes. You have a marriage tax \npenalty; we are not going to help you. The majority committee bill does \nnot deal with seniors at all.\n  There are a lot of senior citizens in our country who are not going \nto find any relief as a consequence of the majority bill. There are 61 \nother provisions in the code on which the majority committee bill will \nnot give people relief.\n  The bill offered by Senator Moynihan, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, is very simple. It says to taxpayers: OK, you have a \nchoice. You, as a married couple, can file jointly or you can file \nseparately. That is your choice. You run the calculation, and whatever \ncomes out lower is presumably the one you are going to make.\n  What is the beauty about that? Why is that better? It is better \nbecause it is simple. The majority bill further complicates the code, \nand the code is complicated enough. The majority bill adds more \ncomplications by trying to deal with changing the deductions, phase-\nins, and so forth. There are a lot more complications.\n  The minority provision is very simple. It says: You choose. It does \nnot add more complications. In addition, it addresses all 65 of the \nmarriage tax penalty provisions in the code today. There are many of \nthem. I mentioned one such as Social Security. That is one the majority \nbill does not address.\n  Other are like interest deduction of student loans. Many students \nhave loans, and as a consequence of current law, when you get married, \nsometimes you pay more taxes. The majority committee bill does not do \nanything about that. The majority committee bill does not address that. \nIt only deals with 3 provisions--the standard deduction and two \nbrackets, 15- and 28-percent brackets. Those three provisions sometimes \ncause a marriage tax penalty.\n  The minority bill takes care of all the penalty provisions in the \ncode. Look at the chart again. The zero under the Democratic proposal \nmeans there are zero marriage tax penalties as a result of the \nDemocratic proposal. The GOP proposal has 62 remaining marriage tax \npenalties.\n  I am curious as to why they did not address those. I may ask some \nMembers on that side as to why they did not address some of them. A lot \nof folks are going to wonder, senior citizens are going to wonder, \nsomebody who takes an IRA deduction is going to wonder, someone who \ntakes a Roth IRA deduction is going to wonder: Gee, why don't they take \ncare of marriage tax penalties that affect me? I do not know. Maybe \nsometime the majority can answer why they do not address those other \nmarriage tax penalties.\n  There are other inequities, but I am not going to get into all of \nthem right now. We will get into them at a later date.\n  It is important to point out that there are two attempts to solve the \nmarriage tax penalty problem: The majority committee bill only deals \nwith three of the provisions in the Tax Code which cause a marriage tax \npenalty. The minority bill deals with all of them. There is no \nprovision left as a consequence of the minority bill.\n  In addition, the minority bill is much simpler; one only has to \nchoose, whereas in the majority committee bill, my gosh, one cannot \nchoose; they are forced into a situation, and they are not part of the \nsolution. They have to deal with extra complexities. It does not solve \nthe problem.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Kansas wants to \nspeak, but if I can take a couple minutes to respond to some things the \nSenator from Montana stated, I think I should do that.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kansas such time as he might consume. I \nshould wait until the Senator from Montana is on the floor before I \ngive my response to him. I yield Senator Brownback such time as he \nconsumes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, for his leadership on this issue and for yielding me time to \nspeak on this bill.\n  I, too, want to comment on the Marriage Penalty Act and the marriage \ntax penalty elimination, and some of the comments of the Senator from \nMontana. I wish he was still on the floor.\n  He says we have differences of opinion: The Democrats have a marriage \ntax penalty bill; the Republicans have one. He thinks theirs is better. \nGreat. Let's have a debate on those two. Let's vote. I do not know when \nwe have had as much clarity of differences between a Democratic bill \nand a Republican bill, where both parties have said we want to pass a \nbill on any issue this year, than the bill we have before us.\n  I am pleading with the members of the Democratic Party: Let's have a \nvote. Let's have a great debate. We will debate your bill for 2 hours, \nours for 2 hours, vote on both of these, and let's get this moving \nforward.\n  If they want to pass a marriage tax penalty elimination bill, we have \nthe time; we have the place; we have the floor; we can have this vote \nnow. If they do not want to, and really all this is about is: Well, we \ndo, but we are going to block this with eight or nine irrelevant \namendments; we are really not that interested in doing this, then that \nshould be said as well. They should be out here saying, no, this really \nisn't a high priority for the Democratic Party to pass, rather than \nsaying, OK, we have a bill, you have a bill, and let's vote.\n  It is time we vote up or down, and we have the time before we go into \na recess.\n  The other thing I would like to point out is the President sent us \nhis budget for the fiscal year 2001. I have a copy of the budget the \nPresident submitted to us. In his budget, he inserted his support for \neliminating the marriage tax penalty. In the President's budget, on the \nEITC, on page 57, entitled, ``Supporting Working Families,'' he says at \nthe bottom of this page:\n\n       In this budget, the President builds upon these policies \n     that are central to his agenda of work, responsibility, and \n     family.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The budget expands the EITC to provide marriage penalty \n     relief to two earner couples . . . .\n\n  That is what our bill does. We have a chance to get that particular \nprovision that he is calling for in the budget to the President.\n  Going back now in his budget to the tables of his proposals and his \n10-year estimates on it--this is on page 409--he provides for, and it \nstates:\n\n       Provide marriage penalty relief and increase standard \n     deduction.\n\n  He does a much smaller one than we have put forward. I think he also \neven has a smaller one than Senator Moynihan's proposal that came \nforward in the Finance Committee. But the President has said all along: \nLet's eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Let's do this.\n  It is in his budget.\n  He has asked us not to send him these gargantuan bills that have 20 \ndifferent items in them. He asked us to send him one like we did on the \nSocial Security earnings limit test. We passed that bill and sent it to \nthe President. He signed it into law. He appreciated being able to have \nthat degree of clarity and that degree of focus on a particular issue.\n  We have another one. We are having the debate on it. It is the time \nand the place for us to consider and vote on this now. We need to \nconsider the proposals that the other party has, and to consider our \nproposals. Let's move this topic forward.\n  The President has said he wants it. I hope the President gets \ninvolved in this debate and urges the Senate and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to vote on this issue and to get it to him--if \nhe wants it. He said he did in his budget. If he truly wants this \nmarriage tax penalty relief, let's have a vote, and let's get it to the \nPresident. We can do this now.\n  I am fearful. What I am sensing is that we are just getting a lot of \ndelay tactics and no real interest in passing the marriage penalty tax \nrelief. Clearly, there is not an interest to pass it before April 15.\n  People have the right to do those sorts of tactics, if they want to. \nBut I do not think they should hide and say they just have a different \nbill, when the true desire here is to not have any bill go through at \nall.\n  This affects a lot of people. We have been over and over this lots of \ntimes. It affects 25 million Americans. In Kansas, 259,000-plus people \nare affected by\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\nthis marriage tax penalty that we have in place. The Senator from \nMontana has 89,000 people who are affected.\n  I am looking forward to the chance and the time when we get to \nactually vote on these issues. Frankly, I think we have had enough \ndiscussion about the Democratic proposal and the Republican proposal. \nWe know what is in these proposals now. We know the costs of these \nproposals. We are ready to pass this. It is time to vote. I really do \nnot understand too much what is holding this up from moving forward.\n\n  My colleagues and I have had a number of people contacting our \noffices saying that this is a penalty they want to see done away with.\n  They have contacted us numerous times. I have worked with the Members \nof the House of Representatives who have passed this bill already. They \nhave sent to me letters from a number of people from across the country \nwith their specific examples of how they are penalized by the marriage \ntax penalty.\n  This is a letter from Steve in Smyrna, TN. He says:\n\n       My wife and I got married on January 1, 1997. We were going \n     to have a Christmas wedding last year, but after talking to \n     my accountant we saw that instead of both of us getting money \n     back on our taxes, we were going to have to pay in. So we \n     postponed it. Now, for getting married, we have to have more \n     taken out of our checks to just break even and not get a \n     refund. We got penalized for getting married.\n\n  Then he concludes:\n\n       And that just isn't right.\n\n  I agree. I presume the Senator from Montana agrees. I presume most of \nthe people on the other side of the aisle agree as well. Let's vote \nthen and get a proposal out of here so we can actually deal with this.\n  Here is one from Wayne in Dayton, OH:\n\n       Penalizing for marriage flies in the face of common sense. \n     This is a classic example of government policy not supporting \n     that which it wishes to promote. In our particular situation, \n     my girl friend and I would incur an annual penalty of $2,000 \n     or approximately $167 per month. Though not huge, this is \n     enough to pay our monthly phone, cable, water, and home \n     insurance bills combined.\n\n  I think that is pretty huge when you are talking about that size of a \nmarriage penalty.\n  This one is from Marietta, GA. Bobby and Susan wrote this one:\n\n       We always file as married filing separately because that \n     saves us about $500 a year over filing married, filing \n     jointly. When we figured our 1996 tax return, just out of \n     curiosity, we figured what our tax would be if we were just \n     living together instead of married. Imagine our disgust when \n     we discovered that, if we just lived together instead of \n     being married, we would have saved an additional $1,000. So \n     much for the much vaunted ``family values'' of our \n     government. Our government is sending a very bad message to \n     young adults by penalizing marriage this way.\n\n  This is from Thomas in Hilliard, OH.\n\n       No person who legitimately supports family values could be \n     against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another \n     example of how in the past 40 years the federal government \n     has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental \n     institutions that were the strength of this country from the \n     start.\n\n  This one is from David in Guilford, IN:\n\n       This is one of the most unfair laws that is on the books. I \n     have been married for more than 23 years and would really \n     like to see this injustice changed so my sons will not have \n     to face this additional tax. Please keep up the great work.\n\n  He goes on.\n  We have a number of different letters. I do not think it really bears \ngoing into much longer because what I hear everybody saying is: We are \nfor eliminating the marriage tax penalty. The American public is for \ndoing that. It is the time to do that. We now just have procedural \nroadblocks to getting it done.\n  That is the bottom line of where we are today. We could vote on this \ntoday. We could vote on the Democratic alternative. We could vote on \nthe Republican alternative. We could have up-or-down votes on this \ntoday and get this through this body, get it to conference, and on down \nto the President, and see if he really meant it when he said in his \nbudget that he wanted to do this, the EITC, the marriage tax penalty \nelimination, to see if he really wants to eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty. We could see if the President really meant that.\n  I invite the President to get involved in this debate so we can pass \nthis through.\n  I have worked with the administration on a number of bills. I would \nhope they would start engaging us here saying: Yes, we want to do this \nand pass this on through.\n  Let's not stall it. Let's get this thing moving forward so we can \nsend this message out across the country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see several other Members on the floor. \nIt is time to get this moving forward.\n  I just call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and say \nlet's not play on this thing. Let's say we are going to pass it. Let's \ntake the votes, and let's move forward.\n  I yield back to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, if I have a minute or 2 more--I don't want to take up \nthe time from my colleague of Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thought the Senator yielded the floor.\n  I would like to speak now if the Senator has yielded the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First of all, I think there is a very general proposition about the \nTax Code. I want to relate it to the philosophy of higher taxation on \nthe part of the Democratic Party members; and that is, that the higher \nthe marginal tax rate, the worse the marriage tax penalty is.\n  We have in 1990 the drive for increasing taxes by Senator Mitchell \nwhen he was majority leader. That increased marginal tax rates at that \nparticular time. Then we have had the highest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country, which was the one that was passed within 7 \nmonths after the Clinton administration was sworn in in 1993, in which \nwe still had two higher brackets put into the Tax Code.\n\n  Remember, that tax increase passed with 49 Democrats for it, and all \nRepublicans and a few Democrats against it. It passed by Vice President \nGore breaking the tie. Remember that we have a much worse tax penalty \nnow than we did under the tax policies of the 1980s, when we had two \nbrackets, 15 and 28 percent. The extent to which the marriage tax \npenalty is worse now than before is a direct result of higher marginal \ntax rates promoted by the other side of the aisle.\n  I also have to make a point in reference to what the Senator from \nMontana said today, as well as what he had said yesterday; that is, his \naccusation that the tax bill that reduces the marriage tax penalty \nbefore us is further evidence of the majority party trying to benefit \nhigher income people. The Senator should be aware that his Democrat \nalternative actually benefits more higher income people than the bill \nthat is before us by the Republican Party. I hope he will take a look \nat the distribution tables that show his bill helps more higher income \npeople than the bill we are trying to get passed.\n  We have also heard arguments that this legislation does not end the \nmarriage tax penalty in every way. This legislation ends the marriage \ntax penalty in the standard deduction and the 15- and 28-percent rate \nbrackets and reduces it for virtually every family that suffers from \nthe marriage tax penalty. This is the largest attack on the marriage \ntax penalty since its inception in 1969.\n  For many working couples, those in the 15-percent and the 28-percent \ntax bracket, which would be up to about $127,000 under this bill, this \nlegislation effectively ends the marriage tax penalty. For those \ncouples in higher income brackets, this legislation provides a \nsignificant reduction in the marriage tax penalty.\n  It is correct that this bill does not end all marriage tax penalties \nin the Tax Code. There are over 60 instances of the penalty in the \ncode. This bill is about hitting the marriage tax penalty where it hits \nhardest--in the middle income tax brackets, the standard deduction, and \nthe earned-income tax credit.\n  There is also talk about the bill before us resulting in more Tax \nCode complexity. Our bill is simpler than the Democrat alternative. Our \nlegislation eliminates the marriage tax penalty in the standard \ndeduction and the 15-percent and 28-percent rate brackets. How could \nthis be more simple?\n  I hope we can have further discussion of these disagreements because \nI am convinced we can soundly overcome the arguments of the other side \nof the aisle.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  I yield the floor. The Senator from Texas may use whatever time she \nneeds or is available.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for \nmaking those points because I think they are very important. The \ndifferences between the Democrat alternative and the Republican plan \nthat is on the floor are actually quite extensive.\n  In the first place, the Democrat plan is $100 billion less in tax \nrelief for American families. We are trying to cover more families. Not \nonly are we trying to cover the people who are in the 15-percent \nbracket and the 28-percent bracket, which takes us through everyone who \npays taxes up to $127,000 in joint income, but it also increases the \nearned-income tax credit for those who don't pay taxes at all. This is \nwhat helps a person who has been on welfare who goes to work and \nactually makes a salary of from $15,000 to $30,000 not have to pay any \nkind of penalty, even though they don't pay taxes.\n  We want to add to the $2,000 earned-income tax credit $2,500 more to \nthe salaries that would qualify for the earned-income tax credit. This \nis an incentive for working people who are in the lowest levels of pay \nto continue working and to realize that it is more important for them \nto work and to have an incentive to work than to be on welfare.\n  The points made by the Senator from Iowa are very appropriate. The \nRepublican plan not only offers more relief, it offers more relief to \nmore people, $100 billion more.\n  Secondly, the Democrat plan is phased in over a very long period of \ntime. It doesn't become fully effective until 2010. It is very \nbackloaded. Fifty percent of it doesn't even take effect until 2008. We \nwant to try to make that timeframe less, and we want to have \nsignificant tax cuts for hard-working American families.\n  Of course, we truly do believe that people will be able to make the \ndecisions with the money they earn better than they will be able to \nlive with decisions made in Washington, DC. In fact, I think it is very \nimportant that people realize, as they are writing their checks on \nApril 15--or Monday, April 17, if they can wait until the very end--\nthat the chances are they are in the 48 percent of the married couples. \nIf they are in that 48 percent that has a penalty, their tax bill next \nyear will be an average of $1,400 less, if we can pass the Republican \nplan, send it to the President, and if the President will sign it. The \nPresident has said he is for tax relief for married couples. We \ncertainly think he should sign the bill. If he doesn't sign the bill, \nwe would really like to know why because this is a better tax cut plan.\n  There is probably just a difference on what is a marriage bonus. For \na married couple where one spouse decides to stay home and raise the \nchildren and they don't pay as much in tax as the single person \ndoubled, I don't think that is a bonus. I would not want to tell my \ndaughter, who has three children, that she is not working when she is \nstaying home with them. Thank goodness we have people who want to stay \nhome and raise their children. I don't want to make that decision for \nthem, but I certainly want them to have the option and not be penalized \nin any way.\n  I think everything we can do to encourage families to be able to make \nthat choice we should do. I do not consider it a bonus. What I want is \ntotal fairness. What I want is, if a person is single and marries \nanother single working person, when they get married there is no \npenalty whatsoever. The $1,000 we now make them pay because they got \nmarried would be spent instead by them, to start building their nest \negg, to have their first home, to buy the second car, whatever it is \nthey need, as newlyweds, who are the ones who struggle the hardest. We \nwant them to have the benefit of not having discrimination in the Tax \nCode.\n  What we are talking about is tax relief; it is a tax correction. It \nis saying that we don't want to penalize people for getting married. \nWhen 48 percent of the married couples in this country do have that \npenalty, what we want to do is correct it. I hope the Democrats will \nwork with us to have relevant amendments that could be put forward. \nThis is a good debate. I think we can differ on the way we would give \nmarriage tax penalty relief. But my plea with the Democrats is let us \ntake it up. Don't say that you have to offer extraneous amendments \nwhich don't have anything to do with marriage tax penalty, especially \nwhen President Clinton has asked us to send him a marriage tax penalty \nbill. That is what I hope will happen at 5 o'clock.\n  I hope the President will work with the Democrats and tell them he \nbelieves in tax relief. I hope we can pass that relief for the hard-\nworking Americans who deserve a break. I urge my colleagues to help us \noffer these amendments. Let's debate them and let's give Americans tax \nrelief as they are signing those checks to the Federal Government this \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana controls the \nremainder of the time until 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see my good friend, the Senator from \nTexas, still on the floor. I will ask her a couple of questions.\n  Clearly, we both want to solve the marriage tax penalty. It is my \njudgment that we are going to pass legislation this week--I hope so. \nThere will be a couple of amendments. It is normal and proper in the \nSenate for Senators who think they can improve upon a bill to offer \namendments. I certainly hope we can dispose of the issue this week. I \nexpect that to happen. I hope so. In doing so, obviously, we want to do \nwhat is right. When you do something, you should do your darndest to \nmake sure you do it right the first time so you don't have to correct \nmistakes later on.\n  I am wondering why it would not make more sense to address all of the \nmarriage tax penalty problems in the code in this bill rather than only \na few. As the Senator knows, there are about 65 provisions in the Tax \nCode, the consequence of which sometimes results in a marriage tax \npenalty for some married couples--not all but for some.\n  I am not being critical of the provision offered by the majority. But \nas the Senator knows, in the proposal offered by the majority, they \ndeal with only 3 of those 65 provisions; whereas, the way the minority \nattempts to solve this, or proposes to solve the marriage tax penalty \nproblem is to allow optional filing; as a consequence, all 65 \nprovisions in the code are dealt with, so that in the minority position \nall of the marriage inequities are solved--all 65 provisions.\n  I am wondering why--without being critical--it doesn't make more \nsense for us while we are here, while we are going to pass a bill \nrelieving couples of the marriage tax penalty, to entirely solve the \nproblem, as is the case in the minority bill, rather than only for a \nfew, as is the case in the majority bill.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Montana for saying, first of \nall, he thinks we will have a marriage tax penalty relief bill passed. \nI certainly think a couple of amendments--five or six or so--on either \nside, which are relevant, to try to perfect legislation is quite \nreasonable. I hope that is what the Democrats intend to offer. That \nisn't what we have seen so far. So perhaps we are coming to a \nconclusion. I hope so.\n  Let me say that if the only bill on the floor were the Democratic \nalternative, I would vote for it because I have voted for it before. It \nis not a bad plan. But I think the Republican plan is better. Here is \nwhy. First of all, our plan helps more people who are in the lower \nlevels, the middle-income levels, who really need this kind of help. We \nsay that if a single person making $35,000 married, or a single person \nmaking $30,000, you double the bracket so their combined bracket is \ngoing to be the same. They will not be penalized in the 15-percent \nbracket or the 28-percent bracket. Now, I would be for going all the \nway through those brackets because I am for tax relief for hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Ours is a bigger bill. It covers more people. I think it is the \nbetter approach. I would be for bracket relief across the board, too, \nbecause I think the tax burden is too heavy and we are talking about \nthe income tax surplus, not the Social Security surplus. So this\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nis the money people have sent to Washington that is beyond what the \nGovernment needs for the Government to operate. So I think ours is \nbetter, but I don't think yours is bad. I just hope we can give the \nmost tax relief to the most people.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe the Senator is not addressing the question, for \nmany good reasons. The question is, why not deal with all 65 of the \ninequities rather than only 3?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If we took our plan and yours and put them together, \nI would think that would be better than the Republican plan. Your plan \nalone is not as good as the Republican plan because it doesn't give \nthat much relief. Our plan gives $2,500 more in the earned-income tax \ncredit. This is helping people come off of the welfare rolls and have \nthe opportunity to be paid to make them whole. These are people who \nmake $12,000 to $30,000 a year, when they have two children, a family \nof four. It also helps people in the 15-percent bracket and in the 30-\npercent bracket.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. We are on my time, so \nI will finish up.\n  Briefly, I think it is important to point this out. One of the \nprovisions not dealt with in the majority bill is taxation of Social \nSecurity benefits. That is no small item. It would cost about $60 \nbillion over 10 years if it were to be addressed. I remind people that \ntoday the majority bill before us is about $248 billion over 10 years. \nSo, in addition, $60 billion is the amount that senior citizens would \nhave to pay as a consequence of the marriage tax penalty, which is not \ncovered by the Finance Committee bill.\n  I might add that, again, the minority bill does solve the Social \nSecurity benefits problem, as it does each of the other 62 remaining \nprovisions in the Tax Code which may result in a marriage tax penalty. \nI hear people say, well, theirs is a better bill. But that doesn't get \ndown to the specifics of what it actually does. I remind Senators that \nover half of the tax reduction in the bill offered by the Finance \nCommittee goes to people who are already in a bonus situation. It has \nnothing to do with the marriage tax penalty.\n\n  I am suggesting that those are dollars that could be perhaps better \nspent for debt reduction. I think most Americans would like to see the \nnational debt paid off. That makes a lot more sense to me. Or perhaps \nthey would prefer that it go to education, health care, or whatnot.\n  We are here to address the marriage tax penalty. I think we should \nfocus on the marriage tax penalty and, by doing that, I submit that the \nproposal offered by Senator Moynihan, the minority alternative, focuses \nonly on the marriage tax penalty. It is very simple to understand. \nEssentially, the taxpayers choose whether to file jointly or \nseparately. I think that sort of empowers the taxpayers to decide for \nthemselves what they want to do. They can be part of the solution where \nthey pay lower taxes and not have to pay any marriage tax penalty at \nall. Again, $60 billion of Social Security benefits is not fixed by \nthis bill.\n  I want to add this, and I know my time is about to expire, the AMT. \nOne consequence of the committee bill is that there are 5.6 million \nmore taxpayers who are going to have to file under the alternative \nminimum tax than today--5.6 million new taxpayers, new people who are \nnot filing under the alternative minimum tax, separate and filing \ntoday, will not have to under the Finance Committee bill.\n  That is not the case in the minority committee bill.\n  I think we should give relief to those folks so they don't have to go \nto the AMT situation; or, to say it differently, the Finance Committee \nbill gives some relief to AMT taxpayers and then takes it back by \nsaying now you new taxpayers have to file the AMT.\n  Why is that result? Why does that happen? It happens because of what \nI have said for a good part of this day; namely, the Finance Committee \nbill only deals with 3 of the 65 provisions. Those three are: the \nstandard deduction, the 15-percent and 20-percent brackets. As a \nconsequence, there is this AMT shift.\n  I don't think we want to say to 5.6 million Americans that you do not \nhave to file the AMT today, the alternative minimum tax, and go through \nall of that and pay that tax, but now you will, as a consequence of the \nFinance Committee bill. I don't think we want to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I inquire about the situation now? I \nbelieve we had general debate until 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand Senator Daschle will be here \nmomentarily. For his benefit, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I have been \nworking to try to reach an agreement to consider the very important \nMarriage Tax Penalty Relief Act. We started working on it yesterday \nafternoon sometime around 3:30 or 4. Senator Daschle indicated they had \na number of amendments that they would like to have considered, and, of \ncourse, we asked for a chance to see what those amendments were. We, of \ncourse, urged that they be relevant amendments.\n  At about 3 o'clock today, we received a list of amendments that \nmembers of the minority wanted to offer to the Marriage Tax Penalty \nRelief Act. The list included nine amendments, five or six of which \nwere clearly not related to the marriage tax penalty relief bill. And \nthen about an hour or so later an additional amendment was added by \nSenator Harkin. The list is now up to 10 amendments.\n  I indicated all along--like we worked it out earlier this year on the \neducation savings account--that we could go with alternatives and \nrelevant amendments. That is eventually what we did with the education \nsavings account. Of course, I had hoped with the very overwhelmingly \npopular Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act that we could do something \nsimilar to what we did on the Social Security earnings test \nelimination. That was something that had been pending in this body and \non Capitol Hill for 20 years.\n  Finally, we worked it out. We had a couple of relevant amendments to \nwhich we agreed. We had a good discussion. We voted, I think, on one of \nthose amendments. It passed unanimously. The President signed it last \nweek with great fanfare that we had achieved this worthwhile goal.\n  I think we can do the same thing with the marriage penalty tax. But \nin order to do it, we need to keep our focus on what is the best way to \nprovide this marriage penalty tax relief. Is it a phaseout? Should it \napply to everybody? What can you do for those in the lower income \nbrackets in how you deal with the EITC, earned-income tax credit, how \nyou deal with the lowest and middle brackets? Is there a better way to \ndo it or another way to do it?\n\n  Senator Moynihan, Senator Baucus, and others on the Finance \nCommittee, had a different approach. I described it then, and publicly \nI think it is a credible approach. I don't think it is as good as the \none we had in the basic bill, but it is one that is worthy of being \ntalked about and thought about. I hope we can work it out so we can do \nthat.\n  We could have debate on the bill and then go to a vote on the \nalternatives and relevant amendments and get this finished by the close \nof business on Thursday or Friday at the latest. But the list we have \nis not only not relevant, but, first of all, we haven't had a chance to \nreally look at how they would work or the details of the proposals.\n  One of them by Senator Robb has to do with prescription drugs. \nSenator Wellstone has one which is something similar to the Canadian \nsystem of prescription drugs. But it looks to be a pretty detailed \nproposal that I don't think the Finance Committee has had a chance to \nconsider.\n  We have one by Senator Graham dealing with Medicare and Social \nSecurity priorities. I think he offered something similar to this in \nthe Finance Committee. This is not one of which we\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nwere unaware. We could have a discussion on that, and I think have a \nvote, but it certainly doesn't relate to the marriage tax penalty.\n  We have one on the college tuition tax credit. There is one on the \nCRT income. This is an agriculture issue. We have one on changing how \nyou deduct a natural disaster impact on your tax form. I don't even \nknow. That may be something we would want to look at doing. Don't we \nwant to consider that in the Finance Committee, see what the budgetary \nimpact is, and see what people are doing now versus what they might do \nunder this proposal? It is something I would like to talk to Senator \nTorricelli about to see exactly what he is trying achieve.\n  Then, at 3:45, we got the amendment from Senator Harkin. Honestly, I \ncan't even quite tell you what it did. I believe that one relates to \nthe marriage tax penalty. It would probably be relevant. Three or four \nof these could probably be relevant, and we could get them done.\n  I hope the Democratic leader would try to reduce his list or, at a \nminimum, make them work with us in getting relevant amendments to the \nmarriage tax relief bill. I think that is a reasonable request.\n  I emphasize again that is what we did on the education savings \naccount and on the Social Security earnings limitation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume the \npending legislation and that there be 10 relevant amendments in order \nfor the Democratic leader, or his designee, and 2 relevant amendments \nin order for the majority leader to the pending substitute, with no \namendments in order to the language proposed to be stricken, or motions \nto commit or recommit. I further ask unanimous consent that following \nthe disposition of the listed amendments--certainly 10 would be an \nawful lot of amendments--and any relevant second degrees, the bill be \nadvanced to third reading, and passage occur, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, \nthe Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on behalf of \nthe Senate.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled for \nThursday of this week be vitiated, in view of this request, if it is \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 amendments to be \nconsidered during the debate on the marriage tax penalty be the \nfollowing:\n  An alternative amendment offered by Senator Baucus, or his \ndesignee; an alternative amendment offered by Senator Bayh; an \nalternative amendment offered by Senator Kennedy having to do with \nMedicaid and family care, or a motion to commit on the part of Senator \nKennedy; a Robb motion regarding marriage tax penalty and prescription \ndrugs; a Wellstone amendment on prescription drugs; a Graham amendment \non Medicare and Social Security priorities having to do with the \nmarriage tax penalty; a Schumer amendment having to do with college \ntuition tax credit and the marriage tax penalty; a Dorgan amendment \nhaving to do with taxation of CRP income; a Torricelli amendment having \nto do with tax consequences of national disaster assistance; and a \nHarkin amendment having to do with capping benefits in the bill and \nputting the savings into Medicare and Social Security trust funds on \nthe marriage tax penalty relief legislation, as well.\n\n  I further ask that each amendment be limited to debate for 1 hour \nequally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I \ninquire, is this the same list I was given earlier today plus the \nHarkin amendment that was added after that original list?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is there any difference? I thought you indicated on a \ncouple of these--and I referred to the earlier Kennedy amendment, which \nreally is a major Medicaid change--you made it sound as if it might be \nrelative to the marriage penalty tax.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on several occasions we have had debates \nwith the Parliamentarian and with the majority with regard to the issue \nof relevancy. I point out to my colleagues, the concept of relevancy is \nonly defined as it relates to an appropriations bill. There is no \ndefinition of relevancy.\n  In our view, all of these issues are relevant to the debate on \nmarriage tax penalty. We believe relevancy ought to be taken in that \ncontext. I am troubled by the interpretation we have gotten from the \nParliamentarian a couple of times on the issue of relevancy. In our \nview, these matters are certainly relevant to the debate on tax \nconsequences and marriage penalties.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is the Senator saying in each one of these cases what is \noffered would be in place of the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act in \nwhole or in part?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No. I am simply saying in most of the amendments offered \nthere is a direct relevancy to the issue of marriage tax penalty.\n  I am also suggesting in all cases we would be prepared to limit the \ndebate to 1 hour equally divided. Regardless of its relevancy, the fact \nis the majority leader would be able to begin this debate, conduct his \ndebate as he has anticipated, with an expectation that we could finish \nby the end of the day tomorrow.\n  He has noted, of course, that he doesn't necessarily support or \nendorse many of these amendments. It is the right of the majority \nleader, especially given the fact that we have now submitted to a 1-\nhour time limit, that he can oppose them, he can table them.\n  Mr. LOTT. How about second-degree them?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We would not agree to second-degree amendments.\n  To ask for the details on top of all of that seems to me to be a real \nstretch. I am sure that in good faith we can work through these \namendments one by one.\n  That is quite an acknowledgment on our part, a willingness to submit \nto the debate, 10 amendments, 1 hour equally divided on each of these, \nmost of them directly relevant to marriage tax penalty, but in all \ncases certainly relevant to the debate about priorities of the money \nbeing spent.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object to that with at least two \nobservations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. For instance, the taxability of the CRP income--I don't \nknow how anyone can stretch that to make it applicable to the Marriage \nTax Penalty Relief Act.\n  Second, the request by the Democratic leader did not allow for \nsecond-degree amendments, or any alternatives, or any option--even \nside-by-side amendments by the majority. We certainly need to work \nthrough that.\n  I still think we can go forward and continue to work to try to find a \nlist of, hopefully, relevant amendments that could be offered to get to \na conclusion on the marriage penalty tax.\n  Since we are not able to reach an agreement at this time, I announce \nthat the cloture vote will occur tomorrow unless we come to an \nagreement that allows a vitiation of that cloture vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, maybe you have to be in the minority to \nappreciate the position in which the minority has now been put once \nagain.\n  The Republican majority is saying, first and foremost, we want to \ndebate the marriage tax penalty. We say to that, absolutely; we want to \ndebate the marriage tax penalty. We strongly support marriage tax \npenalty relief.\n  Then they say, we want you to limit your amendments. So we say, OK, \nwe will limit our amendments.\n  Then they say, we not only want you to limit your amendments, we want \nto be able to tell you which amendments you can offer.\n  After saying first of all we will debate the marriage tax penalty, \nafter secondly saying we will limit amendments, to give the majority \nnow the right to dictate to the minority that they have the ability to \ndetermine what the context, what the definition, what the scope of our \namendments ought to be, it seems to me to be an abrogation of all that \nis fair in debating an important issue such as this.\n  If we are going to spend $248 billion, there are other ways in which \nwe can spend that money. Every one of these amendments in that context \nis relevant. Should we spend $248 billion on\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\na marriage tax relief bill, 60 percent of which does not go to those \nexperiencing a marriage tax penalty? Sixty percent of that $248 billion \ndoes not have anything to do with the marriage tax penalty. It goes in \nmost cases to people who get a marriage bonus.\n  We are saying let's fix the marriage tax penalty. But if you are \ngoing to spend all that money, we have a whole list of other things we \nthink we ought to be looking at. It is in that context that I think we \nare being reasonable and fair, especially given the fact that we are \nsimply saying we will agree to a limit on amendments, we will agree to \na limit on time.\n  I think this Republican bill is a marriage tax penalty relief bill in \nname only. It is a Trojan horse for the other risky tax schemes that \nhave been proposed so far this year. If this bill passes, Republicans \nwill then have enacted $566 billion in tax cuts this year before they \nhave even completed the budget resolution. That is not even counting \nthe audacious $1.3 trillion their Presidential candidate, George W. \nBush, has proposed as their standard bearer. Add $1.3 trillion and the \n$566 billion, and that is $2 trillion in tax cuts they are proposing \nwithout a budget resolution.\n  Is this the way we ought to spend the surplus, including the Social \nSecurity surplus? We are saying we can do better than that. We are \nsaying we ought to look at providing prescription drugs for our senior \ncitizens. We are saying we ought to look at college tuition tax \ncredits. We are saying we ought to look at the Medicaid and CHIP health \nprograms.\n  I remind my colleague, just this day last week, 51 Senators--\nRepublican and Democrat--voted for passing a prescription drug benefit \nbefore we pass the first dollar in tax cuts. Mr. President, 51 Senators \nvoted for that; a majority of Senators said we are for a prescription \ndrug benefit before we are for a tax cut, any kind of tax cut.\n\n  We want to deal with the marriage tax penalty. We want to come up \nwith an agreement on the marriage tax penalty. But if some Republicans \nwant to run for Democratic leader so they can dictate to the Democratic \ncaucus what our agenda ought to be and what our amendments ought to be, \nlet them run. I will take them on. We can have that debate. We will \nhave a good election in the Democratic caucus.\n  But until they are elected Democratic leader, I think Democrats ought \nto make the decision about what Democrats offer as amendments.\n  They can agree with us on time, on a limitation on numbers, but not \non context, not on text, not on substance. That is what this is all \nabout.\n  We will have the debate time on cloture if we have to. Like the \nmajority leader, I am an optimist. I am hopeful we can come to some \nagreement. It certainly is within reach. But not if we are dictated to \nwith regard to the text of the amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2600-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, before the two leaders leave the floor, I \nwant to say, first of all, the Democratic leader is being so generous. \nWe, the Democrats, 44 of us, follow him in lockstep. But the fact is, \nhe has gone a long ways towards accommodating the majority leader.\n  I would just say this in passing: If we are going to be logical about \nthis debate, then if you look at the underlying bill, that is the \nmarriage tax penalty the Republicans are pushing forward, you will find \n60 percent of it is not relevant to the marriage tax penalty--60 \npercent of it is not relevant. So if he is talking about relevancy, \nwhich I think should have no bearing on the proceedings here, 60 \npercent of their own underlying bill is not relevant.\n  So I think, I repeat, our leader has been so generous, trying to move \nthings along. I think his statement is underlined by all the other 44 \nDemocratic Senators. We support every step he has made. We think he is \ndoing the right thing in protecting the prerogatives of the Senate, \nhaving this debate in the Senate where there is free debate. We are not \neven asking for free debate; we are asking there be some debate, which \nis not being allowed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2600-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA, ANDRES PASTRANA\n\n  Mr. L.

Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership on both \nsides and their discussion on us moving forward and dealing with the \nmarriage penalty tax. I am glad we are finally coming together, but I \nwould note the Senator from South Dakota has put forward, on behalf of \nthe Democrat side, 10 amendments on this issue. Many of these are not \ndirectly relevant to what we are trying to get done. With all due \nrespect to him putting these forward, and I appreciate them working \nwith us some, we have a pretty direct issue in front of us. It is the \nmarriage tax penalty.\n  To tie with it a discussion on prescription drugs, to tie with it \ndiscussions on Medicare, on Social Security priorities, on a college \ntuition tax credit, on conservation reserve programs, on the natural \ndisaster assistance program, really just goes contrary, completely, to \nus ultimately trying to get this bill through.\n  What we have before us is a marriage tax penalty. We have two \nalternatives put forward by the Democrat Party. That is good. I think \nwe can have good, direct, clear votes on that, and then we can press \nforward.\n  With all due respect to the Democratic leader, to call this a risky \ntax strategy, I think what is at risk if we do not deal with the \nmarriage tax penalty is the institution of marriage in this country. \nWhat has happened is there is the fall-off in the number of people \ngetting married, and then we tax them on top of that. That is risky.\n  They have said a number of times that 52 percent does not deal with \nthe marriage tax penalty. It is all directly applicable to the marriage \ntax penalty.\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n  The Democratic proposal actually enshrines in law a new homemaker \npenalty; that is, when one of the spouses decides to stay at home and \ntake care of the children. The Democrat proposal makes families with \none wage earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than a \nfamily with two wage earners earning the same income. Why discriminate \nagainst one-wage-earner families? That is a direct connection to the \nmarriage tax penalty. That is a marriage tax penalty taking place with \nthe one-wage-earner family.\n  Why do we want a Tax Code that penalizes families because one spouse \nchooses to work hard at home and one chooses to work hard outside the \nhome? I do not see why we would want to do that.\n  There are a lot of things I like about the Democratic alternative, as \nfar as doing away with the marriage tax penalty in a number of other \nplaces in the Tax Code. This notion of penalizing a single-wage-earner \nfamily is really not something we should be pressing.\n  More to the point, it makes the entire issue of the marriage tax \npenalty, all 100 percent of the tax cut, relevant to marriage. They are \nsaying 52 percent of it is not relevant to the family. It is directly \nrelevant to that one-wage-earner family. In many of those cases, they \nare saying it is not.\n  The other point, and I do not think it needs to be belabored: If we \nare ready to pass marriage tax penalty relief and both sides agree we \nneed to pass marriage tax penalty relief, why would we take up a series \nof additional amendments on Medicaid, prescription drugs, Social \nSecurity, college tuition tax credit, Conservation Reserve Program, \nnatural disaster assistance? Those are not relevant to the issue. We \nhave a chance to do this particular issue, agree or disagree.\n  If the Democrats think this is too rich, let's vote on their bill; \nlet's have a vote on it. We have the chance now to do that, to hone in \non that. I am fearful that what I am seeing is more a block to dealing \nwith the marriage tax penalty.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I asked the Senator to yield because I very \nmuch agree with what he is saying and want to emphasize a couple \npoints.\n  There is a Democrat alternative. I indicated even yesterday we would \nbe glad to take up debate and vote on it. I note even the Washington \nPost yesterday said the problem, for instance, with the Democratic bill \nis it is backloaded and would actually cost more over a 10-year period \nand more of it would affect the upper end, the more wealthy people. \nThat is the alternative that was offered in the Finance Committee.\n  I believe our bill is much more in line with what the average working \nAmerican--a young couple and older couple, for that matter--would like \nto have. I appreciate the Senator's remarks.\n  I want to say something else for the record. A complaint was made a \nfew weeks ago by the Democratic leader about the cost of this bill and \nwhom it will affect. I will, once again, read briefly what this bill \nwill do.\n  It will provide a $2,500 increase to the beginning and ending income \nlevel for the EIC phaseout for married filing jointly; in other words, \na $2,500 increase for the earned-income tax credit joint or married \ncouples. That is the low-end, entry-level couples who need help. There \nis a specific provision that will cost, over a 10-year period, about \n$14 billion.\n\n  It also provides the standard deduction set at two times single for \nmarried filing jointly, and it doubles the brackets for the 15-percent \nand 28-percent. Then it provides for permanent extension of the \nalternative minimum tax treatment of refundable and nonrefundable \npersonal credits.\n  What is it in these provisions to which the Democrats object? It is \naimed at low-end married couples. It is aimed at correcting a problem \nthat was never intended, where people in the middle income are paying \nhigher taxes because of the alternative minimum tax, and it is aimed at \nthe lowest and the middle brackets. It makes good sense.\n  Once again, what the Democrats are suggesting is a diversion. They \nwant to get into agricultural policy. They want to get into Medicaid \nreform. They want to get into anything to distract from the issue at \nhand.\n  We are perfectly willing to go ahead with relevant amendments on the \nmarriage tax penalty. In the end, the question is: Are you for \neliminating the marriage tax penalty or not? If you are, this is the \nopportunity. We will have a chance to see tomorrow who is really for it \nand against it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership \non this issue. It is an issue he has been talking about ever since he \narrived in the Senate. Now we have a chance to get it done. We should \nnot get off on side trails on issues that will complicate or maybe even \ndefeat our entire effort. I thank the Senator. Keep up the good work.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership and willingness to schedule this time. I am interested in \ndealing with this issue because we have been pressing it for years. We \nhave been talking about it. Some have talked about it in campaigns.\n  Why do we want to tie in 10 other topics? We should not. I hope the \nDemocratic leader and our side can get together and agree on a set of \nalternatives that are relevant. Let's have a series of votes up or down \nso we can deal with this marriage tax penalty relief bill. It is time \nto do that. We have the wherewithal to do it. I hope we will deal with \nthis now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I actually want to proceed to morning \nbusiness to introduce a bill, but having listened to the majority \nleader and having listened to Senator Daschle, I want to briefly \nrespond to what I have heard on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is the Senate, and I thank Senator Daschle for representing me \nas a Senator from Minnesota so I can represent the people in Minnesota.\n  This proposal the Republicans have brought to the floor can easily be \ndebated tomorrow. Senator Daschle made a proposal where there would be \nother amendments. They would be limited to an hour equally divided and \nup-or-down votes. It is a matter of whether or not my colleagues, the \nmajority leader, and others, want to vote and want to be accountable \nfor votes.\n  As it turns out, in the Senate, we come to the floor and we try to \nrepresent the people in our States. We will have an opportunity to \nfocus on the Republicans' proposal. The problem with their proposal is \nit blows the budget, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that go \ninto their proposal disproportionately go to people at the top. It is \nmoney that can be invested in other areas.\n  There are a number of Senators with amendments. Our amendments say \nsome of that money, as my colleague from Montana mentioned, should be \ninvested in kids and education; some of that money should be invested \nin making sure prescription drugs are affordable for senior citizens \nand others.\n  In my particular case, the proposal I talked about--and I have worked \nwith Senator Dorgan, Senator Snowe, and others on it--essentially says \nthat when it comes to FDA-approved drugs in our country, there should \nbe a way for our pharmacists and wholesalers to import those drugs back \nfrom other countries at half the cost and pass that savings on to \nconsumers. That is called free trade. As a matter of fact, then people \nhave less to deduct and there is less of a penalty.\n  My point is, with all due respect--and I am just speaking for \nmyself--for too long the majority leader has come out here and has \nbasically said: I am not going to let other Senators come out here with \namendments that deal with issues that are important to the lives of \npeople they represent; I am going to insist on only the amendments I \nsay you can do, and if you are not willing to do that, I will file \ncloture and that is it.\n  That is not the way I remember the Senate operating for most of the \nyears that I have been here. The thing that I have always loved about \nthe Senate, the thing that I think has led to some really great \nSenators, is the ability for Senators to offer amendments, to speak out \nfor the people they represent, to have up-or-down votes, and we would \ngo at it.\n  If it takes us a week, it takes us a week. If we start early in the \nmorning, and we go late in the night, that is the\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nway we do it. We are legislators. We are out here advocating and \nspeaking and fighting for people we represent.\n  I thank Senator Daschle from South Dakota for essentially saying \nthere is no way we are going to let the majority leader basically \ndictate to us what issues we should care about, what amendments we get \nto offer.\n  We have a different view about good tax policy. We have a different \nview about how to get the benefits to families. We also have a \ndifferent view about other priorities that we ought to be dealing with \non the floor of the Senate as well.\n  I will tell you, coming from a State where 65 percent of the elderly \npeople have no prescription drug coverage whatsoever, I would like to \nsee the Senate get serious on that issue. I would like to have an up-\nor-down vote. I would like to thank the minority leader for protecting \nmy rights.\n  Finally, I ask the Chair, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 58 seconds.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2414 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to speak as \nin morning business for a period not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know there is a great deal of \ndiscussion going on about the marriage penalty tax. I wanted to stay \nout of the politics of it, if I could, and just speak about the merits \nof the proposals for a few moments.\n  Essentially, what we have are three proposals: the Finance Committee \nproposal of $248 billion, over 10 years; the Moynihan proposal, which \nis the Democratic proposal, of $150 billion over 10 years; and then I \nbelieve a proposal that is really worthy of very serious consideration \nby this body, and one which I would support, which is a proposal by \nSenator Evan Bayh of Indiana for $90 billion over 10 years.\n  I believe this proposal is the most sensible and most fiscally \nresponsible way to go about addressing the issue. More than 21 million \ncouples suffer from the marriage tax penalty. In my State, there are \nclose to 3 million of them.\n  I think providing marriage tax penalty relief is a measure of common \nsense and a measure of decency. The Tax Code not only can be used for \nrevenue producing, but it is also used to encourage behavior that one \nbelieves one should encourage. Certainly getting married is a behavior \nthat one wishes to encourage.\n  Who generally believes that the marriage tax penalty is unfair? They \nare young couples. They are getting married. Both of them work. They \nfind out, for the first time, they actually pay more taxes if they get \nmarried than they do if they remain single.\n  These people are generally under the $100,000 earning limit. I have \nnever heard anyone at the top brackets say they find the marriage tax \npenalty to be unfair. But I have heard considerable testimony from \nyoung couples getting married, young professionals: My goodness, we \nhave to pay this penalty. Why is it? How is it fair?\n  Senator Bayh's proposal strikes right at that heart, and it does so \nin a way that you can say and I can say--every one of us in this body \ncan say--we eliminate the marriage tax penalty for those earning under \n$120,000 all across this land within 4 years. I think it is simple. I \nthink it is direct. It is cost effective. And it gets the job done. I \nthink it makes a great deal of sense.\n  The targeted Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act provides significant \nrelief by creating a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, calculated by the \ntaxpayer, using a simple worksheet, which offsets and eliminates the \nmarriage penalty for families making under $120,000. The credit is \nphased out at $140,000.\n  The bill would also broaden the availability of the earned-income tax \ncredit for low-income working families.\n  Under this legislation, half of all taxpayers with marriage penalties \nwill have their penalties eliminated the first year. By 2004, it \ncompletely eliminates the penalty on earned income for all couples \nmaking under $120,000. That is approximately 17.5 million couples.\n  If you look at the fact that the impact of the majority proposal by \nthe Finance Committee eliminates most of the marriage tax penalty on \n21.6 million couples who currently face penalties by year 10, and \nprovides a bonus--this does not provide a bonus; the phaseout in that \nbill is over 10 years--the phase in the Bayh bill is over 4 years. In \nthe Moynihan bill, 21.6 million couples who currently incur a marriage \ntax penalty would find relief by year 10.\n  The beauty of this bill is that all of the marriage tax penalty is \neliminated for 17.5 million people by year 4. And less than 10 percent \nof all households earn more than $120,000 a year. So, effectively, it \ncovers not only 17.5 million people, but it covers over 90 percent of \nthe population who would be affected. It does it at a cost that is much \nlower than the other two bills--$90 billion.\n  What I like about it is it gives us the opportunity to actually see \ntax reduction happen, to actually say that within 4 years the marriage \npenalty tax is completely eliminated for working families earning under \n$120,000 a year. We do it for a modest amount of $90 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  The other bills deal with all kinds of different so-called hidden \npenalties, but those are not the real things that I think impact the \npeople's drive to eliminate the marriage penalty. It is what happens \nwhen you get married. It is the increase in the tax when you get \nmarried. This is entirely eliminated within a 4-year period of time. I \nsupport Senator Bayh's proposal, and I will be pleased, when he offers \nit, to be a cosponsor of it. I hope it will have very serious debate \nand discussion before this body.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from California for \nher statement.\n  This will come out later when we debate this more. I think it is \nimportant to note that the proposal advocated by my good friend from \nCalifornia has a certain deficiency, which is that it does not at all \naddress the marriage tax penalty caused by unearned income. The \nproposal advocated by my friend from California deals only with the \nmarriage tax penalty caused by earned income; that is, by wages and \nsalaries. There are a lot of senior citizens in our country, as we \nknow. Most of their income is unearned income. It is pension benefits, \nSocial Security income. It is not wages or salary. As a consequence, \nthere is about a $60 billion tax penalty over 10 years for senior \ncitizens that is not addressed in the proposal offered by or mentioned \nby and advocated by the Senator from California but which is covered by \nthe proposal offered by the Senator from New York, the Democratic \nproposal.\n  I will address another situation. There are lots of aspects of the \nmarriage tax penalty provision. Again, there is nothing in the code \nthat imposes a penalty on marriage. It is just that because of our \ncombination of progressive rates, a desire to achieve neutrality \nbetween married taxpayers and individual taxpayers with the same \nincome, a desire to achieve equality between married couples with the \nsame income but with different distribution in earnings, we end up with \nthis problem. There is no total fix. It is just a matter of trying to \nfigure out what makes the most sense.\n  This chart deals with only one aspect of the so-called marriage tax \npenalty. That is the example of the marriage tax penalty in the earned-\nincome tax credit, the EITC, a provision in the law which is to help \nlow-income people who otherwise face a significant tax burden, let \nalone all the other difficulties they are facing in life with low \nincome. This chart shows first a single mother with two children. Let's \nsay her income is $12,000 a year, which is very common. She, today, \nwould receive an earned-income tax credit benefit of $3,888.\n\n  Let's take a single father with no children. Let's say his income is \nthe same; it is $12,000. Obviously, he receives a zero earned-income \ntax credit. Let's say the single mom with two children marries the \nindividual with no children. Now they are married with two children. \nTheir total income will\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nbe $24,000, hers $12,000 and his $12,000. But because of the marriage \ntax penalty, because of the way the Tax Code works, and in particular \nthe EITC provisions which are very complex, as a consequence of the man \nand the woman getting married, their now joint earned-income tax credit \nwill no longer be the $3,888, which the woman alone with her two \nchildren would receive. Rather, now that they are married, the combined \nEITC benefit would be lower, in the neighborhood of $1,506, a clear \npenalty for getting married. It is something we want to fix.\n  It has been stated several times that the proposal, the Finance \nCommittee proposal helps low-income people by addressing the marriage \ntax penalty under the EITC. It does, but not very much. The maximum \namount of relief that can be received under the Finance Committee bill \nin addressing a potential $2,382 penalty is $500. That is the maximum \namount of benefit under the marriage tax penalty that is addressed in \nthe Finance Committee bill.\n  Contrast that with the Democratic alternative. Under the Democratic \nalternative, there would be total relief; that is, a single mom with \ntwo children and a single father with no children, when they get \nmarried, would receive no penalty. Why is that? Because of the \nsimplicity of the Democratic alternative. The simplicity is, if you are \nmarried, you just choose. You file jointly or you file separately. You \nchoose the one which results in lower tax. As a consequence, all of the \n65 provisions in the Tax Code which sometimes cause a marriage penalty \nare addressed. They are all solved.\n  The minority bill solves completely the marriage tax penalty problems \nfacing some Americans. Contrast that with the Finance Committee bill, \nwhich does not solve completely the marriage tax penalty problems \nfacing some married taxpayers because the Finance Committee bill deals \nwith only three of the inequities, not all 65.\n  This is just one of the inequities the Finance Committee bill does \nnot address very much. There is kind of a little tack-on provision \nwhich addresses it. But as a consequence, the Democratic alternative \ncompletely solves the EITC problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, we did spend some time \ntoday debating the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. This is \nsomething I have been working on for all the years I have been in \nCongress in the Senate. I look forward to the day we can repeal it. I \nwas hoping we would have this vote in the near future. I very much \nregret the delay that was imposed upon us by the minority because by \nputting nongermane amendments on this, we slow down what we could \naccomplish here in the very near future, which is finally to eliminate \nthe marriage tax penalty.\n  I have an amendment prepared to implement elimination of the marriage \ntax penalty a lot sooner. I am contemplating offering that. I will see \nhow much support there is for it. Before I do that, however, instead of \nthe proposed phase-in period of 6 years, which is the underlying \nproposal, my amendment would eliminate the marriage penalty tax \nimmediately, bringing working parents tax relief right away.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, as this graph shows, \nthe additional savings my plan would bring married couples over the \nRoth plan would be almost $3,000. If you look at the years, we go from \n$69 versus $879 in 2002, all the way over to 2008, where it evens out. \nThe point is, these are savings for a married couple--about $810 in the \nfirst year, 2002--if we put it into effect immediately.\n  With today's cost of living exploding, education, tuition, high \nprices at the pump, that is a substantial savings for an ordinary \nworking family. I think we ought to make this effective today, as soon \nas it passes, and not implement it over a 6- or 7-year period. Married \ncouples have been waiting for a large number of years, since this \nridiculous provision was put in the IRS Code.\n  It is not often we have the opportunity to right a wrong around this \nplace, but this is an opportunity. I sincerely hope we take advantage \nof it.\n  Today, however, not only do we have the opportunity to turn back a \ntax, we also have an opportunity to turn back an unjust tax that \npunishes an institution that is the very backbone of society, at least \nin most of our minds.\n  You hear some people say that it isn't. But marriage is the backbone \nof our society, the essence of our families. One of the reasons why we \nare having a lot of cultural problems today is a lack of emphasis on \nthe family and marriage. Twenty-five million couples are subject to the \nmarriage tax penalty in America and, frankly, those of us who have not \nhad the courage to overturn that tax over the past several years \ndeserve some of the blame because it punishes married people. In New \nHampshire alone, almost 140,000 couples will be hit with a marriage tax \npenalty. In a small State such as New Hampshire, which only has a \nlittle over a million people, this tax is antimarriage, antifamily, and \nantichild. Children reared in two-parent homes are more likely to \nsucceed in school, stay away from drugs, and not become involved in \ncrime. We should not penalize married couples. It doesn't make sense.\n  A way for couples to avoid the marriage tax penalty is they could \nfile for divorce and save money or they could not get married and save \nmoney and just live together. That kind of tax policy doesn't make \nsense. The average marriage penalty is $1,400, or more, in additional \nFederal income taxes, which is more than $100 a month. That is an extra \n$1,400 that could be used to buy school clothes for kids, pay for a \nhome computer, perhaps, or a little health insurance, or maybe take a \nfamily vacation. The point is, you would have control over an \nadditional $1,400 to do with what you want, and not have the Government \ntaking your money whenever it wants.\n  I have received a lot of mail on this issue over the years asking for \nrelief--I might say, begging for relief, for the Congress to do \nsomething. Just one example. A gentleman by the name of Roy Riegle from \nDerry, NH, wrote this:\n\n       I am a software engineer working in Merrimack and living in \n     Derry. Via the Web, I just learned of the House Passage of \n     the ``Marriage Tax Cut'' bill. (I think it is H.R. 6). I want \n     to heartily encourage you to vote for this bill when it \n     reaches the Senate. We are one of the classic middle class \n     families (I'm an engineer and my wife teaches in Chester) who \n     are trying to pay for our kid's college education. Our cost \n     to send our second daughter to Trinity College in Hartford, \n     Connecticut, next year is expected to be $20,000. We need \n     assistance of some sort, and this will help. Thank you for \n     your consideration.\n                                                     Roy Riegle.  \n\n  That is so true of many families trying to meet expenses and pay \neducation costs. For all these millionaires and billionaires you read \nabout and hear about all over the country making all this money, maybe \n$100 a month isn't important. But it is real important to people such \nas the Riegles and so many others who have written me on this issue \nover the years.\n  Since 1970, the number of dual-income couples has risen dramatically \nand continues to rise. It is these families who will benefit from the \nrepeal of this tax. What an outrageous tax this is, to discriminate \nagainst people who are married. It is just un-American, and how it ever \ngot in the code is beyond me. Why it hasn't gotten out in all these \nyears is beyond me.\n  I think we should understand that the reason why, as we stand here \nnow, we have not been able to pass this on the floor of the Senate \ntoday is because of delays, because the other side wants to offer \nnongermane amendments to slow it down, to say we have to pick and \nchoose which family gets a break. You have to be in a certain income \ntax bracket, or you have to be a certain type of person to get a break, \nand all this nonsense. Everybody should get the break. The marriage tax \npenalty itself is unfair. It is not more or less fair for one family or \nanother, depending on the income. It is an unfair tax. Let's get rid of \nit, period. There is nothing complicated about that. This year, \nAmericans will give 39 percent of their income to the Federal \nGovernment. As tax levels rise, women who might otherwise stay at home \nare forced to enter the job market. The percentage of single-worker \nhouseholds in the U.S. has plunged to 28.2 percent, compared with 51 \npercent in 1969. However, the harder parents work to keep pace, the \ngreater their chances of moving into a higher tax bracket and winding \nup giving more to the Government.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, these families are right. These taxes \ndo penalize. If we are going to penalize the\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\nsacred institution of marriage and offend our sense of decency and \nmorality, if that is what is going on in the Tax Code, we need to \ncorrect it.\n  We should be encouraging the makeup of the family, not the breakup of \nthe family. We should bring tax relief to married couples today--not \ntomorrow, not next year, not 6 years down the road, but today. They \nhave waited all these years with this discriminatory tax. We can never \nmake it up to them, so let's start today and make it effective today. \nWe can bring tax relief to these couples by passing my amendment and, \nif not mine, at least we should get started with the underlying bill. \nIt is better to do it down the road, over the course of 6 years, than \nnot at all. With my amendment, we can do it immediately and save all of \nthis money each year for each of these families.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2604-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2604-S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ELIAN GONZALEZ\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to talk on a \nsubject that has been in the news a lot. I will take a few minutes of \nthe Senate's time. I have been involved in a lot of issues. I have \ndebated just about everything known to mankind on the floor of the \nSenate, as have most of us. I am in my tenth year in the Senate, and I \nhave never been involved in an issue that has gotten to my heart more \nthan the Elian Gonzalez case--never. Last night, on the Geraldo Rivera \nshow, a poll was shown saying 61 percent of the American people said \nElian Gonzalez should go back to his father, and 28 percent of them \nsaid he should stay here in America.\n  Here is this little boy who floated in the ocean on an innertube \nafter his mother died trying to bring him to America. So we are now \ngoing to conduct policy about what to do about Elian by reading polls. \nWhere is the leadership in this country when we need it? This is not \nabout polls. I don't care what the polls are. I could care less what \nthe polls are. If Lincoln had taken a poll on slavery, we would \nprobably still have slavery because the majority of the people in \nAmerica at that time supported slavery. But he didn't take a poll or \nput his finger to the wind. He did what was right.\n  Again, I plead with my colleagues in the Senate to grant Elian \nGonzalez and his family permanent residency status so this issue can be \nhandled by a Florida custody court. This should not be an immigration \nmatter. Elian Gonzalez did not get on a yacht and cruise into Miami \nHarbor. He and two other people almost drowned while everybody else on \nthe boat--10 or 12 other people --lost their lives. And his mother's \ndying wish was to ``please get my son to American soil.''\n  I have heard a lot about the father's rights. I have nothing against \nhim. He could be the nicest guy in the world. I have met Elian. I \ndidn't get a chance to meet Elian's mother because she didn't make it. \nIf she had made it, we would not be here talking about this because, \nunder the law, she and Elian would be allowed to stay here. So because \nshe died, Elian has no rights.\n  Those of you listening to me now who think this is a father-son \nissue, I want you to listen carefully to what I have to say because it \nis not a father-son issue. That is a totally bogus argument. There are \nreports in Miami that Elian is reluctant to travel to Washington to see \nhis father. He is a frightened little boy. Wouldn't you be after you \nsurvived that? Has anybody listening to me now ever gone through an \nexperience like that--floating on an innertube on the high seas for 3 \ndays, after you watched your mother die, and everybody else on the boat \nis gone except two others he didn't know were alive because they were \ndrifting off somewhere else. And then to be sitting in a home in Miami, \nwith people who love him, who have taken care of him, and to wonder if \ntoday, right now, tonight, tomorrow morning--he doesn't know when--\nmaybe noon tomorrow, in comes the large, sweeping hand of the Justice \nDepartment and Janet Reno, and they yank him from the arms of these \npeople who love him and drag him back to Cuba. That is what he is \nsitting through now and worrying about now. He is a frightened little \nboy. When are we going to be concerned about this frightened little \nboy?\n  I am tired of hearing about everyone else's rights in this debate. I \nam sick of it. I am sick of the fact that I can't get a vote on the \nfloor of this Senate because the people do not have the guts to vote. \nThey do not want to be recorded. I am sick of it because this little \nboy is going to be dragged back to Cuba, and he is going to be used as \na pawn in Castro's--God knows what--forsaken land over there. And we \nhave to live with it. We ought to be recorded, and we ought to be on \nrecord. We ought to stand up and be counted. I am sick of it. I have \nbeen quiet too long. I am not going to be quiet anymore.\n  He is fearful of returning to that country. I talked to him. He said: \nSenator Smith, please help me. Don't send me back to Cuba. I said: \nElian, do you love your father? Do you want to go back with your \nfather? He says: Yes. I want to be with my father. I don't want to go \nback to Cuba.\n  Mr. Gonzalez, if you are listening to me, why don't you defect? It is \na heck of a lot better here.\n  I am going to tell you that there is one shining example of why it is \nnot about father and son. It is not about father and son. I am sick of \nit. Listen to me--one shining example of the human rights violation of \nFidel Castro.\n  Where are all the human rights people who care about this? Where is \nthe Catholic Church that sheltered all of these Communists during the \nNicaraguan and El Salvador issue? Where are they? Silent.\n  Let me tell you about Fidel Castro and what little boys such as Elian \nlook forward to, and what Elian will have to look forward to when he is \ndragged back to Cuba--for his father. Give me a break, Ms. Reno.\n  On July 13, 1994, 72 Cuban men, women, and children boarded the 13 de \nMarzo, a tugboat, trying to sail for freedom to the United States, just \nlike Elian did. Less than 3 hours later--3 hours later--32 of them \nwould be forced to return to Cuba--they were the lucky ones--while the \nother 40, 23 children among them, were left by the Cuban authorities, \ntheir bodies scattered at sea.\n  At 3 o'clock in the morning, 22 men and 30 women boarded a recently \nrenovated World War II tugboat in the Bay of Havana. With them were \nover two dozen children, one an infant, and several others between 5 \nand 10 years old.\n  I am going to show you some pictures of the children who boarded that \nboat who never returned. I want to show you pictures of children who \ndied such as these children right here:\n  Caridad Leyva Tacoronte, dead, 4 years old;\n  Angel Rene Abreu Ruiz, dead, 3 years old;\n  Yousel Eugenio Perez Tacoronte, dead, 11 years old.\n  Let me tell you how they died with this dictator who tells you that \nhe wants to welcome this little boy back to Cuba so he can be with his \nfather. If Castro had caught him, he would be dead. All of them would \nhave been. He would have killed them. But he didn't catch them. They \ndrowned.\n  Now Elian has to be told that he has to go back. His father said the \nother day, ``Four months I have been waiting for my son.''\n  Where have you been, Mr. Gonzalez? Nobody is stopping you from coming \nhere, except Castro. We don't have any policy that says you can't come \nhere.\n  Let me tell you what happened to these kids. This little tugboat was \ndetected, and it was approached by the Cuban coast guard. The \ngovernment boat did not attempt to stop the 13 de Marzo, the boat. It \ndidn't try to stop it. Instead, it stalked it for 45 minutes along the \ncoast of Cuba, 7 miles out at sea--stalked it, intimidating it.\n  The U.S. Coast Guard protects life. The Cuban coast guard \nexterminates life.\n  It was then that the government vessel, beyond the sight of any \nwitnesses on land, rammed this defenseless boat. This is 1994. This \nisn't 1959. This is 1994, 6 years ago. Defenseless people were in a \nlittle tugboat which was rammed by the Cuban coast guard.\n  According to the testimony of several of the survivors, two Cuban \ngovernment firefighting boats appeared and began to pummel the \npassengers with high pressure firehoses.\n  You can imagine how horrible that was.\n  Although the passengers repeatedly attempted to surrender to the \ngovernment officials--even women holding their children up on deck, \nsaying,\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\nplease, my children; it is my child; don't kill my child. They were \nbegging for their lives, but they were relentless, this wonderful \nCastro who is so concerned about getting this little boy back to his \nfather in Cuba.\n  The force from the firehoses you can imagine. One survivor, Mayda \nTacoronte Vega, told her sister that she witnessed children sprayed \nfrom the arms of their mothers into the ocean waters. Other children \nwere swept over the deck by the firehoses into the sea and drowned. \nDesperate to protect their own children, the women carried the \nremaining children down into the boat's hold.\n  Gerado Perez Vasconcelos, whose ex-wife and son perished that day, \ntold of how the firehoses were filling the hold with water. The boat \nsank, and she didn't see anybody coming out of the hold.\n\n  With most of its weaker passengers already drowned inside the hold, \nor in the sea, the tugboat filled with water, cracked in two, and was \nrammed again just to be sure, and it sank.\n  Over the course of a few minutes that day, Maria Victoria Garcia lost \nher husband, her 10-year-old boy, her brother, three uncles, and two \ncousins. For what? For trying to get out of Cuba, this place that we \nare going to send Elian back to, maybe tomorrow.\n  Her poignant testimony revealed what happened to her and her son once \nthey were in the water. ``We struggled to stay above water by clinging \nto a floating body.''\n  I wonder what Fidel would have done if Fidel had found Elian floating \nin the tube rather than these two fishermen.\n  ``We struggled to stay above the water by clinging to a floating \nbody,'' this woman said. ``I held onto this body because I just didn't \nhave the strength to go on. But people fell on me, and my son slipped \nfrom my grasp,'' just as Elian's mother slipped from his grasp.\n  The young boy could fight the huge waves created by the Government \nvessels, and his mother was forced to watch helplessly as her baby \ndrowned only 5 feet away.\n  Angel Ruiz, 3 years old, Fidel Castro, that wonderful, little child-\nloving dictator over there, took care of her.\n  There is Yousel, he is 11.\n  Nineteen-year-old Janette Hernandez Gutierrez also courageously \nattempted to save the life of a child just before the boat was fully \nsubmerged. ``We went to look for the other child. Just as I was about \nto get off the boat, I felt the child * * * had caught my foot. And \nwhen I was about to grab him, my shoe slipped off and down he went. I \ncouldn't reach him. That was horrible * * *.''\n  Hernandez went on to describe the scene of the massacre: ``There was \na child who was inflated like a toad, inflated with so much water.''\n  The merciless attack left 23 children and 17 adults dead in the \nFlorida Straits.\n  You say: Oh, well. That was just a bunch of Castro's goons who got a \nlittle excited; no big deal. This is not about that. Elian's father \nloves him. He should go back.\n  Here is what Castro says about Elian, in case you want to know:\n  ``The team is ready,'' Castro said, referring to when Elian comes \nback, ``to proceed without losing 1 minute with the rehabilitation and \nreadaptation of Elian to his family.''\n  Yes. Absolutely. You talk about psychological trauma. You don't know \nwhat psychological trauma is until you deal with what this little boy \nhas to deal. Not one person in the Justice Department has asked Elian \none question about what he wants.\n  I have been there. I have talked to him.\n  The 32 survivors--maybe they were lucky. Maybe they weren't. They \nwere taken to a prison where they have to endure life separated from \ntheir surviving relatives.\n\n  Not only did the agents refuse to search for the dead, they mocked \nthe survivors and the relatives of the deceased and laughed at those \nwho asked the state security to reclaim the bodies, said Geraldo Perez \nin a tearful press conference.\n  The officials said the drowned were nothing other than \ncounterrevolutionary dogs. Will we send this ``counterrevolutionary \ndog'' back to Castro? Is Elian a counterrevolutionary dog? Elian had a \ntaste of freedom. What if he resists the lack of human rights in Cuba? \nWill we hear about it? I don't think so. We will not hear about it, but \nElian will hear about it. What do you think his father will be able to \ndo about it?\n  I ask some of my critics on the 61 percent, pick up a book about \nFidel Castro's Cuba and look up the word ``pioneers.'' Let me tell you \nabout the Pioneers. Elian was a Pioneer before he escaped. What do \nPioneers do? They have a little indoctrination school. Here is one of \nthe little drills they do for the children at the age of 3: Hold your \nhands out--put on a blindfold. Hold your hands out, ask God for some \ncandy, and wait. No candy comes. Close your hands, put them down. Put \nyour hands back up again, ask Fidel Castro for some candy, and watch it \npour into your hands.\n  That is what Elian has to look forward to. It is called \nbrainwashing--nothing complicated about it.\n  The Union of Communist Pioneers is a compulsory political \norganization for children and adolescents created by the government for \nyoungsters in kindergarten to 12th grade. It functions as the first \nstep toward joining the Union of Communist Youth. Approximately 98 \npercent of the children in elementary school are enrolled. It is not \npresided over by a child or adolescent, as one would expect, but by a \nhigh-ranking adult member of the Union of Communist Youth.\n  Don't give me this stuff about him going back to his father. He is \nnot going back to his father.\n  What about his mother? Why does she not have rights, too? She had \ncustody. She was taking care of him. The dirty little secret which Mr. \nGonzalez will not talk about, because he can't, because of the long arm \nof Castro--where is he? He is in Bethesda, in a Cuban diplomat's house. \nHe has a lot of free time to talk there. He can speak freely there, \ncan't he? Reno has the nerve to say: We talked out there, we talked \nalone, and he didn't say anything about defecting.\n  Come on, give me a break. Attorney General Reno, you could have \nstopped it 4 months ago, and you can still stop it today. Let it go to \na custody court. Get out of it. It is not an immigration matter. He \ndidn't immigrate here in the way we define immigration. Let it go to \nthe custody court in Florida, and let them decide, if they need to. Let \nthe family sit down alone without Fidel Castro, without any government \nofficials, and let them talk about it. If they can't work it as a \nhusband and wife can't work out custody of their children, go to court, \nand let the court make the determination based on all of the facts.\n  There is a dirty little secret about Mr. Gonzalez. Yes, there is. Did \nhe know Elian was coming? Sure, he knew. He knew they were leaving. He \nwas called when the child was picked up and went to the hospital. The \ndoctors wanted to know whether he had medical problems or history they \nneeded to know about, so they called him in Cuba while the family was \nthere. He said: Take care of my son; I will be there soon.\n\n  We are not hearing about that, are we? We will not hear about that \nbecause we don't want to do anything to make Fidel Castro angry at the \nUnited States. After all, Bill Clinton wants a legacy of breaking down \nthe barriers between Cuba and the United States. That is what this is \nabout. Let's get real. God knows, he needs something to save his \nlegacy, so we will take it out on Elian Gonzalez. After all, he is an \nexpendable little kid. We don't care about him. That is just one kid. \nLet him go back to his father.\n  If your son was lost at sea for 3 days and everybody on the boat \ndrowned and somebody found him, I don't care who it was--it could be a \nconvicted murderer who found him, who cares--if he found him and \nbrought him home, wouldn't you ``thank him?'' Wouldn't you say ``thank \nyou''? Wouldn't you thank those who took care of him, if you loved your \nson?\n  Let me state what happened. There was no thank you. When he got off \nthe plane, he said: They were a bunch of kidnappers. I want my kid \nback. They kidnapped my kid.\n  Kidnapped my kid? I am not passing judgment on this guy. He could be \nthe greatest father in the world for all I know, but he will not get a \nchance to be a father because the Cubans have already said this boy is \nthe property of Cuba, not Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez will do what he is \ntold.\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\n  I want your kid.\n  OK; when do you want him? Where do I take him? Where do I drop him \noff?\n  As recently as April 2, Fidel Castro called the Miami relatives of \nElian Gonzalez, Elian's unpunished kidnappers. Do you think little \nElian will go back and tell his classmates and his father and those \npeople in Cuba that these people were kidnappers who took care of him, \nwho saved his life, the fishermen and the family who took care of him? \nI don't think so. What will happen? We can't afford to have little \nElian running around saying bad things about Cuba or good things about \nAmerica. No. Elian will pay the price.\n  We don't have the guts to stand on the floor of the Senate as a \nSenate, all 100 Members, take a vote and say he should go back to Cuba \nor the case should go to court.\n  Some say we might lose. Yes, we might. I think the vote count is \nprobably 45--maybe. So what? We could take a walk on a number of issues \nbefore this body such as whether or not we should go to war in the \nPersian Gulf. We could have taken a walk on that and let the President \ngo ahead and do it, but we took a vote. It was a tough vote. We take a \nlot of tough votes around here, and a lot of people die as a result of \nvotes, especially when we vote to go to war.\n  The headline in ``Granma,'' the Communist Party newspaper, after the \nincident was: ``Tugboat Stolen by Antisocial Elements Loses Stability \nand Sinks.''\n  On August 5, 1994, Fidel Castro declared that the roots of the \naccident were manifested in the conduct of the United States; it was \nthe United States' fault that these kids drowned.\n  Dr. Marta Milina, a Cuban psychiatrist who escaped Cuba in August of \n1999, stated: If Elian Gonzalez is returned to Cuba, he would have \nsevere psychological trauma.\n  Is that in the best interest of Elian? Is it about Elian? Or is it \nabout his father? The answer is, a custody court would know that \nbecause a custody court, if the family could not agree, would listen to \nthe facts. They would make that determination. But they have never \nspoken, and the Justice Department has never spoken to Elian.\n  This is one smart little boy. Meet him. And I am sorry the Attorney \nGeneral does not believe it is important enough to meet him, but I will \nnever forget him. He carried around a little statue of the Virgin Mary \nin the home where we were. I said: Who is that? He said: Virgin Mary. \nHe said: I saw her while I was on the raft.\n  Another story that is not recorded, and the fishermen will tell you, \nwhen they found him, he was floating in that little tube, asleep. You \ncan substantiate this by talking to the family if you don't believe me. \nHe was in the ocean for 3 days in the bright sunshine, didn't have a \nsunburn, and he was surrounded by dolphins, and dolphins will ward off \nsharks.\n  This little boy is a very special little boy in more ways than one. \nThe fact that we allow him to go back to Cuba under the auspices of \nuniting a father and a son is the most outrageous decision this country \nwill ever make. Frankly, I do not want that blood on my hands. I know \nthat is tough talk, and I mean every word of it. I don't want it on my \nhands. I have seen too much of it.\n\n  I am not going to read all the names, but they will be printed in the \nRecord. The children in that incident, 4 years old, 11 years old, 11 \nyears old, 6 months old fire-hosed out of the arms of her mother, 2 \nyears old, 3 years old, 10 years old, 4 years old, 3 years old, 11 \nyears old, 2 years old--that is the age of the children.\n  Let me close on a couple of points. Edmund Burke once said:\n\n       All that is required for evil to succeed is for good men \n     [and women] to do nothing.\n\n  Today we can do something. We can grant Elian Gonzalez and his family \npermanent residency status, which will send this case to the family \ncourt where Mr. Gonzalez can make his case without any Castro \ninfluence. We should have done it the day Elian got back, but we did \nnot. We decided to make this a big political issue between the \nadministration and Castro. So Castro starts whining, and suddenly this \nadministration thinks the case has to be in INS's jurisdiction. We \ncould not kowtow to a Communist dictator. What does Castro care about \nthe interests of this little boy? I told you what he thinks of this \nlittle boy.\n  There are no parental rights in Cuba. The children are taken away \ninto these training camps. They are taught all kinds of drills. They \nare taught how to take an AK-47 apart, blindfolded, at the age of 6.\n  Luis Fernandez, a Cuban diplomat, said as recently as yesterday:\n\n       The boy [Elian] is a possession of the Cuban government.\n\n  Cuban children, my colleagues, do not belong to their parents, they \nbelong to Fidel Castro.\n  Article 39 of the Cuban constitution--it would be nice if some of the \n61 percent of the people who say this had the facts. It would be nice \nif the pollster gave them the facts before they answered the question. \nArticle 39 of the Cuban constitution, adopted in 1976 and revised in \n1992, declares:\n\n       . . . the education of children and young people in the \n     spirit of communism is the duty of all society.\n\n  Law No. 16 of the ``Children and Youth Code,'' adopted in 1978, says \nthe state's goal is the creation of ``Communism's new generation'' and \nrequires all adults to help mold a child's ``Communist personality.'' \nIf the parents do not bring up the children to be good Communists, then \nthe neighborhood spy will report them to the authorities and they will \nbe taken away and ``reeducated.''\n  Talk to some of the Vietnamese who escaped Vietnam and ask them what \na reeducation camp is. If anybody thinks little Elian Gonzalez will not \nbe put under a severe and thorough Communist indoctrination when he \ngoes back, then they are blind. He is going to suffer. He is going to \npay--big time. For what? Surviving a near drowning, surviving a wreck \non the open sea. That is why he is being punished, because his mother \ndid not live.\n  She has rights, too, but we don't know about them. But somebody could \nrepresent her in a custody court and put her rights on the record. But \nnot Janet Reno.\n  Let me give a little idea of what he is going to do some summer when \nhe gets back. He is going to be in a ``voluntary\" labor or military \ndrill camp. He will learn there is no religion but communism. He was \nput in a church a few days after he arrived. He had never been in a \nchurch before in his life. He didn't know what the inside of a church \nwas.\n  He will learn that Fidel is God. He will learn the Communist Party is \nof more value than his father or anybody else in his family. He will be \ntold his Miami relatives who cared for him and loved him, including his \nsurrogate mother, Marielysis, are nothing more than traitors and worms \nand kidnappers. That is the language they use.\n  Marielysis Gonzalez, 21 years old, has been hospitalized off and on \nfor the past 2 weeks because this little boy clings to her every day. \nHe will not leave her alone. Every time somebody knocks on the door, \nevery time somebody comes in the yard, every time the phone rings, he \nwonders if somebody is going to take him away. And he asks her: \nMarielysis, are they going to take me today?\n  How would you like to live like that? That is what Janet Reno has put \nthis boy through for 4 months, and I am sick of it. I am not going to \ndefend it. She has put him through it. It is her responsibility and the \nPresident's. These people have been vilified, these good people, these \ndecent people in the Cuban-American community in Miami--good, decent \npeople who have shown a lot of self-restraint, frankly, under the \ncircumstances, but especially Lazaro and Marielysis and other members \nof that family who have taken such good care of this boy. All they care \nabout is the best interests of the boy.\n  It is funny, I did not hear some of those people saying anything \nabout the rule of law--these same people today who are saying, the rule \nof law says he must go back with his father. It is funny, though, those \nsame people when their President, the Chief Executive of our country, \nwas impeached for repeatedly breaking our law, not one of them had the \ncourage to step out and say: He broke the law; he lied to me.\n  It just depends on whose law it is, doesn't it, and whose law you \nbreak. That is what matters.\n  I believe in the rule of law, but can you understand why they do not \nwant\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nto send Elian back to a totalitarian state? I have talked to the family \nabout this. They love Juan Gonzalez. He is a family member. There is no \ndifficulty between these family members. The reason Mr. Gonzalez did \nnot come here is that he could not come here. The reason Mr. Gonzalez \ncan't defect is that he is afraid to defect because he knows what is \ngoing to happen to some of his family who are still back in Cuba. We \nare playing the game. We are just giving them all the cover.\n  ``I spoke to Mr. Gonzalez, and he didn't indicate to me he wanted to \ndefect.''\n  Do you remember learning about the Fugitive Slave Law of the 1840s \nand 1850s? It made northerners return escaped slaves back to their \nmasters. Would anyone begrudge abolitionists who opposed that law?\n  Picture this: A little black child in 1840, Anywhere, U.S.A., in the \nSouth, picked up by his mother. His father says, ``No, get away, I'll \ncover for you.'' She takes the Underground Railroad and makes it to the \nNorth and is caught. She dies. Same logic--send him back to the father. \nSend him back to slavery.\n  This kid is going back to slavery. He is not going back to his \nfather; he is going back to slavery. So all of you out there, all 61 \npercent, including many of my colleagues, when you watch him paraded \naround the streets of Havana as they teach him to become a pretty good \nlittle Communist, think about it. Think about how you might have stood \nup and prevented it.\n  In 1939, the U.S.S. St. Louis arrived from Germany with 937 refugees \naboard. Do you know who they were? Jews fleeing from Hitler. The ship \nwas denied entry because the law did not allow it. The refugees went \nback to Europe and Hitler and to their deaths. Was it right to uphold \nthe law in that case?\n  The fact is, no law governs this case. Janet Reno is not telling you \nthe truth. She has total discretion. There is no law that is dictating \nto her that she has to send this boy back. No law. Show it to me. \nSomebody come to the floor and read to me the law that says the \nAttorney General must return this boy. There is no such law. There is \nnothing in the law that says it. There is no age restriction. There is \nnothing. What it says is that she has discretion. So her discretion is \nto send him back, but do not tell me it is the law because it is not.\n  She made the wrong decision. With this simple bill, on which I have \nbeen trying to get a vote for a month, Senators can be on record as \nsaying it is wrong to make this an immigration case. He has rights. He \nis only a 6-year-old boy, but he has rights. His mother had rights. \nLet's let the family sit down and talk about it without the Justice \nDepartment. Let them meet alone. If they cannot work it out, they can \ngo to the Florida custody court and decide what is in the best interest \nof Elian. That is the way it should be.\n  Will evil succeed, as Mr. Burke said? That could be Elian. That could \nhave been Elian and might still be Elian. My conscience is clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2607-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2607-S2608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS TAXES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted on a cloture \nmotion to end debate on Senator Lott's proposal to roll back the \ngasoline excise tax. Senator Lott's bill is a sincere effort to address \nthe hardships many Americans have been facing given the rising price of \ngasoline at the pump.\n  I commend the majority leader for this legislation. But, I do want to \nclarify my vote on the cloture motion.\n  I voted for cloture because I believe the majority leader, of all \npeople, deserved an up-or-down vote on the proposal. I also believed \nthat, if we were going to vote to cut or maintain the current gasoline \ntax, we ought not to confuse the American people about where we stood \nby deciding this issue on a procedural vote.\n  Unfortunately, because cloture was not invoked, and there may not be \na vote up-or-down on the proposal itself, it seems that Utahns are \nindeed confused about where I stand on this issue. As it frequently \nhappens, the vote on the procedural motion becomes a proxy for how a \nsenator would have voted on the bill. However, that assumption does not \nhold true for me in the case of this gas tax proposal. I would have \nreluctantly voted against it.\n  While I respect Senator Lott for his effort at providing relief for \ntruckers, farmers, landscapers, salesmen, and everyone else who depends \non his or her vehicle, I have an equal concern for the quality of the \nhighways they drive on.\n  It is unclear to me that the loss of revenue that would have resulted \nfrom passing this legislation could have been immediately made up from \nother programs, thus necessary highway construction and repair projects \nin Utah and around the nation could have been delayed.\n  Moreover, I believe that there are other measures we can find should \ntake to address the issue of high gas prices. In the long-term, we \nshould encourage development of alternative fuels vehicles. Toward this \nend, Senator Jeffords and I will be introducing legislation later this \nmonth that will provide strong tax incentives for the development and \npurchase of such vehicles, along with the alternative fuel they use.\n  I also believe that there are other tax relief initiatives that will \nhave greater positive impact for American families, and I will continue \nto press hard for these proposals.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday, I spoke on S. 2285. I now \nask unanimous consent that an ARCO letter concerning gas prices be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         ARCO,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your phone call on \n     Friday, March 31, regarding gasoline prices in California. \n     During that conversation, you inquired regarding the status \n     of ARCO's gasoline inventory. I have outlined below some \n     statistics that were not available to me when we talked.\n       Currently, ARCO's inventory of CARB gasoline is at our \n     operating target. Total industry gasoline inventories on the \n     West Coast appear to be recovering. The last weekly West \n     Coast gasoline inventory report showed an increase of 1.5 \n     million barrels over the previous week, which was the low \n     point of the year.\n       With respect to the issue of gasoline prices, no one can \n     predict the future. However, crude oil prices have been \n     coming down over the last few weeks as a result of the recent \n     OPEC meeting. Spot prices also appear to have peaked. Barring \n     some unforeseen circumstances, we can assume that retail \n     gasoline prices will follow suit.\n       I hope you find this information helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Mike Bowlin,\n\n                                                      Chairman and\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, American consumers are feeling the impact \nof high oil prices. Obviously, the increase is noticeable at the gas \npump, but it also is being felt in less visible ways through increases \nin the cost of goods and services as airline prices and shipping costs \nescalate. I have stated, in no uncertain terms, that I consider \nresponsibility for the current situation largely to lie at the feet of \nthe Clinton-Gore Administration. Thanks to nearly eight years of their \nshort-sighted policies, we are increasingly dependent on foreign oil. \nTo make matters worse, not only does the Clinton-Gore Administration \nnot have any clear plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, they \nactually appear to be moving in the opposite direction, seeming at \nevery turn making it more difficult to develop domestic energy sources, \nwhether it be gasoline, petroleum products, coal, oil, or hydropower.\n  As it is largely through the bungling efforts of the current \nAdministration that we are in this situation, I believe it is \nappropriate that the U.S. Senate counterbalance their efforts with some \nmodest relief. A suspension of the 4.3-cent federal fuel excise tax, \nimposed in the early days of the Clinton Gore administration, should \nprovide the short term relief consumers deserve.\n  As Congress addresses these issues, however, we must seek a solution \nthat not only attacks this problem from the perspective of energy \nsupply, but also energy use. A key aspect of any debate on this subject \nmust focus on motor vehicle fuel consumption. The United States \ncurrently uses about 17 million barrels of oil per day to run cars and \ntrucks. Thanks to the existence of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or \nCAFE, standards, three million barrels of oil are conserved each day. \nDespite the clear success of CAFE standards,\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nhowever, Congress has prevented the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA) from even considering whether we can do better, \nparticularly in relation to the fuel efficiency standards of lights \ntrucks, which haven't been significantly increased in ten years.\n  Many constituents and colleagues are often surprised to learn of my \nadvocacy for CAFE standards. My motivation is simple, and is based on \nthe success of the original CAFE statute. I feel that NHTSA should at \nleast be allowed to study whether an additional increasing CAFE \nstandards is an appropriate action. As you may know, light truck \nstandards have not had a significant increase in the last ten years. \nLight trucks are regulated separately from cars and are only required \nto get 20.7 mpg on fleet average as opposed to 27.5 for cars. In 1983, \nthe average fuel economy of light trucks was already 20.7 mpg. Since \n1983 it has dropped .3 mpg to 20.4. This is hardly a technological \nbreakthrough.\n  I am not swayed by doomsday predictions from automakers who claim \nthey will be forced to manufacture fleets of subcompact cars. These are \nthe same arguments that were used during the original debate in 1974. \nOne only needs to examine the possible options available to consumers \ntoday to disprove this theory. When consumers can purchase SUVs as \nlarge as the Chevy Suburban or Ford Excursion, it is hard to argue that \nconsumer choice has been compromised. I have complete faith in American \nautomobile manufacturers that they can continue to produce fuel \nefficient vehicles that are the envy of the world.\n  Therefore, it was with great interest that I listened to Energy \nSecretary Bill Richardson testify before the Interior Subcommittee this \nmorning on the Clinton Administration's multi-faceted plan to address \nhigh gasoline prices. This testimony focused on a lengthy discussion of \nthe results of last month's diplomatic efforts. When pressed on the \nAdministration's plan to decrease this country's dependence on foreign \noil sources, Secretary Richardson went on to tout his proposals to \nimprove alternative fuel options and fuel efficiency. He suggested tax \nincentives and credits for U.S. oil producers, fuel efficient vehicle \nproduction, and alternative fuel development. Unfortunately, there was \nno mention of CAFE standards.\n  In response to this omission, I had to ask why this Administration \nhas failed to actively support new fuel efficiency standards. When I \npressed Secretary Richardson to commit to making CAFE standards a \ncenterpiece of the Clinton-Gore Administration's effort to address the \ncurrent fuel shortage and long-term foreign oil dependency of this \ncountry, he ducked the question and told me he wished the EPA \nAdministrator was available to answer.\n  I am perplexed by this response. Obviously, U.S. auto manufacturers \nhave demonstrated they are more than up to the challenge of producing \nmore fuel efficient light trucks and SUVs. In fact, Ford Motor Company \njust announced plans to start selling within three years a hybrid gas-\nand-electric-powered SUV that gets about 40 miles per gallon.\n  Therefore, I fail to understand why the Clinton-Gore Administration \ncan't make simply studying a possible increase in CAFE standards a top \npriority in this debate. I challenge the White House to embrace this \ncommon sense approach, which is certainly preferable to the groveling \ndiplomacy it engaged in just weeks ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2608-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2608-S2609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADOPTION OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Adoption \nOpportunities Act which would amend the current adoption tax credit so \nit does what it was originally intended to do, and that is to help all \nkinds of families in their efforts to adopt all kinds of wonderful \nchildren.\n  I would like to begin my remarks this morning by introducing you and \nmy colleagues to someone very special. This beautiful little girl's \nname is Serina Anglin. Serina was born, as you can see here, \nprematurely and severely addicted to drugs. Her mother was a 15-year-\nold girl who herself had been abandoned in a crack house by her drug-\naddicted mother.\n  At birth, doctors were all but certain Serena would not survive. When \nshe was just a few months old, a neurologist described her in the \nfollowing way:\n\n       In summary, Serina is a severely manifold handicapped child \n     whose significant defects are in social, adaptive, affective, \n     and cognitive development.\n       Serina has cerebral palsy as well as other multiple \n     problems including crack cocaine prenatal addiction, history \n     of herpes and encephalitis, and seizure disorders including \n     epilepsy.  . . . Her ability to walk is very uncertain. I \n     think she will fall into the moderate to severe range of \n     retardation.\n\n  However, through the grace of God, Serina came into the home of a \nwonderful couple, Hal and Patty Anglin, of Wisconsin, who are now her \nadoptive parents. I want to show you a current picture of Serina. \nThrough their love and determination, Serina has not only survived but \nher progress has simply amazed medical experts.\n  Today, Serina is a remarkable child. She still has some small \nseizures, but her larger seizures are all but gone. She not only can \nwalk, she recently learned to ride a bike. Each day she is becoming \nmore and more active. She is true and living proof that the love of a \nfamily, growing up in a nurturing environment, can make what was deemed \nimpossible possible.\n  This is not to say this miracle came easily. In the beginning, \nSerina's care required that she go to the doctor over 16 times a month. \nFor the first year of her life, her adoptive mother, Patty, carried her \nin a tummy sack to simulate the safety and warmth she had been deprived \nin the womb. She had to be taught how to breathe and swallow. She has \nhad several surgeries on her leg which was damaged as a result of \nprenatal drug exposure.\n  I tell this story today because I cannot think of a better way to \nshow my colleagues why the current tax credit needs to be changed. \nSerina was born to a mother who was a ward of the State. So upon her \nbirth, she was immediately placed in foster care, as I explained. As \nsuch, when the Anglins, who were her foster care parents, went through \nthe formal adoption process, the process of adoption cost them almost \nnothing.\n  Therefore, under our current definition of qualified adoption \nexpenses, they were not eligible to receive one single dime of the \n$5,000 tax credit that is supposedly available under current law. Had \nSerina, this beautiful little girl, been a healthy infant voluntarily \ngiven up and adopted privately or through one of our many able \nagencies, the Anglins would have been eligible to claim the $5,000 tax \ncredit. I am sure my colleagues will agree this was not our intention \nwhen we passed the adoption tax credit.\n\n  In the case of children in foster care with special needs, what gives \nmany parents pause is that everyday care of these children can be both \nphysically and financially draining. I cannot tell you how many foster \nparents tell me the only thing standing in the way of their formally \nadopting foster care children is the worry that their personal \nresources will be inadequate to properly care for them. Through a \nproperly drafted and funded adoption tax credit, we can be the partners \nwith these prospective parents whose hearts are ready to take on this \nresponsibility.\n  It is a small step in the right direction but a very important step. \nA tax credit for special needs children logically should assist \nparents, such as the Anglins, with the everyday long-term costs of \nraising a child with special needs and should not be limited to the \nexpenses of the ``act of adoption'' itself. The current definition is \nlimited to ``qualified adoption expenses.'' That is too narrow to reach \nchildren such as Serina who need our help the most.\n  The Adoption Opportunities Act, which we introduce today, proposes to \nfix this dilemma. It allows a straightforward $10,000 tax credit for \nfamilies who adopt a child with special needs. The new tax credit for \nspecial needs children will not require the parents to submit \nverification of their expenses, nor will the amount be dependent upon \nthe cost of adoption itself.\n  I know many of us have argued for years about simplifying the Tax \nCode. I am hard pressed to imagine a way that would be more simple than \nthe one Senator Craig and I are proposing, for all a parent has to do \nis simply attach a certificate of adoption for any special needs child \nto their tax return and they will get, under this bill, a $10,000\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\ncredit that can be carried forward for 5 years. It is that simple.\n  Another problem lies in the fact that the current tax credit for \nnonspecial needs children is due to sunset in December of 2001. Hoping \nto ensure the credit was well designed and necessary, the drafters of \nthe original bill agreed to reevaluate it after 5 years. We have done \nthat and have included that in our bill. It permanently extends the \n$5,000 tax credit for adoption and almost doubles the adoption tax \ncredit for special needs.\n  Because of this assistance, many families, who might not otherwise \nhave been financially able to do so, have been able to build a family \nthrough adoption. Last week, in fact, I had the great honor of \nattending a ceremony when 17 children from 14 different countries \nbecame citizens of the United States. All of these children were \nbrought here to be adopted into loving and wonderful homes of Americans \nfrom all parts of our country.\n  At that gathering, one of the mothers who had adopted two children \ncame up to me and said: Senator, please let them know in Congress how \nmuch we appreciate the adoption tax credit. It made all the difference \nto me and my husband as we decided to adopt our second child.\n  So we know that tax credit works. We know it has a positive impact, \nand part of our bill today extends that permanently so families can \ncount on it.\n\n  With the cost of adoption still on the rise, this tax credit is an \nimportant factor, as I have mentioned. It has been estimated that \nadoptions can range anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000, whether done \nprivately or through an agency domestically or internationally.\n  Another figure to keep in mind is one that was released recently by a \nnational adoptive parent organization. They estimate that using \nspecialized foster or adoptive parents instead of what we do now, which \nis congregate care facilities for drug-exposed children, could save--\nand I believe the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, will be interested in \nthis as he continues to fight for ways the Federal Government can save \nour money--they estimate we can save as much as $550 million a year by \nrelying on adoptive parents instead of keeping many of these children \nin the ``system,'' for which the taxpayers pay. Anything we can do to \nencourage adoption will not only be the right thing, the moral thing, \nthe wonderful thing, and the family values thing to do, but it is smart \nfor the taxpayers of the United States.\n  In addition, in case people are interested, there are more than \n100,000 children in this country today waiting to be adopted--children \nwho have had termination with their biological parents. They are \nwaiting for someone to claim them as their own and to be adopted. There \nare 550,000 children in foster care. About 450,000 of those are in the \nprocess of either being returned to their families or they, too, can be \neligible for adoption. Clearly, there is a need to promote adoption in \nthis country that works for the benefit of birth parents, adoptive \nparents, and the children.\n  Finally, for parents to raise a child in their home, the estimates \nfor a middle-class family are about $140,000. That is not including \ncollege tuition or vocational education. That is just an estimate. The \nleast we can do is help in a small way with a $5,000 or $10,000 tax \ncredit to encourage families to be their partner in this adoption \neffort.\n  I believe not only does it simplify the Tax Code, but there is a \ngreat need, and the need has been demonstrated. The results have been \nterrific. We have had testimony after testimony about how important the \ncurrent system has been, so anything we can do to improve it I am sure \nwill be welcomed by so many. It is a step in the right direction.\n  I close by saying, as we debate which tax credits to pursue, which \nare worthy, this adoption tax credit should be on the top of every \nlist. We need to continue to be bold enough to take these steps because \nevery time we do, children such as Serina, for whom people have given \nup hope, have found families on which to rely and with whom to grow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I commend our colleague from Louisiana. Today we have 130 \nmillion people who work outside the home and earn income. We have some \n260 million Americans. About 30 million of them get some form of public \nassistance. You might ask yourself: Who takes care of the other 100 \nmillion Americans? They are taken care of by families. And the driving \nforce is love.\n  So not only is the distinguished Senator from Louisiana talking about \nsaving money, but what adoptive parents will add to the equation is \nlove and care. The whole world benefits from it. So I commend her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I, too, thank the Senator from Louisiana for her \nleadership on this issue. We are fortunate enough to work together on \nthis marvelous issue of adoption, chairing the adoption coalition here \non the Senate side.\n  Both Senator Landrieu and I this week have helped host two delightful \nyoung ladies who are on the hill, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, both \nadopted, both coming from adoptive families. They were in my office \nthis morning speaking about the wonderful families they were allowed to \nbe a part of who have granted them all of this charm and talent that \ncan only come from a loving environment, that has allowed them to \nbecome national leaders, as they now are, as Miss USA and Miss Teen \nUSA.\n  I say thank you to the Senator for her leadership on this issue. It \nis critically important to America and America's families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2609-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2609-S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PROJECT EXILE: THE SAFE STREETS AND NEIGHBORHOODS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of S. 2390, \n``Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act of 2000'', \nwhich establishes a grant program to provide incentives for states to \nenact mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearms offenses. I \ncommend Senator DeWine for his leadership and appreciate the \nopportunity to join with him and other colleagues working together on \nthis important legislation. The time has come to restore our commitment \nto aggressively prosecuting gun crimes around this country. In states \nand cities around the country where aggressive prosecution of gun \ncrimes is coupled with tough prison sentences, violent crime has gone \ndown. Tough law enforcement saves lives.\n  This legislation provides $100 million of additional resources over \nfive years as incentives for efforts like Project Exile. To qualify for \nthe grant program, states must have a mandatory minimum of 5 years \nwithout parole for convictions of violent crimes and serious drug \ntrafficking offenses where a firearm is used during or in relation to \nthe crime. In the alternative, the state can have a federal prosecution \nagreement which would refer those arrested for federal prosecution of \nthe alleged gun crime in a collaborative effort between law \nenforcement.\n  Project Exile started in Richmond, Virginia as an attempt to reduce \nviolent crime by aggressive enforcement of gun laws and improved law \nenforcement coordination. Since the program began in 1997, violent \ncrimes involving handguns have decreased 65 percent and overall crime \nhas been reduced by 35 percent. 385 guns were taken off of the street. \nIn 1999, Project Exile was adopted statewide in Virginia. It has given \nprosecutors the ability to choose within which courts they will try \noffenders and created tougher penalties for people committing crimes \nwith guns.\n  I have also worked to help expand this approach to Philadelphia in \n1999, where ``Operation Cease Fire'' also adopts a zero tolerance \npolicy for federal gun crimes. Project Exile has already proven that \npresent laws can work if enforced properly. Federal, state, and local \nlaw enforcement and prosecutors work side by side to expedite \nprosecution of every federal firearms violation. In 1999, over 200 \nfederal gun-related indictments were issued in Philadelphia and the \nsurrounding counties. This is a 70 percent increase in indictments in \nonly one year.\n  The bill authorizes $10 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2001, $15 million \nin FY02, $20 million in FY03, $25 million in FY04, and $30 million in \nFY05. States must provide at least a 10 percent match and must also at \nleast maintain current funding levels to qualify. Funds can be used for \npublic awareness campaigns, law enforcement agencies,\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\nprosecutors, courts, probation and correctional officers, case \nmanagement, coordination of criminal history records, and the juvenile \njustice system. Representative Bill McCollum introduced similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives as H.R. 4051. This \nlegislation passed the House yesterday by a 358-60 vote margin.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \ninitiative to collaborate with local efforts to prosecute and prevent \nthe criminal use of guns in our schools and neighborhoods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2610-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RAPE AND SEXUAL TORTURE IN SIERRA LEONE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in all too many places and in all too \nmany conflicts in recent years we have witnessed the use of rape and \nsexual torture as instruments of war. I am sad to say, some incidence \nof rape has always accompanied war and turmoil in human history, but \nthe record of the past few years, with the use of organized, systematic \ncampaigns of rape to terrorize civilian populations, suggests a new \nchapter in the barbarity of human history has been opened.\n  It was disturbing to learn there are serious and credible allegations \nthat rebel forces used systematic rape as an instrument of terror in \nthe eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone.\n  While statistics are not yet available, there is clear and credible \nevidence that thousands of girls and women, ranging from ages 5 to 75, \nwere abducted during the civil war and gang raped. Many were used as \nsex slaves and forced labor. And it is possible many are still being \nheld captive, subject to the depravations of their inhuman captors.\n  This horrific story was detailed in an article in yesterday's \nWashington Post. I ask unanimous consent to have the article, entitled \n``A War Against Women'' from the April 11, 2000, Washington Post \nprinted in the Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  The civilized world must send a strong, unambiguous message that rape \nand sexual torture are not acceptable under any circumstances and will \nnot be tolerated. The United States must be at the forefront of efforts \nto help the Government of Sierra Leone bring to justice those \nresponsible for the systematic rape and sexual torture that took place \nduring the civil war.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 11, 2000]\n\n A War Against Women--Sierra Leone Rebels Practiced Systematic Sexual \n                                 Terror\n\n                           (By Douglas Farah)\n\n       Blama Camp, Sierra Leone--The women slip one at a time into \n     a bamboo hut in this displaced persons camp, and most begin \n     to cry quietly as they tell of being gang-raped and held as \n     sex slaves by rebels who had sought to overthrow the \n     government of Sierra Leone.\n       One 25-year-old woman said she had delivered a still-born \n     baby the day before rebels of the Revolutionary United Front \n     attacked her village in 1998.

I had no reason to live anymore.''\n       Human rights workers says the woman, who was rescued by a \n     patrol of government troops, is one of thousands who were \n     raped by insurgent forces and other armed gangs during the \n     nation's eight-year civil war. While statistics are not yet \n     available, rights workers said the rebels' rape campaign was \n     as widespread and systematic as similar assaults in the 1992-\n     1995 Bosnian war but has received far less attention.\n       Unlike at least some of the perpetrators in Bosnia, those \n     responsible here likely will never be tried because of a \n     blanket amnesty that was part of the accord that ended the \n     conflict last July. Even more worrisome, U.N. officials and \n     government officials say, is that the rebels may still hold \n     thousands of women in remote strongholds despite the fact \n     that the peace accord required them to free all captive \n     civilians.\n       ``The [rebels] perpetrated systematic, organized and \n     widespread sexual violence against girls and women,'' the New \n     York-based group Human Rights Watch said in a recent report. \n     ``The rebels planned and launched operations in which they \n     rounded up girls and women, brought them to rebel command \n     centers and then subjected them to individual and gang rape. \n     Young girls under 17, and particularly those deemed to be \n     virgins were specifically targeted. While some were released \n     or managed to escape, hundreds continue to be held in sexual \n     slavery after being `married' to rebel combatants.''\n       Rose Luz, a physician with the International Rescue \n     Committee, said that what is most shocking about the hundreds \n     of rape cases she is documenting is the ages of the victims. \n     Most were under 14 or over 45--many of whom were too slow or \n     too infirm to flee. Luz said the youngest victim documented \n     so far was 5; the oldest was 75.\n       ``It is the ones who could not get away,'' Luz said. ``They \n     raped whomever they stumbled across.''\n       With the consent of the women involved, Rescue Committee \n     officials arranged for a reporter to be present during some \n     interviews. It was agreed that no names would be used or \n     photographs taken. The interviews were conducted at this \n     camp--about 160 miles southeast of the capital, Freetown--\n     which shelters 22,500 people who were driven from their homes \n     in eastern Sierra Leone by insurgent forces.\n       If the rebels considered a woman attractive or physically \n     fit enough to work, she would likely be taken along with \n     them--not just to be a sex slave, but a domestic servant as \n     well, Luz and other aid workers said. Often, they said, a \n     captive woman would try to attach herself to one leader to \n     avoid repeated gang rape. In a culture in which rape victims \n     are often ostracized, such wholesale assaults were effective \n     not only in spreading terror, but in breaking apart \n     communities, social workers said.\n       The first victims began telling their stories to the Rescue \n     Committee when the aid group started reproductive health \n     classes here several months ago, said counselor Dolly \n     Williams. Last month, in an effort to refer the women for \n     urgently needed medical attention and help them cope with \n     their shame and humiliation, the Rescue Committee began \n     documenting their stories. As word of the program spread, \n     hundreds of women have come forward, waiting their turn \n     patiently while Williams and Luz record the accounts of other \n     victims.\n       ``Child and women abductees and victims of gender violence \n     are far too numerous, and we do not yet even have a clear \n     picture as to how many there really are,'' said U.S. \n     Ambassador Joseph H. Melrose Jr., who is trying to arrange \n     for U.S. funds to help the victims. ``What is clear is that \n     these victims and their injuries, both physical and \n     psychological, must not be ignored. If these injuries do not \n     heal, they will have implications for future generations of \n     Sierra Leoneans and the success of the peace process.''\n       Williams said the rate of sexually transmitted diseases \n     such as syphilis and gonorrhea among the women is extremely \n     high, a reflection of the 92 percent infection rate found \n     among demobilized rebels. Neither the combatants nor the \n     women are tested for AIDS or HIV infection because the cost \n     is too great and there are no resources to treat anyone who \n     tests positive.\n       The first woman to arrive at the palm-thatched interview \n     room one day last week was a 60-year-old who came to tell how \n     she was grabbed in her village by a group of raiders because \n     she was unable to outrun them. When they could not find any \n     other women, she said, they raped her.\n       ``I begged them not to,'' she said. I told them I was old. \n     I could be their grandmother,'' but they did not listen; they \n     just laughed at me. Afterward they let me go because I was \n     old and useless. Now I have pain when I urinate. I have \n     sores; I can't sleep.''\n       A 35-year-old woman said she had been abducted and raped by \n     four rebels in 1997. When they had finished, she said, they \n     took her to their commander, who decided to keep her. She \n     finally escaped three years later, during a firefight between \n     the rebel unit and government troops.\n       ``I can't have a man again,'' she told the interviewer. ``I \n     have lost my life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2610-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2610-S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CASH BALANCE PENSION PLANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join Senators Jeffords, Harkin and \nRockefeller in calling on the Senate to strengthen our Nation's pension \nlaws. This amendment reaffirms the value of defined benefit pension \nplans for workers, and our commitment to protecting workers from age \ndiscrimination in the provision of pension benefits.\n  Too many American workers have discovered that the pension promises \nmade to them by their employers are virtually worthless. It is \ndisturbing in this period of unprecedented economic prosperity and \nrising profits that major corporations are shortchanging their older \nand longer serving workers. These companies have changed the rules \nunfairly, by converting traditional defined benefit pension plans to \nso-called ``cash balance'' plans.\n  Companies have made these conversions quietly, without informing \nworkers of the impact of the changes on their retirement security. When \nworkers ask for an explanation, all too often they are given devious \nresponses. Some employers have done the right thing and allowed older \nand longer service workers to remain covered under the original plan, \nbut other employers have not.\n  In addition, many cash balance plans deny benefits to older workers \nfor a period of time after the conversion, using\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\na discriminatory practice known as ``wear away.'' This practice \nprevents older and longer service workers from earning new benefits \nunder the cash-balance plan until that benefit exceeds the original \npromised benefit. We must end the practice of wear away immediately.\n  Our amendment calls on Congress to enact legislation this year \nrequiring, at a minimum, that employers provide workers with adequate \nnotice of a change in their pension plan that reduces future benefits. \nIt also prohibits the discriminatory practice of wear away. Our \namendment makes clear that Congress will take whatever action is \nnecessary to assure older workers that they will not be short-changed \nwhen it comes to their retirement security. It is long past time for \nCongress to act and protect our older and longer service workers. We \nvalue older workers in America--we don't ``wear them away.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2611-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2390 \nwhich Senator DeWine introduced yesterday. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this legislation. I know that, unlike additional \ninfringements on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, \nthis bill will effectively reduce gun violence and save lives.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am extremely concerned about gun \nviolence. In my home state of Arkansas, there are several cities which \nhave long been plagued by extraordinarily high levels of violence and \nmurder, largely fueled by illegal guns, gangs, and drug trafficking. \nAccording to the 1998 Uniform Crime Reports, Little Rock, with a \npopulation of 176,377, North Little Rock with a population of 60,619, \nand Pine Bluff, with a population of 54,062, had 25, 8, and 17 murders \nrespectively. The rate of murder per 100,000 inhabitants in North \nLittle Rock-Little Rock was 10.3 and it was 33.8 in Pine Bluff and \nsignificantly exceeded the national rate of 6.3 murders per 100,000 \ninhabitants. Nonetheless, I have received literally thousands of \nletters from Arkansas asking me not to support additional gun control \nmeasures, but rather to simply enforce the laws already in effect.\n  My constituents are right. We do not need more gun laws. We just need \nto enforce those already on the books. The facts show that the Clinton \nAdministration has not done this; from 1992 to 1998 prosecutions of \ndefendants who use a firearm in connection with a felony have decreased \nnearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800. In addition, \nwhile more than 500,000 convicted felons and other prohibited \npurchasers have been prevented from purchasing firearms from federally, \nlicensed firearms dealers under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevent Act, \nonly 200 of these persons have been referred to the United States \nDepartment of Justice for prosecution. I have carefully studied the \nProject Exile program in Richmond, Virginia and am convinced that it \nsaves lives. Before Project Exile was implemented, Richmond was one of \nthe nation's murder capitals, and Project Exile resulted in a 40 \npercent reduction in the number of murders committed with firearms. \nThat is why for the past several months, I have been working to \nimplement Arkansas Exile. By supporting S. 2390, I hope to obtain the \nadditional funding necessary to allow Arkansas and other states to \nimplement a program proven to reduce gun violence.\n  Finally, I support S. 2390 because it is the right approach. The \nPresident and many of my Senate colleagues condemn firearms, which are \ninanimate objects, and the gun industry while ignoring and working to \noverturn the well-established legal principle and a third-party's \ncriminal act is an unforeseeable event for which a merchant may not be \nheld liable. I am saddened and alarmed that the President and cities \nthroughout the nation are using the vast resources for their \ngovernments to force the gun industry to take responsibility for the \nacts of criminals, and I am determined to do all I can do that the \ncriminals, not the gun industry and law-abiding Americans, are held \nresponsible for gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2611-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENT OF 13 IRANIAN JEWS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nthirteen Iranian Jews wrongfully imprisoned and facing trial in Iran. I \njoin with concerned people of all faiths around the nation, and the \nworld, in calling for the observation of fundamental human rights and \nthe ultimate goal of freedom for these innocent people.\n  Iran has recently taken some positive steps away from political and \nreligious repression toward the acceptance of freedom, justice, and \ndemocracy. Reforms, however, have been marred by a disheartening lack \nof concern for the human rights of religious minorities in Iran. \nThroughout my life, I have been committed to furthering fundamental \nhuman rights, especially religious freedom, for both Americans and \npeople throughout the world. Therefore, I was deeply concerned by the \nFebruary 1999 arrest of thirteen Iranian Jews informally accused of \nspying for Israel and the United States. Today, ten of the thirteen are \nstill in jail awaiting trial, while the other three have been released \non bail. This situation is especially troubling because these innocent \ncommunity and religious leaders could face the death penalty if \nconvicted.\n  Mr. President, this entire legal ordeal has been filled with Iranian \nConstitutional violations and shrouded in secrecy. For instance, the \nthirteen have never been formally charged or indicted. This should be \nthe first step in any legal proceeding, but it now appears almost \ncertain the defendants will not know the charges they face until the \ntrial begins. As a former Attorney General of Missouri, I fully \nappreciate what a daunting, if not impossible, task it would be to \nbuild a credible defense without knowing the charges.\n  Additionally, although it appears the Iranian government might have \nrecently reversed its previous position and agreed to allow the \nthirteen to choose their own legal counsel, the judge in the case has \nrefused access to the defendants by their chosen attorneys. Beyond the \nseriously limiting results of this decision, the chosen attorneys \ncannot officially become the defendant's counsel until the necessary \nlegal documents are signed, which will not occur until the attorneys \nand defendants meet. The courts have created one of the worst ``Catch-\n22s'' I have seen.\n  It also troubles me that the trial will be conducted in secrecy. \nAfter repeated requests by international observers and the press, the \ndecision to keep the trial secret has been affirmed by the courts. For \nthese obvious reasons, I believe it likely that the thirteen will not \nreceive a fair and impartial trial.\n  The members of the Jewish Iranian community, who out of respect and \nfear of the Islamic majority rarely speak out in public, have even made \nan uncharacteristic plea to the Iranian government. I join with this \ncommunity in asking for all defendants in Iran, regardless of religion \nor standing, to have access to legal counsel of their own choosing, and \nto be afforded the requirements of Iranian law for fair and open \ntrials. In addition, I urge the Iranian government to grant permission \nfor the ten jailed Iranian Jewish defendants to go home on furlough for \nPassover, which begins on the evening of April 19th, if the proceedings \nhave not yet been completed.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the basic principles of \nhuman rights and religious freedom. The Iranian government must do the \nright thing and provide these defendants their fundamental rights, and \nthe International Community must use all available pressure and \ndiplomatic avenues to influence them to do so. And the United States \nGovernment should demonstrate real leadership by diligently working to \nsee the ultimate release of these thirteen Jewish Iranian defendants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2611-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2611-S2612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The \nCenter has since grown into a $2.3 million agency with 100 paid and \nvolunteer staff.\n  In working to fulfill its vision statement of putting more people in \ncharge of their lives, connecting to others and contributing to their \ncommunities, the Counseling Center of Milwaukee provides both \nindividual and family services including education, counseling, \nproviding emergency shelter and mentoring.\n  The Counseling Center serves a variety of clients, most of whom are \nlow income and most from the city of Milwaukee. The Counseling Center \nhas always been a place where clients could turn when they had nowhere \nelse to go. Through public and private funding, the Counseling Center \nprovides service to anyone in need, regardless of their ability to pay. \nThis includes more than 7,000 citizens in the Greater Milwaukee area \nserved in 1999.\n  I am proud to join in celebrating the 30th anniversary of the \nCounseling Center of Milwaukee.

You could--if you just knew how.\n  Or, you could send them to the library instead.\n  National Library Week is April 9-15, and there's no better place than \nour libraries for bringing the world and the events that shape it--past \nand present--to life. Fortunately, a child doesn't need any special \ngadgets to experience all the library has to offer; they just need a \nlibrary card.\n  As Congress debates important issues like the federal budget and how \nto save Social Security, the library is also an excellent place for \nyoung people to learn more about government and what's happening in \nWashington. And of course, the librarians are always there to help.\n  On the occasion of National Library Week, I urge all Americans to \ncheck out a book--and ``check out'' all the riches their local library \nhas to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2612-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember auto \nracing's Lee Petty, who died last week at the age of 86. A pioneer of \nthe sport, he claimed 55 titles, including the inaugural Daytona 500 in \n1959, before a 1961 collision ended his competitive career. His son \nRichard carried the torch with style, collecting seven Winston Cup \ntrophies and establishing a fan base Lee Petty could have only dreamed \nof back in the late 1940s when he was scorching North Carolina dirt \ntracks. But it doesn't end there. Lee's grandson, Kyle, a good friend \nof mine, continues to find success on the NASCAR circuit and Lee's 17-\nyear-old great-grandson, Adam, recently made his NASCAR debut.\n  The name Petty has become synonymous with racing, and for good \nreason. Lee Petty had the foresight to invest in a sport with little \npedigree but a heaping portion of American guts and glory. He \nunderstood that a driver's personality was often as powerful as the car \nhe drove, and spectators would pay good money to go along for the ride. \nHis empire, Petty Enterprises, bears witness to the clarity of that \nvision, having produced 271 race winners and 10 NASCAR champions.\n  Despite great success, Lee Petty never acted like a superstar. He \nlived with his wife, Elizabeth, in the same modest house where they had \nraised their children. Perhaps humbleness, and a willingness to brave \nthe hot sun for hours to sign autographs, will prove to be Lee Petty's \ngreatest contribution to American sports. An editorial in Charleston, \nSC's daily newspaper, the Post and Courier, concludes: ``In a day where \nmoney seems to be the overriding concern of so many athletes, Lee Petty \nwas a reminder of what is important in the sporting world--and why \nfolks gravitate toward the National Association for Stock Car Auto \nRacing. Lee Petty's grown-up NASCAR has never forgotten that a \nprofessional sport should be family- and fan-oriented.'' The patriarch \nof one of professional sports' most celebrated families, Lee Petty has \nleft a legacy that will linger over American racetracks for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2612-5", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2612-S2613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMMENTS ON VIETNAM\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

A lot of \n     awful experiences in the war would follow that decision but \n     not one day of regret.\n       In Vietnam you joined your unit one soldier at a time, not \n     in groups that trained together back home or from old time \n     group enlistments. My unit was Company C, 1st Battalion, 22nd \n     Infantry, 4th Infantry Division. That night in July 1968 when \n     I joined Charlie Company as an incoming sergeant E-5, I was \n     ordered to take out a night patrol. I was exhausted from days \n     of travel and processing but I didn't sleep a wink all night, \n     and never solidly for the rest of the year I was there.\n       Three days later, on patrol in a cornfield, my radio \n     operator who was walking just behind me was shot through the \n     neck by a sniper. I later lost another radio operator who was \n     shot while clinging perilously to rungs of a hastily \n     departing helicopter. If he had been able to survive his \n     wounds, he would never have survived the fall from the \n     chopper into the trees below. We found his body three days \n     later.\n       Discipline was strongly enforced in our division. No \n     intentional killing of civilians or torture of POWs was \n     tolerated. After several reprimands I had one soldier in my \n     company court-martialed for cutting off the ears of dead \n     North Vietnamese soldiers and mailing them home to his \n     girlfriend.\n       The final tragedy for me was that the man I recommended to \n     succeed me as squad leader in Charlie Company was killed as \n     he walked in the squad leader position in the field the day \n     after I left for home. It is his name I look for first on the \n     wall in Washington when I visit it.\n       There were some light moments, too. I was able to keep a \n     pet monkey in my bunker for several weeks until he learned to \n     pull the pins on hand grenades and kick them off the \n     mountainside to explode below.\n       My war experiences only served to support my initial doubts \n     about our involvement. Once when a convoy of U.S. Army and \n     South Vietnamese Army units that I was traveling with on \n     Highway 1 was ambushed by NVA regulars, we American soldiers \n     jumped off our trucks facing the enemy and returned fire. The \n     South Vietnamese soldiers jumped off the other side of the \n     trucks and ate lunch. Whose war was it?\n       I recall numerous incidents when U.S. Army officers \n     instructed us to count each body part from a NVA soldier as \n     one casualty so as to swell the total body count reported. \n     Similarly, we noted that some known U.S. casualties were \n     listed long after the deaths in Stars and Stripes, the weekly \n     military newspaper. These small deceits, multiplied across \n     the country and if practiced widely, could have contributed \n     to an inaccurate picture of battlefield situations. And it \n     would have been done purposefully.\n       What would I want future generations to know about the \n     nation's experience in Vietnam?\n       First, that governments of men can and do make huge \n     mistakes. In understanding political situations in other \n     cultures, in intelligence gathering and interpretation, and \n     that an overzealous military can and will cover up their \n     miscalculations of enemy strength, exaggerate U.S. military \n     effectiveness and minimize cost projections and outcomes. \n     Once committed, reversals of policy are slow in our system of \n     government and often come too late for too many in harm's \n     way.\n       Second, I would urge future generations to get informed and \n     involved in public affairs as a matter of civic duty and \n     personal interest to guard against poor political leadership \n     that can get the country in deep trouble because of political \n     ideology, showmanship or the pursuit of short-term partisan \n     advantage over the national interest. Not only is eternal \n     vigilance the price of liberty in Jefferson's phrase, but it \n     is also the price of intelligent foreign policy and peace in \n     the world.\n       Third, I would want those who look back at what happened in \n     Vietnam to recall that it was not victories in combat by \n     soldiers and airmen that got us out of there. No, it was not \n     that at all. It was the courage and aggressiveness of people \n     of all ages here at home who protested in the streets that \n     finally turned the political tide in this country against the \n     war. Their courage and tenacity forced a reversal of policy \n     in Washington as time and events revealed military failures \n     and unacceptable losses.\n       Finally, I would not want my children or anyone's children \n     to ever know the details of what war looks like up close. It \n     is very gruesome and terrifying for the safe and the wounded \n     and all those who survive are burdened with the awfulness for \n     their lifetimes. As time passes, the joy and fullness of life \n     can repair the damage and soften its impact for those whose \n     lives lead in healthy directions. For those who returned to \n     dysfunctional families, lack of schooling, joblessness, \n     illness, they are the walking wounded of Vietnam who cannot \n     ever come home.\n       I would want my children to know that I tried to do my duty \n     when my country called even when I disagreed deeply with the \n     policies and conduct of the war in which we were engaged. I \n     would want them to know I felt no regrets or ill feelings \n     toward those who chose not to serve; those decisions of \n     conscience required a certain kind of courage as well as any \n     I saw in the war. Lastly, I would want my children to work \n     for a country that is a more thoughtful, careful and \n     respectful force in a world of divergent cultures, one that \n     expends its resources in war only when our national security \n     interests are genuinely at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2613-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MR.

A bill to amend chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide that any Federal law enforcement officer who is convicted of \na felony shall be terminated from employment; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\nlegislation regarding the removal of law enforcement officers convicted \n                              of felonies\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill on removing \nfederal law enforcement officers convicted of felonies.\n  Under my bill, any federal law enforcement officer, who is convicted \nof a felony, would have to be removed from his or her position \nimmediately.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues must be wondering why the Senator from \nIowa is offering this legislation. Law enforcement officers convicted \nof felonies are removed immediately. That's just common sense. Right?\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, common sense does not always prevail in \nthe federal bureaucracy.\n  Common sense is in short supply at one very important place in the \nPentagon--the office of the Inspector General or DOD IG.\n  In October 1999, the Majority Staff on my Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts issued a report on the DOD IG.\n  I placed the Majority Staff Report in the Record on November 2, 1999.\n  The Majority Staff Report substantiated allegations of misconduct by \nsenior officials at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service--or \nDCIS--between 1993 and 1996.\n  DCIS is the criminal investigative branch in the DOD IG's office.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that Mr. Donald Mancuso was the \nDirector of DCIS between 1988 and 1997. Today, Mr. Mancuso is the \nDeputy DOD IG. He may be a candidate for nomination as the next DOD IG.\n  Some of the allegations examined in the Majority Staff Report \nconcerned one of Mr. Mancuso's top deputies--an agent by the name of \nMr. Larry J. Hollingsworth.\n  The Hollingsworth case is the driving force behind my bill.\n  Mr. Hollingsworth was the Director of Internal Affairs at DCIS from \nApril 1991 until his retirement in September 1996.\n  In July 1995, after a fellow agent recognized Mr. Hollingsworth's \nphoto in a law enforcement crime bulletin, Mr. Hollingsworth was \napprehended. His home was searched, and he confessed to filing a \nfraudulent passport application.\n  Mr. Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in U.S. District Court in \nMarch 1996.\n  The authorities who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes believe \nthat he committed about 12 overt acts of fraud between 1992 and 1994.\n  Mr. President, can you imagine that?\n  While he was hammering rank and file agents for minor administrative \noffenses as head of the Internal Affairs unit, Mr. Hollingsworth was \ndeeply involved in a criminal enterprise of his own.\n  The State Department agents who investigated the case were troubled \nby Mr. Hollingsworth's actions. From past experience, they know \npassport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more serious \ncrime. But that crime was never discovered.\n  While the full extent of Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes remain a mystery, \nthis case has helped to shed a whole lot of light on Deputy IG Mancuso.\n  Mr. Mancuso personally approved a series of administrative actions \nthat kept a convicted felon in an employed status at DCIS for 6 months.\n  Mr. Hollingsworth confessed to passport fraud in July 1995. He was \nconvicted in March 1996 and then confined in jail. All this time--for \n14 months, Mr. Mancuso kept Mr. Hollingsworth in an employed status at \nDCIS until September 19,1996.\n  Mr. President, September 19, 1996 was the magic day. That was Mr. \nHollingsworth's 50th birthday.\n  That was the very first day he was eligible to retire. On that day, \nhe retired with full law enforcement benefits and Mr. Mancuso's \nblessing.\n  Mr. Mancuso's generosity will eventually cost the taxpayers a big \nchunk of money.\n  The Office of Personnel Management--OPM--estimated Mr. \nHollingsworth's annuity will cost the taxpayers at least $750,000.00 \nthrough the year 2008.\n  This is money Mr. Hollingsworth should never collect had Mr. Mancuso \nexercised sound judgment under the law.\n  Mr. Mancuso could have removed Mr. Hollingsworth in March 1996 after \nconviction or maybe even sooner.\n  Instead, Mr. Mancuso chose to personally protect Mr. Hollingsworth \nuntil he reached his 50th birthday and could retire.\n  Mr Mancuso shielded Mr. Hollingsworth from the law for at least 6 \nmonths.\n  Under the law--5 U.S.C. 7513(b), Mr. Mancuso was authorized to remove \nMr. Hollingsworth after conviction--if not sooner.\n  Mr. President, I underscore the words authorized. DCIS was authorized \nbut not required to remove him.\n  Under the law, DCIS was granted discretionary authority to decide \nwhen--or if--to remove him.\n  Mr. President, too much discretionary authority in a place so short \non common sense can lead to mistakes. The Hollingsworth case was a big \nmistake.\n  If my bill had been in effect in 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth would have \nbeen removed within 30 days of conviction.\n  My staff has consulted with OPM on this legislation.\n  OPM offered some constructive comments on how to strengthen it. Those \nideas are now in the bill.\n  OPM was unaware of any other instance where a federal law enforcement \nagency had kept a convicted felon in an employed status for 6 months \nafter conviction.\n  However, OPM could not guarantee that this would never happen again.\n  The intent of my legislation should be crystal clear: To ensure that \npersonnel management decisions--like those taken by Mr. Mancuso in the \nHollingsworth case--are never repeated again.\n  Over the past 10 months, my staff has spoken with many rank and file \nlaw enforcement officers about the special treatment given to Mr. \nHollingsworth.\n  Rank and file agents are universally disgusted by what happened.\n  They feel--as I do--that law enforcement officers, who are convicted \nof felonies--should be removed from their posts immediately.\n  They don't want their badges tarnished by having one of their own, \nwho committed a felony, remain on the job--as Mr. Hollingsworth was \nallowed to do.\n  That undermines morale in the ranks.\n  In closing, I would like to quote from a letter Mr. Mancuso wrote--on \nofficial DOD stationery--to Judge Ellis on April 29, 1996.\n  Judge Ellis was preparing to sentence the convicted felon, Mr. \nHollingsworth.\n  Mr. Mancuso's statements to Judge Ellis were absurd. They were \noutrageous.\n  This letter shows that Mr. Mancuso was totally blind to the \nseriousness of Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes.\n  In the letter, Mr. Mancuso asked the judge to consider extenuating \ncircumstances. He told the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth had taken a \nhalf day's leave to file the fraudulent passport application. Mr. \nMancuso praised the convicted felon for this unselfish act. Can you \nbelieve that?\n  This is what Mr. Mancuso said to Judge Ellis, and I quote: ``Mr. \nHollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' but he ``took \nleave to commit a felony.''\n  In Mr. Mancuso's mind, the use of personal leave to commit a felony \nwas a sign of moral excellence.\n  Mr. Mancuso concluded with this telling remark:\n\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\n\n       To this day, there is no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth \n     has ever done anything improper relating to his duties and \n     responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager.\n\n  Mr. Mancuso's statement to Judge Ellis was misguided for two reasons:\n  First, incredible as it may seem, Mr. Mancuso--a sworn law \nenforcement officer and current Deputy DOD IG--feels that it is OK for \nlaw enforcement officers to commit crimes so long as the agents are off \nduty.\n  Second, Mr. Mancuso's assertion about ``no evidence'' is flat wrong. \nIt's inaccurate.\n  On February 1, 2000, my staff discovered a DCIS file containing \ninformation that refuted Mr. Mancuso's assertions to Judge Ellis about \nno evidence. It shows that in August 1995, both DCIS and the State \nDepartment did, in fact, have evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth had \nengaged in criminal activity at his desk in DCIS headquarters.\n  How could the Pentagon's top criminal investigator be so blind to \nevidence?\n  This file also contains other important revelations about Mr. \nMancuso's misconduct in the Hollingsworth case.\n  It contains documents that indicate Mr. Mancuso was communicating \nwith defense attorneys during the criminal court proceedings against \nMr. Hollingsworth.\n  For example, it contains a FAX transmittal memo addressed personally \nto Mr. Mancuso from the defense attorney. Attached was a motion to \ndismiss charges against Mr. Hollingsworth. But there was no court date \nstamp or attorney signature on the document. And there were handwritten \nnotes on it. This was a rough draft.\n  Mr. President, this really bothers me.\n  Mr. Mancuso--the director of a federal law enforcement agency--was \nfurnished with a rough draft of a motion to dismiss felony charges that \nthe U.S. Attorney was attempting to prosecute.\n  That is unethical conduct.\n  The file contains other damaging documents.\n  They suggest that the current Director of DCIS, Mr. John Keenan, \nreturned 11 confiscated handguns to the convicted felon--Mr. \nHollingsworth--in direct contravention of a federal court judgment and \nstatutory law.\n  DCIS allegedly returned the guns to Mr. Hollingsworth on September \n23, 1997, while he was still on supervised probation. This reckless act \ncould have put a probation officer in harm's way.\n  We also learned that Mr. Hollingsworth was under investigation by the \nIRS in November 1983 for perjury. That very same month--November 1983, \nhe was hired by DCIS to be the agent in charge of the Chicago Field \nOffice.\n  The IRS concluded Mr. Hollingsworth had ``committed perjury during \nrebuttal testimony.'' On December 5, 1983, the IRS referred the matter \nto the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans for prosecution.\n  Mr. President, how could DCIS hire Mr. Hollingsworth under such \nquestionable circumstances?\n  I don't understand it.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Mancuso went to extraordinary lengths to protect a \nconvicted felon.\n  By doing what he did, Mr. Mancuso violated a trust that goes with the \nhigh office he occupies. He violated the trust that goes with the badge \nand gun he carries. In our democracy, when those sacred trusts are \nviolated, our only protection is the law.\n  In this case, the law provides too much discretionary authority. It \nleaves the door wide open to abuse by irresponsible bureaucrats. We \nneed to close that door.\n  My bill will close the loophole that Mr. Mancuso exploited in such a \ncrafty way.\n  Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 2406. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide permanent authority for entry into the United States of certain \nreligious workers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  Mother Teresa Religious Workers Act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Mother Teresa \nReligious Workers Act. This legislation will make permanent provisions \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act that set aside 10,000 visas per \nyear for ``special immigrants.''\n  Up to 5,000 of these visas annually can be used for ministers of a \nreligious denomination. In addition, a related provision of the law \nprovides 5,000 visas per year to individuals working for religious \norganizations in ``a religious vocation or occupation'' or in a \n``professional capacity in a religious vocation or occupation.'' This \nhas allowed nuns, brothers, cantors, lay preachers, religious \ninstructors, religious counselors, missionaries, and other persons to \nwork at their vocations or occupations for religious organizations or \ntheir affiliates.\n  The key component of the law will expire on September 30 of this year \nunless Congress acts.\n  Under the law, a sponsoring organization must be a bona fide \nreligious organization or an affiliate of one, and must be certified or \neligible to be certified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Religious workers must have two years work experience to \nqualify for an immigrant visa.\n  Prior to 1990, churches, synagogues, mosques, and their affiliated \norganizations experienced significant difficulties in trying to gain \nadmission for a much needed minister or other individual necessary to \nprovide religious services to their communities. However, this \nimprovement in the law in 1990 was not made permanent and, as such, has \nrequired reauthorization every two or three years, which has created \nuncertainly among religious organizations.\n  Bishop John Cummins of Oakland has written:\n\n       Religious workers provide a very important pastoral \n     function to the American communities in which they work and \n     live, performing activities in furtherance of a vocation or \n     religious occupation often possessing characteristics unique \n     from those found in the general labor market. Historically, \n     religious workers have staffed hospitals, orphanages, senior \n     care homes and other charitable institutions that provide \n     benefits to society without public funding.\n\n  Bishop Cummins noted that,\n\n       The steady decline in native-born Americans entering \n     religious vocations and occupations, coupled with the \n     dramatically increasing need for charitable services in \n     impoverished communities makes the extension of this special \n     immigrant provision a necessity for numerous religious \n     denominations in the United States.\n\n  The sentiments expressed by Bishop Cummins are widely held. Indeed \nthis program has won universal praise in religious communities across \nthe nation. In the past, our office has received letters from religious \norders and organizations throughout the nation.\n  As a nation founded by people who came to these shores so they and \ntheir children could worship freely, it is only appropriate that our \ncountry welcome those who wish to help our religious organizations \nprovide pastoral and other relief to people around this nation.\n  That is why I have introduced the Mother Teresa Religious Workers \nAct. The bill will eliminate the sunset provisions in current law and \nextend permanently the religious workers provisions of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act. It is clear that religious organizations' ability \nto sponsor individuals who provide service to their local communities \nshould be a permanent fixture of our immigration law, just as it is for \nthose petitioning for close family members and skilled workers. No \nlonger should religious institutions have to worry about whether \nCongress will act in time to renew the religious workers provisions. I \nam pleased Senators Kennedy, DeWine, and Leahy are cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I would like to close by reading a passage from a letter \nsent to me in 1997. It's a letter that at the time helped convince me \nof the need to move toward permanent extension of the religious workers \nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The letter read as \nfollows:\n\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I am writing to ask you to help us in \n     solving a very urgent problem. My Sisters in New York have \n     told me that the law which allows the Sisters to apply for \n     permanent residence in the United States expires on September \n     30, 1997. Please, will you do all that you can to have that \n     law extended so that all Religious will continue to have the \n     opportunity to be permanent residents and serve the people of \n     your great country.\n       It means so much to our poor people to have Sisters who \n     understand them and their culture. It takes a long time for a \n     Sister to understand the people and a culture, so now our \n     Society wants to keep our Sisters in their mission countries \n     on a more long term basis. Please help us and our poor by \n     extending this law.\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n       I am praying for you and the people of Michigan. My Sisters \n     serve the poor in Detroit where we have a soup kitchen and \n     night shelter for women. Let us all thank God for this chance \n     to serve His poor.\n       Signed: Mother Teresa.\n\n  My office received this letter only a few weeks before her death. In \nhonor of her great deeds for humanity I hope that this year we can \nfinally extend the religious workers provisions of the INA permanently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mother Teresa Religious \n     Workers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT AUTHORITY FOR ENTRY INTO UNITED STATES OF \n                   CERTAIN RELIGIOUS WORKERS.\n\n       Section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(C)(ii)) is amended by \n     striking ``before October 1, 2000,'' each place it appears.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2407. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \nrespect to the record of admission for permanent residence in the case \nof certain aliens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      DATE OF REGISTRY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today along with the Senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, to introduce the Date of Registry Act \nof 2000.\n  The Date of Registry Act of 2000, complements similar legislation I \nintroduced last year in an effort to fix a terrible mistake made by the \nCongress in 1996. Tucked into the massive piece of legislation known as \nIIRA IRA, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \nAct of 1996, was an obscure, but lethal, provision which stripped the \nfederal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate legalization claims \nagainst the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Most troubling is \nthe fact that this provision nullified legitimate claims based upon \nsubstantiated evidence that the Immigration and Nationalization Service \nhad bypassed Congressional intent in denying benefits to certain \nundocumented persons who have come to be known as the ``late amnesty'' \nclass of immigrants. Through this limitation, Section 377 of IIRA IRA \nhas caused significant hardships, and denied due process and \nfundamental fairness, for hundreds of thousands of hard working \nimmigrants, including several thousand in my home State of Nevada. \nThese are good, hard-working people who have been in the United States \nand had been paying taxes for more than ten years, who suddenly lost \ntheir jobs and the ability to support their families.\n  In an effort to repeal the limitation on judicial jurisdiction \nimposed by Section 377 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, I introduced S. 1552, the Legal Amnesty \nRestoration Act of 1999. In addition to repealing Section 377, S. 1552 \nwould also change the date of registry for those immigrants seeking \nlegalized, documented status in the United States from January 1, 1972, \nto January 1, 1984. The legislation I am introducing today focuses on \nthis aspect of last year's legislation, and would change the date of \nregistry from January 1, 1972, to January 1, 1986.\n  The date of registry exists as a matter of public policy, with the \nrecognition that immigrants who have remained in the country \ncontinuously for an extended period of time--in some cases, up to \nthirty years--are highly unlikely to leave. Today, we must accept the \nreality that many of the people living in the United States are \nundocumented immigrants who have been here for quite a long time. \nConsequently, many people living in this country do not pay their fair \nshare of taxes because they are unable to work legally. Furthermore, \nthe businesses who employ these undocumented persons also do not pay \ntheir fair share of taxes. These are the facts, and coupled with the \nknowledge that we can't simply solve this problem by wishing that it \nwill go away, is the reality we must face when considering our \nimmigration policies.\n  We last changed the date of registry in 1986, with the passage of the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act, which changed the date to January \n1, 1972. In doing so, the 99th Congress employed the same rationale I \nhave outlined above in support of a registry date change. Furthermore, \nI have mirrored the 99th Congress in another, critical aspect, by \nestablishing an approximate fifteen-year differential between the date \nof enactment and the updated date of registry.\n  Mr. President, I should note one more thing about the Immigration \nReform and Control Act of 1986. That legislation which last changed the \ndate of registry was passed by a Democratic House of Representatives \nand a Republican Senate, and was signed into law by President Reagan. I \nmention these facts to highlight my hope that support for this \nlegislation will be bi-partisan and based upon our desire to ensure \nfundamental fairness as a matter of public policy in this country.\n  Finally, the legislation I am introducing today builds upon the \nfifteen year differential standard established in the 1986 reform \nlegislation by implementing a ``rolling registry'' date which would \nsunset in five years without Congressional reauthorization. In other \nwords, on January 2002, the date of registry would automatically change \nto January 1, 1987, thereby maintaining the fifteen year differential. \nThe date of registry would continue to change on a rolling basis \nthrough January 1, 2006, when the date of registry would be January 1, \n1991. Limiting this annual, automatic change to five years will allow \nthe Congress to examine both the positive and negative effects of a \nrolling date of registry and make an informed decision on \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. President, as I stated when I introduced S. 1552 last year, I \ndon't pretend that this legislation will solve all the problems of our \nimmigration and legalization procedures. However, we have an obligation \nto face our problems, and the reality is that there are many, many \nundocumented immigrants who live in this country who would be much more \nproductive contributors to American society if they were legal \nresidents, workers and taxpayers. We know this to be true, as evidenced \nby the thousands of immigrants in Southern Nevada whose status had yet \nto be adjusted, but were working legally and paying taxes--in some \ninstances for more than ten years--when their employment permits were \nrevoked as a result of the 1996 IIRA IRA legislation. I have met with \nmany of these people on several occasions and I have witnessed, \nfirsthand, their pain and genuine suffering. Good people who have \nworked hard and paid their taxes in order to live the American dream \nonly to see their efforts turn into a nightmare.\n  As I stated when I introduced S. 1552 last year, I don't pretend that \nmy legislation will solve all the problems of immigration and \nlegalization policies. However, we must face these problems head on, \nand that is precisely my intent in introducing this legislation today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2408. A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to the Navajo Code Talkers in recognition of \ntheir contributions to the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  honoring the navajo code talkers act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation, recognizing the heroic contributions of a group of Native \nAmerican soldiers who served in the Pacific theater during the second \nWorld War. This legislation will authorize the President of the United \nStates to award a gold medal, on behalf of the Congress, to each of the \noriginal twenty-nine Navajo Code Talkers, as well as a silver medal to \neach man who later qualified as a Navajo Code Talker (MOS 642). These \nmedals are to express recognition by the United States of America and \nits citizens of the Navajo Code Talkers who distinguished themselves in \nperforming a unique, highly successful communications operation that \ngreatly assisted in saving countless lives and in hastening the end of \nthe war in the Pacific.\n\n  It has taken too long to properly recognize these soldiers, whose \nachievements have been obscured by twin veils\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nof secrecy and time. As they approach the final chapter of their lives, \nit is only fitting that the nation pay them this honor. That's why I am \nintroducing this legislation today--to salute these brave and \ninnovative Native Americans, to acknowledge the great contribution they \nmade to the Nation at a time of war, and to finally give them their \nrightful place in history.\n  With each new successive generation of Americans, blessed as we are \nin this time of relative peace and prosperity, it is easy to forget \nwhat the world was like in the early 1940's. The United States was at \nwar in Europe, and on December 7, 1941, we were faced with a second \nfront as the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl Harbor.\n  One of the intelligence weapons the Japanese possessed was an elite \ngroup of well-trained English speaking soldiers, used to intercept U.S. \ncommunications, then sabotage the message or issue false commands to \nambush American troops. Military code became more and more complex--at \nGuadalcanal, military leaders complained that it took 2\\1/2\\ hours to \nsend and decode a single message.\n  The idea to use Navajo for secure communications came from Philip \nJohnson. Johnson was the son of a missionary, raised on the Navajo \nreservation, and one of the few non-Navajos who spoke their language \nfluently. But he was also a World War I veteran, and knew of the \nmilitary's search for a code that would withstand all attempts to \ndecipher it. Johnson believed Navajo answered the military requirement \nfor an undecipherable code because Navajo is an unwritten language of \nextreme complexity. In early 1942, he met with the Commanding General \nof Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, and his staff to convince them of \nthe value of the Navajo language as code. In one of his tests, he \ndemonstrated that Navajos could encode, transmit, and decode a three-\nline English message in 20 seconds. Twenty-seconds!\n  Convinced, the Marine Corps called upon the Navajo Nation to support \nthe military effort by recruiting and enlisting Navajo men to serve as \nMarine Corps Radio Operators. These Navajo Marines, who became known as \nthe Navajo Code Talkers, used the Navajo language to develop a unique \ncode to communicate military messages in the South Pacific. True to \nPhillip Johnson's prediction, and the enemy's frustration, the code \ndeveloped by these Native Americans proved unbreakable and was used \nthroughout the Pacific theater.\n  Their accomplishment was even more heroic given the cultural context \nin which they were operating:\n  The Navajos were second-class citizens and were discouraged from \nusing their own language; and\n  They were living on reservations, as many still are today, yet they \nvolunteered to serve, protect, and defend the very power that put them \nthere.\n  But the Navajo, a people subjected to alienation in their own \nhomeland, who had been discouraged from speaking their own language, \nstepped forward and developed the most significant and successful \nmilitary code of the time:\n  This Code was so successful that military commanders credited the \nCode in saving the lives of countless American soldiers and the \nsuccessful engagements of the U.S. in the battles of Guadalcanal, \nTarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. At Iwo Jima, Major Howard \nConnor, 5th Marine Division signal officer, declared, ``Were it not for \nthe Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.'' Major \nConnor had six Navajo code talkers working around the clock during the \nfirst 48-hours of the battle. Those six sent and received over 800 \nmessages, all without error;\n  This Code was so successful that some Code Talkers were guarded by \nfellow marines whose role was to kill them in case of imminent capture \nby the enemy; and finally,\n  It was so successful that the Department of Defense kept the Code \nsecret for 23 years after the end of World War II, when it was finally \ndeclassified.\n  And there, Mr. President, is the foundation of the problem.\n  If their achievements had been hailed at the conclusion of the war, \nproper honors would have been bestowed at that time. But the Code \nTalkers were sworn to secrecy, an oath they kept and honored, but at \nthe same time, one that robbed them of the very accolades and place in \nhistory they so rightly deserved. Their ranks include veterans of \nGuadalcanal, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa; they gave their lives at \nNew Britain, Bougainville, Guam, and Peleliu. But, while the bodies of \ntheir fallen comrades came home, simple messages of comfort from those \nstill fighting to relatives back home on the reservations were \nprohibited by the very secrecy of the code's origin. And at the end of \nthe war, these unsung heroes returned to their homes on buses--no \nparades, no fanfare, no special recognition for what they had truly \naccomplished--because while the war was over, their duty--their oath of \nsecrecy--continued. The secrecy surrounding the code was maintained \nuntil it was declassified in 1968--only then did a realization of the \nsacrifice and valor of these brave Native Americans emerge from \nhistory.\n  For the countless lives they helped save, for this contribution that \nhelped speed the Allied victory in the Pacific, I believe they \nsucceeded beyond all expectations.\n  Through the enactment of this bill, the recognition for the Navajo \nCode Talkers will be delayed no longer, and they will finally take \ntheir place in history they so rightly deserve.\n  To this end, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Honoring the Navajo Code \n     Talkers Act''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On December 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl \n     Harbor and war was declared by the Congress the following \n     day.\n       (2) The military code, developed by the United States for \n     transmitting messages, had been deciphered by the Japanese \n     and a search by U.S. Intelligence was made to develop new \n     means to counter the enemy.\n       (3) The United States government called upon the Navajo \n     Nation to support the military effort by recruiting and \n     enlisting twenty-nine (29) Navajo men to serve as Marine \n     Corps Radio Operators; the number of enlistees later \n     increased to over three-hundred and fifty.\n       (4) At the time, the Navajos were second-class citizens, \n     and they were a people who were discouraged from using their \n     own language.\n       (5) The Navajo Marine Corps Radio Operators, who became \n     known as the Navajo Code Talkers, were used to develop a code \n     using their language to communicate military messages in the \n     Pacific.\n       (6) To the enemy's frustration, the code developed by these \n     Native Americans proved to be unbreakable and was used \n     extensively throughout the Pacific theater.\n       (7) The Navajo language, discouraged in the past, was \n     instrumental in developing the most significant and \n     successful military code of the time. At Iwo Jima alone, they \n     passed over 800 error-free messages in a 48-hour period;\n       (a) So successful, that military commanders credited the \n     Code in saving the lives of countless American soldiers and \n     the successful engagements of the U.S. in the battles of \n     Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa;\n       (b) So successful, that some Code Talkers were guarded by \n     fellow marines whose role was to kill them in case of \n     imminent capture by the enemy;\n       (c) So successful, that the code was kept secret for 23 \n     years after the end of World War II.\n       (8) Following the conclusion of World War II, the U.S. \n     Department of Defense maintained the secrecy of the Navajo \n     code until it was declassified in 1968; only then did a \n     realization of the sacrifice and valor of these brave Native \n     Americans emerge from history.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to award to each of the original twenty-nine Navajo Codes \n     Talkers, or a surviving family member, on behalf of the \n     Congress, a gold medal of appropriate design, honoring the \n     Navajo Codes Talkers. The President is further authorized to \n     award to each man who qualified as a Navajo Code Talker (MOS \n     642), or a surviving family member, a silver medal with \n     suitable emblems and devices. These medals are to express \n     recognition by the United States of America and its citizens \n     in honoring the Navajo Code Talkers who distinguished \n     themselves in performing a unique, highly successful \n     communications operation that greatly assisted in saving \n     countless lives and in hastening the end of the World War II \n     in the Pacific.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (in this Act referred to as the `Secetary') shall strike\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\n     a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, and at a price \n     sufficient to cover the costs thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 5. STATUS AS NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals \n     for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 6. FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of \n     the medals authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Sarbanes) (by request):\n  S. 2409. A bill to provide for enhanced safety and environmental \nprotection in pipeline transportation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          pipeline safety and community protection act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pipeline \nSafety and Community Protection Act of 2000 on behalf of the \nadministration. Yesterday, Vice President Gore transmitted this \nproposal to the Congress, and requested introduction and referral of \nthe bill to the appropriate committee. The purpose of this legislation \nis to provide for enhanced safety and environmental protection in \npipeline transportation.\n  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a \nfield hearing in Bellingham, Washington, last month on pipeline safety. \nIn addition, I expect the committee to hold another hearing on pipeline \nsafety reauthorization within the next month. Senator Murray has \nintroduced a pipeline safety bill and it is my understanding that an \nadditional pipeline safety bill is to be introduced by Chairman McCain \ntoday. I am interested in reviewing all of the bills and look forward \nto the committee's action on pipeline safety reauthorization in the \ncoming months.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Hollings, in introducing, by request, the Pipeline Safety and \nCommunity Protection Act of 2000 proposed and announced yesterday by \nVice President Gore. This legislation is an important step forward in \nimproving safety and environmental protection in oil and gas pipelines.\n  Mr. President, last Friday night, the State of Maryland experienced a \nmajor oil spill--one its worst spills in many years. More than 110,000 \ngallons of No. 2 oil leaked from a pipe at Pepco's Chalk Point \nGenerating Station into Swanson Creek in Prince Georges County. Bad \nweather and high winds exacerbated the problem and spread the spill \ninto the Patuxent River. It has now affected some 8 miles of shoreline, \nacres of sensitive wetland habitat, and dozens of wildlife in three \ncounties along the Patuxent.\n  Six federal agencies--EPA, the U.S. Coast Guard, Fish and Wildlife \nService, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety \nBoard--are on site coordinating clean-up activities and investigations \ninto the causes of the leak. The Maryland Departments of the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources have taken steps to protect and \nrehabilitate impacted wildlife and to restrict harvesting in clam and \noyster beds in the area. Pepco crews and contractors have recovered \nmore than 70,000 gallons of the spilled oil. But recovering or cleaning \nup the remaining oil will be much more difficult and its cumulative \nimpact on the environment will not be known for months, if not years. \nThe Federal and State agencies have an important responsibility to \nensure that Pepco does everything possible to clean up the spill and \nremediate the environmental and economic damage. But an aggressive \nclean-up effort must be accompanied with a comprehensive program to \nprevent such spills from occurring in the first place. While the \nprecise cause of this oil leak is not yet known and is still under \ninvestigation, steps can and must be taken to help detect problems \nbefore pipelines fail and to minimize the environmental and other \nconsequences of a failure.\n  The Pipeline Safety and Community Protection Act being introduced \ntoday would reauthorize and enhance the U.S. Department of \nTransportation's pipeline safety program by increasing inspection and \ntesting of pipeline integrity. It would require pipeline operators to \ntake extra precautions in populated or environmentally sensitive areas, \nsuch as the area where the Pepco spill occurred. It would strengthen \nenforcement authorities by expanding penalties for violations and \ncompliance monitoring by Federal and State investigators. It would \nexpand research into new technologies for monitoring pipelines and \ndetecting leaks. Finally, it would strengthen Community-Right-to-Know \nand reporting requirements on releases and authorize additional funding \nfor the Department's and State pipeline safety activities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is strongly supported by the State of \nMaryland and represents a constructive step forward in enhancing safety \nand environmental protection in pipeline transportation. I look forward \nto working with the members of the Commerce Committee as they consider \nthis and other proposals to reauthorize the pipeline safety program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (by request):\n  S. 2410. A bill to increase the authorization of appropriations for \nthe Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     authorization increase for the reclamation safety of dams act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate \nreference, legislation submitted by the administration to increase the \nauthorization of appropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation's Safety \nof Dams program. Let me emphasize that I am introducing this \nlegislation at the request of the administration. Neither I nor any \nother member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has taken \na position on the merits of the legislation at this time. I understand \nsome water users have expressed concerns with this legislation, and I \nwant to assure them that the Water and Power Subcommittee, to which \nthis bill will be referred, will have a hearing on the legislation so \nthat they can make their concerns a part of the record and address them \nin the legislative process. Ensuring the safety of dams under the \njurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation is very important but is must \nbe done in a way that ensures safety at Reclamation facilities while \nnot causing undue financial hardship for project beneficiaries. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter of transmittal from the \nadministration and a section-by-section of the legislation that the \nadministration prepared be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                        Bureau of Reclamation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is draft legislation to \n     increase by $380,000,000 the authorized cost ceiling for the \n     Bureau of Reclamation's dam safety program authorized program \n     authorized in Public Law 95-578 and Public Law 98-404. I \n     would appreciate your assistance in seeing that this \n     legislation is introduced, referred to the appropriate \n     Congressional Committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       The Bureau of Reclamation's dam safety program is designed \n     to ensure that its facilities are operated in a safe and \n     reliable condition. The purpose of the program is to protect \n     the public, property and natural resources downstream of \n     Reclamation structures.\n       The Bureau of Reclamation expends approximately $60 million \n     per year for dam safety purposes and estimates that the \n     existing $650,000,000 cost ceiling will be exceeded in Fiscal \n     Year 2001. The enclosed legislation is necessary to continue \n     funding this important program.\n       In addition to increasing the authorized cost ceiling, the \n     legislation would make a few important changes to the dam \n     safety program. Under existing law, irrigators are required \n     to pay a portion of the dam safety costs within 50 years \n     without interest. The draft bill would amend the statute to \n     charge interest on the dam safety costs allocated for \n     irrigation purposes, This makes irrigation repayment terms \n     for dam safety activities consistent with municipal and \n     industrial water supply.\n       Existing law also requires the Bureau of Reclamation to \n     send a dam modifications report to Congress for dam safety \n     work costing more than $750,000. The report must rest before \n     Congress for 60 legislative days prior to Reclamation \n     obligating funds for dam safety construction, The attached \n     legislation would raise the threshold for a Congressional \n     report to $1.2 million, reduce to 30 calendar days the time \n     required for a dam safety modification report to rest in \n     Congress prior to Reclamation commencing dam safety repair \n     work.\n       A section-by-section analysis of the legislation also is \n     attached. Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n       A similar package has been transmitted to the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives. If you have any questions \n     concerning this\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n     legislation, please contact James Hess, Acting Chief, \n     Congressional and Legislative Affairs Group for the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, at 202-208-5840.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this proposal from the \n     standpoint of the administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Eluid L. Martinez,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n       Enclosure\n\n                      Section-By-Section Analysis\n\n       Section (A)(1). Makes Federal dam safety assistance \n     unavailable for costs incurred because the operating entity \n     does not adequately maintain the structure.\n       Section 1(A)(2)(a). Makes the additional $380 million \n     authorized to be appropriated by Section 1(B)(1) subject to \n     the 15 percent reimbursability requirement.\n       Section 1(A(2)(b). Strikes the existing provision that \n     limits repayment of the costs allocated to irrigation to the \n     irrigators' ability to pay.\n       Section 1(A)(2)(c)-(d). Renumbers the subsections of \n     existing Section 4.\n       Section 1(A)(2)(e). Existing law requires that dam safety \n     costs allocated to certain purposes, including municipal, \n     industrial, and power, but not including irrigation, be \n     repaid with interest. This provision includes irrigation \n     costs among those to be repaid with interest. Furthermore, \n     costs allocated to irrigation under this Act should be repaid \n     by the irrigators without assistance from power revenues.\n       Section 1(A)(2)(f). Explicitly provides that costs \n     allocated under this Act to project purposes will be repaid \n     with interest and without regard to water users' ability to \n     pay, thereby eliminating any assistance from power users to \n     water users.\n       Section 1(A)(3). Authorizes the Secretary to use monies \n     received pursuant to a repayment contract at any time prior \n     to completion of the dam safety construction work.\n       Section 1(B)(1). Authorizes the appropriation of an \n     additional $380 million (indexed for inflation) for dam \n     safety.\n       Section 1(B)(2). Increases to $1,200,000 (indexed for \n     inflation) the threshold amount of triggering when the Bureau \n     of Reclamation must send a modification report to Congress \n     prior to obligating funds for dam safety construction. \n     Existing law requires a report for any obligation exceeding \n     $750,000.\n       Section 1(B)(3). Reduces from 60 legislative days to 30 \n     calendar days the time that a dam safety modification report \n     must lie before Congress before the Bureau of Reclamation can \n     obligate funds for dam safety construction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Jeffords)\n  S. 2411.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congressional Joint Economic Committee data suggests \n     that over the last 15 years, agribusiness profits have come \n     almost exclusively out of producer income, rather than from \n     increased retail prices. Given the lack of market power of \n     producers, this data raises the question of whether the trend \n     has been a natural market development or is instead a sign of \n     market failure.\n       (2) Most economists agree that in the last 15 years the \n     real market price for a market basket of food has increased \n     by approximately 3 percent, while the farm value of that food \n     has fallen by approximately 38 percent. Over that period, \n     marketing costs have decreased by 15 percent, which should \n     have narrowed rather than widened the gap.\n       (3) There is significant concern that increasingly \n     vertically integrated multinational corporations, especially \n     those that own broad biotechnology patents, may be able to \n     exert unreasonable and excessive market power in the future \n     by acquiring companies that own other broad biotechnology \n     patents.\n       (4) The National Association of Attorneys General is very \n     concerned with the high degree of economic concentration in \n     the agricultural sector and the great potential for \n     anticompetitive practices and behavior. They estimate the top \n     4 meat packing firms control over 80 percent of steer and \n     heifer slaughter, over 55 percent of hog slaughter, and over \n     65 percent of sheep slaughter. Increased concentration in the \n     dairy procurement and processing sector is also raising \n     significant concerns.\n       (5) In the grain industry, United States Department of \n     Agriculture reports that the top 4 firms controlled 56 \n     percent of flour milling, 73 percent of wet corn milling, 71 \n     percent of soybean milling, and 62 percent of cotton seed oil \n     milling.\n       (6) Moreover, the figures in paragraphs (4) and (5) \n     underestimate true levels of concentration and potential \n     market power because they fail to reflect the web of \n     unreported and difficult to trace joint ventures, strategic \n     alliances, interlocking directorates, and other partial \n     ownership arrangements that link many large corporations.\n       (7) Concentration of market power also has the effect of \n     increasing the transfer of investment, capital, jobs, and \n     necessary social services out of rural areas to business \n     centers throughout the world. Many individuals representing a \n     wide range of expertise have expressed concern with the \n     potential implications of this trend for the greater public \n     good.\n       (8) The recent increase in contracting for the production \n     or sale of agricultural commodities, such as livestock and \n     poultry, is a cause for concern because of the significant \n     bargaining power the buyers of these products or services \n     wield over individual farmers and ranchers.\n       (9) Transparent, freely accessible, and competitive markets \n     are being supplanted by transfer prices set within vertically \n     integrated firms and by the increasing use of private \n     contracts.\n       (10) Agribusiness firms are showing record profits at the \n     same time that farmers and ranchers are struggling to survive \n     an ongoing price collapse and erratic price trends.\n       (11) The efforts of farmers and ranchers to improve their \n     market position is hampered by--\n       (A) extreme disparities in bargaining power between \n     agribusiness firms and the hundreds of thousands of \n     individual farmers and ranchers that sell products to them;\n       (B) the rapid increase in the use of private contracts that \n     disrupt price discovery and can unfairly disadvantage \n     producers;\n       (C) the extreme market power of agribusiness firms and \n     alleged anticompetitive practices in the industry;\n       (D) shrinking opportunities for market access by producers; \n     and\n       (E) the direct and indirect impact these factors have on \n     the continuing viability of thousands of rural communities \n     across the country.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) enhance fair and open competition in rural America, \n     thereby fostering innovation and economic growth;\n       (2) permit the Secretary to take actions to enhance the \n     bargaining position of family farmers and ranchers, and to \n     promote the viability of rural communities nationwide;\n       (3) protect family farms and ranches from--\n       (A) unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices \n     or devices;\n       (B) false or misleading statements;\n       (C) retaliation related to statements lawfully provided; \n     and\n       (D) other unfair trade practices employed by processors and \n     other agribusinesses; and\n       (4) permit the Secretary to take actions to enhance the \n     viability of rural communities nationwide.\n\n      SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nappropriations for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal \nyears 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n      NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nTransportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000. This bill proposes \nto reauthorize the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) through \nfiscal year 2003.\n  The NTSB is an independent agency charged with determining the \nprobable cause of transportation accidents and promoting transportation \nsafety. Among its many duties, the Board investigates accidents, \nconducts safety studies, and evaluates the effectiveness of other \ngovernment agencies' programs for preventing transportation accidents. \nIn my view, the NTSB is one of our nation's most critical governmental \nagencies and I want to commend its excellent work.\n  Since its inception in 1967, the NTSB has investigated more than \n110,000 aviation accidents, at least 10,000 other accidents in the \nsurface modes and issued more than 11,000 safety recommendations. The \nBoard's commitment to accident investigation and the development of \nsafety recommendations to prevent accidents from recurring is indeed \nadmirable. The NTSB staff works tirelessly, and in many cases, under \nthe least desirable circumstances.\n  The NTSB's authorization expired last September. The Board has \nsubmitted a reauthorization proposal and the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing last year to \nreview the Board's request. The reauthorization legislation I am \nintroducing is intended to provide the Board with the resources \nnecessary to carry out its important safety investigatory duties and \nprovide further assistance to the Board in its efforts to fulfill its \nmission.\n  The legislation would authorize the Board for Fiscal years 2000-2003. \nAs the Board requested, the bill would provide significant funding \nincreases over the level currently authorized. The Chairman of the \nBoard has testified that these funds are necessary in order to insure \nthat the NTSB continues to make timely and accurate determinations of \nthe probable causes of accidents, formulate realistic and feasible \nsafety recommendations, and respond to the families of victims of \ntransportation disasters in a professional and compassionate manner \nfollowing those tragedies. The legislation also would raise the Board's \nemergency fund to the level commensurate to that which has been \nappropriated in recent years.\n  The bill includes language requested by the Safety Board to require \nthe withholding from public disclosure of voice and video recorder \ninformation for all modes of transportation comparable to the \nprotections already statutorily provided for cockpit voice recorders \n(CVRs). This provision would be an important step in ensuring that \nrailroad, maritime, and motor vehicle recorders are properly protected \nfrom unwarranted disclosure or alternative use.\n\n  The bill provides the Board with authority to establish reasonable \nrates of overtime pay for its employees directly involved in accident-\nrelated work both on-scene and investigative. This authority was \nrequested in acknowledgment of the extensive time spent by NTSB staff \nin carrying out their duties and the Board's inability under current \nlaw to more fairly compensate these employees. I want to remind my \ncolleagues that the Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard \nalready have been provided authority by Congress to administer similar \npersonnel payment matters.\n  The Board's budget has dramatically increased over the years and this \nmeasure includes a number of financial accountability provisions. \nCurrently, the NTSB is one of the few agencies of the Federal \nGovernment not required to have a Chief Financial Office (CFO). While \nthe Board on its own initiative does have a CFO, this bill would make \nthat position permanent. The legislation also statutorily authorizes \nthe Chairman to establish annual travel budgets to govern Board Member \nnon-accident travel. After concerns were raised last year over \nexcessive Board Member travel by myself and others, the Chairman \nestablished annual budgets and procedures governing non-accident-\nrelated travel. His actions were an important step in addressing fiscal \naccountability at the Board and I believe\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nthey should be continued in the future. Further, the bill would give \nthe Inspector General of the Department of Transportation the authority \nto review the financial management and business operations of the Board \nto determine compliance with applicable Federal laws, rules, and \nregulations.\n  I have only taken time today to highlight a few sections of the bill. \nBut I assure my colleagues that there are other provisions in the \nlegislation designed to give the Safety Board the necessary tools to \ncontinue to fulfill its critical safety mission.\n  Mr. President. I urge my colleagues' support of this measure and look \nforward to bringing it to the full Senate for consideration in the near \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Thurmond, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \n        Robb, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2413. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to clarify the procedures and conditions for the award of \nmatching grants for the purchase of armor vests; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n             bulletproof vest partnership grant act of 2000\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today Senator Leahy and I are \nintroducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, a bill \nto expand an existing matching grant program to help State, tribal, and \nlocal jurisdictions purchase armor vests for the use by law enforcement \nofficers. This bill represents another in a series of law enforcement \nlegislative initiatives on which I have had the privilege to work with \nmy friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy. The Senator brings \nto the table invaluable experience in this area, from his distinguished \nservice as a State's attorney in Vermont, a nationally recognized \nprosecutor, and as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. We are pleased to be joined in this effort by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, and Senators Thurmond, Bingaman, Jeffords, Sarbanes, Coverdell, \nRobb, Schumer, Reed, and Reid.\n  Two years ago, Congress passed and the President signed into law the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-181), which we \nwere privileged to introduce. This highly successful Department of \nJustice grant program has already funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests \nfor police officers across the country.\n  There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our \nstreets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against \nviolent criminals. As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the \nrisks which law enforcement officers face every day on the front lines \nprotecting our communities.\n  Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and \ndeadly weapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law \nenforcement officers--or 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and \nlocal officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests.\n  The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most \nimportant pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can \nhave. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives \nof more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In \nfact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers \nwho do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed \nby a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, \nbulletproof vests save lives.\n  Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to \npurchase vests on their own. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act \nof 2000 would continue the partnership with state and local law \nenforcement agencies to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $50 \nmillion per year for the grant program within the U.S. Department of \nJustice. In addition, the program would provide 50-50 matching grants \nto state and local law enforcement agencies and Indian tribes with \nunder 100,000 residents to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and \nbody armor. Finally, this bill will make the purchase of stabproof \nvests eligible for grant awards.\n  While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a \ncareer in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure \nthat officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a \nvest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an \nofficer can have and often means the difference between life and death. \nThe United States Senate can help, and I urge our colleagues to support \nprompt passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Grant Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had the protection \n     of an armor vest;\n       (2) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were killed in the \n     line of duty;\n       (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing an armor vest is 14 times higher than for officers \n     wearing an armor vest;\n       (4) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n     resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n     law enforcement officers in the United States; and\n       (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply, despite a decrease in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senior Senator from \nColorado in introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n2000. We worked together closely and successfully with the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. I am pleased that Senator \nHatch is again an original cosponsor of this bill. I am also pleased \nthat Senators Schumer, Reid of Nevada, Sarbanes, Robb, Bingaman, \nThurmond, Coverdell, and Reed of Rhode Island are joining us as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 \npercent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty \nsince 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. \nIndeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while \nnot wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.\n  To better protect our Nation's law enforcement officers, Senator \nCampbell and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, \n1998 (public law 105-181). The law created a $25 million, 50 percent \nmatching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state \nand local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years \n1999-2001.\n  In its first year of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests for our Nation's \npolice officers, including 361 vests for Vermont police officers. \nApplications are now available at the program's web site at http://\nvests.ojp.gov/ for this year's funds. The entire process of submitting \napplications and obtaining federal funds is completed through this web \nsite.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the \nsuccess of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million \nfor fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by \nguaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive \nthe full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these \nsmaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests \neligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers and sheriffs \nwho face violent criminals in close quarters in local and county jails.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during \nroutine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential \nthat we update this law so that many more of our officers who are \nrisking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves.\n  In the last Congress, we created the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program in part in response to the tragic Drega incident along \nthe Vermont and New Hampshire border. On August 19, 1997, Federal, \nState and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New \nHampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This \nmadman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two \nother victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with \nthe authorities, Drega lost his life.\n  During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore \nbulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For \nexample, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, who \nwas seriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his \nbulletproof vest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake \ninstead of visiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the \nhospital a few days later. I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is \ndoing well and is back on duty today.\n  The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega \nwere not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective \nvests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous \nofficers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this \nmadman. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were \nkilled. Their tragedy underscore the point that all of our law \nenforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the \nprotection of a bulletproof vest. With that and lesser-known incidents \nas constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent \nloss of life among our law enforcement officers.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 will provide state \nand local law enforcement agencies with more of the assistance they \nneed to protect their officers. Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the \nendorsement of many law enforcement organizations, including the \nFraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. In my \nhome State of Vermont, the bill enjoys the strong support of the \nVermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many \nVermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law \nenforcement officials.\n  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen \ninterest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont \nhas the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, \nwork and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the \nhard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we \nshould do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes \nto our attention.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the \nline of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. \nUnfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not \nnecessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer \nacross the Nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that each and \nevery law enforcement agency in Vermont and across the Nation can \nafford basic protection for their officers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2414. A bill to combat trafficking of persons, especially into the \nsex trade, slavery, and slavery-like conditions, in the United States \nand countries around the world through prevention, through prosecution \nand enforcement against traffickers, and through protection and \nassistance to victims of trafficking; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n               TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today. I \nwould like to thank my colleague, Senator Brownback, for his superb \nwork. It is called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. \nBasically, this is legislation I am doing together with Senator \nBrownback. We are very hopeful we will have strong support in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, starting with the chairman.\n  The long and the short of it, colleagues, is, though, it is hard to \nbelieve, in the year 2000, there are maybe 50,000 women and children \ntrafficked to our country, maybe as many as 2 million worldwide.\n  It is a dark, dark feature of this new world economy, where women and \nchildren are basically responding to ads, going to other countries, \nbelieving they will find employment; and they are forced into \nprostitution, they are forced into labor, and the conditions are \nabsolutely atrocious.\n  It is unbelievable what has happened to these women and children. \nTherefore, we put an emphasis on, No. 1, prevention, to make sure that \nthrough AID we get information out to people in other countries, so \nwomen and children are not entrapped in this way.\n  No. 2, we want to make sure there are alternatives, such as good \nmicroloan programs, like NGOs for women.\n  No. 3, we put an emphasis on how we can provide some protection, \nwhich has to do with making sure if women step forward they are not \nautomatically deported. There would be an extension of their visa so \nthey would be able to speak out without worrying about being deported \nfrom our country. We would make sure there is treatment for women who \nhave gone through this living hell.\n  Finally, there would be prosecution. Making it crystal clear to those \nwho are engaged in trafficking, you are going to be hit with stiff \nfinancial penalties.\n  Senator Feinstein, who is on the floor, has been a strong supporter \nof trying to do something about this, and to make sure that if you are \ngoing to traffic a child under the age of 14 for\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nforced prostitution, you are going to serve a life sentence in prison.\n  We are going to call on the international community to take this \nseriously. I believe there will be strong support in the Senate. It \nwould be a powerful and important human rights piece of legislation.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation today. I think we can move \nit in committee. I think we can have strong bipartisan support. I thank \nSenator Brownback, Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, and others for \ntheir interest.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to introduce legislation to help end \nthe horrific crime of trafficking in persons, particularly women and \nchildren, for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor. \nThis egregious human rights violation--and we must acknowledge \ntrafficking in persons as the gross human rights abuse that it is--is a \nworldwide problem that must be confronted in domestic legislation as we \ncontinue to fight it on the international front.\n  At this very moment the administration is involved in negotiations in \nVienna to strengthen international efforts to combat trafficking. We \ntoo must do our part. We need to enact a comprehensive trafficking bill \ninto law in this Congress. Senator Brownback and I have worked together \nclosely to develop the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, and \nwe agree on every provision of the bill except for one. We are here \ntogether today to introduce separate trafficking bills but to relay to \nyou the truly bipartisan effort this has been. Senator Brownback, I \nlook forward to continuing this effort as our respective bills move \nthrough the committee and to the floor.\n  Despite increasing governmental and international interest, \ntrafficking in persons continues to be one of the darkest aspects of \nglobalization of the world economy, becoming more insidious and more \nwidespread everyday. It is not just a problem that takes place on \ndistant shores, as many of us have been led to believe. A recent CIA \nanalysis of the international trafficking of women to the United States \nreports that as many as 50,000 women and children each year are brought \ninto the United States and forced to work as prostitutes, forced \nlaborers, and servants. Others credibly estimate that the number is \nprobably much higher than that.\n  In a hearing last week, I heard the almost unbelievable testimony of \nseveral women who had been victims of trafficking. But, I say almost \nunbelievable because I heard the truth directly from the mouths of \nthose who have been hurt the most. One victim trafficked for sex from \nMexico to Florida at the age of 14 told,\n\n       Because I was a virgin, the men decided to initiate me by \n     raping me again and again, to teach me how to have sex * * * \n     Because I was so young, I was always in demand with the \n     customers. It was awful. Although the men were supposed to \n     wear condoms, some didn't so I eventually became pregnant and \n     was forced to have an abortion.\n\n  I am here today to say that one victim is one too many. We have a \nserious problem that must be addressed.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is a comprehensive \nbill that addresses the three P's of trafficking: it aims to prevent \ntrafficking in persons, provides protection and assistance to those who \nhave been trafficked, and provides for tough prosecution and punishment \nof those responsible for trafficking.\n  This bill addresses the underlying problems which fuel the \ntrafficking industry by promoting public awareness campaigns, and \ninitiatives to enhance economic opportunity, such as microcredit \nlending programs and skills training, for those most susceptible to \ntrafficking. It provides for the establishment of programs designed to \nassist in the safe reintegration of victims into their community, and \nensures that such programs address the physical and mental health needs \nof trafficking victims. In fact, the trauma that results from being \ntrafficked is not unlike that of someone who has been tortured, and \nvictims of trafficking deserve similar assistance.\n  This bill also provides immigration relief and allows victims of \ntrafficking the time necessary to bring charges against those \nresponsible for their condition. In the United States, many trafficking \nvictims are deported for not having the appropriate legal documents \nwhen, in fact, it is often the trafficker who has given the victim \nfalse documents, or held the victim's identifying documents so that he \nor she could not move freely. This bill addresses this unintended \nresult of the law. This measure enhances our existing legal structures, \ncriminalizing all forms of trafficking in persons and establishing \npunishment which is commensurate with the heinous nature of this crime. \nIt provides for sentences of up to life in prison for those criminals \ninvolved in trafficking children.\n\n  Those criminals who are involved in trafficking, from the lowest to \nthe highest levels, should not expect to go unpunished in the United \nStates or abroad, and neither should governments whose governments \nmight be complicit in trafficking. This bill requires an expansion of \nreporting on trafficking in the annual Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices, including a separate list of countries of origin, transit or \ndestination for a significant number of trafficking victims which are \nnot meeting minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. This \nbill provides for sanctions against counties which do not meet these \nminimum standards. It also authorizes the Secretary of State to publish \na list of foreign persons involved in trafficking, and authorizes the \nPresident to take tough action against any person on that list.\n  A similar bill to our bills is moving through the House. Both that \nbill, H.R. 3244, and the bills that we are introducing today, are \nbipartisan efforts that deserve our full consideration. Senator \nBrownback and I have worked hard to create a bill that is comprehensive \nand addresses both of our concerns, and both of us are equally \ncommitted to the fight against trafficking. We disagree, however, on a \nsmall but significant part of the strategy in this fight: the use of \nmandatory versus discretionary sanctions against countries which do not \nmeet the minimum standards for elimination of trafficking.\n  While Senator Brownback believes a system of mandatory sanctions will \nbetter facilitate our goal to eliminate trafficking, after much \nresearch into the effect of a mandatory sanctions requirement, I \nbelieve a discretionary sanctions approach, allowing for a more \ntargeted use of sanctions, together with a requirement for the delivery \nto Congress of a separate list of countries involved in trafficking, is \nthe better approach.\n  Trafficking exploits poor women and booms in societies undergoing \nsevere economic distress. To impose economic sanctions in trafficking \nlegislation that cuts off a broad range of bilateral and multilateral \nassistance programs designed to improve the economy of specific nations \nis to cause harm to the very people who might be helped by the \nlegislation.\n  For example, I don't believe we can justify cutting off funding \ndesigned to foster economic reform so that those most susceptible to \ntrafficking such as women and children, can find work; or cutting off \nfunding for programs that increase professionalism and independence in \nthe judicial system so that traffickers can be held accountable; or \neven cutting off programs designed to provide training and technical \nassistance to countries which are generally making an effort to combat \ntrafficking. This is what could happen to certain countries which are \nknown to have a severe trafficking problem, under a mandatory sanctions \nregime. I don't believe we justify cutting off child survival and \ndisease programs which counter the spread of HIV and AIDS, a \nsignificant problem among women trafficked into the sex industry, to \ncountries in which sex trafficking is a large problem such as the \nPhilippines and Bangladesh. These are just a couple of examples of the \nproblems created by a sanctions regime that is too broad. A more \ntargeted, discretionary sanctions approach to sanctions is, I think, \nclearly the way to go.\n\n  By requiring a list of countries involved in trafficking who do not \nmeet minimum standards for the elimination of it, we can closely \nmonitor the progress of countries in their fight against trafficking. \nTrafficking in persons is a complicated issue that almost always \ninvolves larger criminal elements. Those countries which are truly \ncommitted to ending this gross human rights abuse, and are cooperating \nin the global battle against it, should not\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nfear the list since they will not be put on it. Those countries which \nare not doing their share should expect that the President of the \nUnited States will use his discretion to impose targeted sanctions, and \nI for one will do all I can to see that our government imposes \nappropriate sanctions against those governments whose officials are \ncomplicit in this terrible crime.\n  Sanctions can be an important deterrent. However, in my opinion broad \nmandatory sanctions within the context of trafficking are not useful. A \ndiscretionary sanctions regime that allows the President--who is, in \nfact, better positioned to understand the varying dynamics and extent \nof the trafficking problem from country to country--to impose specific, \ntargeted, and workable sanctions against trafficking countries is a \nmore sound approach.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at both of these trafficking \nbills and cosponsor one or the other as they move forward. These bills \nare identical except for the sanctions provision, and both provide the \nsame broad and comprehensive assistance to trafficking victims and to \ncountries working to combat trafficking.\n  Since my wife and I began working on this issue several years ago, I \nhave met with trafficking victims, after-care providers, and human \nrights advocates from around the world who have reminded me again and \nagain of the horrible nature of this crime. We must intensify our work \nto eliminate trafficking in persons. We must focus our energy on this \nbipartisan effort to see the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 \nmove quickly through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and get \npassed into law this year. The many victims of trafficking deserve no \nless.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 2415. A bill to amend the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act \nof 1994 and other sections of the Truth in Lending Act to protect \nconsumers against predatory practices in connection with high cost \nmortgage transactions, to strengthen the civil remedies available to \nconsumers under existing law, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n           predatory lending consumer protection act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Predatory \nLending Consumer Protection Act with Senators Dodd, Kerry, and Schumer. \nThis legislation is a companion to an identical bill being introduced \nby Representative LaFalce in the House of Representatives, along with a \nnumber of his colleagues.\n  Representative LaFalce has demonstrated his strong commitment to a \nbanking system that takes into consideration the credit needs of all \nAmericans, including those that have been traditionally locked out of \nthe market or are less sophisticated. I thank him for his leadership.\n  Homeownership is the American Dream. It is the opportunity for all \nAmericans to put down roots and start creating equity for themselves \nand their families. Homeownership has been the path to building wealth \nfor generations of Americans; it has been the key to ensuring stable \ncommunities, good schools, and safe streets.\n  The predatory lending industry plays on these hopes and dreams to \ncheat people of their hard-earned wealth. These lenders target working \nand lower income families, the elderly, and, often, uneducated \nhomeowners for their abusive practices. To my mind, nothing can be more \ncynical.\n  Let me briefly describe how predatory lenders operate. They target \npeople with a lot of equity in their homes; they underwrite the \nproperty without regard to the ability of the borrower to pay the loan \nback. They make their money by charging extremely high origination \nfees, and by ``packing'' other products into the loan, including \nupfront premiums for credit life insurance, or credit unemployment \ninsurance, and others, for which they get significant commissions but \nare of no value to the homeowner.\n  The premiums for these products get financed into the loan, greatly \nincreasing the loan's total balance amount, sometimes by as much as 50 \npercent. As a result, the borrower is likely to find himself in extreme \nfinancial distress.\n  Then, when the trouble hits, the predatory lender will offer to \nrefinance the loan. Unfortunately, another characteristic of these \nloans is that they have prepayment penalties. So, by the time the \nrefinancing occurs, with all the fees repeated and the prepayment \npenalty included, the lender/broker makes a lot of money from the \ntransaction, and the owner has been stripped of his or her equity and, \noftentimes, his or her home.\n  The problem is, most of these practices, while unethical and clearly \nabusive, are legal. There is a widening sense that this is a serious \nproblem. Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Board has recognized \nthis as an increasing problem, as have the other banking regulators. \nFor example, the FDIC is considering raising capital standards for all \nsubprime lending; the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) has published \nan Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) asking for information \nand views on these very practices; HUD Secretary Cuomo and Treasury \nSecretary Summers have convened a Task Force on this issue. Both Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac have developed a number of products that are \nintended to reach out to homeowners with somewhat impaired credit in \norder to bring them into the financial mainstream. These companies have \nalso announced that they will not buy loans with single premium credit \ninsurance financed into the loan, one of the problems highlighted by \nthis legislation.\n  Clearly, there is already some action to address the problem of \npredatory lending. But we need to do more. This legislation will outlaw \nthe most abusive practices, and enable the marketplace to eliminate the \nothers. This is a very important point. Let me give you an example. The \nbill prohibits the financing of more than 3% of a loan in fees for high \ncost loans, because it is the financing of fees and premiums on \nextraneous products that literally strip the equity out of a person's \nhome. However, the bill would not prohibit additional fees from being \ncharged, so we are not regulating profit.\n  We want to make sure that the loan is affordable to the borrower. \nTying the lender's return to the loan's successful repayment is the \nbest way to assure this. Now, some people have raised concerns that \nlimiting the financing of fees will push up interest rates. This may be \ntrue, but it is also better to see the return to the lender reflected \nin the interest rate because it is much easier for people to shop on \nthe basis of the interest rate. As a result, the market will help to \nkeep rates down. Moreover, higher rate mortgages can always be \nrefinanced as borrower's credit standing improves.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the support of the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, the American Association of Retired People, \nthe National Consumer Law Center, the Self-Help Credit Union of North \nCarolina, Consumers Union, Consumers Federation, ACORN, the National \nAssociation of Consumer Advocates, U.S. PIRG and others.\n  I want to make clear that this bill is aimed at predatory practices. \nThere are many people who may have had some credit problems who still \nneed access to affordable credit. They may only be able to get subprime \nloans, which charge higher interest rates. Clearly, to get the credit, \nthey will have to pay somewhat higher rates because of the greater risk \nthey represent. We want them to be able to get these loans.\n  But these families should not be stripped of their home equity \nthrough financing of extremely high fees, credit insurance, or \nprepayment penalties. They should not be forced into constant \nrefinancing, losing more and more of the wealth they've taken a \nlifetime to build to a new set of fees each and every time.\n  This legislation will keep credit available, while discouraging or \nprohibiting these worst practices. The bill allows lenders to recover \nthe costs of making their loans, while always leaving the door open to \nborrowers to repair their credit and move to lower cost loans.\n  Taken as a whole, predatory lending practices represent a frontal \nassault on homeowners all over America. Today,\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nwe are coming to their defense. We must stop the American dream of \nhomeownership from being distorted into a nightmare by these \nunscrupulous practices. We want to ensure that all borrowers, whether \nin the prime or subprime market, are treated fairly and responsibly. \nThat is what this legislation is intended to do, and I urge my \ncolleagues' consideration and support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of \nthe legislation be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The new \n     definition, which amends the ``Home Ownership Equipment \n     Protection Act,'' is as follows: First mortgages that exceed \n     Treasury securities by six (6) percentage points; second \n     mortgages that exceed Treasury securities by eight (8) \n     percentage points; or mortgages where total points and fees \n     payable by the borrower exceed the greater of five percent \n     (5%) of the total loan amount, or $1,000. The bill revises \n     the definition of points and fees to be more inclusive.\n       The following key protections are triggered for high cost \n     mortgages only:\n       Restrictions on financing of points and fees. The bill \n     restricts a creditor from directly or indirectly financing \n     any portion of the points, fees or other charges greater than \n     3% of the total sum of the loan, or $600. The lender cannot \n     finance prepayment penalties or points paid by the consumer \n     if the originator of the loan is refinancing the loan. \n     Moreover, the lender or any affiliated creditor cannot \n     finance points and fees for the refinancing of a loan they \n     originated.\n       Limitation on the payment of prepayment penalties. The bill \n     prohibits the lender from imposing prepayment penalties after \n     the initial 24 month period of the loan. During the first 24 \n     months of a loan, prepayment penalties are limited to the \n     difference in the amount of closing costs and fees financed \n     and 3% of the total loan amount.\n       Prohibition on balloon payments. The bill prohibits the use \n     of balloon payments.\n       Limitation on single premium credit insurance. The bill \n     would prohibit upfront payment or financing of credit life, \n     credit disability or credit unemployment insurance on a \n     single premium basis. However, borrowers are free to purchase \n     such insurance with the regular mortgage payment on a \n     periodic basis, provided that it is a separate transaction \n     that can be canceled at any time.\n       Extension of liability for home improvement contract loans. \n     The bill would make parent companies and officers of lenders, \n     or subsequent holders of loans by a contractor, liable for \n     HOEPA violations if the contractor goes out of business to \n     avoid liability.\n       Limitation on mandatory arbitration clauses. The bill \n     prohibits mortgages from including terms which require \n     arbitration or other non-judicial settlement as the sole \n     method of settling claims or disputes arising under the loan \n     agreement.\n       Prohibition on requiring rescission of rights. The bill \n     prohibits a creditor from requiring or encouraging a borrower \n     to sign an election not to exercise the three-day right to\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\n     rescind or cancel a credit transaction at the same time that \n     the borrowers receives notice of the right of rescission.\n       Other provisions in the bill:\n       Increase statutory damages in individual civil actions and \n     class actions. The maximum amount that can be awarded in \n     individual actions is increased to $100,000. The maximum \n     amount that can be awarded in a class action is the greater \n     of: (1) the maximum amount of the liability available for an \n     individual action multiplied by the number of members or (ii) \n     percent of the net worth of the creditor.\n       Require that as a condition for making a high cost loan, a \n     creditor make a determination at the time the loan is \n     consummated, that the borrower will be able to make the \n     schedule payments to repay the loan obligation.\n       Prohibit a lender from making a high cost loan unless it \n     certifies that it has provided the borrower with certain \n     information regarding the risks associated with high cost \n     loans and the availability of home ownership counseling.\n       Require additional disclosures related to the risks \n     associated with high cost mortgages.\n       Prohibit a creditor/lender from: (i) recommending or \n     encouraging default on an existing loan or other debt prior \n     to, or in connection with, a closing on a high cost loan, \n     (ii) including any provision which permits the creditor, in \n     its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness under the \n     loan, or (iii) charging a borrower any fee to modify a high-\n     cost loan or defer payment due under such high cost loan \n     unless it provides a material benefit to the borrower.\n       Require that a creditor annually report both favorable and \n     unfavorable payment history of borrowers to credit bureaus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2636-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2636-S2637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 459\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Domenici) was added as a cosponsor of S. 459, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the State ceiling on private \nactivity bonds.\n\n\n                                 S. 660\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 660, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage under part B \nof the medicare program of medical nutrition therapy services furnished \nby registered dietitians and nutrition professionals.\n\n\n                                 S. 741\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Helms and\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nLautenberg in submitting this resolution on the travel ban and other \nU.S. restrictions on Libya.\n  At the end of March, a team of State Department officials visited \nLibya as part of a review of the ban that has been in effect since 1981 \non U.S. travel to Libya. State Department officials were in Libya for \n26 hours, visiting hotels and other sites. Based on the findings of \nthis delegation, the State Department is preparing a recommendation for \nthe Secretary of State to help her determine whether there is still \n``imminent danger to . . . the physical safety of United States \ntravellers,'' as the law requires in order to maintain the ban.\n  Because of the travel ban, American citizens can travel to Libya only \nif they obtain a license from the Department of the Treasury. In \naddition, the State Department must first validate a passport for \ntravel to Libya.\n  The travel ban was imposed originally for safety reasons and predates \nthe terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But lifting the ban now, \njust as the two Libyan suspects are about to go on trial in The \nNetherlands for their role in that atrocity, will undoubtedly be viewed \nas a gesture of good will to Colonel Qadhafi.\n  After State Department announced that it would send this consular \nteam to Libya, a Saudi-owned daily paper quoted a senior Libyan \nofficial as saying the one-day visit by the U.S. team was a ``step in \nthe right direction.'' The official said the visit was a sign that \n``the international community was convinced that Libya's foreign policy \nposition was not wrong and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's \nrelations with the world.''\n  Libya's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \nCooperation said the visit demonstrated that the Administration ``has \nrealized the importance of Libya'' and that Libya considers ``that the \nnegative chapter in our relations is over.''\n  Libya's Secretary for African Unity told reporters that the visit to \nLibya by U.S. officials was a welcome step and that `` . . . we welcome \nthe normalization between the two countries.''\n  The good will gesture was certainly not lost on Colonel Qadhafi, who \nsaid on April 4, when asked about a possible warming of relations with \nthe United States: ``I think America has reviewed its policy toward \nLibya and discovered that it is wrong . . . it is a good time for \nAmerica to change its policy toward Libya.''\n\n  I have been in contact with many of the families of the victims of \nPan Am Flight 103, and they are extremely upset by the timing of this \ndecision. They are united in their belief that the U.S. delegation \nshould not have been sent to Libya and that it would be a serious \nmistake to lift the travel ban before justice is served. The families \nwant to know why the Secretary of State made this friendly overture to \nColonel Qadhafi now--just six weeks before the trial in the Netherlands \nbegins. They question how much information the State Department was \nable to obtain by spending only 26 hours in Libya. They wonder why the \nState Department could not continue to use the same sources of \ninformation it has been using for many years to make a determination \nabout the travel ban.\n  There is no reason to believe that the situation in Libya has changed \nsince November 1999, when the travel ban was last extended on the basis \nof imminent danger to American citizens. Indeed, in January 2000 \nPresident Clinton cited Libya's support for terrorist activities and \nits non-compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, and \n863 as actions and policies that ``pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy \ninterest of the United States.''\n  These American families have waited for justice for eleven long \nyears. They felt betrayed by the decision to send the consular \ndelegation to Libya. They have watched with dismay as our close ally, \nGreat Britain, has moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with \nLibya, before justice is served for the British citizens killed in the \nterrorist bombing. The State Department denies it, but the families are \nconcerned that the visit signals a change in U.S. policy, undermines \nU.S. sanctions, and calls into question the Administration's commitment \nto vigorously enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. That Act requires \nthe United States to impose sanctions on foreign companies which invest \nmore than $40 million in the Libyan petroleum industry, until Libya \ncomplies with the conditions specified by the U.N. Security Council in \nits resolutions.\n  The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 188 Americans were killed, \nwas one of the worst terrorist atrocities in American history. Other \nAmerican citizens are waiting for justice in other cases against Libya \nas well. Libya is also accused in the 1986 La Belle discotheque bombing \nin Germany, which resulted in the deaths of two United States \nservicemen. The trial against five individuals implicated began in \nDecember of 1997 and is ongoing. In March 1999, six Libyan intelligence \nagents, including Colonel Qadhafi's brother-in-law, were convicted in \nabsentia by a French court for the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which \nresulted in the deaths of 171 people, including seven Americans. A \ncivil suit against Colonel Qadhafi based on that bombing is pending in \nFrance.\n  The State Department should not have sent a delegation to Libya now \nand it should not lift the travel ban on Libya at this time. The State \nDepartment's long-standing case-by-case consideration of passport \nrequests for visits to Libya by U.S. citizens has worked well. It can \ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n  The resolution we are submitting today states the sense of the Senate \nthat Libya's refusal to accept responsibility for its role in terrorist \nattacks against United States citizens suggests that the imminent \ndanger to the physical safety of United States travelers continues. It \ncalls on the Administration to consult fully with the U.S. Congress in \nconsidering policy toward Libya. It states that the travel ban and all \nother U.S. restrictions on Libya should not be eased until all cases of \nAmerican victims of Libyan terrorism have been resolved and the \ngovernment of Libya has cooperated fully in bringing the perpetrators \nto justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a Washington Post article and editorial on this subject be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 26, 2000]\n\n                        Stealthy Shift On Libya\n\n                           (By Jim Hoagland)\n\n       In the 11 years since her husband and 188 other Americans \n     were murdered aboard Pan Am 103, Victoria Cummock has learned \n     to listen carefully to the words State Department officials, \n     say, and do not say, to her. So alarm bells went off for \n     Cummock the third or fourth time her latest interlocutor from \n     Foggy Bottom seemed to limit responsibility for the terror \n     bombing to ``the two indicted Libyans.''\n       ``Wait a minute,'' Cummock recalls telling Michael Sheehan, \n     head of the State Department's counterterrorism office. \n     ``Your department always spoke of Libya and state-sponsored \n     terrorism being responsible. You are distancing your past \n     position. You now present this as just two wild and crazy \n     guys off on their own? What is going on?''\n       In the small space between two bureaucratic formulations \n     Victoria Cummock heard the sound of her husband, and the \n     other victims of a gigantic crime aimed at their nation, \n     being consigned to official oblivion. Your cause is no longer \n     our cause, she and others on the telephone conference call \n     heard Sheehan not quite say. It is to move on.\n       Sheehan does not recall the exchange that way. He told me \n     he never made the semantic distinction heard by Cummock, who \n     lives in Coral Gables, Fla. But he also declined to respond \n     directly when I asked if he thought Libya still practices or \n     supports state-sponsored terrorism. ``They are still on our \n     terrorism list,'' was as far as he would go.\n       Mere she-said, he-said in an emotion-charged conversation \n     between still-grieving families and a government official \n     given the thankless task of briefing them? Not quite. \n     Whatever the exact words spoken, Cummock did hear the \n     background music being played in a skillful operation to move \n     policy one small step at a time, almost imperceptibly and \n     always deniably.\n       The Clinton administration has for more than a year been \n     slowly shifting from a policy of isolating and punishing \n     Libya to a policy of exploring whether the North African \n     state can be rehabilitated and its oil made available to U.S. \n     markets once again.\n       In the most transparent move yet, the State Department \n     dispatched four officials to Tripoli Wednesday to judge \n     whether Americans can safely travel to a country that few \n     realize has been off-limits to them since 1981. The \n     diplomats' safe return this weekend will presumably be \n     evidence in the affirmative. Then a recommendation will go\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n     to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to remove or keep \n     the official ban on U.S. travel to that inhospitable, barren \n     land.\n       Sheehan insistently discounted the importance of this trip, \n     and Albright may yet decide to keep the ban on. But this \n     maneuvering must be viewed for what it is: a piece in a \n     pattern of endgame diplomacy by the Clinton administration. \n     Improving relations with states once known as rogues and \n     lifting or easing sanctions where possible (with the \n     exception of still politically useful Cuba) has become an \n     undeclared but important objective for the Clintonites.\n       The push to close the books on the bombing of Pan Am 103 \n     over Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, and other Libyan misdeeds is \n     in part a response on the White House from Britain, Egypt and \n     U.S. oil companies, all of which argue the case for rewarding \n     Moammar Gadhafi's recent abstinence from terrorist exploits.\n       But it also reflects President Clinton's concern over the \n     diplomatic and humanitarian effects of open-ended sanctions. \n     ``The lack of international consensus on sanctions and the \n     costs that brings has bothered him for some time,'' says one \n     well-placed official.\n       There is a case to be made for reviewing and adjusting U.S. \n     sanctions as conditions change: Clinton has in fact allowed \n     Albright to make that case publicly and persuasively on Iran. \n     She has skillfully mixed approval of a trend to internal \n     democracy with strictures about Iran's continuing \n     depredations abroad and let the public judge each step as it \n     is taken.\n       But there is no similar intellectual honesty on Libya. \n     There seems to be instead a stealth policy to bring change \n     but not accept political responsibility for giving up on \n     confronting the dictator who would have had to authorize \n     Libyan participation in the bombing.\n       Last year the White House overrode skepticism from Justice \n     Department officials and other opposition within the \n     administration and agreed to Gadhafi's terms for a trial of \n     two Libyan underling in The Hague, under Scottish law. Their \n     trial begins in May.\n       ``There was an unvoiced sense in these meetings that the \n     Pan Am 103 families had to get over it and move on with their \n     lives. The trial would help with that as well as with our \n     diplomatic objectives,'' said one official who participated \n     in the contentious high-level interagency sessions. ``But if \n     these two are acquitted, it is all over. There will be no \n     more investigations, and no more international pressure on \n     Gadhafi. It is a huge risk.''\n       Worse: It is a huge risk that Bill Clinton is willing to \n     take but not explain honestly to the American people. For \n     shame, Mr. President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 3, 2000]\n\n                             The Libya Thaw\n\n       Four American diplomats recently returned from Libya, where \n     they were sent by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to \n     determine whether it is time for the United States to lift \n     the ban on using U.S. passports to visit Moammar Gadhafi's \n     realm. The trip follows other steps hinting at a Clinton \n     administration intention to thaw relations with a regime that \n     remains on the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism.\n       The most notorious terrorist act linked to Tripoli is the \n     Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, \n     Scotland. The attack killed 270 people, including 189 \n     Americans. After an investigation fingered two Libyan agents, \n     the United States won U.S. Security Council approval for \n     sanctions against Libya. Last year the Clinton administration \n     agreed to ``suspend'' sanctions after Mr. Gadhafi consented \n     to hand the two men over for a trial under Scottish law at a \n     special court in Holland. The Libyan dictator did so only \n     after being satisfied, via a U.S.-vetted letter from U.N. \n     Secretary General Kofi Annan, that the trial, which opens May \n     3, would focus on the two suspects and not on his regime.\n       In striking this compromise, the Clinton administration \n     made clear that it would not approve permanent lifting of the \n     U.N. sanctions or the lifting of unilateral U.S. sanctions \n     until Mr. Gadhafi meets other demands, such as paying \n     compensation, accepting Libyan responsibility for the crime \n     and revealing all that his regime knows about it. But the \n     administration has not pressed those issues at the U.N., and \n     its diplomatic body language suggests it is trying to wrap up \n     a long battle that has often placed the United States at odds \n     with European allies who rely on Libyan oil.\n       Perhaps the administration believes the economic and \n     diplomatic costs of a hard line on Libya now outweigh the \n     benefits. Perhaps Mr. Gadhafi's recent expulsion from Libya \n     of the Abu Nidal organization deserves to be rewarded. And \n     perhaps it is futile to insist that Mr. Gadhafi tell \n     everything he knows about the case, however contradictory it \n     may be to prosecute the two bombers while settling, at most, \n     for compensation from Mr. Gadhafi, who almost certainly would \n     have ordered such an attack.\n       Whatever the rationale, the American public is entitled to \n     a full explanation. But, with the exception of a speech by \n     Assistant Secretary of State Ronald Neumann last November, \n     the Clinton administration has kept its Libya decision-making \n     in the shadows. Despite requests from the Pan Am 103 victims' \n     families, it won't release the Annan letter, citing \n     diplomatic privacy. A legitimate point--but it inevitably \n     leaves many wondering whether the letter contains \n     inappropriate promises to Mr. Gadhafi. If there's nothing \n     untoward about the Clinton administration's overall Libya \n     policy, why doesn't Secretary Albright, or, better, the \n     president, do more to help the public understand it?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/12/senate-section/article/S2639-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 288--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                  CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
