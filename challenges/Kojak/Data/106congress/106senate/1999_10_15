Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 2684, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 2684, an act making \n     appropriations for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and \n     Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies for \n     the year ending September 30, 2000.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to extend my congratulations and \nthanks to both Senators Bond and Mikulski for the conference report \nthey are presenting us today. This bill makes constructive strides \ntoward improving the housing situation for many poor and low income \nworking families.\n  Though the Chairman and Ranking Member were under extremely tight \nbudgetary constraints, they stood together and worked hard to bring us \na conference report which restores important funding. They have \npresented us with a strong bill that invests in our nation's low income \nhousing stock and continues our efforts to aid struggling communities \nin their redevelopment efforts.\n  It is my understanding that this bill moved forward with the support \nof\n\n[[Page S12656]]\n\nmembers from both sides of the aisle. I think that the Chairman and \nRanking Member should be commended for this as well. It is notable when \nlegislation receives such even handed, bipartisan support.\n  Let me highlight a few of the programs that received increased \nfunding in this year's appropriations bill.\n  It includes 60,000 new section 8 vouchers to be used in our nation's \nmost needy areas. I cannot express how important these new vouchers are \nto addressing the needs of low income Americans. As the economy soars, \nso do rents in many metropolitan areas, making it nearly impossible for \nlow income families to afford an apartment. A recent report by the Low \nIncome Housing Coalition shows that in no metropolitan area in this \ncountry can a person working at a minimum wage job forty hours a week \nafford the rent on an average two bedroom apartment.\n  There are 5.3 million families that HUD classifies as ``worst case \nhousing needs.'' These are families that live in substandard housing or \npay more than 50% of their income towards rent. Sixty thousand vouchers \nwill not help all of these families, but they are an important step in \nthe direction of alleviating poverty and will be enthusiastically \nreceived by the families that benefit from them.\n  Also included in this bill is funding for the important mark-to-\nmarket plan that will allow HUD to raise section 8 payments to prevent \nlandlords from opting out of the program. In addition, the bill exempts \nthe old preservation deals from restructuring, which saves money and \nhousing. These two provisions are important to preserving affordable \nhousing in our nation's communities.\n  This bill includes an additional $50 million to be used for Community \nDevelopment Block Grants, or CDBG. These funds are used to address the \nneeds of low income neighborhoods in a holistic manner. They have been \na resource for renewal and redevelopment in many cities, including \nBaltimore and other Maryland metropolitan areas, since their creation \nin 1974. I am extremely pleased to see an increased investment in the \nhope that CDBG funds can bring needed assistance to many communities \nacross America.\n  There is also an increase of $55 million to aid the rehabilitation of \ndisabled elderly housing programs. That includes provisions to provide \nsupportive housing for the elderly, service coordinators in elderly \nfacilities, grants to convert elderly housing into assisted living, and \nfunds for section 8 assistance to be used for assisted living \nfacilities. These levels show that we are committed to our low income \nsenior citizens.\n  Lastly, I want to highlight the increased commitment to improve the \npublic housing projects that remain. Over the last few years many \npoliticians have pointed to the failing of public housing, but have not \nprovided the necessary funds to improve those developments. Senators \nBond and Mikulski's bill takes the important and necessary action of \nincreasing the public housing operating fund by $320 million. I look \nforward to seeing and hearing about the new and positive improvements \nthat will occur as a result of this new funding.\n  I will continue in the years to come to press for an increased \ncommitment to housing programs that serve our nations' working and low \nincome families. Overall, the bill we are presented with today is a \ngood bill, with funding for many vital housing programs.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1997, Congress created the Mark-to-\nMarket program, which was designed to preserve the affordability of \nlow-income rental housing and reduce the long-term costs to the Federal \ngovernment. The program is designed to restructure the mortgages for \nHUD insured properties so that they can be supported by market based \nrents.\n  Under the Mark-to-Market program, HUD enters into agreements with \nState and local housing finance agencies, as well as a limited number \nof private firms, called Participating Administrative Entities or PAEs. \nThe PAEs underwrite and recommend the financial restructuring of these \nproperties. Under the agreement, the PAEs determine rent levels, how \nmuch of a new mortgage the property can support with those rents, and \nhow much of a second mortgage HUD will have to hold on the property in \norder to ensure that the restructuring is economically feasible. The \nprogram also allows the housing finance agencies to provide financing \nfor the new first mortgage on the property, even though they have \ninside knowledge of how the agreement is negotiated and structured.\n  However, the legislation creating the program recognizes that a \nconflict of interest can exists where the housing finance agency that \nis charged with restructuring the mortgage provides financing for the \nsame property. In this situation, HUD is to establish guidelines to \nprevent conflicts of interest. Despite this provision, the legislation \nbefore us today requires the Secretary to approve financing by a HFA \nunder the risk sharing program where the financing meets certain terms \nand conditions. Under this language, it is possible that the housing \nfinance agency can gain an unfair advantage over other lenders who want \nto compete to provide financing. This could happen if the housing \nagency has the opportunity to review all submissions for financing and \nstructure its own proposal so that no other lender can compete. In \naddition, property owners will have virtually no voice in determining \nwho provides a mortgage on their property if they wish to stay in the \nprogram.\n  It is the intent of this bill, in the interest of all parties, that \nall lenders be given the opportunity to compete on a level playing \nfield in providing financing. To this end, HUD should exercise its \nauthority under the conflict of interest requirement and undertake an \nindependent review of the financing proposals. This could be \naccomplished, for example, by having the housing finance agency submit \nall lenders' proposed financing packages to HUD and include a statement \njustifying its position on the recommended financing. This independent \nreview will allow the best financing alternative to be used for \nrestructuring and will allow lenders to compete on a level playing \nfield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I must vote against this \nconference report. Once again, I have the unpleasant task of speaking \nbefore my colleagues about unacceptably high funding levels of \nparochial projects throughout this bill. In addition, the conferees \nhave included several legislative provisions that were not in either \nbill, nor were these initiatives considered by either the House or \nSenate before they were summarily added to this bill. Therefore, \ndespite the fact that the bill contains funding for many purposes which \nI strongly support, I oppose its passage because of these objectionable \nprovisions.\n  This bill, in total, contains more than $700 million in low-priority, \nwasteful, and unnecessary spending. This is an unacceptable waste of \nthe taxpayers' hard-earned money, and I will not be a party to \nCongress' pork-barrel spending habits.\n  I very much regret having to oppose a bill that contains critical \nfunding for programs for our Nation's veterans.\n  I would like to point out that I actively supported adding $3 billion \nfor veterans medical health care in this year's appropriations bill. I \ncosponsored several amendments introduced in the Senate, including the \nWellstone amendment, which would have provided an additional $3 billion \nabove the President's VA budget request. Although the Wellstone \namendment failed, the amendment proposed by Senators Byrd and Bond, \nwhich I also supported, passed overwhelmingly, increasing the total \namount of VA funding to $1.7 billion above the President's request.\n  I commend the conferees for keeping the $1.7 billion for essential \nhealth care programs for veterans in the conference report. This \nrepresents the largest annual increase since the Department of Veterans \nAffairs was created. Although I sincerely welcome this increase, I will \ncontinue to do all in my power to find additional money in the budget \nto fund veterans health care at an amount that will guarantee a higher, \nsustainable level of quality health care for all veterans.\n  It is important to note that the level of earmarks and set-asides in \nthe Veterans Affairs section of this conference report is down from \nprevious years. The total value of specific earmarks in the Veterans \nAffairs section of the VA-HUD conference report is $31.3 million, about \none third of the amount that was inserted in this section of the \nSenate-\n\n[[Page S12657]]\n\napproved VA-HUD appropriations funding measure.\n  Certain provisions in this section, however, illustrate that Congress \nstill does not have its priorities in order. For example, it is \ndisturbing to me and many other Senators who stood on the floor of this \nbody to fight for additional funding for veterans benefits to learn \nthat the conferees have agreed to direct some of the critical dollars \nfrom veterans health care to fund wasteful projects like the \n``mothballing'' of four historic buildings in Dayton, Ohio.\n  There are other notable examples of unnecessary items included in the \nconference report. An especially troublesome expense, neither budgeted \nfor nor requested by the Administration for the past eight years, is a \nprovision that directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue \nthe eight-year-old demonstration project involving the Clarksburg, West \nVirginia VAMC and the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia \nUniversity. Several years ago, the VA-HUD appropriations bill contained \na plus-up of $2 million to the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the \nAdministration's line-item veto list--even the Administration concluded \nthat this was truly wasteful.\n  Like the transportation and military construction funding bills, the \nVA-HUD funding bill also includes many construction project additions \nto the President's budget request. For example, the VA-HUD \nappropriations conference report adds $1 million for the advance \nplanning and design of the Lebanon VAMC renovation of patient care \nunits and other enhancements for extended care programs. An additional \n$500,000 was provided for planning national cemeteries in Atlanta, \nGeorgia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; and Sacramento, \nCalifornia. Although all of these areas likely are deserving of \nveterans cemeteries, I just wonder how many other national cemetery \nprojects in other states were leapfrogged to ensure that these states \nreceived the VA's highest priority. This bill directs VA to award a \ncontract for design, architectural, and engineering services in this \nmonth for a new National Cemetery in Lawton (Oklahoma City/Fort Sill), \nOklahoma and also directs the President's fiscal year 2001 budget to \ninclude construction funds for a new National Cemetery in Oklahoma. \nThis is an amazing feat, since this appropriations bill is supposed to \nprovide single-year appropriations, yet is attempting to direct next \nyear's funding, too.\n  The bill also directs the VA to reprogram $11.5 million originally \nappropriated in fiscal year 1998 to renovate Building 9 at the VAMC in \nWaco, Texas, to instead be used for renovation and construction of a \njoint venture cardiovascular institute at the Olin E. Teague VAMC in \nTemple, Texas. This unusual procedure is outside of the established \nreprogramming process--unfortunately, it sends the message to the VA \nthat the money can be reprogrammed ``as long as the money stays in \nTexas.''\n  Other VA construction projects--outside the President's original \nbudget request--include: $3.9 million to convert unfinished space into \nresearch laboratories at the ambulatory care addition of the Harry S. \nTruman VAMC in Columbia, Missouri; $3 million for renovations of the \nresearch building at the Bronx VAMC in Bronx, New York (next door to \nthe prestigious Mount Sinai Hospital); and $500,000 for preparation of \nthe satellite site to expand the National Cemetery at Salisbury, North \nCarolina. Some final egregious examples of unrequested, additional \nspending include the following: the VA is directed to provide $1 \nmillion to the National Technology Transfer Center to establish a pilot \nprogram to assess, market, and license medical technologies researched \nin VA facilities; $750,000 is provided to continue the VA's \nparticipation with the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network; and \nMarshall County, Mississippi, Hardin County Tennessee and Letcher \nCounty, Kentucky were inserted ahead of other remote areas to become \nfederally funded Community Health Care Centers to provide outpatient \nprimary and preventive health care services to veterans in their home \ncommunities. These areas appear to have been added ahead of higher \npriority communities because their interests were well-represented in \nthe Appropriations Conference.\n\n  I am encouraged by the increase in veterans health care funding, and \nif this title of the bill had been separately presented to the Senate, \nI would have wholeheartedly supported it, despite the earmarks and set-\nasides it contains.\n  This title of the bill contains the funding for many programs vital \nin meeting the housing needs of our nation and for the revitalization \nand development of our communities. Many of the programs administered \nby HUD help our nation's families purchase their homes, assist low-\nincome families obtain affordable housing, combat discrimination in the \nhousing market, assist in rehabilitating neighborhoods and help our \nnation's most vulnerable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged--have \naccess to safe and affordable housing.\n  When the Senate debated this bill, I highlighted for my colleagues \nnumerous funding earmarks for specific housing proposals and set asides \ncontained in the Senate version of this bill. Unfortunately, I find \nmyself coming to the floor today to again highlight the numerous \nbudgetary violations which remain or were added to this conference \nreport. The list of projects which received priority billing is quite \nlong but I will highlight a few of the more egregious violations.\n  $3,000,000,000 to Olympic Regional Development Authority, New York \nfor upgrades at Mt. Van Hoevenberg Sports Complex.\n  New language inserted in conference providing $15,000,000 for urban \nempowerment zones.\n  $1,000,000 to the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee for housing \ninfrastructure improvements for the Olympics and Paraolympics.\n  $1,000,000 to Syracuse University in New York for rehabilitation and \ncommunity redevelopment of the Marshall Street Area.\n  Directive language to the Secretary requiring the continuation of \nproviding interest reduction payment in accordance with the existing \nauthorization schedule for Darlinton Manor Apartments, 100-Unit project \nlocated at 606 North 5th Street, Bozeman, Montana, which will continue \nas affordable housing pursuant to a use agreement with the state of \nMontana.\n  In addition to the numerous budgetary violations which this report \ncontains, I am also concerned about the legislative initiatives which \nhave suddenly appeared during conference which were not contained in \nthe Senate or House appropriation bills. The intent of this legislative \nlanguage is certainly laudable--providing safe, quality and affordable \nhousing for seniors and the disabled is and must remain a priority for \nour nation. However, we cannot and should not be passing comprehensive \nlegislation which makes substantial changes to the housing system \nwithout allowing both chambers of Congress to debate and provide \nvaluable input to such an important proposal. Certainly, an issue as \nimportant as meeting the housing needs of our most vulnerable \npopulation, deserves thoughtful deliberation and careful review through \nthe established legislative process and should not be attached at the \nlast moment to a funding conference report. This is not the manner in \nwhich we should be implementing meaningful reform intended to benefit \nthe citizens of our nation.\n  After reviewing the sections funding the Environmental Protection \nAgency, I find that the conferees continued to run rampant in their \npork-barrelling in this section of the bill. There are few areas in \nthis final conference report that clearly indicate the level of \nparochial actions than those targeted in EPA's budget.\n  Just last month, the Senate passed a bill providing funding for \nenvironmental protection programs, which included $207 million in \nunrequested and low-priority earmarks. However, the number of earmarks \nhas seriously inflated in the conference report by $73 million to a new \ngrand pork total of $280 million.\n  I understand that we have critical needs around our country dealing \nwith leaking underground storage tanks, water and wastewater \ninfrastructure, air pollution, pesticide abatement, and other important \nenvironmental issues. Many of the projects identified in this \nconference report are no doubt critical to many communities who are \nforced to deal with these serious environmental threats.\n\n[[Page S12658]]\n\n  I do not question their merit at all. I do question the process by \nwhich the appropriators have made decisions that prioritize certain \nprojects over many others across our nation in such a blatant and \nprovincial manner. For example, $1 million is earmarked for the Animal \nWaste Management Consortium that will benefit the University of \nMissouri, Iowa State University, North Carolina State University, \nMichigan State University, Oklahoma State University, and Purdue \nUniversity to deal with animal waste management. Again, this may very \nwell be important, but there is little background provided in the \nreport to explain the national priority interest of earmarking a \nmillion dollars to deal with animal waste management in six specific \nstates.\n  EPA has an established process by which the agency administers grant \nand loan programs that are supposed to be awarded on a competitive and \npriority basis. However, these guidelines are simply thrown out the \nwindow when the conferees direct the agency through earmarks and \ndirective language to give priority consideration to various states and \nprojects rather than undergoing a competitive review. Despite stated \nbudget constraints, the conferees found a way to include an additional \n$68 million more in wastewater infrastructure funding than previously \nagreed to by both houses for locale-specific earmarks.\n  I know first-hand that many of my constituents in Arizona have a \ngreat need to improve their water and wastewater systems, but they will \nbe forced to wait in line while other projects are given priority \ntreatment through this conference report.\n  Clearly, no title of the bill was left unsullied by pork-barrel \nspending. For the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), there is \n$10 million available to the State of California for pilot projects to \ndemonstrate seismic retrofit technology. For the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration (NASA), this Report also includes earmarks of \nmoney for locality-specific projects such as $3 million for the Adler \nPlanetarium in Chicago, Illinois, $14 million for infrastructure needs \nat the University of Missouri, Columbia, and $10 million for the \nRegional Application Center in Cayuga County, New York. For example, \nthe National Science Foundation (NSF), there is $60 million for the \nPlant Genome Research Program. When will this outrageous pork-barrel \nspending stop?\n  The conferees have also included legislative initiatives that were \nclearly out of scope of the conference. The bill includes a general \nprovision authorizing NASA to carry out a new program to demonstrate \nthe commercial feasibility and economic viability of private business \noperations involved in the International Space Station. This provision \nhas not had the benefit of consideration in any hearings or public and \nprivate industry discussions. It would seem logical for private sector \nviews to be considered if we hope to attract them to this venture.\n  The bill also shifts the way NASA will operate both the space station \nand the space shuttle program. We have already heard from some small \ncompanies that this program will put NASA and use of the shuttle for \ncommercial payloads in direct competition. We do not want to stifle the \ncreativity and ingenuity of these small launch companies, nor should we \nrely upon NASA to provide all the answers to our space problems, \nespecially in the area of commercialization of space. I think NASA has \nenough problems with the space station, including the fact that it is \ntwo years behind schedule and $9 billion over budget.\n  Finally, the conferees have included two provisions related to \ncommercial space launch indemnification extensions and insurance and \nindemnification for experimental vehicles. Neither of these provisions \nwere included in either of the appropriations bills and they clearly \nfall within the jurisdiction of the appropriate authorizing committees.\n  The appropriators should abide by the rules and procedures of the \nSenate and refrain from usurping the power of the authorizing \ncommittees, in fact, the rest of the Senate, by including these \nlegislative provisions in a conference report written behind closed \ndoors.\n  I am gravely disappointed that I am unable to vote for this \nconference report. This measure contains funding for many critical \nprograms which help provide important resources to our communities. It \nincludes vitally important funding to fulfill our obligation to our \nnation's veterans, those who fought for the peace and security we enjoy \ntoday. Included in this bill is funding for section 202 housing which I \nknow most, if not all, of my colleagues would agree helps meet the \nneeds of America's seniors by ensuring they have homes which are safe, \naffordable and accommodates the demands of aging. Also included is \nvaluable funding for section 811 which helps disabled individuals have \nan opportunity to live independently as part of a community in quality \nand reasonably priced homes.\n  Because of the egregious amount of pork-barrel spending in this bill \nand the addition of legislative provisions clearly outside the scope of \nthe conference, I must oppose its passage. I regret doing so because of \nthe many important and worthy programs included in the conference \nagreement, but I cannot endorse the continued waste of taxpayer dollars \non special-interest programs, nor can I acquiesce in bypassing the \nnormal authorizing process for legislative initiatives.\n  Mr, President, the full list of the objectional provisions is on my \nSenate website.\n\n\n                high production volume chemical testing\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to confirm my \nunderstanding with Chairman Bond regarding the conference report \nconcerning the HPV chemical testing program. My understanding regarding \nthe ``agreement'' is that it is actually a letter from EPA asking \nparticipants in the challenge program to make certain changes, and not \nin fact an ``agreement'' to do so. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And is it also correct that by using the word \n``consistent,'' the conferees did not intend or imply that the test \nrule must be the exact equivalent of the voluntary part of the program \nin terms of the actual testing requirements?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                       warrior hotel edi project\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understood that the conference report \nwas supposed to contain the following language concerning an economic \ndevelopment initiative item approved in the FY 99 VA-HUD Appropriations \nmeasure: ``The description of the Warrior Hotel EDI project in the FY \n99 HUD-VA Appropriations report is modified to the following: $1 \nmillion for the restoration of the Warrior Hotel in Sioux City, IA, to \nbe used for adult day care and other services or uses consistent with \nthe revitalization of the Central Business District''. Unfortunately, \nthis language was inadvertently left out of the report.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Iowa is correct, the language was \ninadvertently left out of the FY 2000 conference report and it was our \nintention to have the language included.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I concur with the remarks of Chairman Bond and Senator \nHarkin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I offer my strong support for the fiscal \nyear 2000 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report and am pleased to \njoin my Senate colleagues in passing this important piece of \nlegislation today. Rural America, and my state of South Dakota, is in \nthe midst of an affordable housing shortage crisis. According to \nreports, 5.3 million Americans pay more then 50 percent in their annual \nincome to rent or living in substandard conditions. This is \nunacceptable for a society as wealthy as ours, and we must make real \nprogress now to improve housing conditions for all Americans.\n  Although I supported the VA-HUD Appropriations Bill on the Senate \nfloor last month, I was disappointed that the bill failed to provide \nadditional Section 8 rental assistance for the thousands of American \nfamilies that desperately need it. Additional Section 8 rental \nassistance, like that proposed by the President, would have allowed 321 \nfamilies in South Dakota to receive Section 8 vouchers to help them \nafford adequate housing. In addition, I objected to the elimination of \nthe Community Builders program in the original bill. In South Dakota, \nCommunity Builders\n\n[[Page S12659]]\n\nhave worked with local governments and housing authorities to provide \nneeded rental assistance statewide.\n  I joined my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Banking and Housing \nCommittee in writing to Chairman Bond and Ranking Member Mikulski, \nasking them to fund additional Section 8 vouchers and restore the \nCommunity Builders program during their negotiations with conferees \nfrom the House of Representatives. I am pleased that Chairman Bond and \nRanking Member Mikulski were able to secure funding for an additional \n60,000 Section 8 vouchers. The VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report \nalso reiterates the need for Community Builders in HUD to help bring \nimportant HUD programs to an increasing number of Americans.\n  This legislation will help address the affordable housing shortage in \nmy state of South Dakota. Currently, South Dakota families in need of \nhousing assistance spend an average of 9 months on a waiting list for \ncurrent Section 8 vouchers. While not helping all of those in need, the \nadditional Section 8 vouchers contained in the VA-HUD Appropriations \nConference Report will begin to shorten the time it takes for low-\nincome families to receive much needed assistance.\n  Community Builders will also be able to continue to work with South \nDakota communities to increase access for affordable housing. In the \npast, Community Builders worked with the Northeastern Council of \nGovernments in South Dakota to spread information to several \nnortheastern counties on the services that HUD provides, and how to \naccess these services. Community Builders have facilitated FHA loans \nfor the construction of affordable homes in Rapid City, while also \nhelping the Sioux Empire Housing Partnership become a HUD-approved \nhousing counseling agency. The Community Builder program has begun to \naddress the housing needs in historically underserved communities, \nincluding the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Community Builders have \nenabled tribal leaders to better utilize HUD's programs to the benefit \nof one of the most poor populations in the nation.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Bond and Ranking Member Mikulski for \nimproving the VA-HUD Appropriations bill despite the strict budget \nconstraints the committee faced. I believe it is a wise investment in \nour country's future when we ensure that our working families have \nadequate housing, and I look forward to continue working with my \ncolleagues to find ways to help South Dakota families and families \nacross the nation address their housing needs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the conference agreement on \nappropriations for fiscal year 2000 for the departments of Veterans \nAffairs, Housing and Urban Development, and other independent agencies.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond for their hard work and \ncommitment to providing adequate health care for our veterans and \nhousing for our citizens.\n  The conference agreement provides $19 billion for veterans health \ncare, $1.7 billion more than the President requested. I am pleased that \nCongress has made a commitment to take care of our veterans. I do wish \nthat we had agreed to Senator Wellstone's amendment to provide $20.3 \nbillion, but I believe that our nation's veterans will be cared for \nunder this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that housing needs will also be \naddressed with this legislation. First, the agreement provides a much \nneeded 60,000 additional Section 8 vouchers. A far greater need for \nvouchers exists in California, let alone across the nation. But this is \na much acknowledged vital step in the right direction towards \naddressing the housing needs for the poorest of Americans. Second, \npublic housing, Housing for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), and homeless \nassistance programs will all experience an increase in funding. Third, \nthe agreement also provides additional tools for preserving existing \naffordable housing. Specifically, HUD will be provided with significant \nnew legal authority to address the Section 8 ``opt-out'' crisis--\nincluding longer contract renewal terms. Last, the agreement exhibits \nstrong support for HUD's Community Builder program. This program has \nbeen a key component of HUD's reinvention efforts and is working. I \nreceived numerous letters from elected officials and nonprofit \norganizations throughout California expressing support for the \nCommunity Builder program and am grateful that the conference committee \nagreed to reinstate earlier cuts to the program.\n  The conference agreement also addresses other key areas, such as the \nenvironment and space exploration and research. The Environmental \nProtection Agency will receive $7.59 billion to carry out its important \nfunctions. The National Aeronautical and Space Administration is funded \nat $13.65 billion. I am pleased that the conferees agreed to restore \nthe drastic cuts in NASA programs that were in the House version of the \nbill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I call for the yeas and nays on the VA-HUD \nappropriations conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2299 to amendment No. 2298.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Thomas Paine, the famed orator of the \nAmerican Revolution, once offered an explanation for why corrupt \nsystems last so long. He said:\n\n       A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a \n     superficial appearance of being right, and raises, at first, \n     a formidable cry in defense of custom.\n\n  That is certainly true of the way we pay for campaigns in this \ncountry. Our reliance on special interest money to run political \ncampaigns is such an old habit that for a long time it had the \nsuperficial appearance of being right but not anymore.\n  While there is still a vocal minority who deny it, a clear majority \nin this Congress, and an overwhelming majority of the American people, \nknow that our current campaign finance system is broken.\n  The American people understand that special-interest money too often \ndetermines who runs, who wins, and how they govern.\n  Opponents of change tell us that no one cares much about campaign \nfinance reform.\n  I believe they're mistaken.\n  I believe the tide has turned.\n  Instead of hearing a ``formidable cry in defense of custom,'' to use \nTom Paine's expression, what we are hearing now is a growing demand for \nchange.\n  One of the newest voices demanding change belongs to a group of more \nthan 200 CEOs of major corporations. They call themselves the Committee \nfor Economic Development, and many of them are Republican. They're \npushing for a ban on soft money because, they say, they're ``tired of \nbeing shaken down'' by politicians looking for campaign contributions.\n  They, like the rest of America, will be watching this debate, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Another reason I believe the tide has turned is because this election \ncycle has gotten off to such an ominous start.\n  At both the Presidential and congressional level, we are on pace to \nshatter all previous records.\n  During the first six months of this year, soft money donations--the \nunlimited, unregulated contributions to political parties--were already \n80 percent above where they were at this point in the last Presidential \nelection cycle, in 1995.\n  There really are no limits any more, Mr. President. We all know that.\n  The current system is more loophole than law.\n  Opponents argue that our Constitution forbids us from correcting the \nworst abuses in the system. I disagree with their pinched \ninterpretation of our Constitution. In any case, I believe our \nconscience demands that we at least try to fix the system.\n  And so during this debate, Senator Torricelli and I, and others, will \noffer the Shays-Meehan plan.\n  As I said, I have great admiration and respect for what Senator \nFeingold and Senator McCain have attempted to achieve. But I believe we \ncan--and must--go further than their bill now allows.\n  Shays-Meehan is fair. It does not place one party or another at an \nadvantage. It treats incumbents and challengers in both parties fairly.\n  Shays-Meehan is bipartisan.\n  Shays-Meehan is passable. It has already passed the House. It is \nsignable. The President will sign it into law.\n  Most importantly, Shays-Meehan is comprehensive. Not only does it ban \nunregulated ``soft money'' to political parties--the biggest loophole \nin the current system--it also prevents soft money from being re-\nchanneled to outside groups for phony ``issue ads.''\n  This is critically important, Mr. President.\n  Spending on sham ``issue ads'' by advocacy groups and special \ninterests more than doubled between the '96 and '98 election cycles--to \nsomewhere between $275 million and $340 million.\n  A 1997 study by the respected Annenberg Public Policy Center at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania found that phony ``issue ads'' are nearly \nidentical to campaign ads--with two exceptions. The ``issue ads'' are \nmore attack-oriented and personal. And, it is harder to identify the \nsponsor. These ads epitomize the negative campaigning--without any \naccountability--the public so dislikes.\n  Shays-Meehan closes the ``issue ad'' loophole. It does so by applying \nexisting rules to ads targeting specific candidates that are run by \nadvocacy groups within 60 days of an election.\n  It does not silence anyone. It merely says, if you want to \nparticipate in the election process, you have to follow the rules.\n  In addition to closing the ``soft money'' and ``issue ad'' loopholes, \nShays-Meehan makes two other important changes.\n  First, it provides for expanded and speedier disclosure of both \ncampaign contributions and expenditures--plus, stiffer penalties for \nanyone who violates the requirements.\n  Second, it bans direct and indirect foreign contributions to \npolitical campaigns.\n  Shays-Meehan won a bipartisan majority in the other body, Mr. \nPresident. It deserves the same in this Senate.\n  When a person gives money to a judge who is deciding his case, we \ncall that bribery. But when special interests give money to politicians \nwho vote on bills that help or hurt them, we call that ``business as \nusual.''\n  Some mistakenly call it ``free speech.''\n  Let's be very clear: Shays-Meehan is not an attack on free speech. It \nadvances free speech by ensuring that those with the biggest checkbooks \nare not the only voices that are heard.\n  Shays-Meehan represents extraordinarily modest reforms.\n  It doesn't fix every problem with our current system. But it bans the \nworst excesses.\n  It is not a panacea. But it is a credible and necessary first step in \nrebuilding people's trust in government.\n  I have no doubt we will hear a great deal over the next few days \nabout abuses of the current system.\n\n[[Page S12661]]\n\n  There are abuses--on both sides of the aisle. That's why we're having \nthis debate.\n  But it's not enough just to decry the abuses. If you're really \noutraged by the abuses, fix the system that invites them.\n  Defenders of the status quo have tried to dissuade some of us from \nsupporting real reform by warning how much it might cost us in lost \ncampaign contributions.\n  What about how much the current system costs us in lost credibility?\n  Listen to this quote:\n\n       Senators and Representatives, faced incessantly with the \n     need to raise ever more funds to fuel their campaigns, can \n     scarcely avoid weighing every decision against the question \n     ``How will this affect my fundraising prospects.'' rather \n     than ``How will this affect the national interest?''\n\n  Do you know who said that?\n  It wasn't some Pollyanna progressive.\n  That was Barry Goldwater, in 1995.\n  And even if we don't make those kinds of calculations, it doesn't \nmatter. No one has to prove that money influences our votes. It's \ndamaging enough that people believe money influences our votes.\n  There are other ways the current system costs us as well. Like the \ncost of endless fundraising. The demeaning, demanding money chase.\n  In 1998, it cost an average of $4.9 million to run a successful \nSenate campaign.\n  To raise that kind of money, you have to bring nearly $16,000 a week, \nevery week, for 6 years. That is the minimum it takes. Some people have \nto raise twice that much.\n  And we all know what that means. It means we spend hours and hours in \ncampaign offices, dialing for dollars, instead of doing what people \nsent us here to do.\n  It means running to fundraisers every night--sometimes two and three \na night--instead of working on problems that affect families--or maybe \njust having dinner every once in a while with our own families.\n  But the biggest cost of the current system is the cynicism it \nproduces in people.\n  The American people are disgusted, and they feel disenfranchised, by \nthe current system.\n  Every election cycle, the amount of money goes up, and voting goes \ndown.\n  Defenders of the status quo say we need soft money for ``party \nbuilding'' activities--like ``get out the vote'' drives.\n  If you really want to get out the vote, get the money out of \npolitics!\n  Pass Shays-Meehan.\n  We expect opponents will use every procedural trick and advantage \nthey can think of to try to block any real reform. They will offer \namendments not to strengthen our proposal, but to sink it.\n  They should know: The American people understand that game. They can \ntell the differences between protecting principles, and protecting \npartisan advantage.\n  We make this pledge at the beginning of this debate: If Shays-Meehan \ndoes not pass, we will do everything we can to build a coalition for \nreal reform.\n  We will work with Senator Feingold and Senator McCain to strengthen \ntheir proposal and make it, once again, a comprehensive plan.\n  When you read the history of campaign finance, one of the names that \nstands out is Mark Hanna. U.S. Senator. Wealthy businessman. Ohio \npolitical boss. And head, at the turn of the last century, of his \nnational political party.\n  Mark Hanna is widely credited with being the father of systemic \ncampaign fundraising techniques.\n  He introduced the concept, for instance, of regularly assessing \nbusinesses for contributions to his party, based on their ``share in \nthe general prosperity.''\n  He also introduced the first modern political advertising operation.\n  In 1895, Mark Hanna remarked that ``there are two things that are \nimportant in politics. The first is money--and I can't remember what \nthe second one is.''\n  Mr. President, I believe Senator Hanna got it wrong. Money isn't the \nmost important thing in politics. Integrity is.\n  Integrity is essential to democracy. Without integrity we lose public \nconfidence. And without public confidence, a democratic government \nloses its ability to function.\n  We all know--whether we will admit it or not--that the current system \nis broken.\n  I hope we can work together. I hope we can come up with a \ncomprehensive, workable plan to fix it.\n  The currency of politics should be ideas--not cash.\n\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Bryan, Jeff Bingaman, Tim \n           Johnson, Harry Reid, Blanche L. Lincoln, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Jay Rockefeller, Richard J. Durbin, Daniel \n           K. Akaka, Ron Wyden, Byron L. Dorgan, Tom Harkin, and \n           Barbara Mikulski.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the amendment offered by the minority leader and the Senator from \nNew Jersey. As you know, this amendment is almost identical to the \nShays-Meehan bill that passed the House of Representatives by a \ndecisive, bipartisan vote of 252-177. It is time for the Senate to show \nthe same courage and pass this important legislation.\n  as I enter my eleventh political campaign and my fourth California \nstatewide election, I am one who knows a little about the dynamics of \ncampaigning in expensive races. In the 1990 race for Governor, I had to \nraise about $23 million. In the first race the Senate, $8 million; in \nthe second race, $14 million. In 1994, my opponent spent nearly $30 \nmillion in his attempt to defeat me. My experiences have led me to \nbelieve that the current campaign finance system is badly flawed and in \nneed of overhaul.\n  Since 1976, the first election after the last major revision of \ncampaign finance laws, the average cost of a winning Senate race went \nfrom $609,000 to $3.8 million in 1998. The average cost for a winning \nHouse candidate rose from $87,000 in 1976 to $679,000 in 1998.\n  Campaigns in 2000 are very different than they were in 1976. Clearly, \nour campaign finance system must be reformed to reflect these \ndifferences.\n  I have been a strong supporter of federal campaign finance reform \nsince my first election to the Senate. Campaigns simply cost too much \nand it is long past time that Congress does something about it.\n  I believe very strongly that this will be the final real opportunity \nthis millennium to make significant structural reforms to our campaign \nfinance system. Two of the fundamental changes that I believe must be \nmade are a complete ban on soft money contributions to political \nparties and making independent campaign ads subject to contribution \nlimits and disclosure requirements as are a candidate's campaign ads.\n  While I have a great deal of respect for the persistence the Senators \nfrom Arizona and Wisconsin have demonstrated in pushing the Senate to \nact on campaign finance reform, I am concerned that the underlying \nbill, S. 1953, is too narrow to constitute a real reform of the \ncampaign finance system. Banning soft money without addressing issue \nadvocacy will simply redirect the flow of undisclosed money in \ncampaigns. Instead of giving soft money to\n\n[[Page S12662]]\n\npolitical parties, the same dollars will be turned into ``independent'' \nads.\n  The issues of soft money ban and independent advertisements go hand \nin hand and one can not be addressed without the other.\n\n\n                             soft money ban\n\n  The ability of corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals to give \nunlimited amounts of soft money to political parties is the largest \nsingle loophole in the current campaign finance structure. The lack of \nrestrictions on soft money enables anonymous individuals and anonymous \norganizations to play a major role in campaigns. They can hit hard and \nno one knows from where the hit is coming. The form that soft money is \nincreasingly taking is negative, attack ads that distort, mislead, and \nmisrepresent a candidates position on issues. These ads have become the \nscourge of the electoral process.\n  This is the third time in as many years that the Senate has had the \nopportunity to pass meaningful campaign finance legislation. Last year, \na minority of Senators blocked its passage and they appear poised to do \nso again.\n  The consequence of this action is clear: voters will continue to \nbecome disenchanted with the political process and the flow of money \ninto campaigns and the access it buys will continue to grow.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. According to the Federal Election \nCommission, the Republican party raised $131 million in soft money \nduring the 1998 election cycle. That is a 149 percent increase over the \nlast mid-term election in 1994. The Democratic party is not much \nbetter. We raised $91.5 million, a 89 percent increase.\n  Soft money contributions are continuing to rise. In the first 6 \nmonths of this year, Republicans raised $30.9 million. 42 percent more \nthan in the first six months of the 1997-98 election cycle. Democrats \nraised $26.4 million, a 93 percent increase.\n  One organization, Public Citizen, estimates that soft money spending \nthis election cycle will exceed $500 million. That is double the amount \nspent in the last presidential election cycle and six times as much as \nin 1992.\n  At some point this escalation of campaign spending has got to stop. \nWe simply cannot continue down this path. A complete ban on soft money \ncontributions to political parties is the first and most basic way to \nreduce the amount of money in our campaigns.\n\n\n                             issue advocacy\n\n  That brings me to the other disturbing trend in the American \npolitical system: the rise of issue advocacy. This campaign loophole \nallows unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to influence \nelections without being subject to disclosure or expenditure \nrestrictions.\n  During last year's debate, I mentioned a study released by the \nAnnenberg Public Policy Center that estimated that during the 1995-96 \nelection cycle independent groups spent between $135 and $150 million \non issue advocacy.\n  The Center has done a similar study for the 1997-98 cycle and the \nresult is quite disturbing. They estimate that the amount spent on \nissue advocacy more than doubled to between $275 million and $340 \nmillion.\n  These ads do not use the so-called ``magic words'' that the Supreme \nCourt identified as express advocacy and, therefore, are not subject to \nFEC regulation. The Annenberg study found, however, that 53.4 percent \nof the issue ads mentioned a candidate up for election.\n  The Center found another unfortunate twist to issue advocacy. Prior \nto September 1, 1998, that is in the first 22 months of the election \ncycle, only 35.3 percent of issue ads mentioned a candidate and 81.3 \npercent of the ads referred to a piece of legislation or a regulatory \nissue.\n  After September 1, 1998, during the last 2 months of the campaign, a \ndramatic shift occurred. The proportion of ads naming specific \ncandidates rose to 80.1 percent and those mentioning legislation fell \nto 21.6 percent.\n\n  A similar shift can be seen in terms of attack ads. Prior to \nSeptember 1, 33.7 percent of all ads were attack oriented. After \nSeptember 1, over half were.\n  These findings clearly demonstrate that as election day gets closer, \nissue ads become more candidate oriented and more negative. This kind \nof unregulated attack advertisements are poisoning the process and \ndriving voters away from the polls.\n  The amendment offered by the minority leader defines ``express \nadvocacy'' communications as advocating election or defeat of candidate \nby: First, using explicit phrases, words, or slogans that have no other \nreasonable meaning than influence elections; second, referring to a \ncandidate in a paid radio or TV broadcast ad that runs within 60 days \nof election; or third, expressing unmistakable, unambiguous election \nadvocacy.\n  This provision draws a clear line between true issue advertising and \nelectioneering activities. It is an important part of any real reform \neffort and I applaud the minority leader for seeing that we have an \nopportunity to vote on it.\n\n\n                              other issues\n\n  This amendment also contains a number of important issues that are \nnot contained in the underlying bill. I understand the sponsors of the \nbill removed them in an attempt to force a straight up or down vote on \nthe soft money ban. I do feel, however, that some of these provisions \nwill significantly improve the campaign finance system and are worth \nmentioning.\n  The bill mandates electronic filing; allows the FEC to conduct random \naudits of campaigns within 12 months of an election; makes it easier \nfor the FEC to initiate enforcement action; and increases penalties for \nknowing and willful violations of election law.\n  This amendment would lower the threshold for disclosure of \ncontributions from $200 to $50. It would prevent candidates from \ndepositing contributions of $200 if the disclosure requirements are not \ncomplete. It would also require the FEC to post contribution \ninformation on the Internet within 24 hours of receipt.\n  These are commonsense steps to making our elections more open to the \npublic. Voters are increasingly feeling cut out of the political \nprocess. By allowing an open window into our campaigns, we can begin \nthe process of reconnecting with voters.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to again thank the Senators from \nArizona and Wisconsin. Without their leadership on this issue we would \nnot have come as far as we have.\n  This body is now faced with a choice. We have been at this same point \nseveral times in the last couple of years and each time we have failed \nto act and each time the American public has grown more cynical and \nlost more confidence in their government.\n  With the passing of every election, it becomes more and more clear \nthat our campaign system desperately needs reform. I remain hopeful \nthat this is the year that Congress can finally come together in \nsupport of legislation that brings about a real improvement in our \ncampaign system. Let's make the first election of the twenty-first \ncentury one of which we can be proud. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support this \namendment at this time. I want to make it clear why.\n  The amendment would essentially restore all of the provisions of S. \n26, which is the original McCain-Feingold legislation to this bill. I \nstill support those provisions and strongly believe that most, if not \nall, should be enacted into law. Now is not the time to do so.\n  My good friend, Russ Feingold, and I spent much time debating as to \nhow we could move forward on the subject of campaign finance reform. \nWe, along with many others who have supported this effort for many \nyears, came to the conclusion that some reform is better than no \nreform. Unfortunately, if this amendment is adopted, a political point \nwill be made, but reform will be doomed, and the sponsors of this \npresent amendment are very well aware of that.\n  We all know there are 52 votes for S. 26. We all know that. We went \nthrough a long period of debate and amending. We know there are 52 \nvotes. Tell me where the additional 8 votes are for S. 26, and I will \nbe the first to sign on and support this.\n  I ask my dear friends who just propounded what is basically McCain-\nFeingold, where are the votes? I think the answer is obvious.\n  What we have tried to do in proposing a ban on soft money and a \ncodification of that is to start a process\n\n[[Page S12663]]\n\nwhich has succeeded in this great deliberative body over many years \nwith amendments and disposal of amendments, up or down, and improving \nthe bill but letting the Senate work its will. We have already picked \nup one additional vote. I am told there are other Members on this side \nof the aisle who are considering supporting this legislation.\n  But it is also clear that those same people who are leaning towards \nsupporting would not vote for S. 26 in its entirety because of their \nstrongly held--although I don't agree, I respect their views--view that \nthe independent campaign aspect of the original McCain-Feingold has \nconstitutional difficulties associated with it.\n  We know the facts. We need 60 votes to prevail, and 52, while a \nmajority, is not enough and will not be until the rules of the Senate \nare changed where 51 votes are necessary for passage.\n  For some time, I hoped that my colleagues who oppose reform would \nallow a majority in both bodies to prevail and do what the vast \nmajority of the American public desires. But the opponents of reform, \ndefenders of the status quo, won't cede their rights.\n  I have learned from previous debates on other matters not to let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good. The bill before the Senate represents \na modest step but a very important step forward.\n  I want to emphasize that point again. If we can pass the underlying \nbill, we will have made an extremely important and vitally needed step \nforward.\n  There is no observer of this issue of campaign finance reform who \ndoes not disagree that banning of soft money would have an important \nand salutary effect on the evils and ills of the present campaign \nfinance system. There is no objective observer, whether they are for or \nagainst campaign finance reform, who would deny that the single act \nabout allowing soft money would have a significant effect on the \npresent system.\n  Do I personally desire that a more comprehensive bill be passed into \nlaw? Yes. In my 16 years in the Congress, I have learned to be a \nrealist.\n  Simply put, if this amendment is accepted, campaign finance reform \nwill be dead. There will be no reform this year and most likely next \nyear. During that period, I am sure that more loopholes in the current \nsystem will be found and exploited. Public cynicism will have grown \nand, unfortunately, nothing will have changed except the same political \npoints will have been made once again and, undoubtedly, more and more \nmoney will be awash in our political process.\n  The New York Times had it right on 14 October. Let me quote:\n       An important but little-noticed boost was given to campaign \n     finance reform in the Senate this week. Sam Brownback of \n     Kansas became the eighth Republican to break with his party's \n     leadership and support the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban, \n     scheduled for debate today. There are now 53 votes to choke \n     off a Republican-led filibuster and pass the bill, only seven \n     votes short of what is needed. The pressure is mounting on \n     other Republicans to support reform. But amid these favorable \n     developments, a move by Robert Torricelli and some other \n     Democratic supporters of reform could undercut the cause.\n       The risk is posed by a Democratic attempt to block Senators \n     John McCain and Russell Feingold from advancing a stripped-\n     down version of their reform legislation. The new McCain-\n     Feingold bill would omit a section preventing independent \n     groups from raising unlimited money for sham campaign ads two \n     months before an election. Some Republicans say that because \n     that section threatens free speech, they cannot go along with \n     the central objective of reform, which is to ban unlimited \n     donations to campaigns waged by political parties. Shrinking \n     the bill to a simple soft-money ban for parties has paid off. \n     Senator Brownback is on board and other Senate Republicans \n     may follow.\n       Mr. Torricelli and the Democratic Senate leader, Tom \n     Daschle, are nonetheless determined today to scrap the new \n     McCain-Feingold bill and substitute the original bill, with \n     the limits on independent groups. This is a serious tactical \n     mistake that raises questions about the Democrats' commitment \n     to campaign finance reform. They ought to know that the bill \n     they are pushing does not have the votes to break a \n     filibuster, whereas the revised McCain-Feingold bill has a \n     chance of getting them.\n       It would be especially grievous if their move played into \n     the destructive tactics of Senator Mitch McConnell of \n     Kentucky and other Republican foes of reform. Mr. McConnell \n     might even try to deliver enough votes for the Democratic \n     move, allowing it to pass because in the end the bill in that \n     form will surely die.\n       Some Democrats, noting that the House passed its broader \n     Shays-Meehan reform last month, warn that a narrower bill in \n     the Senate will not survive either. But Mr. Brownback's \n     courageous move makes it worth a try.\n\n  Mr. President, I think the New York Times has it right. I think we \nshould determine that this would be viewed by many as a cynical ploy \nwhich would assure the failure of campaign finance reform.\n  I believe we need to vote down this amendment, return to what has \ngiven those who have been laboring on this issue for many years, some \noptimism, and to go back to a process where there are amendments on the \nspecific issues. If we correctly debate and amend this issue, each one \nof those provisions of the original provisions of McCain-Feingold will \nbe brought up for consideration, voted, and the body will work its \nwill.\n  It is abundantly clear that if this amendment is adopted, it is the \nend of campaign finance reform. Have no doubt about the effect of this \namendment. No one should have any doubt about the effect of this \namendment. I hope that is well understood by Americans all over this \ncountry who have committed themselves, people such as ``Granny D,'' who \nyesterday visited with me and Senator Feingold. She has walked across \nthis country. People have committed themselves to reforming this \nsystem. People such as her all over America deserve better than what is \nbeing done with this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, every Senator who has taken the floor \nhas given the appropriate compliments to Senator Feingold and Senator \nMcCain. I will be no exception. Congress has been considering campaign \nfinance reform for more than a decade. There have been, by my \nestimation, 3,000 speeches made on the floor of the Senate for campaign \nfinance reform, some 6,500 pages of Congressional Record, 300 pieces of \nlegislation. Indeed, we would not be at this moment without Senator \nFeingold or Senator McCain. They deserve that credit.\n  I found their arguments in recent years so persuasive that I am today \njoining Senator Daschle in presenting their own legislation. The \noriginal McCain-Feingold bill, which found its way to the House of \nRepresentatives, is before the Senate now as the Shays-Meehan \nlegislation. Similar in content and purpose, it is comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Regarding advocacy of that reform, I take a second place to no Member \nin my years in the Congress. I have never voted against campaign \nfinance reform, and I never will. I believe the integrity of this \nsystem of government and the confidence of the American people is at \nissue. It is not by chance that only a third of the American people are \nparticipating in some elections. Even in the choice of the Presidency \nof the United States, with those not registered and those not choosing \nto vote in many of our localities and States, half of the American \npeople are not participating. It is not that they do not recognize the \nchoice is important. I do not believe they have a lack of confidence in \nour country. They do not respect the process because they believe they \ndo not have an equal position, and it is money that is the heart of \nthat problem.\n  When we entered into this new phase of campaign finance reform 2 \nyears ago, along with most Members of this institution, I had great \nambitions for how far we could go with reform. Indeed, in private \nconversation, almost every Member of this Senate knows the fundamentals \nof comprehensive reform. We started with such ambition. We were going \nto subject all independent advocacy groups in issue advertising to the \nrules of the FEC. We were going to require full and immediate \ndisclosure by all contributors. We were going to ban soft money to the \npolitical parties. We were going to prohibit foreign interests. We were \ngoing to reduce the cost of television time. We even discussed the \nsubsidies of mail to inform voters.\n  One by one almost every one of these reforms has been eliminated from \nthe legislation. Political cultures in all of our States are different. \nIn my State, in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, and \nCalifornia, I don't believe\n\n[[Page S12664]]\n\nreal campaign finance reform is possible without reducing the cost of \ntelevision advertising. There is a reason for the spiraling rise of \ncampaign spending; it is the cost of television advertising. In each of \nthe large metropolitan areas, 90 percent of the money goes to feed the \ntelevision networks. That was the first reform to be eliminated.\n  Then there was the advocacy of subsidized mail. It went the way of \npublic finance--one by one by one. Yet, because the need for reform is \nso overwhelming and the public confidence is so much in question, I \njoined in the last Congress with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold \nand reluctantly supported their legislation. Although I believe these \ncritical provisions for the reduced cost of television advertising were \nessential for reform in my area of the country, I joined in support of \nthe McCain-Feingold. That was to be followed by the House of \nRepresentatives which reached the same judgment in a historic vote for \nShays-Meehan.\n  That brings the Senate to this moment. In a frustration I share with \nother advocates of campaign finance reform, the mantra of the day has \nbecome: Do something, do anything. Pass some legislation. Call it \nreform. Let's put the problem behind us.\n  If only it were so easy.\n  The new legislation presented by Senators McCain and Feingold has a \nsingle objective: to eliminate soft money fundraising from Democratic \nand Republican Parties. It is a worthwhile objective, but it does raise \nthe prospect that if passed it will eliminate the chance to have any \nfurther campaign finance reform. If history is any guide, every decade \nwe get one chance to redesign this system. We are largely still \ngoverned by the Watergate reforms of 1974. Through a series of court \nrulings and FEC decisions, they clearly are no longer producing a \nsystem that was once envisioned. If we institute but this single \nchange, we will not create a new system of our design but, in my \njudgment, be governed by the law of unintended consequences.\n  Let's look for a moment at this new national campaign system. If \nSenator Daschle and I fail and the House of Representatives legislation \nin Shays-Meehan is rejected and instead we adopt this very narrow \nreform as envisioned by Senators McCain and Feingold, we eliminate soft \nmoney fundraising by the political parties, but it is maintained for \nissue advocacy and independent expenditures.\n  The principal rise in campaign advertising in recent years is not the \npolitical parties; it is this independent advocacy expenditure. This \nchart tells the story. In 1998, the Democratic and Republican Parties \nspent $64 million in issue advocacy spending; nonparty advocacy groups \nspent $276 million, rising at a rate of 300 percent cycle to cycle.\n  In my hand I have the list of 70 advocacy groups. It begins \nalphabetically with the AFL-CIO and ends with the Vietnam Veterans. In \nbetween are many organizations I support and believe have a worthwhile \ncontribution to the national political debate; some I note I do not \nbelieve have great contributions to the political debate. But they are \nall heard--in the last election cycle, $276 million worth of advocacy.\n  The legislation before the Senate by Senators Feingold and McCain \ndoes nothing about the expenditures, nothing. Nothing. Many exist as \nnonprofit tax-free organizations under the IRS Code. From whom they \nraise money is unknown. As to the sources of their contributions, no \none in this Senate could attest. They often exist before the public eye \nas names that misrepresent their purpose and are designed to shield \ntheir objectives. They are not just a part of the national political \nadvertising debate; they are coming to dominate it.\n\n  What is this new campaign finance world that will be produced if \nSenator Daschle and I fail and the House of Representatives Shays-\nMeehan legislation is rejected? A national political debate that is \nfought by surrogates. The Democratic and Republican Parties will be \nwithin FEC rules, raising money only at $1,000 per person, $50 a \nperson, $100 a person--a good system, where every name will be known, \nlimits will be imposed to reasonable amounts. But over our heads will \nbe a far larger contest fought by the AFL-CIO, with millions more \ndollars of expenditures, the Christian Coalition, anti-abortion groups, \nchemical companies, automobile companies, steel companies, that will \nspend millions, indeed, if history now is any guide, hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of advocacy.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Yesterday, in a colloquy I had with the senior Senator from \nArizona, we established that in the very sparsely populated State of \nNevada, in the last general election--I was a candidate, Harry Reid, \nrunning for election, and John Ensign, Congressman Ensign, was running \nfor my seat--we spent over $20 million in our direct campaigns and in \nthe soft money. That is established. You can determine how much that \nis.\n  The Senator would acknowledge that; is that right?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would.\n  Mr. REID. Yet to this day, a year after the election, we do not know \nhow much money was spent by these outside groups you are talking about, \nthe NRA, the League of Conservation Voters, the truckers----\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. You don't know how much was spent or who spent it?\n  Mr. REID. No; nor where their money came from. Is that the point the \nSenator is making?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It is the central point. The proper system is the \nfull disclosures we have for the Democratic and Republican Parties; \nlimit those political parties just to these hard money contributions \nwithin the law, but extend that to all Americans who participate in the \nnational political debate.\n  The fact that my colleague, as a Senator, has accounted for every \ndollar he has raised, and he did so within limits, but these major \ngroups enter his State either on his behalf or against his candidacy, \nyet my colleague doesn't know who they are or where their money is \ncoming from and to whom they are accountable, is the heart of the \nproblem.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Jersey, in the election that \nwas held in the State of Nevada last year, Congressman Ensign and \nSenator Reid never really campaigned because of all the outside \ninfluences. Our campaigns were buried in all these independent \nexpenditures and State party expenditures.\n  At least with my campaign, and that of the State party, anyone in the \nworld can find out how much money was spent. But for the independent \nexpenditures, no one in the world can find out what money was spent.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I point out to the Senator from Nevada, this is not \nsimply a problem with our adversaries; sometimes it is a problem with \nour allies.\n  When I go to the people of New Jersey, I want to present to them who \nI am and what I want to do, what my record is as a Senator. Groups \nwhose support I am very proud of--AFL-CIO, National Abortion Rights \nLeague, Sierra Club, environmental groups--I am proud to have their \nsupport, but I don't want them presenting my campaign. Under the system \nthat would be in place if Shays-Meehan were rejected, the political \nparties would be further restricted from advertising. I think they \nshould be restricted with soft money. But if these advocacy groups were \nto take over, they would hijack your campaign; they would tell the \npeople of your State what you were for and what you were against.\n  It is not only your adversaries who will be out there presenting a \ncampaign against you with these enormous amounts of money, it is even \nyour allies who are not so restricted.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, in the election of 1986, when Senator \nBryan was elected to the Senate, he was a sitting Governor at the time. \nAt that time, there were these ads that came from nowhere, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of ads in the State of Nevada. These ads were \ntalking about Social Security.\n  One would think these ads were run by some organization that had some \nconcern about Social Security. We learned later that those ads were \nbeing paid for by foreign auto dealers--talking about the United States \nof America's Social Security plan. That is what happens when these \ngroups have unfettered, unrestricted ability to spend money on any \nsubject they want for any cause they want.\n\n[[Page S12665]]\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, that is not \natypical. Health care in this country has been undermined by advocacy \nof insurance companies whose principal interest is not the delivery of \nquality health care to people who are currently uninsured, but they \nstand behind these blind advertising campaigns where no one knows where \nthe money comes from.\n  Just as in the campaign of my colleague from Nevada, we have \npolluters who are running ads on environmental protection; we have \npeople on consumer safety who are representing groups that are damaging \nto individual consumers. That is because none of these groups is \ndisclosable and none is accountable.\n  In the current system, bad as it is, while these groups can run these \nadvertising campaigns, the political parties are also raising soft \nmoney and there is a chance to answer them. Now the political parties \nwill no longer be able to raise these funds, but these advocacy groups \nwill continue in an upward spiral of spending. Senator Daschle's point \nis, let's eliminate this gross fundraising and these soft money \nexpenditures across the board within 60 days of an election by putting \neverybody under the FEC rules.\n  Senator McCain has said, ``But that will not pass.'' It may not. But \nit passed in the House of Representatives, and 60 Republicans came to \njoin with the Democratic majority in passing it. We are not 20 or 30 or \n40 votes from passing it in the Senate, we are 7 or 8. I would come \nback here every week of every month of every year until we restored the \nintegrity of this Government and got comprehensive campaign finance \nreform.\n  But the answer is not to lower our ambitions for campaign finance \nreform, to have a new, distorted system to make American politics \nfought by surrogates over the heads of candidates. The answer is to \nremain committed to this reform, reveal to the American people who is \nvoting against it, who is stopping it, and let the American people \ndecide.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend in conclusion--and I appreciate his \nallowing me to ask him a question or two--first of all, I hope beyond \nall hope the Shays-Meehan bill passes. That is the amendment that has \nbeen filed by our leader, the Democratic leader. I hope that passes. I \nam going to do everything I can to make sure that passes. I hope we \nhave Republicans of goodwill who will support that legislation.\n  I have offered another amendment that would eliminate soft money. I \nrespect and appreciate what the Senator from New Jersey has said. \nCertainly there is merit to what he said. But I believe, as I think \ndoes most everyone in the Democratic conference, that even if Shays-\nMeehan for some reason fails, there will be a significant number of us, \nout of desperation regarding the system that is so bad in this country, \nwho will support the so-called soft money ban. I hope we do not get to \nthat. I hope Shays-Meehan passes. The Senator makes a compelling case \nfor what might happen. I hope something short of that will happen and \nthe soft money ban will bring some reality to the system.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I note the problems of which I speak are not theoretical. Groups are \nalready adjusting to the possibility that there will be a soft money \nban in the political parties but no Shays-Meehan reform. They therefore \nare adjusting to this new reality. Let me give an example.\n  Congressman DeLay has now formed a group, Citizens For A Republican \nCongress. He has gone to the wealthiest donors in the Nation, promising \nthem a safe haven for anonymous and limitless contributions to the 2000 \nelections. He is reportedly planning on spending $25 to $30 million in \n30 competitive House races in soft money.\n  So Congressman DeLay will now, if this happens in the Democratic and \nRepublican Parties, personally be directing a larger advertising \ncampaign than the Democratic or Republican Parties in either House of \nCongress.\n  The former advisers to Congressman DeLay are also forming a \nRepublican issues majority committee, which is planning on spending $25 \nmillion.\n  Already in a previous cycle, in the 1996 cycle, Americans for Tax \nReform received $4.6 million from the Republican National Committee \nthat they were able to spend on issue advocacy.\n  United Seniors Association spent $3 million in direct mail in seven \nStates in the 1996 election. They are an IRS tax-exempt 501(c)(4) \nsocial welfare organization.\n  U.S. Term Limits, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable organization, \nspent $1.8 million in 1996;\n  Americans for Limited Terms, $1.8 million in seven States;\n  American Renewal, $400,000, a 501(c)(3).\n  These are charitable organizations. The Tax Code has these provisions \nfor people who want to help churches, synagogues, and Americans who are \nhurt and damaged, and to help build communities. They are being used as \na cover for political advertising and no longer simply a force on the \nfringes of American politics.\n  Look at the chart I have on my left: 1998 elections. Nonparty \nadvocacy groups are two-thirds of all the issue ads in U.S. politics. \nThe political parties, Democratic and Republican Parties, are one-\nthird. If the sum total of the legislation offered by Mr. McCain and \nMr. Feingold is that we will largely eliminate this third, when a \nSenator stands here a year from now going over this same problem, this \nentire pie chart will be advocacy groups, many of them tax-free \norganizations that are hiding who is contributing to them, who is \nrunning them, where their money is coming from, often using disguised \nnames and running surrogate campaigns over the heads of political \ncandidates.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New Jersey has \nthe floor and has agreed to yield for a question from the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me ask a question, if I can, about \nthe chart I believe he has up at this time. Is the Senator from New \nJersey aware the $276 million estimate of issue advertising in the 1998 \ncycle, which the Senator has there I believe, includes all issue \nadvertising, not just ads that are so-called phony issue ads? Is the \nSenator aware this chart actually covers all issue ads?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I think I said it covers all.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It covers the Harry and Louise type of ads, tobacco ads \nand ads just related to bills that do not have anything to do with \ncampaigns directly.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It covers all of those. I do not see that because \nthey are dealing with an issue, they are not otherwise intending to \ninfluence an election.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Fair enough. I wanted to establish that. The chart the \nSenator from New Jersey is using relates to an entire election cycle, a \n2-year period, and it covers all sorts of ads. That means all kinds of \ntrue issue ads and so-called phony issue ads, as well as political \nparty ads, are included in his chart.\n  All three categories are in there. That is the basis on which he \nmakes his argument. Is he aware the Shays-Meehan bill--which, of \ncourse, Senator McCain and I essentially wrote in the first place--that \nhe has offered as an amendment would have no effect on any ad aired \nbefore the last 2 months of an election campaign?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am aware of it, and if it was my design, I would \nhave it apply to issue advocacy ads throughout the calendar so everyone \nis equal. To quote Senator McCain, making the perfect the enemy of the \ngood, if it is your argument that because I cannot bring all issue \nadvocacy under FEC hard money limits, therefore we should do none, \nthat, I think, is to surrender the point and we will not make any \nprogress.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, that \nis very interesting because it is essentially the same argument the \nSenator from New Jersey is using against the McCain-Feingold approach \nat this time which is, unless you do it all, it is not worth doing some \nbecause the soft money would flow to outside groups.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. My argument is, I believe, the Senator from Wisconsin \nand the Senator from Arizona are making a premature retreat. I concede\n\n[[Page S12666]]\n\nthere may not be 60 votes in the Senate today for comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform, but I do believe there is mounting public \npressure. I believe Senators who vote against comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform, who will vote against us on cloture on the amendment \noffered by Senator Daschle, are accountable to the people in their \nStates. In the House of Representatives 2 years ago, the passage of \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform was equally unlikely. Sixty \nRepublicans crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats for real reform.\n  These numbers are untenable. You cannot explain to the American \npeople that you allow this charade to continue of people hiding behind \nthese groups and spending $1 million, $100,000 contributions that are \nnot accountable.\n  I respect the Senator's work, but I believe we would do better to \nremain on this. I believe, in the alternative, you are going to \nestablish a system where these groups dominate American politics as you \nsilence the political parties.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator further yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would, but Senator Bennett is standing. If we could \ngo to him next.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding for a \nquestion, and I precede the question with a comment that I think the \nSenator from New Jersey is doing us a very worthwhile service in \npointing out the reality of the world in which we would live if soft \nmoney were banned for political parties but not for everybody else. I \nagree with the Senator from New Jersey, absolutely in his words, when \nhe says the debate would be fought by surrogates which would take place \nover our heads, a far larger context.\n\n  I ask the Senator to give us his opinion of what would happen if \nShays-Meehan, which he is endorsing, were to pass and then the Supreme \nCourt were to strike down as unconstitutional the ban on issue ads by \noutside groups? Would that not, in fact, then leave us with the \nsituation which the Senator from New Jersey is decrying, I think \nappropriately, as a bad system?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Senator Bennett raises a very worthwhile point. \nIndeed, as Senator McConnell has noted in a number of cases, this is \nall an interesting debate. There are various sides trying to do good \nthings, but the last word is in the Supreme Court, and, indeed, whether \nor not the Supreme Court will allow us to ban issue advocacy through \nsoft money contributions to advocacy groups or even the political \nparties remains a question.\n  If the Senator's point is correct, we could end up in the same place \nwith, I will concede to you, the current McCain-Feingold if the Court \nwere to do so. Senator McConnell has also pointed out it is a question \nof whether the Court will allow us to maintain the current limits on \ncampaign fundraising in any case. Senators who vote on this should be \naware that the Court, before we are concluded, will change probably \nmuch of what we are writing.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I can ask a further question of the \nSenator from New Jersey, if he is aware--I know he is aware because he \nis a very astute student of politics but maybe not aware enough to \ncomment without further research--if he is aware of what has happened \nin the State of California where they have virtually unlimited \ninitiative opportunities and virtually every truly contentious \npolitical issue is now decided by initiative rather than by the \nlegislature and the amount of money that is spent in an initiative \nfight dwarfs any of the sums we are talking about here.\n  In the State of California, when an initiative fight comes up over an \nissue, which traditionally would be handled by the State legislature, \nthe special interests on both sides of that fight routinely go over the \nhundreds of millions of dollars on both sides of the fight which dwarf \nthe amount of money spent for a senatorial or gubernatorial race in \nthat State.\n  I ask if the Senator is aware of some of those particulars and if he \nwill comment on the implications of that on a national basis if we get \nto the point where issues are fought out by special interest groups \nwith unlimited budgets being spent on both sides, the implications on \nthe role of the legislature in its constitutional responsibility to \ncontrol the legislative agenda.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. We may not be on the same side of the debate for \ncomprehensive reform, but I think our dialog can help Senators \nunderstand the world in which we are entering, because if we, indeed, \nreject Shays-Meehan and only go to this narrow reform, that single \nadjustment is going to change the American political debate as we know \nit. The Senator has raised some of the means by which it will change.\n  I will predict for the Senator the new environment in which we are \ngoing to live: The Democratic and Republican Parties that now receive \ngreat amounts of this soft money with a wink and a nod are simply going \nto direct it to favorite organizations. Instead of soft money \ncontributions coming to the Republican National Committee, for example, \npeople who are interested in a particular issue are going to give it to \nan advocacy group. You will never know who they are. The contribution \nwill never be known, but the money will be redirected, and rather than \nleaders of the party deciding how to present the issue, those groups \nwill do so.\n  Second, I predict to you the Democratic and Republican Parties will \nestablish their own independent wings, much like legally what Senator \nD'Amato did with the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Down the \nhall, they put a new sign on the door, new incorporators, a new name, \ntook money, and did issue advocacy.\n\n  As long as you do that fully at arm's length, it is fine to do. But \nthe same soft money you think you are banning in the parties will now \ngo to these independent groups or affiliated groups. Unless this is \ndone comprehensively, you are only going to have money flow in through \ndifferent windows.\n  What bothers me the most is that the people who are most honest about \nthe process and most committed to stopping this abuse will suffer while \nthose who are prepared to do the winks and nods, establishing the other \norganizations, working on some affiliated arm's-length basis will \nsucceed. In any case, we are not going to stop this money; we are going \nto redirect it. The only way to stop it, in my judgment, is \ncomprehensive reform.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think this is an extremely useful exchange that \nreally goes to the core question about this legislation. I want to \nthank the Senator from New Jersey, even though we may come to different \nconclusions about specific tactics in what we do here. I thank the \nSenator for allowing us to talk about this because this is really what \nit is all about. Let me first reiterate my concern and ask a question \nabout the totality of the ads the Senator suggested on his charts.\n  Would the Senator concede that when you are dealing with ads that \nsimply have to do with legislation, prior to 60 days, let's say, for \nexample--the kind of tobacco ads we have seen; the ads we have seen \nabout the Patients' Bill of Rights, the so-called Harry and Louise ads \nduring the health care debate--there is no way under either Shays-\nMeehan or under McCain-Feingold, or even under any other legislation, \nwe could prohibit those ads? Is that something with which the Senator \nwould agree?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I think it is difficult to know how the Supreme Court \nis going to deal with all of this. But certainly, if you get outside \nthe 60 days and you are attempting to bring people under FEC \nregulations for issue advocacy outside of the 60 days, your case will \nclearly be weakened.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am specifically talking here about ads that do not \ntalk about elections at all, they are simply talking about legislation. \nThe Senator will concede, without a constitutional amendment, we could \nnot prohibit such ads?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I don't dispute that, although, indeed, if we were \nreally doing comprehensive reform, which seems to be lost in the \nSenate, frankly, I would be going to that question on disclosability \nand tax deductibility and people remaining in tax-free status to do so. \nThat would be comprehensive reform. But for the purpose of the \nargument, I will concede the point.\n\n[[Page S12667]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Fair enough. I think that is important because we have \nto distinguish here between the kinds of ads we are talking about.\n  If it is the case, as the Senator from New Jersey suggests, that \nbanning soft money will cause money to flow to phony issue ads, I think \nit is also rather difficult to dispute--in fact, you seem to concede--\nif we prohibit that, that the money will just flow to generic issue ads \nas well. Isn't that your likely scenario?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. That is the scenario I predict.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me follow then to the really important question you \nare raising about the possibility of the attempts to evade our attempts \nto simply ban party soft money.\n  I don't doubt for a minute that the Senator is right, that the \nattempt will be made to evade the intent of the law, and in some cases \nit could succeed. But is the Senator aware that the McCain-Feingold \nsoft money ban, the bill we have introduced, will prohibit Federal \ncandidates from raising money for these phony outside groups such as \nthe organization that is connected with Representative DeLay? Are you \naware that that provision is actually in this soft money ban?\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am aware of it. And I believe it will be proven to \nbe entirely ineffective.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Are you further aware that the bill will prohibit the \nparties from transferring money to 501(c)(4) organizations such as \nAmericans for Tax Reform, which you mentioned a short time ago?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. There would be no reason to do so. They are no longer \nraising soft money, so why would they need to transfer?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. So that route will be blocked.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. That route will be blocked. Instead, the environment \nwe create would be this. Is the Senator from Wisconsin, with his \nfamiliarity with American politics and American fundraising, generally \nof the belief that people who are now contributing $100,000 or $250,000 \ncontributions, because they are advocating some perspective in American \npolitics, when you pass this law, you are going to sit at home and say: \nYou know, I guess I'm just not going to be heard; I'm going to remove \nmyself from the process because that's the right thing to do?\n  I think the Senator from Wisconsin must at least be suspicious that \nthat money, that same check, is going to work itself into Americans for \nTax Justice or one of these other 70 organizations that are engaged in \nthis political advertising.\n  It may not happen, as the Senator has appropriately written the bill, \nthat a Member of Congress or a political party leader calls one of \nthese contributors and says: Send your check to so-and-so. But \ncertainly the Senator is aware it will not be very hard for political \nleaders to divert this money by a wink or a nod or some smile in the \nright direction, and we are going to end up, instead, having these \nsurrogate organizations running these campaigns.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I further ask the question--I do appreciate these \nanswers--I think when you look at the tough provisions we put in this \nbill, although nothing is ever perfectly complete if somebody is \nwilling to violate the law and take their chances, but what we are \ntalking about here is corporate executives, CEOs, who now give money \ndirectly to political parties, taking the chance of running afoul of \nthese new criminal laws.\n  I have this chart. It is a list of all the soft money double givers. \nThese are corporations that have given over $150,000 to both sides. \nUnder the Senator's logic, these very same corporations--Philip Morris, \nJoseph Seagram, RJR Nabisco, BankAmerica Corporation--each of these \nwould continue making the same amount of contributions; they would take \nthe chance of violating the law by doing this in coordination with or \nat the suggestion of the parties, and they would calmly turn over the \nsame kind of cash to others, be it left-wing or right-wing independent \ngroups?\n  I have to say--and I will finish my question--I am skeptical that if \nthey cannot hand the check directly to the political party leaders, \nthey will take those chances.\n  I share your suspicions about some group trying to funnel this money. \nThere is no question that some of that will happen. But wouldn't you \nconcede there has to be some serious risk, in our soft money ban, for \nthese corporations to pull this kind of a stunt?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, I do not doubt there are some \npeople who will not participate in doing so. But in what is a rising \ntide of soft money contributions in the country, they will be \noverwhelmed by people who will because it is not illegal. It will not \nbe illegal. It will be fundamentally clear which of these affiliated \norganizations each political party supports and favors.\n  It certainly is not going to be lost upon many donors that the \nDemocratic Party looks favorably upon the Sierra Club or NARAL. I doubt \nthat any major Republican contributor is not going to understand that \nGrover Norquist, Americans for Tax Justice, or term limits, or the \nantiabortion groups, or term limits are favored by the RNC.\n\n  No one is going to have to send out a letter or make a speech. \nEverybody is going to know where everybody stands. The same money just \ngets redirected, but not equally as bad as the party contributions--\nworse, no accountability; you will never know who they are. And the \nads, I believe, become less and less responsible.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will----\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Nor, by the way, if I may continue, is this a \ntheoretical problem. I do not cast aspersions, but entirely legally in \nthe 1996 cycle, when the restrictions were out on the coordination of \nissue advertising, Senator D'Amato set up a separate division and did \nissue advertising. It is entirely appropriate, entirely appropriate.\n  This August, Grover Norquist had $4.5 million worth of advertising \nfor his Americans for Tax Justice. In some of those advertisements, \nthey used the same film footage as Republican candidates were using--on \nthe same issues. That technically is not advisable, but it is \nhappening. We have some responsibility here in the Senate to deal with \nthe reality of how this process is going to evolve.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. One more question, because the Senator from New Jersey \nhas been very generous in responding.\n  The proposition you are advancing appears to be--given this chart, \nPhilip Morris did give almost $500,000 to the Democrats, although they \ngave $2.5 million to the Republicans--apparently the Senator believes, \none way or another, Philip Morris is going to see to it that that kind \nof money--$500,000-- sees its way to the Sierra Club or NARAL or some \nkind----\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Probably not the groups the Senator has cited, but I \ndo believe they end up in an organization.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. But it will go to that kind of a group.\n  The point I want to reiterate--and I put it in the form of a \nquestion--is that the suggestion that a party soft money ban that \nincludes some new tough provisions to protect against evasions of the \nlaw would not make a difference, I think, is problematic. We are \ntalking about making these subterfuges, which are currently legal--\nmaybe at the most they are stretching the law--illegal. What Mr. DeLay \nis doing, from the other body, apparently is right on the line, some \nwould say. Maybe it is legal; maybe it isn't. But we can't say for sure \nit is illegal. We are making sure in our bill that it is a crime to do \nthis sort of thing.\n\n  Don't you think it would make a significant difference and raise the \nbar on the risk for these companies and those individuals to play this \ngame? Isn't it worth taking the chance by banning soft money and having \nthese tough provisions? Isn't it worth giving it a try?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. My point to the Senator from Wisconsin is, he is not \nbanning soft money. He is continuing the legitimization of a process \nwhere money from unknown contributors is distorting the American \npolitical process and undermining confidence.\n  I have great respect for what the Senator from Wisconsin has done, \nbut it is a premature and unfortunate retreat. If the Senator believes \nwe should be banning soft money, we should be banning soft money for \npeople in the entire process, not the Democratic and Republican parties \nalone.\n  Could the Senator tell me, under your provisions, when Congressman \nDeLay simply takes his name off of this and he puts on his cousin, B.B.\n\n[[Page S12668]]\n\nDeLay, or his former chief of staff, how does your law protect his $25 \nmillion expenditures when he no longer has a name on it, but it is very \nclear to anyone in the country the organization that he favors?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am very glad the Senator asked me that question. \nAgain, you come to the heart of the matter. Let us look at the language \nof the bill we have put forward.\n  It does not talk about only what the gentleman from Texas--as we \nshould perhaps refer to him on the floor--would do directly. The \nlanguage is clear. It says: A candidate, an individual holding Federal \noffice, agent of a candidate or individual holding Federal office, or \nan entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, \ncontrolled by, or acting on behalf of one or more candidates--cannot \nraise this money.\n  We deal with the indirect problem. It is not possible to have B.B. \nDeLay become the shell person to do this without running the risk of \nviolating the law.\n  Since you asked me a question this time, I will answer in the form of \na question back to you. How can you say to me that we only deal with \nsome of the soft money when the whole exchange we just had made you \nconcede--you clearly conceded--that you can't deal with all the soft \nmoney, that there is no way you could ever deal with----\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, I can deal with it. I remind the \nSenator, I am yielding the time. It can be dealt with. I am telling you \nabout our legislation. In the original McCain-Feingold bill now passed \nby the House of Representatives, we are dealing with soft money in this \n60-day period.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. You are not dealing----\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The most sensitive period for American elections are \nthose ads that are actually directly influencing elections.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is the Senator not aware that even during the 60-day \nperiod, the Shays-Meehan bill, which, of course, was the McCain-\nFeingold bill, does not cover pure issue ads? It only covers ads that \nshow the likeness of a candidate or mention the name of a candidate. It \ndoes not cover the Harry-and-Louise kind of ads.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator knows I am aware. But to go back to \nSenator McCain's point, his argument of making the perfect the enemy of \nthe good, no; I can't control every abuse in American politics by the \nShays-Meehan bill. I can't control advertising throughout the entire 2 \nyears. I can't control advertising where someone wants to buy a soft \nmoney ad to show the virtues of his grandmother. I can't do that. That \nmay not be important. But what we did accomplish in the original \nMcCain-Feingold bill is, in that 60-day period when elections are most \ninfluenced, we were making sure the American people knew who was doing \nthe advertising and where the money was coming from if they were \nattempting to influence their votes. That was a high standard, not an \nimpossible standard, and a worthwhile goal. It never should have been \nabandoned. That is what leads us to the floor today.\n\n  I want to ask one final question, and then I will yield to Senator \nBennett.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I want to ask the Senator from Wisconsin one more \nquestion. A group of unaffiliated citizens decides they are going to \nrent a building next to DNC headquarters. In that building, they are \ngoing to call themselves Democrats for a Better America. Democrats for \na Better America is going to file as a charitable organization along \nwith the Red Cross and the Boy Scouts. No one in the current DNC \nleadership is going to be on their board of directors, but they are \nright next door. They are going to have the same seal as the DNC except \nthey are going to take one toe off the eagle and they are going to \nchange the color tone a little bit, but they are going to be right next \ndoor. They are going to take $200,000 contributions, million-dollar \ncontributions. And unlike the Democratic Party, they are not going to \ndisclose them. No one is going to know where the money is going to come \nfrom.\n  Can the Senator tell me how legally we are going to restrict American \ncitizens from doing this constitutionally under your provision, unless \nwe had Shays-Meehan, which applied these soft money bans to everybody's \nefforts?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think, in the scenario you described, there would be \na heck of a case to suggest there is indirect coordination. What you \nhave just described is an obvious scenario.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Different address, different name, different purpose.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would be delighted to have some sort of an \ninvestigation of whether or not that is a different organization and \nhas no connection with the party. But if the Senator has some concerns \nabout how we drafted this, if he thinks we need to take the language \nand tighten it up--I think it is pretty tight--but we would be \ndelighted to try to make this tougher. You are right. We shouldn't let \nanybody do this by ruse. What you described is a ruse.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, what I am describing to you is \nwhat I believe is going to be the future of American politics. We do \nhave tougher language; it is called Shays-Meehan. That is why Senator \nDaschle and I have offered it. It is a complete, comprehensive ban on \nsoft money. It is genuine reform. There is no end to my admiration of \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin who wrote it.\n  I yield to Senator Bennett.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to make one comment, if I could, in response to \nthat. Excuse me, to the Senator from Utah.\n  Let me again thank you and, of course, reiterate, I helped write \nthose provisions in Shays-Meehan. I would love to see them passed. It \nwould do more than the bill we are now proposing. But the notion that \nit isn't worth it, if that is all we can do--and that is something we \ndisagree on and we will debate in a few minutes, I hope--the notion \nthat it isn't worth it to ban these giant direct contributions to the \nparties, as well as the various attempted ways to try to get around the \nban, which we seek to do, to not do that, to suggest that not doing \nthat alone isn't worth it and it is worse than the status quo, to me, \nis absurd.\n  Let me reiterate, I do support the language of Shays-Meehan. But the \nquestion that is crucial is whether or not it is at all possible to get \n60 votes for that. I suggest stopping this is well worth doing.\n\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Is he aware of a gentleman named Arnold Hyatt?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I do not know Mr. Hyatt. Should I?\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I may, then, could I enlighten the Senator from New \nJersey on the case of Arnold Hyatt. This comes from an article that \nappeared in Fortune magazine on September 7, 1998, in an article \nentitled ``The Money Chase,'' the subtitle of which says: It's as venal \nas this: The Presidential candidates who raise the most money get the \nnomination. Fortune's guide to the masters of the political universe.\n  Now, in that article, it describes Arnold Hyatt, 71, who, in 1996, \nwas the second largest individual contributor to the Democratic Party. \nHis $500,000 gift was second only to the $600,000 given by Loral's \nBernard Schwartz.\n  The article goes on to say: Hyatt wrote his $500,000 check a month \nbefore the November 1996 election, specifically to help unseat \nvulnerable House Republicans and return the House to Democratic \ncontrol.\n  I am sure the Senator from New Jersey would accept that as a laudable \ngoal. The Senator from Utah might argue with that, but that was his \npurpose. In the article it says he has decided not to give any more \nsoft money. Quoting the article, why he decided to stop contributing to \npoliticians so soon after giving so much, he admits that it was because \nhis Democrats didn't win.\n  Then, the article goes on:\n\n       He still aspires to topple his enemies by ending the \n     Republican majority in Congress. Hyatt then hasn't gotten \n     religion, he's changed tactics. Rather than relying on the \n     Democrats to press his agenda, he is now giving heavily to \n     organizations like the Washington-based Public Campaign, \n     which lobbied for publicly financed elections.\n\n  I submit to the Senator from New Jersey that what he says will go on \nand, in fact, is already going on, as demonstrated in the case of Mr. \nHyatt who gave one-half million dollars--enough to put him on the chart \nof the Senator from Wisconsin all by himself,\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\nwithout any company behind him, his own money, one-half million \ndollars. Clearly, it had to be soft money because if it were hard \nmoney, it would be illegal and over the $25,000 limit. He decided to \nshift that giving from a party--because he wasn't getting the results \nhe was hoping for--to a special interest group.\n  That is why I asked if the Senator was aware of him because, in my \nview, he represents a class A example of exactly what the Senator from \nNew Jersey is saying will happen. It has already started to happen and \nwill continue to happen if we pass the underlying legislation.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator. It is illustrative that we can \nbe on different sides politically in the campaign finance debate and \nsee emerging the same future. The Senator has described the future of \nAmerican politics, where large donors choose their favorite \norganization, or create one of their own. Rather than be part of a \npolitical campaign, they create their own issue advocacy group, fund it \nwith their own money, and run their own advertising. You, as a \ncandidate, will sit in the leisure of your home, sending out postcards \nor mail with your thousand dollars in federally restricted funds, while \non your side the Chamber of Commerce, or on my side the AFL-CIO, fights \na war in the airwaves over our heads. You won't control content; you \nwon't define yourself; you won't answer to your opponents. You will be \na spectator in your own campaign.\n  We may have different prescriptions for the problem--mine is Shays-\nMeehan--to put everybody on the same plain. You may have a different \nformula, but we see the same future.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have been listening carefully to the observations of \nmy friend from New Jersey. Along the same lines, would the Senator \nagree with the Senator from Kentucky that the only entities in American \npolitics completely devoted and willing to support challengers are the \npolitical parties?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. In my experience, that is largely true.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from New Jersey agree that, as a \npractical matter, the result of the most recent version of McCain-\nFeingold is to take away 35 percent of the budget of the Democratic \nSenatorial Committee, 35 percent of the budget of the Republican \nSenatorial Committee, and roughly 40 percent of the budgets of the RNC \nand the DNC; is that not correct?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. That is probably a fair estimate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I say to my friend from New Jersey, another maybe \nunintended consequence of the proposal that is targeted right at the \nheart of America's two great political parties is that it will make it \neven more difficult for challengers to be competitive in elections \nacross America.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I think the Senator from Kentucky makes a good point, \nthat neither will be in a position to fund challengers. I don't know \nabout the spending priorities of the Republican organization, but I can \ntell you soft money, largely raised by the DNC and the DSCC, also goes \nfor things such as voter registration, for get-out-the-vote efforts, \nwhich are not necessarily things for which to use Federal moneys. That \nsoft money, in our case, almost exclusively goes for those outreach \nprograms. Indeed, our States are all different, but in my State, soft \nmoney goes almost entirely to minority communities for get-out-the-\nvotes and registration.\n  Having said that, the Senator and I agree on his analysis. \nNevertheless, where we part is I would be prepared to have the DSCC and \nthe DNC forego all soft money and operate only on hard money. But my \nconcern is, I don't want to do so while the National Rifle Association \nor the Christian Coalition or the right-to-life organizations are \nrunning soft money campaigns against our candidates or challengers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, we don't agree on the underlying \nissue. But selective disarmament of the two great political parties, \nsome would argue, is not a step forward in having more and more \ncompetitive elections, which presumably would be a good thing for the \nAmerican political system. As the Senator knows, I don't want to disarm \nanybody. I don't think we have a problem in America because we have too \nfew voices speaking on issues.\n  My view is, a government that spends $1.8 trillion a year is a \ngovernment that can threaten an awful lot of people. It is not at all \nsurprising these citizens, groups, and parties want to have an impact \non a government that has the ability to take away everything they have. \nSo I am not surprised, nor am I offended, by all of these voices having \nthe opportunity to speak out.\n  But I thank the Senator from New Jersey for making the very important \npoint that it is a sort of selective quieting of voices, a singling out \nof six committees. I think there are something like 3,000 committees \nregistered with the Federal Election Commission. If this particular \nversion of McCain-Feingold were passed, I say to my friend from New \nJersey, 6 committees out of 3,000 would be unable to engage in issue \nadvocacy, raising an important fifth amendment problem under the equal \nprotection clause. Is it possible for the Government to single out 6 \ncommittees out of 3,000 and say only those committees cannot engage in \nissue advocacy?\n  So this thing has an important fifth amendment problem. We have \ntalked a lot about the first amendment in this debate. This proposal \nhas a serious fifth amendment problem.\n  I thank my friend from New Jersey for his observations about what is \ngoing to happen, practically, if you simply target the parties.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the question before the Senate is, Are we \ngoing to make progress in reforming our campaign finance system or not?\n  That is the simple question before us. In the 105th Congress, the \nSenate took up comprehensive campaign finance reform measures three \ntimes--in September of 1997, in March of 1998, and in September of \n1998. Despite my support and the support of a majority of the Senate, \nthese measures could not break the legislative logjam and move forward. \nSo it was obvious it was time for a new approach, a new test that would \nallow the Senate to consider a more narrow piece of legislation and \nthen work its will on the various components of the original McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n  Now, I am a supporter of the more comprehensive approach. I am proud \nto have been an early cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold bill. The Shays-\nMeehan bill is, too, an excellent piece of legislation. It contains \nmany provisions I wholeheartedly support. But the point is--and the \nSenator from New Jersey is well aware of it--the comprehensive approach \nwill not garner the votes necessary to move through this Senate. So the \nquestion is, Do we want to make progress or don't we?\n  It is difficult to think of a better example of the old adage of \n``the perfect being the enemy of the good'' than the debate we are \nhaving this morning. So I rise in strong support of the underlying \nmeasure before us, the revised McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The underlying bill closes the most glaring loophole in our campaign \nfinance laws by banning the unlimited, unregulated contributions known \nas soft money. The legislation also takes an important step of \ncodifying the Supreme Court's decision in the Beck case. This will \npreserve the rights of nonunion members who must pay fees to a union to \nhave their money excluded from the union's political activity fund.\n  In 1974, in the aftermath of Watergate, Congress passed comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform measures that placed dollar limits on political \ncontributions.\n  In its Buckley v. Valeo ruling, the Supreme Court upheld those \ncontributions limits reasoning they were a legitimate means to guard \nagainst the reality or appearance of improper political influence.\n  Contribution limits remain on the books, but in reality, they have \nbecome a dead letter. The resourceful have found that the easiest way \nto circumvent the spirit of Federal election\n\n[[Page S12670]]\n\nlaw is to provide huge sums to the political parties through soft money \ndonations. For years, soft money contributions to the major political \nparties were used for party overhead and organizational expenses. But \nover time, the use of soft money has increased dramatically to include \na wider range of activities which influence elections.\n  Mr. President, in 1907, corporations were banned from directly \ncontributing to Federal elections from their treasury funds. In 1947, \nCongress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which banned labor unions from \ncontributing treasury funds to candidates. Plain and simple, the soft \nmoney corporations and labor unions funnel through the parties clearly \ncircumvents those laws.\n  We in this body decry legal loopholes, but we have reserved a gaping \none for ourselves. Indeed, the soft money loophole is more like a black \nhole, and that sucking sound you hear during election years is the \nwhoosh of six-figure soft money donations gushing into party coffers.\n  The soft money loophole in our Federal election laws has been \nexploited to the point where the legislative framework put in place in \nthe 1970's has become a mere shell. In 1994, approximately $100 million \nwas raised through soft money by the major parties. Four years later, \nthat amount more than doubled--fully $224 million was raised in soft \nmoney.\n  The problem with soft money was painfully evident during the 1997 \nhearings at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, in which the \nCommittee heard from one individual who gave $325,000 to the Democratic \nNational Committee in order to secure a picture with the President of \nthe United States. We also heard from another individual, the infamous \nand clearly unrepentant Roger Tamraz who testified that next time he is \nwilling to spend $600,000, rather than $300,000, to purchase access to \nthe White House. In a July, 1997 interview with the Los Angeles Times, \nJohnny Chung, who gave $366,000 derived from illegal foreign sources to \nthe Democratic National Committee and other Democrat organizations, \ncynically revealed the depth of the current problem; he said, ``I see \nthe White House is like a subway--you have to put in the coins to open \nup the gates.''\n  This is what this debate is about.\n  How long can public faith in a political system survive when the \npublic perception exists that wealthy groups are given a stage, podium \nand a microphone to broadcast their concerns, while the voice of the \nvast majority remains muted?\n\n  I hope Members will indulge me if I take a moment to explain the \nimportance of this issue to the people of Maine.\n  Time and time again, I hear it said on the Senate floor and elsewhere \nthat the American people do not care about this issue. I can't speak \nfor the citizens of other States, but I know the people of Maine care \ndeeply about this issue--about reforming our campaign finance system.\n  My home State has a deep commitment to preserving the integrity of \nthe electoral system and ensuring that all Mainers have an equal \npolitical voice--and Mainers have backed their commitment to an open \npolitical process in both word and deed. In many regions of Maine, \npolitical life is dominated by town meetings and public forums in which \nall citizens are invited to share their concerns, and hash out critical \npolitical matters. This is unvarnished direct democracy where all \ncitizens are a part of the process. People with more money do not get \nto speak longer or louder than people with less money. Perhaps it is \nour tradition of town meetings that explains why so many Maine citizens \nfeel so strongly about reforming our Federal campaign laws, about \nreforming the current system. And that strong feeling is one I share.\n  The bill before us today is not a broad sweeping reform such as the \none we considered last year and the year before. Rather, it is a modest \nattempt to achieve some progress by tackling the biggest abuse in the \nsystem. This primary purpose of today's bill is to stem the growing \nreliance on huge soft money contributions. This is not a radical \napproach; rather, our proposal to eliminate political party soft money, \nendorsed by former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George \nBush, is a measured step toward meaningful reform.\n  Mr. President, when I ran for a seat in this body, I advocated major \nchanges to our campaign finance law, but I recognize that goal must \nwait for another time.\n  But surely we can take this initial critical first step. Although I \nremain personally committed to more comprehensive changes in the \ncurrent law, I believe the revised McCain-Feingold bill before us today \nwill serve as a building block on which we can build a much better \nelection financing system.\n  I look forward to the debate in the days ahead. My colleagues have \nseveral proposals to improve this bill. But at the conclusion of this \ndebate, my guiding principle in casting my votes on the amendments \nbefore us, including the proposal by the Democratic leader, will be \nanswering the question of whether we are moving forward and whether we \nare successfully ending the abuse of unregulated soft money in our \ncampaign finance system.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this modest, \ncommonsense first step to restore integrity and public confidence in \nour campaign system.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine. She has \nbeen a stalwart and steadfast advocate, ally, and friend in this very \ndifficult effort. I know that not only the people of Maine but the \npeople of Arizona are very appreciative of everything she has done in \nthis effort. She lends credibility and grace to the debate. I thank her \nvery much for everything she has done.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes about an organization called the \nCommittee for Economic Development. It is an independent research and \npolicy organization of some 250 business leaders and educators. It is \nnonprofit, nonpartisan, and nonpolitical.\n  The interesting thing about the Committee for Economic Development is \nthat they are composed preliminarily of business leaders in America, \nmainly from major corporations, some smaller, and many educators. It \nhas an incredibly illustrious membership.\n  This organization took a very bold step not too long ago; that is, a \ngroup of chief executive officers of major corporations decided they \nwould stand up and reject soft money contributions to American \npolitical campaigns, whether they be Republican or Democrat. I am sure \nthat was not an easy decision on their part. I am sure there have been \nsignificant pressures brought to bear against many of them as \nindividuals and as corporations.\n  They issued a very interesting statement by the Research and Policy \nCommittee, the Committee for Economic Development. It is entitled, \n``Investing in the People's Business: A Business Proposal for Campaign \nFinance Reform.'' Chapter IV is entitled: ``Recommendations for \nReform.'' It says,\n       Our recommendations are also informed by our belief in \n     certain basic principles that should govern a system of \n     campaign finance regulation. The five principles listed below \n     reflect the objectives we regard as most important, which \n     should form the basis for evaluating regulatory reform \n     proposals.\n       (1) Regulation should protect free speech and promote an \n     informed citizenry.\n       The First Amendment and the principles it embodies \n     guarantee freedom of speech and expression and thus protect \n     the cornerstone of our political system: full and robust \n     political debate. The courts have acknowledged the link \n     between political finance and the First Amendment in ruling \n     that the financing of political expression is a protected \n     form of political speech under the First Amendment. Campaign \n     finance laws must recognize these constitutional \n     considerations and uphold the principles of free speech. It \n     is especially important to protect and promote the political \n     speech that takes place in election campaigns, the purpose of \n     which is to provide American citizens with the knowledge \n     needed to make informed decisions on Election Day.\n       (2) Regulation should protect the political system from \n     corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n       The regulations governing campaign finance should promote \n     public confidence in the political process and ensure that \n     the integrity of the electoral system is maintained. It is \n     therefore essential that the system guard against corruption \n     or the appearance of corruption in the financing of political \n     campaigns. A system of political finance that fulfills this \n     objective helps to ensure that elected officials are \n     responsive to broad public interests and the desires of their \n     constituencies.\n       (3) Regulation should ensure public accountability.\n\n[[Page S12671]]\n\n       A goal of the campaign finance system should be full \n     transparency of the funding of campaigns for public office, \n     supported by the public's right to know. Elections allow \n     citizen to hold candidates and elected officials accountable \n     for their views and actions. If the major participants in \n     political campaigns are to be held accountable, the public \n     must have full and timely information about their campaigns.\n\n  I might add, Mr. President, one of the first amendments I proposed \nyesterday, which was adopted, concerned full and complete disclosure \nand using the Internet as part of that capability to do so.\n\n       Any system of campaign finance must therefore ensure full \n     public disclosure of the sources of campaign funding, the \n     activities undertaken with it, and the amounts raised and \n     spent. Disclosure not only provides the electorate with the \n     information it needs but also helps curtail excesses and \n     promote full public scrutiny of financial transactions.\n       (4) Regulation should encourage public participation in the \n     political system.\n       The strength of a democracy depends upon the political \n     participation of its citizens. Citizens should be encouraged \n     not only to vote but to participate in the process in other \n     ways. Campaign finance rules should not discourage citizens \n     from seeking elective office, associating with others, \n     volunteering their skills and time, or participating in the \n     financing of campaigns. Such participation enhances the \n     legitimacy of the representative process and thereby \n     strengthens popular support for the political system.\n       (5) Regulation should promote electoral competition.\n       The essence of democracy lies in competitive elections that \n     offer voters a choice of candidates. Competition stimulates \n     public interest in election campaigns, induces greater \n     numbers of citizens to learn about the candidates, gives more \n     meaning to elections, and encourages people to vote. It is an \n     essential element in promoting the vitality and quality of \n     political life. The regulation of campaign funding should \n     therefore promote competitive elections by ensuring that \n     candidates have an opportunity to obtain the resources needed \n     to share their views with voters.\n\n  Mr. President, one reason I quote that is I think it is a very \nimportant statement as to what our goals should be in political \ncampaigns. It lays out the basis for the first recommendation of the \nCommittee for Economic Development. Their first recommendation is \neliminate soft money.\n\n       We believe that, as a general principle, funds used to \n     promote political candidacies should be subject to the \n     requirements and restrictions of federal law on campaign \n     finance. Soft money is the most egregious example of campaign \n     financing that violates this principle. No reform is more \n     urgently needed than the elimination of soft money.\n       Some business leaders have already taken action to help \n     remedy this problem by refusing to participate in the soft \n     money system. Most businesses in America do not give \n     unregulated soft money funds to the political parties. \n     Others, including such industry leaders as General Motors, \n     AlliedSignal, and Monsanto, have recently declared that they \n     will no longer make such contributions. They have been joined \n     by dozens of corporate executives, who recognize the dangers \n     to our system of government created by this type of \n     fundraising.\\49\\ CED supports these voluntary efforts to \n     reduce soft money and lauds the leadership shown by these \n     members of the business community. We urge other business \n     leaders, labor unions, and individual citizens to follow this \n     lead and voluntarily work to reduce the supply of soft money \n     funds.\n       There are ample opportunities for members of the business \n     community to express their support for candidates or party \n     organizations, either as individuals or through PACs. We \n     encourage participation in the process in these ways. But \n     there is no need for members of the business community, labor \n     unions, or others to supplement these opportunities with soft \n     money contributions. Participation in the soft money \n     practices of the national party committees fuels the demand \n     for soft dollars and spurs the arms race mentality that now \n     characterizes party fundraising at the national level.\n       Voluntary efforts alone, however, will not solve the soft \n     money problem. Potential donors will still face pressure from \n     elected officials and national party leaders to make soft \n     money contributions. We therefore believe that a legislative \n     remedy is needed to end soft money. Specifically, we \n     recommend that Congress prohibit national party committees, \n     their officers or staff, and any organizations or entities \n     established or controlled by national party committees or \n     their personnel, from soliciting, receiving, or directing any \n     contributions, donations, or transfers of funds that are not \n     subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and public \n     disclosure requirements of federal law. These committees and \n     individuals should also be prohibited from spending any funds \n     that are not subject to such restrictions and requirements. \n     Similar prohibitions should be applied to federal \n     officeholders, candidates, and their agents or staffs. In \n     addition, federal officeholders or candidates should be \n     prohibited from raising or spending soft money through \n     personal PACs or so-called ``leadership PACs.'' (An \n     exemption, however, would be made for federal \n     officeholders running for state or local office who are \n     raising monies allowable under the relevant state law--\n     e.g., a U.S. senator running as a candidate in a \n     gubernatorial election.)\n       In short, national party committees, including the national \n     congressional campaign committees, and federal politicians \n     would not be allowed to raise and spend monies from \n     unrestricted sources in unlimited amounts. We believe that \n     this reform will greatly reduce the unregulated party money \n     that is now flowing through the system.\n       This reform also would significantly simplify the rules \n     governing party finance. National party committees would be \n     allowed to raise only hard money. National party committees \n     would no longer be able to raise or use corporate or labor \n     union treasury funds or unlimited gifts from individuals and \n     PACs. Their revenues would have to come from limited \n     voluntary contributions from individuals, PACs, or other \n     federally registered political committees, such as candidate \n     campaign committees. There would no longer be a need for \n     separate types of bank accounts or complex allocation rules \n     for the financing of different types of party activity.\n       Taking national party committees, federal officeholders and \n     candidates, and their agents and staffs out of the business \n     of raising and spending soft money will change the \n     relationship between donors and federal politicians. It will \n     reduce both the incentive for donors to give in exchange for \n     access and the pressure to give that is created by \n     solicitations from national party leaders or elected \n     officeholders. It will also prevent federal candidates from \n     raising unlimited funds that can be used by party committees \n     to benefit indirectly their own bids for office. We believe \n     that this reform will substantially alter the incentive \n     structure that encourages soft money contributions. As a \n     result, we expect the vast majority of this pool of funds, \n     especially much of the money donated by the business \n     community, to dry up. Most of this money came into the \n     system only during the last two presidential cycles, \n     largely in response to the aggressive fundraising \n     practices of the national party committees. These donors \n     are unlikely to aggressively seek out other means of \n     pouring money into the system.\n       We recognize, however, that this recommendation could be \n     circumvented. Federal officeholders and candidates could \n     still engage in soft money fundraising by shifting their \n     activities to the state level. Federal officials could help \n     their respective state parties raise funds that are not \n     subject to federal limits, and the state parties could in \n     turn use these monies to finance activities, such as voter \n     registration and turnout drives, that influence federal \n     elections in their state. Such activities would diminish the \n     benefits of reforms adopted at the national level.\n       We have carefully considered the proposal to close this \n     ``loophole'' by extending federal regulation to any state \n     party activities that might influence the outcome of a \n     federal election and are financed by contributions not \n     permitted by federal law. But we are very troubled by the \n     prospect of using federal rules to govern state party \n     political finance, especially when these committees are \n     acting in conformance with the laws adopted by the people of \n     their states. Such an approach raises troublesome issues \n     regarding the principle of federalism and the scope of \n     Congress's authority to legislate in this area. Accordingly, \n     we conclude that this issue is most appropriately handled by \n     the states. We therefore urge state legislatures to pass any \n     legislation necessary to ensure that state party committees \n     cannot finance their activities from unrestricted or \n     undisclosed sources of funding.\n       We recognize that a ban on soft money will have a \n     significant effect on the resources available to national \n     party committees and may diminish their role in the electoral \n     process. Soft money represents a substantial share of \n     party revenues and is used to finance many of the costs \n     directly related to the parties' activities, ranging from \n     staff salaries and overhead expenses to voter registration \n     and mobilization efforts. The loss of soft money is likely \n     to reduce such party activities and would require that \n     parties pay more of their administrative and political \n     services costs from funds they raise under federal limits. \n     This, in turn, may lead to a reduction in the amounts of \n     money available for candidate support or voter turnout \n     efforts. Since parties are the only source of private \n     funding (other than personal contributions or loans) that \n     favors challengers, a significant reduction in party \n     resources is likely to decrease the resources available to \n     challengers. It is also likely to reduce the amounts \n     available for voter identification and turnout programs. \n     We believe that these party activities play a valuable \n     role in enhancing the competitiveness of elections and \n     encouraging citizen participation.\n       To partially compensate for this loss, we recommend a \n     change in the rules limiting individual contributions to \n     federal candidates and political committees. Under current \n     law, individuals are limited to an annual total of $25,000 \n     for all contributions made to federal candidates, PACs, and \n     party committees. We propose that Congress establish two \n     separate aggregate limits for individuals. The first would \n     limit the total amount contributed by an individual to \n     federal candidates and PACs to $25,000 annually. The second, \n     separate ceiling would limit the total amount contributed by \n     an individual to national party\n\n[[Page S12672]]\n\n     committees to $25,000 annually. This change will allow \n     parties to raise more regulated money from individuals than \n     is permissible under current federal law.\n\n  Mr. President, how did we get to where we are in this soft money? I \nthink probably one of the best depictions of it is also in chapter 3 of \nthe CED's report. I quote:\n\n       Efforts to regulate the flow of campaign money often \n     produce unintended and unforeseen consequences. Candidates \n     and their staffs, as well as party committees and interest \n     groups, have responded to regulation with imaginative \n     innovations, producing new financial practices unanticipated \n     by lawmakers. The law has also been interpreted by the courts \n     and administrative agencies in unexpected ways, producing new \n     directives that also have encouraged new financial \n     strategies. Both these developments have dramatically \n     increased the flow of money in federal elections and \n     significantly undermined the effectiveness of our federal \n     campaign finance laws.\n       Soft money was not recognized as a form of party finance \n     under the original provisions of FECA. In fact, FECA \n     contained only one narrow exception to the party contribution \n     limits. Parties could receive contributions in unlimited \n     amounts from unlimited sources for ``building funds'' \n     established to pay for new buildings or headquarters \n     structures. Outside of this ``bricks and mortar'' provision, \n     all monies received by parties were subject to federal \n     limits.\n       By 1980, the year of the second presidential election \n     conducted under FECA, these tough prohibitions on party \n     receipts and expenditures had begun to erode, and the door \n     had been opened to unregulated party financial activity. This \n     occurred as a result of problems experienced in the 1976 \n     election and administrative decisions of the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC) that altered the kinds of money parties \n     could raise.\n       In the 1976 election, party leaders quickly recognized that \n     the activities they traditionally financed in conjunction \n     with national elections were significantly hindered by the \n     new system of public financing and spending limits for \n     presidential campaigns. Under the new law, expenditures by a \n     party to help the presidential ticket might be considered in-\n     kind contributions to the candidate or election-related \n     expenditures that were no longer allowed. Parties therefore \n     looked to the presidential campaigns to fund much of the \n     paraphernalia used in traditional volunteer activities, such \n     as signs, bumper stickers, and buttons, as well as voter \n     registration and turnout activities. But the presidential \n     campaigns, now faced with limited funds and wanting to \n     maximize the resources available for television advertising, \n     did not allocate substantial amounts to these other \n     activities that parties considered important. As a result, \n     party leaders appealed to Congress after the election to \n     change the law so that they could finance volunteer and \n     party-building activities without risking a violation of the \n     law.\n       Congress responded to these concerns and in 1979 amended \n     FECA to exempt very specific, narrowly defined party \n     activities from the definitions of ``expenditure'' and \n     ``contribution'' contained in the Act. Thus, parties were \n     allowed to spend unlimited amounts on grassroots, party-\n     building activities and generic party activities such as \n     voter registration and turnout drives. They were also \n     permitted to spend unlimited amounts on such traditional \n     campaign materials as bumper stickers, buttons, and slate \n     cards. But the Congress did not change the rules on party \n     fundraising: the monies spent on these activities had to come \n     from ``hard money'' donations subject to federal contribution \n     limits. Congress also specified that none of these unlimited \n     expenditures could pay for mass public communications, such \n     as direct mail or television advertising.\n       At the same time that Congress was making these changes in \n     the law, party officials were asking the FEC to decide \n     another set of issues related to general party activities. \n     The parties argued that their organizations were involved not \n     only in federal but also in non-federal election activity, \n     such as supporting candidates in state-level races and \n     building party support at the state and local level. \n     Furthermore, many generic party activities, such as voter \n     registration and turnout drives, are conducted to help both \n     federal and non-federal candidates. The parties therefore \n     contended that the finance rules should recognize the non-\n     federal role of party organizations and allow parties to \n     partially finance their political activity with monies \n     subject only to state laws.\n       The FEC responded to these questions with a series of \n     ruling that recognized the non-federal role of state and \n     national party organizations. These rulings allowed parties \n     to finance a share of their activities with money raised \n     under state law if they maintained separate accounts for \n     federal and non-federal funds. Subsequent rules established \n     complex allocation formulas that determined the shares of \n     particular expenditures that had to be allocated to federal \n     and non-federal accounts.\n       Thus was born the distinction between ``hard'' and ``soft'' \n     money. Hard (federal) money is subject to federal \n     contribution limits and is the only type of funding that can \n     be used to support federal candidates directly. All \n     contributions to federal candidates, coordinated \n     expenditures, or independent expenditures made in federal \n     contests must use hard money. Soft (non-federal) money is \n     exempt from federal limits and can be used to finance general \n     party activities, including such activities as voter \n     registration drives, even though these activities may \n     indirectly influence federal elections, for example, by \n     encouraging more party members to vote.\n       The FEC's decisions essentially freed parties to engage in \n     unlimited fundraising as long as they abided by the technical \n     requirements of the law. They could now raise (and spend) \n     monies obtained from sources that were banned from \n     participating in federal elections or from individuals and \n     PACs that had already donated the legal maximum. These \n     changes in the rules thus gave parties a strong incentive to \n     raise soft money.\n\n\n                        the growth of soft money\n\n       Parties quickly adapted to the new regulatory environment. \n     At first, soft money was primarily raised in presidential \n     election years for use on voter registration and turnout \n     operations. But the parties soon expanded the role of soft \n     money by expanding the range of activities that could be paid \n     for with these funds. They also began to raise soft money \n     more aggressively, soliciting ever larger sums.\n       Since 1980, soft money has grown rapidly. In 1980, the \n     Republican and Democratic national party committees spent a \n     total of about $19 million in soft money, with the \n     Republicans disbursing $15 million and the Democrats $4 \n     million. Much the same pattern existed in 1984. By 1988, \n     however, the amount of soft money had more than doubled to \n     $45 million, shared about equally between the two major \n     parties. By 1992, soft money had almost doubled again to $80 \n     million, with the Republicans spending $47 million to the \n     Democrats' $33 million.\n       Yet the soft money raised in those elections pales in \n     comparison to that raised in 1996 and 1998. In the \n     Presidential election cycle of 1996 the two major parties \n     raised $262 million in soft money, more than three times the \n     amount garnered only four years earlier. (See Figure 5.) The \n     Republican committees solicited more than $138 million and \n     the Democratic committees $124 million. In contrast, hard \n     money increased much more slowly. Democratic hard money \n     increased by 59 percent over 1992, and Republican funds by 71 \n     percent.\n       Similarly, soft money fundraising in 1998 was up \n     dramatically over the previous off-year election cycle of \n     1994. As of 20 days after the election, the national party \n     committees had raised $201 million in soft money, close to \n     twice the $107 million they had raised in the entire 1994 \n     election cycle. The Republicans had raised $111.3 million, \n     compared with $52.5 million in 1994, an increase of 112 \n     percent; the Democrats had raised $89.4 million, 82 percent \n     more than the $49.1 million four years earlier.\n       The share of total party funds represented by soft money \n     has also increased substantially. In 1992, for example, soft \n     money constituted 26 percent of the receipts of all three \n     Democratic national party committees. By 1998 the soft-money \n     share had risen to 37 percent. For the three Republican \n     national party committees, the proportion rose from 20 \n     percent to 29 percent during the same six years.\n\n\n                       the sources of soft money\n\n       Soft money has grown rapidly because both parties have been \n     increasingly successful in soliciting large soft money gifts. \n     Since at least 1988, both parties have had organized programs \n     to recruit large donors. In 1992, for example, the DNC and \n     RNC raised a total of $63 million in soft money, about 30 \n     percent of which came from contributors of $100,000 or more. \n     The parties have also been successful in soliciting major \n     contributions from corporations and, primarily in the \n     Democratic Party, labor unions. The parties have thus \n     succeeded in gaining access to contributions from sources and \n     in amounts that were prohibited by the campaign finance \n     reforms of the 1970s.\n       According to an analysis by the FEC, the parties have \n     raised an increasingly large number of contributions in this \n     manner. During the 1992 election cycle, the national party \n     committees' soft money accounts accepted at least 381 \n     individual contributions in excess of $20,000 (the annual \n     federal party contribution limit) and about 11,000 \n     contributions from sources that are prohibited from giving in \n     federal elections, particularly corporations and labor \n     unions. By the 1996 election cycle, these figures had more \n     than doubled. The national party committees received nearly \n     1,000 individual contributions of more than $20,000 and \n     approximately 27,000 contributions from sources prohibited \n     from giving hard money.\n       The business community is by far the most important source \n     of soft money, as shown in Table 5 (page 26). According to \n     one independent analysis, businesses provided $55.9 million \n     of the $102.2 million in soft money received by national \n     party committees during the 1994 election cycle. In 1998, \n     these organizations had donated more than $105 million of the \n     more than $200 million received through October. The vast \n     majority of this money came from corporations rather than \n     trade associations or other incorporated organizations. These \n     figures do not, of course, include individual contributions \n     made by members of the business community.\n       A substantial share of this money came from large \n     contributions. In 1998 at least 218 corporations donated more \n     than $100,000, compared with 96 that gave this amount in \n     1994. Sixteen corporations gave $500,000 or\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\n     more, whereas only four gave at this level four years \n     earlier.\n       Further evidence of the role of business contributions in \n     the growth of soft money is found in a 1997 analysis \n     conducted by the Los Angeles Times, which found that soft \n     money donations made by the 544 largest public and private \n     U.S. companies had more than tripled between 1992 and 1996, \n     growing from $16 million to $51 million. In comparison, the \n     contributions made by PACs, maintained by these companies \n     rose only from $43 million to $52 million.\n       The largest soft money donors tend to be companies or \n     industries that are heavily regulated by the federal \n     government or those whose profits can be dramatically \n     affected by government policy. For example, according to the \n     Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of 1996 donors:\n       ``Tobacco companies and their executives, who have faced \n     concerted federal efforts to strengthen the regulations \n     governing tobacco sales and advertising, as well as the \n     possibility of congressional action to settle ongoing \n     lawsuits, gave a total of $6.83 million in 1996, with $5.77 \n     million donated to the Republicans and $1.06 million to the \n     Democrats. This group was led by Philip Morris, which donated \n     the most soft money of all contributors in 1996, giving a \n     total of about $3 million, $2.52 million of which went to the \n     Republicans. RJR Nabisco gave a total of $1.44 million, with \n     $1.18 million going to the Republicans.''\n  There is a study by Professor Kathleen Jamieson of the Annenberg \nSchool at the University of Pennsylvania, in which she describes not \nonly the political contributions of the tobacco companies but the \namount of lobbying fees which, according to her, is the most in the \nhistory of American politics.\n  I will be reading that and inserting it in the Record at the proper \ntime. It goes on to list a number of the large contributions.\n  Finally, the effects of soft money on the political system. This is \nthe view, of course, of the CED:\n\n       The rise of soft money has greatly increased the flow of \n     money in national elections and has turned party fundraising \n     into a frenetic and never ending chase for large \n     contributions. As the range of party activities financed with \n     soft money has increased, party organizations have engaged in \n     more aggressive and directed efforts to raise soft dollars. \n     The parties therefore have sought ever larger amounts from \n     soft money donors and have pursued new sources of soft money \n     contributions, especially among members of the business \n     community.\n       One of the primary ways parties obtain very large \n     contributions is by providing donors with access to federal \n     elected officials. The most highly publicized and \n     controversial example of the access and privilege afforded \n     soft money donors is the use of the White House during the \n     1996 election cycle as a venue for dinners and other events \n     with President Clinton. While money was not raised at these \n     events, they were clearly designed to reward past soft money \n     donors and stimulate future contributions. Published reports \n     of these sessions sparked a controversy that raised serious \n     questions as to whether access to the White House was for \n     sale and fueled public cynicism about the influence enjoyed \n     by wealthy contributors. Further examination of the \n     Democratic Party's public disclosure reports revealed that \n     the Democratic National Committee had deposited at least $3 \n     million in illegal or questionable contributions into their \n     soft money accounts.\n       The Democratic Party's 1996 fundraising activities, \n     however, are only one example of the consequences of \n     unrestricted party fundraising. In recent years, both major \n     parties have offered soft money donors access to elected \n     leaders in exchange for contributions. White House officials \n     and congressional leaders have been asked to appear at party \n     soft money fund-raisers, participate in party-sponsored \n     policy briefings, attend weekend retreats with donors, and \n     play a role in other small group meetings. Elected officials \n     have even been recruited by the party committees to solicit \n     soft money donations from potential contributors, especially \n     from their own financial supporters and others with whom they \n     have relationships.\n       Federal officeholders have thus assisted their parties in \n     raising funds for issue advocacy advertising, voter \n     registration, election day turnout drives, and other \n     activities that directly benefit their own campaigns for \n     office. They have also participated in fundraising efforts \n     directed at donors whose interests are directly influenced by \n     federal policy decisions. Such activities place undue \n     pressure on potential donors. Businesses, in particular, are \n     induced to contribute to keep up with their competitors or \n     ensure their own access to lawmakers.\n       Given the size and source of most soft money contributions, \n     the public cannot help but believe that these donors enjoy \n     special influence and receive special favors. The suspicion \n     of corruption deepens public cynicism and diminishes public \n     confidence in government. More important, these activities \n     raise the likelihood of actual corruption. Indeed, we believe \n     it is only a matter of time before another major scandal \n     develops within the soft money system.\n\n  Mr. President, I have often said that the scandal in Washington in \n1996 was not Monica Lewinsky. The scandal in Washington was a \ndebasement of virtually every institution of government carried out by \nthe Clinton administration when the Lincoln Bedroom was rented out, \nwhen access to the President--I think it was Mr. Chung who said the \nWhite House is like the subway: You have to put in money in order to \nopen the gates.\n  I have a memo that is a public document. It is a memo from the \nDemocratic National Committee to the White House that lists activities \nto be coordinated with the White House by the DNC for $100,000 givers \nand says--I think it is the third or fourth item on the list--seats on \nofficial trade missions. That was the scandal in Washington, and the \nongoing scandal, of course, is the failure of the Attorney General to \npursue these very well documented allegations.\n  I do agree with the CED when they say at the end: ``Indeed, we \nbelieve it is only a matter of time before another major scandal \ndevelops within the soft money system.''\n  That is what we are trying to prevent. We had a spirited debate \nyesterday about this issue, and I tried to point out that I think these \nhuge amounts of money have made decent and good people do things they \nshould not otherwise do. That is an example which should be cited in \nthese scandals I just described in the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.\n  We have to try to restrain the system. I am fully aware it will never \nbe completely the kind of system we want it to be, but I also will at a \nlater time, because I have been talking a long time, chronicle that \nthroughout American history we have had cycles. We have had cycles \nwhere the system has been cleaned up, as Teddy Roosevelt was able to do \nin 1907. I continue to quote extensively from him and read him as he \ntalks about the corrupting influence of the robber barons at the turn \nof the century.\n  Then we had, of course, the scandals of 1974 which caused us to clean \nup again. And if we succeed in cleaning up this system 10, 15, or 20 \nyears from now, we will be back--maybe not me, maybe not Russ Feingold, \nmaybe not Senator McConnell or Senator Bennett, but there will be \nothers who will be back because we know that money in politics flows \nlike water through cracks.\n  What I read was how we had gone in the 1970s from a virtual \nnonexistence of the so-called soft money to the point where we are now \nawash in it. Sooner or later we will clean this up, and then sooner or \nlater, unfortunately, it will need cleaning up again. That is why \nlegislatures do not go into session and adjourn permanently.\n  In 1986, we cleaned up the Tax Code. We did a good job. We took 3 \nmillion Americans off the tax rolls, something I think overall, despite \nsome flaws associated with it, was a good bill. We need to clean up the \nTax Code again. It is now 44,000 pages long. We need to change it from \nthe cornucopia of good deals for special interests and a chamber of \nhorrors for average American citizens.\n  Why should a lower- or middle-income American have to go to an \naccountant to fill out their tax return? Why is it that it is 44,000 \npages long? Why is it that we cannot break the grip of the teachers \nunions to reform education? Why is it we cannot come together \nreasonably and give patients who are members of HMOs decent, reasoned, \nbalanced rights? Why is it that we cannot restructure the military so \nwe can meet the challenges of the future we face in the next century? \nEvents around the world have, again, amply demonstrated, such as in \nPakistan, we ought to be able to cope with some very serious challenges \nin the next century in the military, but we cannot restructure it. It \ntakes 2 months to get 24 Apache helicopters from Germany to Albania. \nThey train and crash two, and we never use them in the conflict.\n\n  We need to move forward on this issue. We need to do it, and I hope \nthe sponsors of the amendment that is presently under consideration \nwill recognize this is the same amendment which stalled us out last \ntime. I believe we can make progress by moving forward with an amending \nprocess which requires votes which requires debate. I believe we can do \nthat.\n  I commend to my colleagues, particularly on my side of the aisle, who\n\n[[Page S12674]]\n\nare involved with the business community, this little booklet. Major \nexecutives, major corporations in America have become sick and tired of \nbeing sick and tired. I cannot tell how many of them have told me--and \nI am sure they have told my colleagues privately--they are tired of the \nphone calls, they are tired of being dunned, they are tired of being \ncalled upon to give to both parties.\n  Senator McConnell said yesterday, in response to the comment that the \nmajor corporations now give to both parties, they have a right to be \nduplicitous.\n  I do not deny him that right to be duplicitous. I hope we could \narrange a system where they do not feel they have to be duplicitous. \nThat is what this object is all about.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their patience and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are a number of Republican \nSenators anxious to offer amendments, and I would like to create an \nenvironment in which people can come over, offer their amendment, \ndiscuss it, and lay it aside.\n  Senator Bennett has been sitting here patiently for some time. He and \nSenator Burns have an important amendment related to the Internet.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the pending two amendments be laid \naside in order for Senator Bennett to offer an amendment, along with \nSenator Burns, regarding Internet free speech, and that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment. I further ask----\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I finish?\n  I further ask consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the \namendment at 5:30 p.m., on Monday, and there be 5 minutes, equally \ndivided, for closing remarks just prior to the vote, and following the \ndebate today, the amendment be laid aside until that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, I say to \nmy friend from Kentucky, these amendments can still be offered, but we \nthink they should not be offered to the two amendments that are \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what we have is a debate that is \nproceeding in such a way that amendments are not being allowed.\n  One of the things we talked about this year, and Senator McCain \nindicated he wanted, was an open debate, in which Senators would be \nable to lay down their amendments, get debate, and get votes.\n  I say to all of my colleagues, we have Senator Bennett and Senator \nBurns here with a very important amendment they would like to get \noffered. Senator Sessions is on the floor. He has an amendment he would \nlike to offer. Senator Thompson and Senator Lieberman have an amendment \nthey would like to offer. Senator Nickles has an amendment he would \nlike to offer; Senator Hatch, in all likelihood. Senator Hagel has \nindicated he may be offering an amendment, as well.\n  We have an opportunity here to lay down and discuss these amendments, \nlay them aside, and guarantee these Senators an opportunity to vote.\n  I am somewhat confused about where we are. I thought the whole idea \nbehind having 4 or 5 days of debate, I would say to my friend from \nArizona--although he did not object; it was the assistant minority \nleader--I guess I am perplexed about where we are. I would like to \nprotect the opportunity of my colleagues on the Republican side to \noffer amendments about which they feel strongly about.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to retain the floor, but I will be glad to \nyield for some observation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield to me?\n  First of all, I believe we should move forward and have amendments. I \nwould like to discuss it with all of us discussing it, go into a quorum \ncall in a second, if we might.\n  First of all, I would like to frame a parliamentary inquiry very \nquickly.\n  Mr. President, if an amendment in the nature of a substitute were to \nbe offered, how many votes would be needed to affirmatively adopt the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate his question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If an amendment in the nature of a substitute were to be \noffered, how many votes would be needed to affirmatively adopt the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking in terms of a simple \nmajority?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am asking, if an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A simple majority would be required.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If such an amendment were adopted, and it contained a new \nrules change, how many votes would be required to invoke cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty seven, if 100 Senators are voting.\n  Mr. McCAIN. During consideration of the pending, underlying \nlegislation, would such an amendment be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My point is, a little parliamentary tactic was played \nearly yesterday which did not start things off in the manner which we \nhad sort of hoped it would--that a rule was adopted that now requires \n67 votes. But as most parliamentary tactics, it can be negated by a \nsimple substitute amendment that could be propounded by any Senator, \nwhich amendment, in the form of a substitute, would then negate the \nrule change, which then would bring us back to the position that we are \nof 60 votes.\n  So I say to my friend from Kentucky, when we agree to further \namendments or we agree to his unanimous consent request--which none of \nus has seen, which the Senator did not take the time to show me--we \nhave to be a little bit careful and cautious as to what we agree to.\n  So I want to move forward. I want to move forward with amendments. I \nwill be glad to go into a quorum call and sit down with all of the \nSenators present on the floor and see if we can't work something out.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I still have the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I did not yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky yielded to the \nSenator from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. I asked if the Senator would yield. I did not ask if \nthe Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. He did not ask me to yield the floor, and I did not \nyield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, might I suggest a solution to the \nproblem of my friend from Arizona. He might want to look at the \namendments. If he does not find them offensive, maybe he would want to \ngive his Republican colleagues an opportunity to lay down their \namendments, to discuss them, and lay them aside, with the understanding \nthat, obviously, they would get a vote at someplace down the road, \nunless they were filibustered.\n  I would ask my friend from Arizona, what would be wrong in taking a \nlook at the amendments, one by one, and if they met the Senator's \napproval, maybe he would give our Republican colleagues an opportunity \nto have some votes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator would allow----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I cannot ask you a question. I can only answer. You can \nyield the floor, and I will be glad to yield the floor back.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do not yield the floor, but there must be some way \nfor the Senator from Arizona to express himself. I will be glad to \nyield to him for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will try to frame it as a question.\n  Is the Senator aware that up until half an hour ago we were not \nallowed to see the amendment nor have we been able to see your proposed \nunanimous consent request--we were not allowed to look at it. Now we \nhave a\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\nchance to look at it. We would be glad to look at it, but I still say, \nif the Senator from Kentucky wants to really move forward, then we go \ninto a quorum call, we sit down, as has been my habit in 13 years on \nthe floor here, and see if we cannot work out an agreement. If we \ncannot, then we will not. But that is the way we usually do it.\n  I want to assure the Senator from Kentucky that, from my viewpoint, \nas long as we are protected, as long as we can make sure this is a \nstraightforward process, then I am eager for additional amendments to \nbe considered when debate on this particular amendment has been \nconsumed.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Might I suggest the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from Utah have a discussion about \nthis while I make some remarks. Maybe the Senator from Arizona might be \nsatisfied that there is no chicanery afoot here between the Senator \nfrom Utah and the Senator from Montana. Might I suggest to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, since the objection came from the assistant Democratic \nleader, you might want to include him in the discussion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kentucky, in response to a question \nasked by the Senator from Arizona, the Senator stated to me--and it was \nreported in the press this morning--that the Senator yesterday, in the \neffort with the amendment for a rules change, has indicated that the \nintent of the Senator from Kentucky was to change the rule, not to \nchange the number of Senators it would take to invoke cloture in this \nmatter. The Senator has stated, as I said, publicly and stated to me \npersonally that in this matter we would only need 60 votes.\n  Is that what the Senator said?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is exactly what the Senator said. I am not \nprepared to withdraw that yet, as Senator McCain indicated that that \ncould be displaced, in any event, by some substitute, which the Senator \nfrom Nevada has already offered. I reject the notion that there is some \ndevious notion at work. Besides, I don't even want to get into that. \nThe only issue before us, I say to the Senator from Nevada, is whether \nor not we can get consent to have some other Senators take advantage --\nwe have had all this discussion about having an open debate on campaign \nfinance reform. We can't even get amendments laid down for discussion. \nWe are not talking about controversial amendments, I don't think. \nPeople do have the option to vote against them.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Senator has indicated there are two \namendments the Senator wishes, he and/or his colleagues, to file today. \nI have stated that as far as the two amendments pending, one by Senator \nDaschle and one by this Senator, we would not agree to set those aside. \nHowever, the record is quite clear; there are two spots still open in \nthe tree that these Senators could file their amendments any time they \nwant today. All they need is recognition.\n  Mr. McCAIN.  Will the Senator from Kentucky yield again for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to make a parliamentary \ninquiry with respect to the amending process in relation to what the \nSenator from Nevada just suggested. Is it true that a first and second-\ndegree amendment are pending, as offered by the minority leader and the \nassistant minority leader, that would take consent to lay aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it true that although two additional amendment \nslots are available to offer amendments, if amendments were offered and \nagreed to, and an amendment offered by the minority leader was \nsubsequently adopted, the action taken on the two additional amendment \nslots would, in effect, become moot?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With this record now made by the Chair, I regret that \nour Democratic colleagues are blocking amendment consideration during \nthis campaign finance reform bill. What we are trying to do is to give \nRepublican Senators an opportunity to offer amendments. If I understand \nthe Chair correctly, where we are is that without consent, either from \nthe assistant Democratic leader or the Senator from Arizona, my \nRepublican colleagues are not going to be able to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to tell the Senator that the Senator from Montana \nand the Senator from Utah and I and the Senator from Wisconsin are in \nagreement that an amendment by Senator Bennett and Senator Conrad would \nbe in order, unless the Senator from Wisconsin has additional comments \nabout the pending amendment, but that it is also proper and appropriate \nto continue the debate until finished on the pending amendment and \nthat, of course, we would like to make sure that any unanimous consent \nagreement we are in agreement with. I hope the Democratic leader would \nalso agree with that approach to the pending business because I am not \nin any way in disagreement with the view of the Senator from Kentucky \nthat we need to move forward with the process.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Maybe I should make \nthe consent request again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending two amendments be laid aside \nin order for Senator Bennett and Senator Burns to offer an amendment \nregarding Internet free speech and that no second-degree amendments be \nin order prior to the vote in relation to the amendment. I further ask \nconsent that the vote occur on or in relation to the amendment at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday, and that there be 5 minutes equally divided for closing \nremarks just prior to the vote and, following the debate today, the \namendment be laid aside until that time.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment, which I personally haven't \nseen, but I am sure has been shared with the staff, we have not had an \nopportunity to discuss, to even show the amendment to the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, both of whom are tremendously interested in anything dealing \nwith the Internet. First of all, to lock in a time, that is something \nwe couldn't do.\n  Secondly, I say to my friend from Kentucky, there are no more votes \nuntil 5:30. That is an announcement made by the majority leader. So we \nare not stopping anyone from voting. That decision has been made by the \nmajority. We would have been happy to stay and vote. I have been here \nthe last several days anyway. If there had been some notice there would \nbe votes, other people would be here.\n  I say there is ample opportunity to talk about any of these issues in \nwhatever length anyone cares to. We have a vote scheduled at 5:30 on a \njudicial nomination or whatever the majority leader decides. We have \ncloture votes that are going to take place on Tuesday. I think we have \nplenty to do on this.\n\n  I might say in passing that I think now the majority knows how we \nfeel all the time when we can't offer amendments to pending \nlegislation. On this legislation, we have two amendments that have been \nfiled: One dealing with the Shays-Meehan legislation, and one dealing \nwith the so-called soft money amendment. That is what this debate is \nall about. That is what it should focus on. Objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me try another approach, if I may. I heard the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader say the time was a problem. \nLet me try it a different way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending two amendments be laid aside \nin order for Senator Bennett and Senator Burns to offer an amendment \nregarding Internet free speech, and that\n\n[[Page S12676]]\n\nfollowing the reporting by the clerk, the amendment be laid aside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I will not \nobject. I think it is important that we move forward. I think there are \nSenators on the floor who want to propose amendments and who want to \ndebate. I want to say--perhaps this is the only time in this entire \ndebate the Senator from Kentucky and I are in total agreement--that we \nshould allow an amendment by Senator Bennett and Senator Burns, even if \nI am not in agreement with that amendment. I think it is very \ndestructive of the entire proposition with which we began this debate, \nand that is that we would allow amendments and votes. I do not object.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I say this: \nThese amendments can be offered. There is no question they can be \noffered. It has already been indicated that they be offered. There are \ntwo spots still open on the tree. Objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am told by the parliamentary experts \nwho serve us that to amend the rest of the tree is essentially a waste \nof time. So as a practical matter, what our Democratic colleagues are \ndoing is preventing Republicans from offering amendments. This has the \nresult of putting us back to the way we have handled this in the past, \nwhich the Senator from Arizona and I thought the other side had agreed \nwe would not do this time, which was to allow amendments. The practical \neffect of where we are now is we are going to have two cloture votes, \nwhich is the way this issue has been dealt with in recent years, and it \nprevents Senators from offering amendments, having them debated, and \nhaving them voted on. I think that is unfortunate.\n  Mr. President, on the substance of the issue, unless there is some \nchange of heart on the part of my good friend from Nevada, and I see \nhe, with a determined look on his face, has taken his seat, I assume \nthe last word on that issue has been uttered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I prevail one more time on the Senator from \nKentucky to yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. According to the parliamentary exchange that I heard \nbetween you and the President, the Senator from Utah still can offer an \namendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. He can offer an amendment, but if their amendment were \nadopted, his is wiped out. What I am told is it, in effect, makes the \noffering of the amendment an exercise in futility. That is what I am \nadvised.\n  Mr. McCAIN. By the brains?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, by our super-Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his response.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Arizona for being willing to \nlet our colleagues offer their amendments. Let me repeat, where that \nleaves us is we have been shut out, as a practical matter, by the other \nside and denied an opportunity to offer important amendments that many \nof us believe would have improved this bill.\n  I want to encourage Senator Burns and Senator Bennett, who are on the \nfloor, to go ahead and say what they would have done had they had the \nopportunity to do it. I think this is a very constructive amendment, \nand if they will just indulge me for one moment, I will yield the \nfloor, and I hope they get an opportunity to discuss the amendment they \nwould have offered had they had an opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I assume we will have a vote on the \nDemocratic amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There are two cloture votes. The Democratic leader \nlaid down what is typically referred to as Shays-Meehan, the bill that \npassed the House. The assistant Democratic leader second-degreed that \nwith the underlying ``McCain-Feingold lite'' and filed cloture on both.\n  Under the rules of the Senate, those votes would occur Tuesday \nmorning. The dilemma we now have is, we are in a position where \ncolleagues on our side of the aisle are unable to offer amendments.\n  What I suggest to my friend from Montana is----\n  Mr. BURNS. Once the cloture vote has been taken and cloture is not \nagreed to, then what happens?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the Republican leader will have concluded \nthat, after 5 days of this debate, we would go on to other matters \nbefore the Senate. From a parliamentary point of view, we will be right \nwhere we are now if cloture is not invoked. So all that will have \nhappened is, Senators such as you and the Senator from Utah will have \nbeen denied the opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will we move off this issue and go to another issue?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is my understanding. The majority leader has \nother important matters he would like the Senate to turn to after \nTuesday. That is his decision.\n  What I suggest to both of the Senators, who have been waiting \npatiently, is to describe the amendment that would have been offered \nhad the Senator been given an opportunity to do so, and put that in the \nRecord. Maybe at some point between now and Tuesday, there will be some \nchange of heart. But I think we ought to say to the Senate what the \nSenator wanted to be able to do had he been permitted.\n  Mr. BURNS. I have a very short statement on that. I will yield to the \nadvice of the Senator from Kentucky and also yield to my good friend \nfrom Utah as to what he would like to do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I don't have a time schedule today. I \nwill spend the entire weekend in the Washington area. My friend from \nMontana has an airplane to catch, so I am happy to step aside and let \nhim make whatever statement he wants to make and delay my comments \nuntil he has finished.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment that was crafted by Senator Bennett and myself is a \nvery important amendment regarding this business of freedom of speech \nand how it is connected to the issue of campaign finance reform. What \nthe amendment actually says is that citizens who use the Internet to \nexpress themselves politically are not subject to ``Big Brother'' \npolicing imposed by the Federal election bureaucrats. The amendment \nsimply prevents the FEC from defining political communications by \nindividuals over the Internet as campaign contributions.\n\n  I thank my friend from Utah for his input when we crafted this \namendment. I should emphasize to my colleagues that this amendment is \nvery narrow in scope and covers only individuals who don't receive \ncompensation for their Internet communications. I think that is very \nimportant--individuals who do not receive compensation for their \nInternet communications. Further, these individuals cannot solicit \npolitical contributions using the Internet.\n  If an American citizen feels strongly enough about a candidate or an \nissue to create a web site to express his views, he should not be \nsubject to oversight by the Federal Election Commission. Free \nexpression is the founding principle of this country.\n  Currently--and not a surprise to those of us who have seen the \nexplosion of the Internet--there are 90 million Americans who use the \nWorld Wide Web to access information, e-mail, and other services every \nday. Undoubtedly, many of these communications are political in nature. \nAre we to expect the FEC to somehow monitor and regulate all of this \npolitical dialog? To me, that is a very chilling scenario.\n  I myself use the unique capabilities of the Internet for a host of \nthings--to communicate with my constituents, for services. We have a \nweb page that allows my constituents access to my office \nelectronically. Every week, I do a ``cybercast'' from my web site, \nwhere I answer questions posed to me by my constituents from Montana \nand across the country.\n  By the way, once you go on the web, you are everywhere. Just \nyesterday, in my cybercast, I commented on the tremendous, productive \ndebate that has\n\n[[Page S12677]]\n\nresulted from the increased use of this great thing we call the \nInternet. It allows any individual to become a publisher and have the \nsame access in the marketplace of ideas as the largest political party, \nor corporation, for that matter.\n  We have seen the leveling of marketing because one person with an \nidea for a service or goods can now go on the web and take on the \nlargest corporations and be successful. That is what makes it a very \npowerful tool.\n  We have seen spectacular growth result from the upward spiral of the \nInternet. A recent Commerce Department study has indicated that over a \nthird of the U.S. increase in gross domestic product since 1995 is \ndirectly traceable to information technologies and, in particular, the \nInternet. Small businesses and individuals have used those capabilities \nof this new tool to tap into global markets and compete directly with \nlarge corporations.\n  Even more important than the raw economic numbers, however, is the \nflowering of the discussion of ideas that has been fostered by the \nInternet. Whether on web sites, chat rooms, or e-mail, the revolution \nin information technology has resulted in the ongoing, vigorous, \nsustained debates on the critical issues that now face our country.\n  A year ago, I was in China and there, too, as the capability grows, \nthe Internet grows--not as fast as we have experienced here in this \ncountry, because of infrastructure more than anything else, but it is \ngrowing. And with it is a growing fear in that country where the \nGovernment controls every aspect of information; the fear of the \nfreedom of flow on the Internet is very real.\n  The Internet uniquely provides the ability for any individual to \nexpress his political beliefs, and we think that should not be \ninfringed upon. To limit free speech of individuals in the very country \nthat created the Internet is as dangerous as it is misguided. As \nchairman of the Senate Communications Subcommittee, and cochairman of \nthe Internet Caucus, I have been convinced time and time again of the \nfolly of trying to regulate the Internet.\n  Government should not impose burdensome regulations on political \nspeech on the Internet, or any other medium. Instead, the Government \nshould act to keep the Internet and those medium outlets a free speech \nzone.\n  I urge my colleagues, if this amendment sees the light of day and \ncomes to this floor, to adopt this amendment as part of the ongoing \nreform.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend from Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Montana leaves for \nMontana, he can offer his amendment. The Senator from Utah can offer \nhis amendment to two slots to which I previously referred. If they are \nsubsequently adopted, they could try to defeat, of course, the Daschle-\nReid amendments by votes, or after the Reid amendment is disposed of, \nthey could still offer their amendments to the Daschle amendment. In \nshort, there are occasions in the Senate when it doesn't work by \nmajority rule but most of the time majority rules. In this instance, \nthe majority rules. All they need to do is pass this amendment and \ndefeat the Reid-Daschle amendment.\n  It is a very simple procedure. They can offer their amendments. They \nnot only can talk about them but they can offer both of them.\n  Remember the procedure we are now working under. There will be no \nvotes this day or on Monday until 5:30. We will come in sometime \nMonday. There will be further discussion on this bill. There are people \non my side of the aisle, on the minority side, who still want to talk \nabout the bill.\n  Also, there has been some talk about pulling down this bill on \nTuesday. Of course, it is 5 days. I know the majority leader recognizes \nthe fifth day is on Wednesday. But also, you can't automatically go to \nsomething else. It takes, again, a majority vote to do that.\n  As I have indicated, all they need are majority votes to adopt the \nBurns amendment and the Bennett amendment and have a majority vote to \ngo to some other issue rather than campaign finance reform.\n  We are operating, we think, in good faith. There are still two spots \nto offer their amendments. If there are two Senators who wish to offer \ntheir amendments, they can certainly do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as a practical matter, I repeat what I \nsaid earlier. The offering of amendments to the rest of the tree would \nbe a waste of time. Several of the amendments my colleagues want to \noffer would not be germane postcloture.\n  We are, as a result of the actions of the other side, on a glidepath \nto two cloture votes on Tuesday. But we will have an opportunity to \ndiscuss amendments that would have been offered could they have been \noffered and that would have been offered, if this parliamentary \nsituation would have allowed it.\n  I encourage, in addition, Senator Burns, who has already talked about \nhis amendment, and Senators Sessions, Thompson, Lieberman, Nickles, \nHatch, and Hagel to take the opportunity--if not today at least on \nMonday--to come over to the Senate and describe the amendments they \nwould have offered and put them in the Record so everyone is aware of \nthe opportunities that were missed.\n  I was listening with some interest to the Senator from Arizona \nearlier in describing what he perceived to be the position of the \nbusiness community in this country with regard to non-Federal money. \nThe Senator described the views of a business group which until a few \nmonths ago no one had ever heard of, and more specifically the \nrecommendations of a subcommittee of that group that was dominated by \nbusinessmen who have contributed to Democrats over 2-to-1 and leaving \nout of the description the remainder of that business groups' views on \ncampaign finance reform, which are for public funding, taxpayer \nfunding, of elections and spending limits, which is such a bizarre \nposition these days. It hasn't even been advocated by the other side in \nthe last few years. I think it is safe to say that this little-known \nbusiness group does not represent the views of American business.\n  Let me take a few moments to outline the views of American business \non the issue before us.\n  There are 10 business groups representing over 4 million businesses, \nand 40 million employees representing the Business and Industry \nPolitical Action Committee, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nMining Association, the National Restaurant Association, the National \nAssociation of Realtors, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nNational Association of Business Political Action Committees, the \nAssociated Builders and Contractors, the National Association of \nWholesaler-Distributors, and the National Association of Broadcasters, \na media group, all of whom signed the following letter:\n\n       As the leading business associations in America, we oppose \n     the current campaign finance reform legislation being debated \n     in the Senate and strongly oppose that which recently passed \n     the U.S. House of Representatives. * * * the tenets of \n     McCain-Feingold and the House-passed Shays-Meehan Bill run \n     contrary to the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of \n     speech.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Further regulating issue advocacy should be rejected as an \n     infringement on the basic right of free speech. We are also \n     concerned that these bills decrease opportunities and \n     incentives for citizen participation in the election process.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Just as over-regulation distorts the commercial \n     marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the marketplace \n     of political ideas.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord, as well as an excellent letter from the National Association of \nManufacturers on the same subject, and a letter by the Chamber of \nCommerce on the same subject.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Business-Industry Political\n\n\n                                  Action Committee of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. --\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear --: As the leading business associations in America, \n     we oppose the current campaign finance reform legislation \n     being debated in the Senate and strongly oppose that which \n     recently passed the U.S. House of\n\n[[Page S12678]]\n\n     Representatives. While most of the nation's business \n     community agrees with the need for some meaningful reform of \n     the Federal laws regarding campaign finance, the tenets of \n     McCain-Feingold and the House-passed Shays-Meehan Bill run \n     contrary to the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of \n     speech.\n       This week, the U.S. Supreme Court will be hearing yet \n     another case on the constitutionality of limiting free \n     speech. Further regulating issue advocacy should be rejected \n     as an infringement of the basic right of free speech. We are \n     also concerned that these bills decrease opportunities and \n     incentives for citizen participation in the election process.\n       Comprehensive campaign finance legislation has not been \n     passed since 1974 and contribution caps established at that \n     time have not been adjusted for inflation. The maximum \n     contribution of $1,000 in 1974 is worth only $303 today. \n     These artificially low ceilings have forced candidates and \n     political parties to seek alternative ways to finance \n     effective participation in the election process. Candidates \n     now have more voters to reach and the cost of campaigning \n     continues to rise.\n       Just as over-regulation distorts the commercial \n     marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the marketplace \n     of political ideas. Rather than regulating more, we would \n     suggest both complete and immediate disclosure of all \n     campaign contributions and raising or eliminating limits on \n     individual and PAC contributions.\n       Eliminating or further limiting financial alternatives \n     basically used to fund get-out-the-vote drives or issue \n     awareness efforts, without corresponding actions to raise \n     personal and corporate limits, only exacerbates the funding \n     shortfalls of current campaigns and the increasingly lower \n     voter turnout.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gregory S. Casey, President and CEO, BIPAC; Thomas J. \n           Donohue, President and CEO, U.S. Chamber of Commerce; \n           Richard L.

Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the more than 14,000 \n     members of the National Association of Manufacturers, \n     including approximately 10,500 small manufacturers, I want to \n     applaud your efforts in protecting the First Amendment rights \n     of individuals and organizations to participate in the \n     political process by opposing attempts to further regulate \n     campaign finance and political speech.\n       I want to share our thoughts on campaign finance reform \n     with you:\n       1. While the NAM has no formal policy on soft money, \n     manufacturers know that just as over-regulation distorts the \n     commercial marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the \n     marketplace of political ideas. The so-called soft money \n     issue emerged in response to earlier regulatory restrictions \n     imposed on the political system. Adding another layer of \n     regulations to cover the failures of previous regulatory \n     efforts will inevitably lead to further distortions. The NAM \n     believes that raising limits on individual and PAC \n     contributions is long overdue. The NAM supports full \n     disclosure of campaign contributions.\n       2. The NAM is completely opposed to total or partial \n     government funding of congressional campaigns. The NAM \n     believes that our representative form of government functions \n     best when candidates seek voluntary contributions from \n     private citizens or citizen groups. Government funding \n     through tax dollars of candidates for the U.S. Senate and \n     House of Representatives would constitute drastic and costly \n     change in our electoral process. Such unwarranted federal \n     intrusion into the election process would also reverse the \n     present healthy trend toward a reduction in the many \n     pervasive levels of bureaucracy in the federal government. On \n     PACs: As many as 20 million Americans participate in nearly \n     4000 PACs. That is almost half of the total number of people \n     who voted in the last election cycle. PAC participation is an \n     exercise in free speech and voluntary political activity that \n     has brought millions into the political process.\n       3. The Supreme Court has decided that money is a form of \n     speech. So, limitations on giving as a form of political \n     speech, whether voluntary or coerced, are limitations on the \n     ability to exercise free speech. Those of us in industry that \n     have been highly impacted by government regulation know that \n     elections have consequences and limitations on our ability to \n     be involved in the process is consequential to the support \n     and election of pro-growth candidates.\n       4. Issue advocacy restrictions are very worrisome and \n     almost certainly unconstitutional. If the NAM ran ads today \n     about health care or Social Security reform that mention a \n     Congressman's vote on those issues but do not urge the \n     election or defeat of the Congressman, that's perfectly legal \n     under current law (for example, ``thank-you'' ads \n     manufacturers have run in recent years). Under previous \n     versions of the McCain-Feingold plan, this would change. \n     Running ads more than 60 days before a general election would \n     be constitutionally protected free speech, but running \n     identical ads less than 60 days before an election would be \n     highly regulated speech. NAM has no formal policy on \n     restrictions on issue advocacy, but is very troubled by them.\n       5. The role of organized labor in the political process is \n     not adequately addressed by proponents of reform. The \n     involuntary collection of union dues for political purposes \n     is anathema to democracy. NAM policy states that ``The \n     involuntary collection and use of funds by labor unions for \n     political purposes should be prohibited by statute. The NAM \n     supports the codification of the Beck Supreme Court decision \n     and further paycheck protection measures that ensure that \n     union members cannot be forced to have mandatory union dues \n     go to political causes or organizations they do not \n     support.''\n       In recent years, these five areas of concern have been the \n     principal reasons why the NAM has opposed campaign finance \n     reform legislation and the NAM Key Vote Advisory Committee \n     has named campaign finance reform a Key Manufacturing Vote. \n     The NAM has long advocated individual freedom and \n     participation by all citizens in the legislative and the \n     political process. Therefore, we must again oppose the \n     McCain-Feingold legislation.\n       For all these reasons, oppositiion to McCain-Feingold, like \n     the Shays-Meehan bill in the House, will be designated a Key \n     Manufacturing Vote in the NAM voting record for the 106th \n     Congress.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jerry J. Jasinowski.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business organization \n     representing more than three million businesses of every \n     size, sector and region, I want to applaud your efforts in \n     protecting the First Amendment rights of individuals and \n     organizations by opposing attempts to regulate ``issue \n     advocacy.''\n       The U.S. Chamber has long advocated individual freedom and \n     unrestricted participation by all citizens in the legislative \n     and the political process. Therefore, we oppose the McCain/\n     Feingold legislation. By restricting issue advocacy, we \n     believe the legislation is an infringement on the \n     constitutionally protected right of free speech of \n     individuals and organizations.\n       After numerous press reports we feel it is imperative to \n     clarify our differences with some groups. The Chamber \n     believes in reasonable campaign finance reform proposals. We \n     support a system that relies on full disclosure, voluntary \n     participation, and the confidence in the electorate to make \n     sound decisions through the free exchange of ideas and \n     information. We believe true reform protects the First \n     Amendment rights of American citizens, organizations and \n     parties.\n       The Chamber does not support taxpayer financing of \n     congressional races as it would dangerously extend the \n     government's role in the traditionally voluntary political \n     process based on individual choice. We believe spending \n     limits are unconstitutional and we will continue to adamantly \n     oppose restrictions on the use of ``issue advocacy'' as an \n     infringement on First Amendment rights.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                              Tom.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been suggested that somehow \nmembers of the business community believe they have to contribute to \npolitical campaigns. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am \nfamiliar with a number of companies that do not contribute non-Federal \nmoney, as is their right. We appreciate those who do choose to support \nour party and give us an opportunity to engage in issue advocacy, voter \nturnout, and other projects that are funded by non-Federal money, which \ngives us an opportunity to compete in the marketplace of ideas and \ngives us a chance to win elections. For those who do choose to \nparticipate, we want to thank you.\n  I also suggest to those who do not want to, don't feel obliged to. \nThere are plenty other members of the business community who want to \nget involved, who want to help advance the cause that my party stands \nfor, and we are grateful for their support.\n  I don't know whether we are going to have any more speakers. I want \nto check with our floor staff and see if we might not be at a point to \nwrap it up.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Feingold says he wants to speak for 10 or 15 \nminutes on\n\n[[Page S12679]]\n\nthe bill. But other than that, we have no request for speakers on this \nside.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Bennett might come back. But he \nwill be here Monday as well and will be able to speak at that point.\n  I see the Senator from Wisconsin is here and wishes to speak. I don't \nbelieve we have any other interest in speaking on this side.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we have had an excellent debate so far. \nI am pleased to have an opportunity to make a few comments essentially \nin summary on what we have covered.\n  We have been debating an amendment. In fact, we have been debating \ntwo amendments. We have been debating two alternatives, both of which I \nlike very much. One of them is the original version of the McCain-\nFeingold bill, which is very similar to the Shays-Meehan bill that has \nbeen offered, and the other is essentially the underlying bill, the \napproach of simply banning soft money. We think that is well worth \ndoing if we can get nothing else out of the Senate.\n  I want to make it very clear. I, like my leader, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, also support comprehensive reform. It is even a little \nbit amusing to me because I remember we had the first version of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill. And when the decision was made to make it a \nlittle bit lighter in order to get more support, there was outcry by \nsome that we had abandoned comprehensive reform.\n  What is now the Shays-Meehan bill was said at that time not to be \ncomprehensive, but today the Shays-Meehan bill is being called \ncomprehensive reform.\n  It is not comprehensive, I am the first to admit; not only that bill, \nnot only our bill, but any of the bills that have been offered, \nincluding the original McCain-Feingold bill. I prefer public financing. \nSo the question isn't: Is this bill comprehensive reform? There is no \ncomprehensive reform being offered on the floor of the Senate in this \ndebate. The question is whether we are advancing the cause of campaign \nfinance reform in a meaningful way with these different alternatives.\n  I think either alternative, Shays-Meehan or the McCain-Feingold soft \nmoney ban, does advance the cause of campaign finance reform.\n  Then there are only two questions in deciding which approach to \nfollow at this point in this Senate. The first question is: Can it \npass? Can the legislation get over the filibuster in the Senate? The \nsecond question, and it is as important as the first question, maybe \nmore important: Is it worth it to pass the bill assuming we can do it? \nThat is the issue we have to address.\n  On the first question, what can be passed in this body? I would love \nand have fought long and hard for years to be able to pass a bill \nthrough this body that includes not only a ban on soft money but that \nalso deals with the phony issue ads that almost every American knows \nare campaign ads. But unlike the Senator from New Jersey, I have taken \nthe time to sit down individually with every Republican Senator who has \nnot supported our side in the past, who I thought might support our \nside on a pure soft money ban or some other alternative.\n  I asked each Member what they want to see in a campaign finance \nreform bill. I did this largely with the help and special extra effort \nnot only of Senator McCain, but also the Senator from Maine. This was a \nprocess we undertook in May and June and that continues today. I \nbelieve these Senators were being sincere with me. Some said they would \nnot support anything and enjoyed the conversation. Some told me maybe \nthere was a way they could support a stronger bill. The underlying \ntheme from these conversations was whereas they couldn't support the \nprovisions having to do with phony issue ads, many of them were open to \nthe possibility of simply banning soft money. Some said: Let's ban soft \nmoney and do a couple of other things, too.\n  There was a thread that came through all of these conversations. I \ncan say to my colleagues with absolute certainty: I don't believe there \nis any scenario where the phony issue ads issue can be dealt with in \nthis body on this piece of legislation. We cannot get 60 votes for it. \nAnd if we don't get 60 votes, the efforts in the House a few weeks ago \nthat were so admirable are wasted. The House passed a bill that has \nboth the soft money ban, and good provisions dealing with the phony \nissue ads. If we don't pass a bill in the Senate at all, we all know \nthe process. This isn't Nebraska; it is not a unicameral legislature. \nThere are two Houses. If we can't get a bill out of this body, there \ncan't be a conference; or if the House can't agree to the Senate \nposition, we can't have campaign finance reform.\n  As great as the Shays-Meehan approach or the original McCain-Feingold \napproach is, I guarantee, I know we can't get 60 votes for that \napproach in this Senate at this stage of the process.\n  It is fair to ask whether or not we can pass the soft money ban. We \ndon't know for sure. But we do know this: This long, difficult battle \nhas been won, one piece at a time. We are going to win it. The claim \noriginally was, we only have a few supporters. Then the claim was, we \njust have Democrats and Senator McCain and Senator Thompson; we don't \nhave a third Republican. Then Senator Collins came on board. Then \nSenator Specter came on board. Then they said, there are only 49 votes; \nyou don't have a majority, so you can't win. Then we were very \nfortunate to gain the support of three Senators--Senators Snowe, \nJeffords, and Chafee, and we had a majority in the Senate. Then they \nsaid, you can't get 60 votes.\n\n  Fair enough. We know we need 60 votes, if people want to play the \ngame that way--and it is the way it is often played in the Senate to \nwin. For the last year, we have needed eight votes; we need eight \nvotes. Because we had made the decision to listen to our Republican \ncolleagues who were willing to listen, to try to just do a soft money \nban if we can't do anything else, we now only need seven votes, as the \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, has cosponsored the McCain-Feingold \nbill to ban soft money. Now it is seven.\n  Maybe in a couple of days it will be five or three or two. The point \nis, in this game we lose and lose and lose and lose until we win, and \nwe only have to win once. That is what legislating is all about. We can \nwin. We must find out whether it is possible to win by finding out how \nmany Members of this body answer the following question with a yes or a \nno. The question is, Are you for or against party soft money?\n  Do you think people should be able to give unlimited contributions to \nthe political parties, $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, $1 million--even \nthough corporations and unions have been prohibited from doing that for \ndecades in the United States? That is the question. Are Members for \nsoft money or are they against soft money? Are they for a system of \nlegalized bribery or against a system of legalized bribery? That is the \nquestion.\n  I do believe there is no contest, no question as to which approach is \nmost likely to break the filibuster. It is the approach of simply \nbanning soft money.\n  That leads to the second question, and this is the excellent exchange \nwe had with Senator Torricelli today. It was all about whether it will \nmake a difference, whether it is worth it, whether it will do anything \nat all if we are able to only ban party soft money. It is a fair \nquestion because I don't think there is any doubt there will always be \nattempts to avoid the ban and have the money flow to other sources.\n  But my belief that it would make a huge difference to ban party soft \nmoney in this process is not some kind of utopian version. It is not \nsome kind of a millennial fervor about being able to sever the \nconnection between money and politics. I believe that is eternal. There \nwill always be some connection between money and politics.\n  The question is whether we can do something to close an outrageous \nloophole that has caused America to not have a campaign finance reform \nsystem at all--which is exactly what the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nThompson, has said on many occasions. That is the question. Is it worth \nclosing this loophole?\n  Senator McCain said it well. We may have to do more. Even this \nattempt may in 10 years be void. It is similar to tax reform. Nobody \nthinks when we do tax reform, as we did in 1986, that it is forever. It \nworks for a while and we have to come back and do it again.\n\n[[Page S12680]]\n\n That is why the Senator from Arizona said we don't adjourn \npermanently. Problems recur. Thomas Jefferson even said we should have \na revolution every 20 years. Surely, it is not such a bad thing if we \nhave campaign finance reform attempted every 20 years.\n  I do think it is worth it. The reason I think it is worth it is \nbecause of the staggering figures I think many Americans are not aware \nof which are demonstrated on this chart. Do the American people know \nthe kind of money that is being given to the political parties in this \ncountry, in a country that is supposed to be based on the principle of \none person, one vote? How can they believe they are operating under a \nsystem of one person, one vote when enormous contributions can be given \nby corporations, unions, and individuals that make a farce out of the \nWatergate era reforms?\n  These figures bear repetition. In 1992, 52 people gave over $200,000 \nto one of the major political petitioners. That is a lot. But by 1996, \n219 people had given over $200,000. What about over $300,000? In 1992, \nonly 20 people had given $300,000 to the major political parties. That \nfigure sextupled--120 people instead of 20 gave in 1996 that amount.\n  What about those who gave $400,000? These aren't groups that \nrepresent a bunch of individuals. These are one individual or one union \nor one corporation, each giving $400,000. Thirteen entities or persons \ndid that in 1992, but in 1996 it was 1979.\n  Finally, $500,000, a half a million dollars--people or corporations \nor unions giving a half a million dollars to one of the political \nparties: there were 9 people or groups who did that in 1992; by 1996 it \nwas 50. I can just imagine what that figure is going to look like in \nthe year 2000. It will be enormous. In a system where people are \nsupposed to generally have their votes count the same, some people get \nto give these unlimited contributions to the national political \nparties.\n  To tie this into the debate from yesterday about the issue of \ncorruption and the appearance of corruption, I reminded my colleagues \nafter the exchange here that the test that the Supreme Court has put \nforward as to whether you can ban contributions or limit contributions \nis whether there is corruption or the appearance of corruption. All I \nneeded to do to drive this point home was to open up the newspaper this \nmorning and on the front page of the Washington Post see this headline:\n\n       Microsoft Targets Funding For Antitrust Office.\n\n\n  Apparently Microsoft and their allies are not seeking to directly \naffect the litigation that is being conducted with regard to Microsoft \nby the Justice Department at this time; what they are trying to do, \naccording to this article, is cut the overall funding for the Justice \nDepartment's Antitrust Division. In this context, if somehow things \ndon't look right, there is the ever present possibility that there \nwould be an appearance of corruption. It just so happens on the plane \nout here, next to my seat there was a copy of Forbes magazine and the \nForbes 400. I read the whole thing.\n  I found out to be in the Forbes 400 now it is not enough to have half \na billion dollars. You are not on the team if you're only worth half a \nbillion. You get kicked off the Forbes 400 list. You have to have $620 \nmillion to be on the Forbes 400 list.\n  Who do you think led that list? Who do you think was the lead in the \nwhole thing? It was the Microsoft executive, of course, and Mr. Gates \nhimself is so much more wealthy than the next wealthiest person that it \nis absolutely staggering.\n  One chart in the magazine article showed five or six people and how \ntheir wealth was greater than the wealth of various countries. They put \nthe picture of the head of the person next to the wealth of the \ncountry. In this context, where Microsoft wants the Justice \nDepartment's budget cut, to have a scenario where corporations and \nunions and individuals can give unlimited amounts of soft money \ncertainly creates the potential for an appearance of corruption.\n  I have no idea what Microsoft's or Bill Gates' actual contributions \nare, and I am not suggesting that they are making those contributions \nto influence the funding of the Justice Department. But for us to \ncreate a scenario where Mr. Gates could give unlimited amounts of money \nrather than the old $2,000 of hard money, or a Microsoft PAC could give \nmore than $10,000, to just have it be unlimited I believe almost \ninherently, as the Supreme Court would say, creates an appearance of \ncorruption that is bad for Microsoft, bad for the Justice Department, \nand bad for our country.\n  We have never permitted this in the past. We have never permitted \ncorporations to give this kind of money. We have never permitted unions \nto give this kind of money. Essentially in the last 5 years, one way to \ndescribe this: This kind of negative influence of money and politics, \nwhich will always be there, has gone from the retail--$2,000, $10,000--\nto the wholesale side. We now have the wholesale purchase of public \npolicy, or the appearance thereof, in this country.\n  I will simply quote from a Minneapolis Star Tribune editorial from \nOctober 13, 1999. This summarizes this very well, the fact that it is \nworth it to prohibit corporations and unions and individuals from \ngiving unlimited contributions to the political parties. The editorial \nsays:\n       Later this week, when the Senate tries again to pass \n     campaign-finance reform, opponents will argue that Congress \n     shouldn't abridge the right of citizens to express their \n     opinions through their checkbooks. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the \n     Republicans' legendary fund-raiser from Kentucky, told the \n     Washington Post this week: ``Somebody needs to protect the \n     right of Americans to project their message.''\n       This is a plausible argument in a society that values free \n     speech. Except that some of the people with the biggest \n     checkbooks say it's a load of bunk.\n       Listen to Rob Johnson, corporate vice president for public \n     affairs at Cargill Inc.: ``Even if money doesn't buy \n     influence, it is perceived to buy influence. That perception \n     erodes peoples' confidence in their government and their \n     willingness to participate in the electoral process.''\n       Consider Marilyn Carlson Nelson of the Carlson Companies, \n     or James Porter, a vice president at Honeywell. Both are \n     active in the Committee for Economic Development (CED), a New \n     York study group of influential corporate executives. After \n     researching the cost of political campaigns, the CED \n     concluded last summer: `Candidates spend an inordinate amount \n     of time fundraising, reducing the time they spend \n     communicating their ideas to constituents.''\n       If these powerful executives--the very people who might \n     benefit most from checkbook politics--can see the corrupting \n     influence of money in campaigns, it's astonishing that the \n     Senate cannot.\n       And yet reform will almost certainly die in the Senate this \n     month, for the third time in as many years. Though a \n     promising bill just passed the House and has majority support \n     in the Senate, reformers cannot muster the votes to break a \n     GOP filibuster.\n       The point is not that big donors always get their way. \n     Populists can point to the occasional victory--the recent \n     House vote on patient' rights, for example, or President \n     Clinton's veto of the big GOP tax cut.\n       The point is that big money has taken politics out of the \n     hands of citizens and delivered it into the hands of cynics. \n     Promising candidates refuse to run for office because they \n     can't face begging for cash. Talented incumbents shirk their \n     legislative work to raise money for the next campaign. \n     Citizen volunteers drop out of politics because the old forms \n     of participation--pounding lawn signs and calling neighbors--\n     have given way to slick direct mail and vicious TV spots. \n     Voters eventully understand that politcs no longer belongs to \n     them.\n       The bill that comes before the Senate this week--a \n     whittled-down reform written by Republican John McCain of \n     Arizona and Democrat Russell Feingold of Wisconsin--wouldn't \n     revoluntionize politics. It would merely ban ``soft money,'' \n     the unregulated form of contributions that has spiraled out \n     of control in recent years. But banning soft money would at \n     least be a start toward healthier politics. Alas, that start \n     must likely await another year, and a Congress with more \n     courage.\n       After three fruitless years, the reform effort has grown \n     demoralizing. And yet the marathon debate is useful--it \n     brings new critics to their feet, whets the outrage of \n     intelligent citizens, and drives the obstructionists to ever \n     more desperate tactics.\n\n  This is a good statement of why it is worth it to ban this kind of \noutrageous abuse of our American democracy.\n  Justice Souter said it very well at the oral argument in the Shrink \nMissouri Government PAC case just a few days ago; which I had a chance \nto attend. I know this was just a comment from the bench. We don't know \nwhat the ruling will be. But Justice Souter described exactly what \nthese giant contributions have to mean to almost any American. He said:\n\n       Most people assume, and I do, certainly, that someone \n     making an extraordinarily large contribution gets something \n     extraordinary in return.\n\n\n[[Page S12681]]\n\n\n  I am sure the Court will take notice, if we ever get to that point, \nthat many Americans share that view, and it is very significant that \none of the great Justices of the Supreme Court took notice that it \ngives him the feeling there is an appearance of corruption in this \nsystem.\n  To finally respond to the point the Senator from New Jersey made, the \nSenator from New Jersey said--I don't know what his historical basis \nfor this is, but it is an interesting comment: ``We only get a chance \nonce every 10 years to do campaign finance reform.'' He said that is \nwhy we had to do the Shays-Meehan approach rather than the soft money \nban.\n  But this is what I know to be true. Not only is it worth it to ban \nsoft money, but if we don't take this opportunity to at least ban soft \nmoney, there will be no campaign finance reform at all during the \n1990s. The opportunity to have any campaign finance reform will have \nbeen destroyed by Congress after Congress after Congress. This is our \nchance to break down this system that is destroying anybody's sense \nthat there is a system of one person one vote in the United States \nanymore.\n  This is a chance. This is the one we must take. This is the one on \nwhich we must have a yes-or-no vote early next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering \ncampaign finance reform. As my colleagues know, the House of \nRepresentatives in September passed a strong, bipartisan reform \nmeasure. Senators McCain and Feingold have put a bipartisan reform \nproposal before the Senate.\n  The House has acted overwhelmingly in favor of reform and the \nmajority of Americans support them. It is imperative that the Senate \npass a tough campaign finance reform measure this year.\n  I have consistently supported campaign finance reform since coming to \nCongress. As many of my colleagues know, I started my career in \npolitics as a community activist, working to prevent a highway from \ndemolishing my Fell's Point neighborhood. I don't want the next \ngeneration of community activists shut out of the political process. I \nwant them to know that their efforts matter. I want to restore each \nAmerican's faith and trust in government. This bill is an important \nstep in restoring the faith of the American people and ensuring that \nour citizens have a voice in government.\n  Vote after vote in the past has shown that the majority of the United \nStates Senate supports the McCain-Feingold reform proposal. \nUnfortunately, through parliamentary tactics and filibuster, a majority \nof the Senate has not been able to work its will on this issue. I hope \nthis year will be different, and that we will pass and enact meaningful \ncampaign finance reform.\n  During my time in the United States Senate, I have voted 19 times to \nend filibusters on campaign finance reform. So I know we have a fight \non our hands. But it is time for action, and it is time for reform. The \nAmerican people are counting on us.\n  I believe we need campaign finance reform for a number of reasons. \nFirst and most important, we need to restore people's faith in the \nintegrity of government, the integrity of their elected officials, and \nthe integrity of our political process.\n  Many Americans are fed up with a political system that ignores our \nNation's problems and places the concerns of working families behind \nthose of big interests. Our campaign finance system contributes to a \nculture of cynicism that hurts our institutions, our government and our \ncountry.\n  When Congress fails to enact legislation to save our kids from the \npublic health menace of smoking because of the undue influence of Big \nTobacco, it adds to that culture of cynicism. When powerful health care \nindustry interests are able to block measures to provide basic patient \nprotections for consumers who belong to HMOs, that adds to the culture \nof cynicism. Is it any wonder that Americans do not trust their elected \nleaders to act in the public interest?\n  It's time for the Senate to break this culture of cynicism. We can \nenact legislation to eliminate the undue influence of special interests \nin elections.\n  How does this bill do that? First of all, it stems the flood of \nunregulated, unreported money in campaigns. It will ban soft money, \nmoney raised and spent outside of federal campaign rules and which \nviolates the spirit of those rules.\n  During the 1996 Presidential election cycle, the political parties in \nAmerica raised a record $262 million. In just the first six months of \nthe 2000 election cycle, the parties have raised an astounding $55.1 \nmillion. That's 80% more than they raised in the same period of the \n1996 cycle. The need to shut down the growing soft money machine is \nclear.\n  This bill will also codify the Beck decision, by allowing non-union \nmembers who pay fees in lieu of union dues to obtain a refund of the \nportion of those fees used for political activities. Unions play a \nvital role in our political process. This provision enables unions to \nmore accurately reflect the views of their members.\n  These are reasonable reforms. They will help get the big money and \nthe secret money out of campaigns. They will help to strengthen \ndemocracy and strengthen the people's faith in their elected officials.\n  Mr. President, we can improve our political process, making it more \nfair and more inclusive, without compromising our rights under the \nConstitution.\n  By limiting the influence of those with big dollars, and increasing \nthe influence of those with big hearts, we can bring government back to \nwhere it belongs--with the people.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act will help us to do that, and I am \nproud to support it and encourage my colleagues to do likewise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12681-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to describe why I \nthink it is very important to hang on to the bill the Senator from \nWisconsin and the Senator from Arizona have put before us on campaign \nfinance reform.\n  There will be all kinds of amendments offered to change the bill, \nsome of which I support strongly. It seems to me our only chance of \ngetting this legislation passed is to stick as closely as possible to \nthe bill we currently have in front of us.\n  I have had a fair amount of experience in soliciting soft money \ncontributions from donors. I can say that both the contributors and \nmyself, and anybody else who solicits, would have a difficult time \ndenying they are extremely uncomfortable with the dollar\n\n[[Page S12682]]\n\namounts that are coming into political parties, or for that matter--I \nhave never done it--for individual organizations that are spending \nmoney in a so-called generic fashion as well.\n  One of the reasons, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, I feel \nstrongly that change is needed is because we have added a fourth \nrequirement to the Constitution for service in the Senate. The \nConstitution lays out three requirements for someone who wants to run \nfor office--you have to be a U.S. citizen for 9 years; you have to be \n30 years of age; and you have to live in the State for whose office you \nare running. But there has been a fourth requirement added, and that is \nyou have to be able to raise enough money or you will not be a credible \ncandidate.\n  Those who have been challenged before, those who have run for office \nwill tell you, if you do not have enough money to advertise on \ntelevision--I know the Senator from Wisconsin ran on an anti-incumbent \nstrategy, but it is very difficult for most citizens. In Nebraska, \nthere are only a handful of people who are eligible given that fourth \nrequirement.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Wisconsin will tell me if what I am \nsaying is true. I like Shays-Meehan. I like the bill. The junior \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, has an amendment I like as well. The \ntrouble is, when these amendments are adopted, if these amendments are \nadopted, it reduces the chances of our defeating a declared filibuster. \nIt makes it much more likely we will fail to break a filibuster and, as \na consequence of that failure, fail to enact legislation, and as a \nconsequence of that, we will never go to conference and never change \nthe law.\n  I wonder if he can comment on that a bit because there are a lot of \nus who will be facing amendments coming up on this bill. The comment we \nwill have is: Gee, I like that amendment; why not vote for it? There \nmay be a good answer why not to vote for it. It may be the amendment \nwill make it difficult for us to succeed in changing the law and \nreducing, in my mind--I understand and appreciate the problem of \napparent corruption. I would like to get that out of the system. The \nbig thing I see in the system right now is we have a very high barrier \nto public service, and it is much harder, as a consequence, to persuade \nmen and women that they ought to take one of us on and try to come and \nserve their State and Nation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis question. I first compliment him. Not only has he, obviously, done \na good job when he was in the role of being a leader for our political \nparty committee, which involved fundraising, but he has always been an \nardent supporter of campaign finance reform at the same time. He knows \nvery well because he was involved.\n  The fact that people do not have a lot of money can keep them out of \npolitics. It almost kept me out of politics. That is the reason I got \ninvolved in this issue in the first place. I certainly was not aware of \nwhat soft money was at that time.\n  In answer to the Senator's question, this clearly is not \ncomprehensive reform; Shays-Meehan is not comprehensive reform. But \nwhen we get to the point of simply banning soft money, we should take \nthe opportunity.\n\n  In specific answer to his question about what happens when these \namendments come up, all I can do is tip my hat and say let's follow the \nexample of the other body which, on two occasions, has shown us what to \ndo.\n  You have to be willing on some occasions to vote against a good \namendment in which you believe--I am even prepared, if necessary, to \nvote against a bill that has my name on it--if you believe the reason \nfor putting that amendment on is to destroy the chance to pass a \nreasonable and appropriate bill. They had to do that in the House. \nMembers had to vote against amendments that had to do with disclosure, \nalmost an indisputable principle. They had to vote against other \namendments they liked very much in order to make sure they could pass a \nreasonable bill, such as the Shays-Meehan bill, that included a number \nof important provisions.\n  We have to be ready to do the same thing. I believe in some cases, I \nsay to the Senator from Nebraska, the amendments that will be offered \nwill be helpful and do not threaten our ability to win, but in some \ncases I think they are poison pills and we need to work together to \ndefeat them. I am confident we have a majority of people in this body \nwho are reformers and understand the importance of taking the vote you \nhave to take in order to win this battle.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is very kind to say I have always been a \nsupporter. Actually I have not always been a supporter. When I came to \nthe Senate in 1989, this was not a very important issue. Indeed, at one \npoint, I joined the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, to defeat \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Then I had the experience of going inside the beast in 1996, 1997, \nand 1998 when I was Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee--I do not want to raise a sore subject for the Senator from \nMaine. It changed my attitude in two big ways: One, the apparent \ncorruption that exists. People believe there is corruption. If they \nbelieve it, it happens. We all understand that. If the perception is it \nis A, it is A even though we know it may not be, and the people believe \nthe system is corrupt.\n  Equally important to me, I discovered in 1996, 1997, and 1998 that \nthere are men and women who would love to serve. They say: I can't be \ncompetitive; I can't possibly raise the money necessary to go on \ntelevision; oh, and by the way, my reputation could get damaged as a \nconsequence of what could be said on television against me.\n  I am persuaded this law needs to be changed for the good of the \nRepublic, for the good of democracy. I hope Members, such as myself, \nwho are enthusiastic about changing that law will take the advice of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona to heart \nbecause we may have to vote against things we prefer in order to make \ncertain we get something that not only we want but the Nation \ndesperately needs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I can respond briefly, I cannot think \nof a more helpful remark than what the Senator from Nebraska just said. \nWhat he is talking about--and this is his nature--is to actually get \nsomething done. Not just posture but actually accomplish something. I \nam grateful because that is the discipline we are going to need when we \nstart voting next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nthoughtfulness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12682-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12682-S12683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about \nthe effort I have launched with the other Senator from Maine, Ms. \nOlympia Snowe, around the only bipartisan effort now before the Senate \nto get Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for the Nation's senior \ncitizens.\n  As my colleagues can see in this poster next to me, Senator Snowe and \nI are urging that senior citizens send in their prescription drug bills \nto Members of the Senate in Washington, DC, to help show how important \nit is we address this issue in a bipartisan way for the millions of \nvulnerable elderly people.\n  Here are a few of the prescription drug bills I have received from \nsenior citizens from my home area in the Pacific Northwest. I will take \na few minutes this afternoon on behalf of Senator Snowe and myself to \ntalk about why this bipartisan issue is so very important.\n  Let me read from a letter sent October 1 from an elderly women in \nLebanon, OR. She said:\n\n       Please find enclosed a copy of the prescription costs for \n     the past 6 months. As you will note, the average cost each \n     month is $236.92 without the over-the-counter medications I \n     must take. Please make use of these figures any way you can \n     in your effort to obtain prescription coverage for those of \n     us receiving Medicare. I'm 78 years old and doubt if I will \n     see the time prescriptions are a covered item. However, keep \n     fighting for the next generation.\n\n  I want to tell this older person in Lebanon, at home in Oregon, that \nwe are going to be fighting for her. We are not going to wait until the \nnext generation to get older people the coverage they need. To think \nthat this\n\n[[Page S12683]]\n\nCongress would say it is not critical to help this kind of vulnerable, \nelderly woman isn't acceptable to Senator Snowe and me. We have a \nmarket-oriented approach, one that can hold down the costs of \nprescription medicine for the Nation's senior citizens.\n  On the basis of these bills that are being sent now to Senator Snowe \nand me, I think we can show this Congress that the time to act, in a \nbipartisan fashion, is now and not after the next election or the next \nelection after that.\n  Let me read from another letter I received on September 29 of this \nyear from a gentleman, an elderly gentleman, in King City, OR. He said:\n\n       I am a constant user of inhalant. Two uses per day come to \n     $839.80.\n\n  Imagine that, two uses a day: $839.80.\n  And he says:\n\n       Fortunately, I drove a Chevrolet when my friends were \n     driving Cadillacs and our family vacations were spent in the \n     United States, not the South Seas, so I'm able to carry the \n     load, at least for a while.\n\n  The annual cost of this prescription medication for this older person \nin King City, at home, is $30,600. It equals what it would cost to stay \nin a nursing home.\n\n  I am just hopeful that with more examples like this, where senior \ncitizens send to Senator Snowe and me copies of their prescription drug \nbills, we can win bipartisan support for this legislation before the \nend of this session.\n  Let me cite a third letter I received at the beginning of October. \nThis is from an elderly woman--it came just a few days ago--whose \nSocial Security income is $1,179 a month. She spends $500 of her \nmonthly income of $1,179 on prescription drugs. She is taking Fosamax. \nThat is a drug that costs $179 a month. She is taking Prilosec. It \ncosts $209 a month. And she is taking Lescol, which costs $112 a month. \nSo it takes $500 a month from the monthly income of $1,179 of an \nelderly woman in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, these bills that are being sent to \nSenator Snowe and me do not lie; they tell the whole story. We are \ngoing to do everything we can to ensure that Congress acts on this \nmatter, in a bipartisan way, in this session of Congress.\n  Just this week, I saw a story in one of the publications saying there \nwas not a consensus around this issue. Senator Snowe and I got 54 \nvotes--a majority in the Senate--to join us in a funding plan for a \nprescription drug program. I am of the view that we cannot afford not \nto cover prescription drugs because so many of these prescription drugs \ntoday help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol and keep folks well.\n  What Senator Snowe and I are proposing is a market-oriented approach. \nIt is based on the model that is used for Federal employees. It is \nmarket driven. It has choices. We would not see the kind of price-\ncontrol approach that is being advocated by some. I am very opposed to \nthat kind of price-control orientation because what will happen is, if \nyou just try to control prices for Medicare drugs, the costs will all \nbe shifted to somebody else.\n  Senator Snowe and I do not want to see a divorced mom at the age of \n27, with a modest income and two kids, have to pick up all the extra \ncosts. So we are going with a market-oriented approach. I hope that in \nthe days ahead, as a result of bills such as this, and others that I \nknow are being sent to our colleagues--and the campaign we have \nlaunched here on the floor so that seniors will, as this poster says, \nsend in copies of their prescription drug bills--we can show the people \nof this country that we are not going to wait until the next election \nor the election after that; we are going to find a way to come together \nnow to do the job we were elected to do, which is to work in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Unfortunately, that did not happen this week on the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. I wish it had. I am anxious to work with the Presiding \nOfficer and my colleagues on the other side of aisle. We can do it on \nprescription drugs. We can do it on an issue that is foremost in the \nminds of millions of our families and our seniors.\n  We have 20 percent of the Nation's older people spending more than \n$1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine.\n  I described this afternoon an elderly woman with a monthly income of \n$1,179, who every month spends more than $500 on prescriptions. Let's \nshow seniors such as that elderly woman who wrote from the Willamette \nValley in my home State of Oregon that we can act now. She was \nskeptical. She has heard all the oratory and all the partisan rhetoric \non this issue, and she is understandably skeptical.\n\n  Senator Snowe and I are trying to mobilize a bipartisan coalition in \nthis Senate to act in this session so that older people can get decent \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare. We should not wait until the \nnext election. We were elected to act now and to act in a bipartisan \nway.\n  I hope, as a result of this short statement today, that additional \nolder people, as this poster says, will send us copies of the \nprescription drug bills with which they are faced.\n  Senator Snowe and I intend to be back on this floor again and again \nand again through this session of Congress until we get action. We will \nbe talking about it next week, and we are going to talk about it the \nfollowing week and the week after that. It is not right to wait on an \nissue such as this that is so pressing to vulnerable older people such \nas those who have written me the letters I have described today.\n  I am very grateful to my colleague, the other Senator from Maine, \nwho, by the way, has a long record of being an advocate for consumer \nissues as well. And she knows how much I enjoy working with her. I \nthank her for this courtesy this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. First, I thank the Senator for his kind comments and for \nbringing to the Senate's attention a very important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kansas and I be allowed \nto proceed in morning business in a colloquy for as much time as we may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12683-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12683-S12687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HOME HEALTH SERVICES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are committed to \nenacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save Medicare for \ncurrent and future generations. In addition to addressing the long-term \nissues facing Medicare, it is absolutely critical that this Congress \nalso take action this year to remedy some of the unintended \nconsequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which have been \nexacerbated by a host of ill-conceived new regulatory requirements \nimposed by the Clinton administration.\n  These problems are the subject of the issue my colleague from Kansas \nand I wish to address today, for these problems are jeopardizing access \nto critical home health services for millions of our Nation's most \nvulnerable and frail senior citizens.\n  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have \nenabled a growing number of our vulnerable senior citizens to avoid \nhospitals, to avoid nursing homes, and receive the care they need and \nwant in the security and privacy of their own homes--right where they \nwant to be.\n  In 1996, however, home health was the fastest growing component of \nthe Medicare budget, which understandably prompted Congress and the \nClinton administration to initiate changes that were intended to make \nthe program more cost effective and efficient. There was strong \nbipartisan support for the provisions that called for the \nimplementation of a prospective payment system for home care. \nUnfortunately, until this system is implemented, home health care \nagencies are being paid under a critically flawed interim payment \nsystem known as IPS, that penalizes those home health agencies that \nhistorically have been the most cost effective.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Maine yield to me \nfor a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. For all of those who are listening and watching this \ndebate, I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine for her--I wrote \nit down--untiring, persevering, never-give-up\n\n[[Page S12684]]\n\nleadership with regard to this effort to resolve our problems with \nHCFA. What an acronym. We have all heard of Peter and the dike. This is \nSusan at the dam, the HCFA dam. In fact, we could probably turn that \naround in regard to what is happening.\n  I want to ask a question. Do you mean this new interim payment \nsystem--and we will go through this in some detail. I want folks to \nremember interim payment system, IPS. That is the acronym. Everything \nhas to be an acronym in Washington. I don't call it IPS. I call it the \n``IPS mess''. It not only rewards but actually penalizes the home \nhealth care agencies for their past, not bad behavior but good \nbehavior; is that right?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Unfortunately, that is exactly right. Unbelievable \nthough it may seem, the formula that is being used actually penalizes \nthose agencies in our two States that have done a good job of holding \ndown costs. It rewards those home health agencies that have provided \nthe most visits, that have spent the most Medicare dollars. It is \ntotally backwards. In fact, home health agencies in our two regions of \nthe country, the Northeast and the Midwest, are among those that have \nbeen particularly hard hit by this inexplicable formula, the IPS, that \nthe Senator just mentioned.\n  The Wall Street Journal observed last year--this could be said of \nagencies in the Midwest as well--that if New England had just been a \nlittle greedier, its home health agencies would be a whole lot better \noff now. Ironically, the regions, yours and mine, are getting clobbered \nby the system because they have had a tradition of nonprofit community \nservice and efficiency.\n  Even more troubling--and I commend the Senator from Kansas for his \nleadership on this issue; I know this troubles him as well--is the fact \nthe flawed system is restricting access to care for the very senior \ncitizens who need the care the most. Those are our seniors who are the \nsicker patients, who have complex chronic care needs, such as diabetic \nwound care patients whom I visited in northern Maine during a home \nhealth care visit, or IV therapy patients who require multiple visits. \nIndeed, according to a recent survey by the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, almost 40 percent of home health agencies have said there \nare patients who they no longer serve due to the flawed interim payment \nsystem and the regulatory overkill on the part of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  I show the distinguished Senator from Kansas and the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, who is also committed to this issue, and my other \ncolleagues, a chart that demonstrates the dramatic impact the IPS, this \nflawed payment system, has had in my own State of Maine.\n  As you can see, the number of Medicare beneficiaries who have been \nserved by home health care agencies has dropped dramatically. It has \ndropped by 13 percent, from 49,458 to 42,858; 6,600 senior and disabled \ncitizens in my State have lost their access to home health care \nservices in 1 year. This is so troubling to me. The number of visits \nhas plummeted by more than 420,000, and reimbursements to our home \nhealth agencies have dropped by an astounding $20 million in a year. \nKeep in mind that Maine has some of the least costly home health care \nagencies in the country. They have been very prudent in their use of \nresources. They were low cost to begin with. So when this formula went \ninto effect, it put such a squeeze on them, they had no choice but to \nclose offices, lay off staff, and stop serving some of the most \nvulnerable, ill senior citizens in my State.\n\n  The point is, cuts of this magnitude, that we have seen in the State \nof Maine and throughout the country, cannot be sustained without \nhurting senior citizens.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I will ask the Senator from Maine, if she \nwill yield, another question.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I heard similar complaints--I have them written down--on \nthe interim payment system, the IPS system, from the same agencies in \nmy State. In fact, since January of 1998, 56 Medicare-certified \nagencies in Kansas have closed their doors, largely as a result of the \nchanges in the IPS. These are not the fly-by-night home health care \nagencies we hear about that sometimes are in the press. Many of these \nagencies have been in existence for 20 years. I have visited these \nagencies. There was a survey conducted by the Kansas Home Care \nAssociation that shows agencies have laid off an average of 42 percent \nof their staff. They are subsidizing their Medicare payments to the \ntune of $213,000. In 1997, many agencies decreased the Medicare patient \nvisits by 63 percent. Your chart shows 6,600 people. I have asked \nKansas to come up with the numbers of people who are affected. They are \ntrying to do that. It could be in the hundreds; it could be in the \nthousands.\n  But one person, just one person is a valued individual. That is \neverybody's mom, dad, grandmother, or granddad. So from the standpoint \nof numbers, it is astounding what the distinguished Senator has put up \non the chart with regard to this so-called IPS system. We are going \nthrough the same kind of problem. I am going to ask you, how much \nlonger is this IPS mess going to be in effect? It was supposed to be a \ntransition program to the prospective payment system, but they said, \nwell, we can't do it that fast. I understand that because it does take \na lot of work, but how much longer will we have to put up with this?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Unfortunately, I say to my friend, the Senator from \nKansas, the answer is far longer than any of us in Congress ever \nanticipated. The problems with the IPS system, which the Senator has \ndescribed so eloquently for his State, and we have seen in my State, \nare all the more pressing because the Clinton administration has missed \nthe deadline for implementing the prospective payment system. As a \nconsequence, home health care agencies throughout our Nation are going \nto be struggling under this unfair and flawed payment system far longer \nthan Congress ever envisioned or intended when it passed the Balanced \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for another \nquestion, if she will.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The home health care agencies are worried about IPS in \nKansas. I know the same is true of all around the country. They also \ncomplain that their financial problems have been exacerbated--that is a \nfancy word that means a whole lot worse--by a host of new regulatory \nrequirements imposed by HCFA--my favorite agency in Washington--\nincluding the implementation of something called OASIS--I have the \nreport--that they are requiring nurses to fill out. Oasis, if you look \nin the dictionary, is a desert island somewhere or in the middle of the \ndesert; you come to an oasis and you get relief. Oasis is not relief. \nYou don't spell relief by spelling oasis: a new outcome and assessment \ninformation data set; new requirements for surety bonds, sequential \nbilling, overpayment recoupment, and a new 15-minute increment \nreporting requirement that is a doozy. What about all these reporting \nrequirements in addition to the IPS problem? What about OASIS?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is absolutely correct. We not only have a \nflawed payment system, but home health agencies are struggling under a \nmountain of burden of unnecessary and onerous regulations imposed by \nHCFA, imposed by the Clinton administration. In fact, my colleague may \nbe interested to know that earlier this year I chaired a hearing of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations on home health care. We heard \nfirsthand about the financial distress and cash-flow problems that home \nhealth agencies across the country are experiencing. In fact, the \nSenator has talked about the number that have closed in Kansas.\n  The Senator may already know, but for the benefit of my colleagues \nwho may not be as well informed as the Senator from Kansas, more than \n2,300 home health agencies across the country have been forced to close \ntheir doors as a result of the regulatory burden and the flawed payment \nsystem.\n  We heard witnesses talk about their frustrations. In fact, the CEO of \nthe Visiting Nurses Service in Saco, ME, termed the Clinton \nadministration's regulatory policy as being one of ``implement and \nsuspend.'' She and others pointed to numerous examples of hastily \nenacted, ill-conceived requirements along the lines of what the Senator\n\n[[Page S12685]]\n\npointed out--surety bonds, sequential billing, the OASIS system, a host \nof unnecessary regulatory requirements. What has happened is, no sooner \ndoes HCFA impose this burden on these home health agencies and they \ninvest the costs necessary to comply, then HCFA changes its mind and \nsuspends the regulatory requirements and says never mind.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for another question or just an \nobservation?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Now, wait a minute, HCFA imposed the cost burden of this \nmandate on home health care agencies. Then they had seconds thoughts. \nWhy?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I think the Senator will allow me to respond. This is a \ntypical example of the administration rushing in without thinking \nthrough the regulatory burden that is imposed and, in response to an \noutcry from Members of Congress, such as ourselves, and from senior \ncitizens and home health agencies, it then decided maybe it made a \nmistake. But, in the meantime, our home health agencies have gone \nthrough the time, trouble and expense of implementing these \nrequirements.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. But they suspended them?\n  Ms. COLLINS. That's correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. They didn't say you have no requirement to keep up the \nreporting paperwork; they just suspended them. So that shoe will drop \nagain.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator makes a good point. In some cases, they may \nsuspend it and then they may turn around and impose the burden again. \nIt is hard to know. The agency seems to be in so much turmoil and so \ninsensitive to the home health care agencies.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If there is a home health care agency and they go \nthrough the requirements and get, hopefully, up to speed--although you \ndon't know how with the lack of personnel and you are not being paid \nfor it, et cetera--they could then be suspended, but they have already \ngone through those costs to comply. But then you don't know. Aren't \nthey sort of in a ``HCFA purgatory'' here?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is exactly correct. Let me give you a \nspecific example. In 1998, HCFA instituted a new policy for sequential \nbilling. Under this policy, home health agencies are required to submit \nclaims in a sequential order to Medicare. Now, this required a \nsubstantial investment in computer software, a lot of process changes \non behalf of the home health agencies and the fiscal intermediaries. \nMoreover, the way the system was set up, if there were subsequent \nclaims for a particular patient, they could not be paid until all \nprevious claims relating to this patient were settled. This caused \nenormous cash flow problems for home health agencies. They experienced \ndelays as long as 120 days before they could get the payment they were \ndue.\n  One witness at my hearing testified that her agency was still owed \nabout $20,000 for fiscal '98, and other agencies reported they had to \nobtain bridge loans, or tap into their credit lines, solely because of \nthis ill-conceived policy.\n  Now, due to the objections raised by the Senator from Kansas, myself, \nother Members, and the home health care industry, HCFA finally decided \nto suspend the policy this past July. But, in the meantime, we have had \nover a year of turmoil because of this policy, and home health agencies \nhad already spent time, energy, training, and effort to comply with a \nmisguided policy that now is, as you put it, in ``HCFA purgatory.''\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if she will yield for \nanother question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We have also heard a number of complaints from my \nconstituents about this business called OASIS. For those who don't \nknow, again, OASIS is a system of records containing all this data on \nthe physical, mental, and functional status of Medicare and Medicaid \npatients receiving care from home health care agencies. So HCFA then \nimplemented OASIS, as I understand it, as a tool to help the agency \nimprove the quality of care and form the basis for a new home health \nprospective payment system. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. \nBut the problem, as the Senator has pointed out, is that the collection \nof data is burdensome and expensive for agencies; it invades the \npersonal privacy of patients, and it must be collected for non-Medicare \npatients--that is the part I don't understand--as well as those served \nby Medicare.\n  Why on earth would they require that? I don't understand this. You \ntalk about an unfunded mandate. This has to be at least in the top 10.\n  The Kansas House of Representatives actually passed a resolution \nearlier this year that asked Congress to rescind HCFA rules requiring \nOASIS. I have it right here. It is not often that an entire legislature \nof a State passes a resolution telling some alphabet soup agency back \nhere, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense; you are causing an \nawful lot of regulatory overkill and causing home health care agencies \nto go out of business. Let's see. The State of Kansas is very concerned \nabout the health and well-being of the senior and disabled citizens. We \nhave 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ``whereases,'' translated: Whoa, HCFA, don't do \nthis. It is an unfunded mandate.\n  This was passed by the House of Representatives of the State of \nKansas and it was resolved ``that the Secretary of State be directed to \nprovide an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President of the \nUnited States, Secretary of Health and Human Services, President of the \nUnited States Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Minority \nleaders of the United States Senate and the United States House of \nRepresentatives,'' saying please don't enforce these OASIS regs the way \nthey are being enforced. It is signed by the distinguished speaker of \nthe House in Kansas and the President of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5041\n\n       Whereas, New rules made by HCFA require OASIS assessment \n     and follow-up reports for all patients of Medicare-certified \n     home health agencies and health departments whether or not \n     the personal or attendant care for such patients is paid from \n     Medicare; and\n       Whereas, The new HCFA report requires an 18-page initial \n     assessment, which must be completed by a registered nurse, \n     with a 13 page follow-up assessment being required every 60 \n     days; and\n       Whereas, The requirement for computer software for the \n     preparation and transmission of such assessments and follow-\n     up reports is another unfunded mandate of the federal \n     government; and\n       Whereas, The HCFA requirement requires costly unfunded \n     reporting of those who receive services which are not paid by \n     Medicare--which reporting duplicates existing assessment and \n     reporting requirements of the Kansas Department on Aging; and\n       Whereas, In the environment of the small, home health care \n     services existing in Kansas, it is not feasible to create \n     separate organizations to provide services for non-Medicare \n     customers. The end result of the HCFA rules is that Medicare-\n     certified agencies will no longer be able to provide in-home \n     services to non-Medicare customers. Consequently, with lower \n     levels of preventive home services being available to older \n     Kansans there will be an increase in hospital admissions, \n     thus increasing Medicare costs, and an increase in nursing \n     home admissions, thus increasing Medicaid costs; and\n       Whereas, OASIS appears to be solely a research project of \n     HCFA, totally unfunded by federal sources, and accomplished \n     with loss of funds by reporting agencies and loss of services \n     for Kansas seniors: Now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State \n     of Kansas, the Senate concurring therein: That we memorialize \n     the Congress of the United States to require the Health Care \n     Financing Administration OASIS reporting and data reporting \n     requirements to apply only to Medicare patients and not to \n     all patients of Medicare-certified home health agencies; and\n       Be it further resolved: That the Secretary of State be \n     directed to provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to \n     the President of the United States, Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, President of the United States Senate, \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     minority leaders of the United States Senate and the United \n     States House of Representatives, and to each member of the \n     Kansas Congressional delegation.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am sure that this burden is being felt by agencies \nnationwide, not only in Kansas. I am not sure the legislatures of each \nState have been passing resolutions to say we need relief from OASIS, \nbut I ask the Senator if she has any idea how long it takes for nurses \nto collect this information?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Most agencies are reporting that it takes a nurse \nbetween 1\n\n[[Page S12686]]\n\nand a half and 2 hours per patient. Now, I point out, that is 2 hours \nthat could be used on direct patient care, on tending to the problems \nthat caused the home health visits to be necessary in the first place. \nInstead, as the Senator has so ably described, it is being spent on \nunnecessary paperwork.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have 2 or 3 more questions. I have a \ncopy of OASIS. This is not relief. I understand the time requirements. \nI want you to look at this. This OASIS document includes an 18-page \ninitial assessment that must be completed by a registered nurse, and a \n13-page follow-up assessment that is required every 60 days. This is \nperpetual reporting, a perpetual reporting machine, well-boiled by \nHCFA. And this is on top of assessments already required by States. The \npaperwork burden is immense. I am curious about what is included in \nthis assessment. Is the Senator aware of the nature of the questions in \nthis assessment?\n  I think I know the answer. I have read through this OASIS--the third \ndegree, or whatever you want to call it. Will the Senator speak to the \nnature of the questions in the assessment?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Well, the Senator has put his finger on yet another \nproblem. As I understand it--and the Senator is the expert on the OASIS \nsystem--OASIS collects information on the patients' medical history. We \ncan understand that part, but also on the patient's living \narrangements, sensory status, medications, and emotional state.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am glad to.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Emotional status?\n  Ms. COLLINS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I see that page, as I have gone over this.\n  I tell the distinguished Presiding Officer, nurses in Colorado must \nask the questions of these patients about their feelings--it sounds \nlike a Barbara Streisand song--such as if they have ever felt \ndepressed, had trouble sleeping, or even if they have ever attempted \nsuicide. The thought occurs to me that Members of this distinguished \nbody from time to time feel depressed and have trouble sleeping. I hope \nthat would not be the case with regard to suicide.\n  I am being too sarcastic.\n  Do we really think we need to ask a nurse to bother a physical \ntherapy patient for this information so that he or she can send the \nanswers over to some computer someplace in Baltimore that will then use \nthis information to develop a prospective payment system, and we can't \nfind out when it is going to be proposed? Who in Baltimore reads these? \nI asked that in regard to HCFA, in regard to all of their requirements \nback when it was Health, Education, and Welfare in regard to Kansas \nCity. I wanted to go to Kansas City and say: Who reads this stuff? What \ndo they do with it? Maybe the Senator and I could go to Baltimore and \nfigure that out. Why on Earth would we ask a nurse to bother a physical \ntherapy patient for this information so they can send the answers? It \nhasn't anything to do with physical therapy patients. Why is that?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I completely agree with my colleague. These are the \nquestions, when asked of the senior citizens whom I talked to, they \nfind very intrusive. The nurses who are treating them are offended that \nthey have to pry into matters that have no connection to the reason for \nthe home health visit.\n  Moreover, as I pointed out earlier to my friend and colleague, this \nis time that is being spent on unnecessary paperwork, on intrusive \nquestions that alienate and destroy the relationship between the nurse \nand the patients that could better be used for actually caring for the \npatient.\n  Agencies are not reimbursed for this time. Moreover, in a State such \nas Maine, which is very rural, our home health providers have to spend \na lot of time traveling from patient to patient. This is time that is \nlost from the system.\n  Another issue, which the Senator has also raised, which is \ninexplicable to me, is why is HCFA collecting this data for non-\nMedicare patients? I don't understand that. Am I correct? The Senator \nfrom Kansas is much more knowledgeable about the OASIS system than I \nam. Am I correct that it actually applies to non-Medicare patients as \nwell?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to respond to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Unfortunately, she is correct. Any Medicare-approved health care \nagency must comply with all Medicare conditions of participation. That \nis MCP--probably another acronym, and I will not venture to say what \nthat sounds like--including the collection of OASIS. This means \npatients who do not participate in Medicare are still subject to \nMedicare assessment.\n  In June, HCFA amended this regulation to say that these agencies \ndon't have to--here again, this is what we have a lot of trouble with--\ntransmit the data on non-Medicare patients for the time being, but they \nstill must spend the time taking these assessments. Hello.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yet another sample of what the Senator has described as \npolicies being implemented, then pulled back, agencies not knowing \nwhether they are coming or going, and being subjected to the confusing \nand conflicting and extensive requirements that are detracting from the \nability of these agencies to provide essential care to our seniors.\n  I want to give the Senator from Kansas yet another example of this \nregulatory overkill by HCFA. I don't know whether the Senator from \nKansas is familiar with this, but it is the new 15 -minute incremental \nreporting requirement. HCFA is requiring nurses to act more like \naccountants or lawyers billing for every 15 minutes of their time. They \nare going to have to carry stopwatches to comply with this. \nImplementation is not only going to be very difficult for the staff to \nadminister, but also, once again, it changes the very relationship \nbetween the patient and the nurse. It is very disruptive to a patient's \ncare.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for one additional observation \nand a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I want to go back to my statement earlier when I said in \nthat June HCFA responded in regard to the outcry on the part of the \nhome health care agencies in regards to the regulation on the \nconditions of participation with OASIS. As I indicated before, the \nagency still must spend the time taking the assessment. So I asked \nstaff. I said: Wait a minute. Why is it, if they suspended it, you \nstill have to take the assessment? I don't know where they are storing \nall of this paperwork. Maybe they burn it at Christmas time That may be \na good idea. But, at any rate, write the mail; don't send it. And I \nasked staff: Why are we still doing this if, in fact, you don't send it \nin? It is a privacy issue. Look at the questions that are involved. \nThese are privacy issues, and they haven't figured that out yet. So if, \nin fact, there are privacy issues, it would seem to me we had better \nsettle those first or we are going to have lawsuits, big time. Why \nissue the regulation and then say to people: Well, we have a bunch of \nprivacy issues that we haven't thought through, but keep on filling \nthem out, and when we figure out the privacy issue, why, then we will \nget back to you.\n  I am extremely sympathetic to the concerns raised by my constituents \nthat these new policies will harm seniors.\n  But let's give HCFA a break. I have been pretty critical and a little \nsarcastic, and I have to admit that I have a bias.\n  I have been working on this ever since I have had the privilege of \nbeing in public service. Even back when I was an administrative \nassistant to Congressman Keith Sebelius, we used to have these HCFA \ndirectives coming out to the rural health care delivery system. I can \nremember one right off the bat on behalf of cost containment.\n  Give HCFA a break. They are in charge of cost containment. We are all \ngood at passing laws and then passing a lot of regulations, and saying, \nOK, you have to really put up with these, and it is up to HCFA to put \nout the regulations. And when we find they don't work, the people come \nto us and complain about it.\n  I can remember one rather incredible thing when they said we are not \ngoing to pay anybody any Medicare reimbursement unless the patient \nadmissions are reviewed by hospitals on a 24-hour basis by three \ndoctors. We thought about that a little and said: We think we are for \nthis--because we\n\n[[Page S12687]]\n\ndidn't have any doctors. I figured, well, what the heck. If we go ahead \nand accept this regulation, maybe they could provide the three.\n  Then there was the other great example of the sole provider and \ncommunity hospital--talking about Goodland, KS, America, out on the \nprairie at the top of the world, a great place to live, a great farming \ncommunity miles from nowhere. We asked again--it was HHS at that \nparticular time--can you give us this decree, or this ruling to make \nthis hospital eligible for a little more in payments? They said: Well, \nno, because everybody out there--I am not making this up--has four-\nwheel drives, and it is pretty flat in Kansas. What? As opposed to \nColorado, I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer, who serves as \nan outstanding Senator. Four-wheel drive, and it is flat, and because \nthey have lizards, windstorms. Our weather out there is a little tough \nfor some bird in, like Virginia, down here to make that assessment.\n  So I have a little bias here, but I want to give HCFA a break.\n  I want to ask the Senator, are these policy changes necessary to \nachieve the Medicare savings goals? Medicare is a top concern; \nstrengthen and preserve it. We have all worked very hard to do that. \nAre these policies necessary to achieve the savings that we want to \nachieve to strengthen and preserve Medicare?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator has raised an excellent question. There is a \nvery good answer. That is no. In fact, the regulatory overkill of the \nClinton administration has already exceeded the savings projected by \nthe balanced budget amendment. Medicare for home health fell nearly 15 \npercent last year, and CBO now projects the reductions in home health \ncare will exceed $46 billion over the next 5 years. That is almost \nthree times greater than the $16 billion estimate that the \nCongressional Budget Office originally estimated.\n  It is yet another indication that these cuts are far too deep, and \nthat they are hurting far too many people completely unnecessarily. \nThey have been far too severe and much more far reaching than Congress \never intended when it was trying to bring a measure of fiscal restraint \nto the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask the distinguished Senator from Maine, didn't we \nfix the problems last year when we passed the omnibus appropriations \nbill? I think we both made speeches at that particular time. What is \nthe status?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator worked closely with me and others last year \nin providing a small measure of relief in the omnibus appropriations \nbill. I am pleased that together we were able to take some initial \nsteps to remedy this issue. However, I think it is evident from the \noverwhelming evidence that the proposal did not go nearly far enough in \nrelieving the financial distress of these home health agencies. The \nones that are paying the price are the good agencies, the cost-\neffective agencies that are serving our seniors. That is the tragedy.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I could ask the Senator one final question, I know I \nhave been hard on HCFA. Each Member has some very special experiences, \nand these are experiences that come to our attention when a constituent \nis having a big-time problem or a hospital or home health care agency. \nAll of the folks that work down at HHS certainly don't fall under the \ncategory that I have been talking about. So what about our \nresponsibility? What about our leadership? What should we do to fix the \nproblem? How can we provide more relief to the beleaguered home health \ncare agency?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I know the Senator from Kansas has been such a leader \nand cares so much about this issue and has joined with me in \nintroducing legislation, along with our colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, and 31 of our colleagues. Both sides of the aisle have \njoined in legislation that we have introduced called the Medicare Home \nHealth Equity Act.\n  This solves the problem. For one thing, it eliminates another 15-\npercent cut that is scheduled to go into effect in October of next \nyear. I am sure my friend, the Senator from Kansas, agrees with me if \nthat goes into effect, it will sound the death knell for the remaining \nhome health agencies. That means the ones that have been struggling to \nhang on will be forced to close their doors or refuse even more \nservices to our senior citizens. This is totally unnecessary because we \nhave already achieved the savings, the targets set by the Balanced \nBudget Act.\n  The legislation includes a number of other provisions that affect a \nlot of the regulatory issues we have discussed today. I think it is \nabsolutely critical we pass this legislation or similar provisions \nbefore we go home. I have visited senior citizens in my State who, if \nthey lose their home health services, are going to be forced into \nnursing homes or hospitals. The irony is that is going to be at far \ngreater cost.\n  Mr. ROBB. It will increase the costs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is right. This is penny wise and pound \nfoolish--not to mention the human toll that is being taken on our \nvulnerable senior citizens and our disabled citizens.\n  I know the Senator shares my commitment. This is of highest priority. \nWe must solve this problem before we adjourn.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield one more time, I thank the \nSenator for all of her leadership and all of her hard work in this \neffort. I believe it is absolutely mandatory for Congress to bring much \nneeded relief to the home health care industry in the timeframe she has \nemphasized, as well as to the small rural hospitals and teaching \nhospitals that also are feeling the pinch of all the legislative and \nregulatory changes made in the last few years.\n  The Senator is exactly right. We will have to move quickly. We must \ndo it this year. There has been talk if we can't agree on a single \nproposal, we might have to put it off until next year. Time is of the \nessence in regard to our hospitals, especially the small rural \nproviders. They operate on a shoestring budget. The same is true for \nthe home health care agencies.\n  I will continue to work with the distinguished Senator to pass \nlegislation before Congress adjourns for the year. We cannot go home \nbefore we straighten this out and provide some help.\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership. I think we have had a very \ngood colloquy.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Kansas. I appreciate his \nsupport and his compassion in making sure we are keeping our promise to \nour senior citizens. With his help and with our continuing partnership, \nI am convinced we can do the job and solve this problem before we \nadjourn.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12687-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12687-S12688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GUNS IN SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when is it okay for a gun to be at school? \nI find it hard to think of an instance when it is. In fact, a few years \nago Congress was so concerned about guns at school that it passed a law \nthat required school districts to implement a zero tolerance policy for \nguns or lose their Federal funding. Schools must expel a student who \nbrings a gun to school for a year.\n  Three weeks ago a young man at Lakeside High School, a public school \nof 520 students in the Nine Mile Falls School District in eastern \nWashington, brought a handgun to school. Thankfully, school authorities \nwere notified quickly and nobody was hurt. Students and parents were \nunderstandably upset that such an incident would happen at all, and \nassumed that the situation would be dealt with in accordance with the \ndistrict's ``zero-tolerance'' policy for such matters.\n  What happened was very different. I began receiving calls from \nstudents and parents who were concerned that this young man will now be \nallowed back at school after just 45 days. They were both confused and \nupset when they found out that Federal law supersedes local policies \nfor addressing such incidents. So upset, in fact, that students at \nLakeside High School have begun organizing a walkout. I have a flyer \nthat has been circulated by students promoting a planned walkout on \nOctober 18. The students plan to drive to the district office and \nprotest the return of the student. I ask unanimous consent the \nstudents' flyer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     ______________________________________________\n\n       Do we really want this kid with a gun coming back to our \n     school?!\n\n[[Page S12688]]\n\n                                 NO!!!\n\n                          Let's stand for our\n\n                                RIGHTS!\n\n                                Join US\n\n       On October 18, 1999, LHD Students Are Having A WALK OUT! \n     Between 1st and 2nd Block--Meet In The Student parking lot \n     and drive down to the district office.\n\n                         WE HAVE A RIGHT, TOO!\n\n     ______________________________________________\n\n  Like other school districts across the country, the students, parents \nand educators at Lakeside High School have just run head-first into the \ndouble standard inherent in the discipline policies mandated by the \nfederal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. While the \nintent of this law is commendable--to ensure that disabled children are \neducated in a fair and equitable manner--in practice it has again shown \nits flaws. As I said when I was the only Senator to vote against the \nreauthorization of IDEA in 1997, the single aspect of this bill that is \nmost questionable and unjust is the double standard it sets with \nrespect to discipline in schools. Each and every school district \nretains nearly full and complete authority over disciplinary matters as \nthey apply to students who are not in special education classes. They \nlose almost all of that authority under the present IDEA statute.\n  Under the IDEA amendments of 1997, if a child brings a gun to school \nand a team of parents and educators decide it is not related to the \nchild's disability, that student may be removed for up to a year. But, \nthe district must continue to provide the child with a free appropriate \npublic education.\n  If the incident is determined to be caused by the child's disability, \nthen the student may be moved from their regular classroom for no more \nthan 45 days. Again, that child must receive not simply a free \nappropriate public education, but the school district must ensure that \nthe student can continue to participate in the general curriculum, \ncontinue to receive services that allow the student to meet the goals \nset out in the child's individual education plan, and the school must \nprovide services that address the misbehavior so that it does not \nrecur.\n  Although I've just given you a succinct description of federal law, \nMr. Parker is still faced with a paradox. He is responsible for making \nsure school is a safe place for all children to learn. However, IDEA \nrequires the school to implement different consequences for children \nwho qualify for special education services for violations like bringing \na gun to school, selling drugs or engaging with violent behavior. \nChildren in special education can make up anywhere from 10-20 percent \nof a school district's enrollment, encompassing children with a broad \nrange of disabilities.\n  Instead of focusing on what's best for the children and staff at his \nschool, including the student who brought the gun to school, he and \nother administrators in his district must focus on what they have to do \nto minimize the district's exposure to a lawsuit. It's an unfortunate \nfact that this provision of law is often fought out in the court room, \ndriving desperately needed resources away from serving children.\n  Mr. Parker and district officials have not yet made a final decision \nabout what to do in this instance. However, Mr. Parker did make a point \nin an article published in the Spokane Spokesman Review yesterday. He \nsaid, ``We have to focus on the law, not the kid.'' He's right. As I \nmentioned earlier, students at Lakeside High School are planning to \nwalk out of class on the 18th of October and hold a rally to bring \nattention to their concerns. I want to assure the students and parents \nthat they have my attention, and a disruption of classes is \nunnecessary. Instead, I hope they channel that energy into writing \nletters to and meeting with their elected officials to make them aware \nof their concerns about the law.\n   Mr. President, IDEA says that Members of Congress know more about \nhow to educate students than do their teachers, their administrators, \ntheir school board members, people who have spent their lives and \ncareers at this job. We do not know more. They know more. We should \npermit them to do their jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12688-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12688-S12689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FEDERAL MANDATES AND SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has, once \nagain, succinctly and clearly stated a circumstance and situation in \nthis country that is almost beyond belief. I have had a number of \ncomplaints about that. I used to be a Federal prosecutor. One of my \ngood friends who has been a prosecutor for a very long time personally \ncame to Washington to talk to me about the abuses of this law. It \nactually resulted in a full-page article in Time magazine. The title of \nit was, ``The Meanest Kid In Alabama.''\n  It is probably not an accurate statement, but it indicated what we \nwere dealing with. My friend, David Whetstone, told me of the \ncircumstance in which a very violent, disruptive young man was kept in \nthe classroom, under these Federal laws, beyond all common sense, all \nreason, beyond anything that can have any basis in connection with \nreality.\n  Americans may not know what is occurring, but this is happening in \nother schools. I want to tell you what happened to this young man. He \nhad an aide who got on the school bus with him alone in the morning, \nsat with him alone through the classroom day, and went home with him at \nthe end of the day because of his disruptive behavior. That had to be \npaid for by the school board, the taxpayers of that community. Can you \nimagine what it would be like trying to be a teacher, trying to teach \nin a classroom with that kind of problem? He used curse words to the \nprincipal on a regular basis, and it was very disruptive. But our law \nsaid, basically, he had to stay in that classroom. It was just \nremarkable.\n  Eventually the young man, going home one afternoon on the school bus, \nattacked the bus driver, it has been reported. The aide tried to \nrestrain him, and he attacked the aide. My friend, the prosecutor, \nbrought a criminal action or some legal action against him to try to \ndeal with it. He was shocked, stunned, and amazed that this goes on, on \na regular basis. He wrote me that in that County, Baldwin County, AL, \nthere are at least six other incidents of a similar nature of which he \nwas aware.\n  This may sound unbelievable, but I suggest anybody who thinks what \nthe Senator has just said is not true, the kinds of things I am talking \nabout are not true, ask your principals and teachers. Just ask them. It \nis Federal law that is mandating it.\n  We were supposed to pay for it when we passed it, and we never even \npaid for it. We were supposed to pay 40 percent of that unfunded \nmandate on the school systems. I think we are paying 15 percent now. \nThis administration, President Clinton, opposes our getting it up to 40 \npercent. Why? I will tell you why I think the President opposes it. Not \nbecause it is not necessary; it is because the school systems, by this \nlaw, are having to do it anyway. They ran polling data that said maybe \nit strikes a better chord to have more teachers than to have funding \nfor the Federal mandate we put on the schools, so we want to get more \nteachers and get more political credit or something; I don't know. We \nought to finish funding this mandate. We ought to go back and look at \nthis requirement and change it. It is not sound.\n  We want to keep disabled children in the classroom as much as \npossible. That is a worthy goal. But to go to the extent that we cannot \nremove children who bring guns to school, who consistently disrupt the \nschool system, is beyond my comprehension.\n  In the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, we had \ntestify the superintendent of a school system in Vermont. I was \nstunned. He said 20 percent of his budget goes to IDEA students, these \nkids with disabilities. In Vermont, 20 percent of the system's money \ngoes for that. Somehow we are out of sync. You wonder why we cannot get \nmore good education? Teachers cannot maintain discipline. They can only \nremove them, what, 40 days from a classroom in the face of the most \noutrageous behavior, even where there is violence involved. We have an \nobligation to the classrooms and to our teachers to help our teachers \nmaintain order. If we are not going to do anything, then we don't do \nanything, but the worst thing for this Congress to do\n\n[[Page S12689]]\n\nis to pass laws that make it worse, make it harder for a teacher to do \nhis or her job.\n  I know teachers who have quit; they say they cannot take it anymore. \nA friend of mine, who is 6 feet 4 and played college basketball, told \nme he taught junior high school and he didn't feel safe a lot of days.\n  I think we can do better. We ought to help our school systems do \nthat. The Senator from Washington and a number of us, including the \nPresiding Officer, are working on some proposals that would allow us to \nempower school systems to receive funds with a minimum of restrictions \nas long as they have a firm plan that they know will work in their \ncommunity to actually improve education.\n  We need to give the people elected to run our school systems more \nauthority and give them the money so they can use it of the Federal \nmoney we are spending on schools, we know now only 65 cents out of \nevery Federal dollar for education actually gets down to the classroom. \nWe need to get our dollars to the classroom. We need to get that money \ndown to the people who know our children's names. They need the money, \nnot Washington. We cannot be a super school board for America. That \nwould be so silly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12689-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CUTS IN HOME HEALTH CARE FUNDING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I sat here and listened with great \ninterest when the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Kansas were \ntalking about the home health care. I realized early that was going to \nbe a problem in Alabama. It has had a dramatic and devastating impact \non the State. Mr. President, 15 percent cuts consistently are really \ndevastating the home health care agency.\n  Senator Shelby, the senior Senator from Alabama, and I, right after \nthis bill passed--without hearings, by the way, as part of a conference \ncommittee report--along with other people, when it was voted on, did \nnot realize its significance. But pretty soon we realized that, so we \ncalled the top officials of HCFA into our office to discuss with them \nwhat we could do. We had proposed and offered an amendment to the \neffect we would delay the implementation of these changes until we had \nhearings to analyze their impact. We could tell it was going to be very \nbad. HCFA refused. They would not join us in that effort. That \namendment we sought to have agreed to over a year ago was not agreed \nto.\n  It is, to my way of thinking, a situation that cannot continue. We \nare going to have to fix it. It was seen early. It was a matter that \ncame up in an attempt to make some changes they thought would work, and \nCongress ought to pass laws to help effectuate that. But there was not \nan understanding of how bad it was going to be.\n  The agency in charge of the management of the home health care, HCFA, \nis responsible and ought to be helping us in a more effective way to \ndeal with this. It is true, as the Senator from Maine said, even under \nthe containment of costs provided in the legislation that passed at \nthat time, HCFA has cut substantially more than that.\n  It is expected to produce only about one-third of the savings that \nactually occurred. They squeezed that program for $46 billion over 5 \nyears. That is about three times what was actually planned to be cut. \nWe have a crisis that does require attention. I thank the Senator from \nMaine for leading the effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12689-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Congress has no greater responsibility than \nto ensure that our Armed Forces--the guardians of the freedoms which \nall Americans cherish so dearly--are given the resources they need to \ncarry out their mission. Consequently, the Defense Appropriations bill \nis one of the most important pieces of legislation that we pass each \nyear.\n  As others have expressed, this is by no means a perfect piece of \nlegislation. There are a number of items contained in this bill that do \nnot meet the most urgent needs of the Armed Forces. At a time when the \nmen and women who serve in uniform are being called upon to serve the \ninterests of the United States in a growing number of places--Bosnia, \nKosovo, Haiti, Iraq, and the list goes on--Congress must ensure that \nthe most critical needs of the Armed Forces are met first.\n  However, I believe that the strengths of this conference report \noutweigh its faults. The report does contain funding to address a \ngrowing number of readiness and quality-of-life issues currently \nchallenging our military. Our men and women in uniform need to know \nthat their Congress supports them, and voting for this conference \nreport is one way to demonstrate that support.\n  So, Mr. President, although I believe that Congress can always do a \nbetter job of directing defense dollars where they are most needed, I \nalso I believe that there is much in this conference report that \naddresses critical needs of the military, and that is why I voted in \nfavor of the report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12689-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12689-S12690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE RONNIE WHITE VOTE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Chamber is where 50 years ago this \nmonth, in October 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's \nnomination of William Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit, the first Senate confirmation of an African-American to \nour federal district courts and courts of appeal. Indeed, today is the \n50th anniversary of that historic event. This Senate is where some 30 \nyears ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of \nThurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court. And this is where \nlast week, the Senate wrongfully rejected President Clinton's \nnomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made me doubt seriously \nwhether this Senate, serving at the end of a half century of progress, \nwould have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or Justice Marshall.\n  For the first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a Federal district \ncourt was defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate \ndebate that day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just \nthat which took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus \nlunch that led to the party line vote. On October 5, 1999, the Senate \nRepublicans voted in lockstep to reject the nomination of Justice \nRonnie White to the Federal court in Missouri.\n  For many months I had been calling for a fair vote on the nomination, \nwhich had been delayed for 27 months. Instead, the country witnessed a \npartisan vote and a party line vote as the 54 Republican members of the \nSenate present that day all voted against confirming this highly \nqualified African-American jurist to the Federal bench.\n  Tuesday of last week the Republican Senate caucus blocked \nconfirmation of Justice Ronnie White. It is too late for the Senate to \nundo the harm done by that caucus vote, although I would hope that some \nwho voted based on inaccurate characterizations of Justice White and \nhis record would apologize to him. What the Senate can do and must do \nnow is to make sure that partisan error is not repeated. The Senate \nshould ensure that other minority and women candidates receive a fair \nvote. We can start with the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and \nMarsha Berzon, which have been held up far too long without Senate \naction. It is past time for the Senate to do the just thing, the \nhonorable thing, and vote to confirm each of these highly qualified \nnominees.\n  Likewise, we should be moving forward to consider the nomination of \nJudge Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit. His nomination has already \nbeen pending for over seven months. He should get a hearing and prompt \nconsideration. He should be accorded a fair up or down vote on his \nnomination before the Senate adjourns this year.\n  The bipartisan Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for \nIndependent Courts recently recommended that the Senate complete its \nconsideration of judicial nominations within 60 days. The Senate has \nalready exceeded that time with respect to the nomination of Judge Ann \nWilliams to the Seventh Circuit. When confirmed, she will be the first \nAfrican-American to serve on that court. We should proceed on that \nnomination without further delay.\n  Likewise, the Senate should be moving forward to consider \nthe nomination of Judge James Wynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit. When \nconfirmed, Judge\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\nWynn will be the first African-American to serve on the Fourth Circuit \nand will fill a judicial emergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed \nsince the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still \nthere has never been an African-American on the Fourth Circuit. The \nnomination of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., was previously sent to us by \nPresident Clinton in 1995. That nomination was never considered by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee or the Senate and was returned to President \nClinton without action at the end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to \nact on a qualified African-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit.\n\n  In addition, early next year the Senate should act favorably on the \nnominations of Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit and Enrique \nMoreno to the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of \nJorge Rangel on which the Senate refused to act last Congress. These \nare both well qualified nominees who will add to the capabilities and \ndiversity of those courts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth \nCircuit has this month declared that a judicial emergency exists on \nthat court, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, lack of Senate \naction on pending nominations, and overwhelming workload.\n  I have noted the unfortunate pattern that the Republican Senate has \nestablished by delaying consideration of too many women and minority \nnominees. The recent Republican caucus vote against Justice Ronnie \nWhite is the most egregious example, but the treatment of Judge Richard \nPaez and Marsha Berzon show that it is, unfortunately, not an isolated \nexample.\n  Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all \nAmericans. The Senate should treat minority and women nominees fairly \nand proceed to consider them with the same speed and deference that it \nshows other nominees. Let us start the healing process. Let us vote to \nconfirm Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon before this month ends; \nJudge Julio Fuentes before the Senate adjourns in November; and Judge \nAnn Williams, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, and Enrique \nMoreno in the first weeks of next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12690-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MOTHERS AND NEWBORNS HEALTH INSURANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Mothers and \nNewborns Health Insurance Act, a bill that I have introduced along with \nmy colleagues Senators Bond, Breaux, Lincoln, and McCain.\n  As you know, Mr. President, in 1997 Congress passed the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, or CHIP. CHIP is a joint Federal-State \nprogram, designed to ensure that children of low-income working \nfamilies have access to health insurance. I'm proud to have worked on \nthe Senate Finance Committee to establish CHIP, and I remain committed \nto its guiding principle: that all children should have access to the \nmedical care they need to stay healthy and strong.\n  In fact, just 13 days ago, the Montana CHIP program went into effect. \nSo as I speak, children in my state are already benefitting from this \nprogram.\n  But while CHIP is important, it is not without imperfections. Most \nnotably, States are not allowed to extend CHIP funds to low-income, \npregnant adult women. This just doesn't make sense. If pregnant women \ngo uninsured, they are far less likely to receive prenatal care. And if \nthey don't receive prenatal care, their babies face a much higher risk \nof having health problems, from premature birth to birth defects. We \nshould make sure that these babies are healthy and strong from the very \nstart, by allowing states to offer health insurance to low-income \npregnant women under CHIP.\n  A second problem with CHIP is that, just like the Medicaid program, \nwe've had a hard time getting the word out about it. Right now, there \nare 358,000 pregnant woman and fully 3 million children who are \neligible for Medicaid, but are not enrolled in the program. The same \nholds true with CHIP: across the United States, low-income, uninsured \nkids cannot benefit from the program, because they aren't enrolled.\n  Mr. President, our bill is aimed at solving these problems, and \nmaking CHIP an even stronger, more effective program. First, it would \ngive States the freedom to extend CHIP funds to low-income, pregnant \nmothers above the age of 19. This is a critical steps toward empowering \nour States to provide health care to those who need it most, when they \nneed it most. As many as 45,000 pregnant women could benefit from this \nchange every year--and bare in mind, that means that 45,000 babies \ncould benefit as well.\n  And let me add, Mr. President, that this does not create a new \nFederal mandate. To the contrary, this provision would only increase \nthe freedom of the States to direct these Federal health care resources \nas they see fit.\n  Second, our bill would assist States in reaching out to their \nuninsured citizens. When Congress passed the welfare reform bill in \n1996, we also created a $500 million fund that States could use to let \nuninsured folks know if they were eligible for Medicaid. The problem \nis, most of this money has gone unused. And in just a short while, most \nstates will lose their 3-year window of opportunity to use these funds. \nOur bill will eliminate this 3-year deadline, to allow continued access \nto these funds. It will also allow states to use the funds to reach out \nto both Medicaid and CHIP-eligible women and children. By making this \nchange, we can help ensure that CHIP and Medicaid function as they are \nsupposed to--and that the mothers and children who need health \ninsurance coverage will get it.\n   Mr. President, most of my colleagues, liberal and conservative \nalike, agree that CHIP is a step in the right direction toward solving \nthe growing problem of the uninsured. Let's act now to make CHIP even \nstronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12690-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12690-S12691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CTBT VOTE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to correct \nsome misconceptions about the reasons why the Senate voted to reject \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Wednesday, and the impact its \nrejection will have on efforts to control the spread of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Some have asserted that the Senate acted to reject the treaty for \npartisan political reasons. At the same time, they threatened grave \npolitical consequences for those who opposed the treaty. Obviously, \nthere is a lot more politics in the aftermath of the treaty's rejection \n(by supporters) than in its not popular, but principled rejection. \nSimply put, Senators voted to defeat the treaty because it jeopardized \nour nation's security by undermining the U.S. nuclear deterrent that \nhas served our country so well for the past 50 years.\n  Nor was this evidence that Republicans are isolationist, as the \nPresident charged. It is Republicans who support free trade agreements \n(rather than the President's party, which is dominated by labor union \nisolationism). And Republicans strongly supported NATO expansion.\n  Our distinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, summed up the case \nagainst the CTBT quite well stating,\n\n       I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as \n     the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in \n     recent decades. Its usefulness to the goal of non-\n     proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely \n     ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence \n     in the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as a \n     symbolic statement of our desire for a safer world, it is \n     problematic because it would exacerbate risks and \n     uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear stockpile.\n\n  The majority leader and other opponents of this treaty never asked \nMembers to vote against it for reasons of party loyalty. Rather, \nSenators were persuaded to reject the treaty by the facts about its \neffect on our security. In fact, Republican Senators were on both sides \nof this issue, while Democrats paradoxically, voted lockstep, except \nfor Senator Byrd, who voted present.\n  Unfortunately, the President and the Democratic leader have asserted \nthat the process for consideration of the treaty was unfair, and have \nimplied they were forced to vote on the treaty. With all due respect, \nthese assertions strike me as nothing more than sour grapes. Let's \nreview the history that brought us to the vote yesterday.\n  For 2 years, the President and other supporters of the CTBT called on \nthe Senate to take up the treaty.\n  In his State of the Union Address in 1998, President Clinton called \nfor it to be taken up ``this year.''\n\n[[Page S12691]]\n\n  In June 1998, President Clinton said it was ``important that the \nSenate debate and vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without \ndelay.''\n  On August 9 of this year, the President asked ``the full Senate to \nvote for ratification as soon as possible.''\n  On April 1 of this year, Secretary of State Albright gave a speech \ncalling for action on the CTBT, ``this year, this session, now.''\n  And some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were quite \noutspoken in calling for a vote on the treaty. In 1998, the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle said on the Senate floor that ``We believe that \nit's important for us to move this very important treaty this year.'' \nAnd just over 2 weeks ago, he stood on the Senate floor and said, ``I \nstill think, one way or the other, we ought to get to this treaty, get \nit on the floor, debate it, and vote on it.''\n  And as we all know, it was the threat to bring the business of the \nSenate to a halt that led the majority leader to offer a unanimous \nconsent agreement on the CTBT. On September 8--with 22 days remaining \nin the fiscal year to dispose of the remaining appropriations bills--\nSenator Dorgan said the following:\n\n       When [the majority leader] comes to the floor, I intend to \n     come to the floor and ask him when he intends to bring this \n     treaty to the floor. If he and others decide it will not come \n     to the floor, I intend to plant myself on the floor like a \n     potted plant and object. I intend to object to other routine \n     business of the Senate until this country decides to accept \n     the moral leadership that is its obligation and bring this \n     treaty to the floor for a debate and a vote.\n\n  Supporters of the CTBT clearly wanted a vote on the treaty; it now \nturns out they actually only wanted a vote if they could win. Well, \nthat's not the way it works.\n  I have also been surprised that some Senators have complained that \nthe time for consideration of the treaty was too short. Let's remember \nthat the time-frame for consideration of the treaty was established by \nunanimous consent. In fact, the majority leader first offered a \nunanimous-consent agreement on September 30. The Democratic leader \nobjected to that first request, asking for it to be modified to add \nmore time--4 more hours of general debate, and up to 8 hours for \namendments (in addition to the 10 hours already allocated). The \nmajority leader accommodated the Democratic request, and on October 1, \na modified version of the unanimous-consent request was again offered, \nand not a single Senator objected either to the time or to the date. \nThe latter is also important, because setting the date for the vote on \nOctober 12 or 13 (it occurred on the 13th) meant there were almost 2 \nweeks for ``education'' of Senators who had not already become educated \non the treaty. (Presumably those who were fomenting consideration of \nthe treaty had taken the time to familiarize themselves with it. They \ncan hardly argue they needed more time in view of their insistence.)\n  In any event, we all agreed on a time-table to take up the treaty. \nThis is why I am disappointed that some have charged that the majority \nleader scheduled the vote out of some sense of partisanship. If Members \nhad a concern about the time frame for the treaty's consideration, any \nsingle Senator could have objected--but none did. And the week after \nthe agreement, three Senate committees held hours of hearings. \nResponsible Senators had plenty of time to learn enough to make an \ninformed decision, witness the early expression of support by those who \nsaid others needed more time (i.e., those who didn't agree with them).\n  I am also disappointed by assertions that, by rejecting the CTBT, the \nUnited States Senate has diminished America's moral authority in the \nfight against nuclear proliferation. I deeply regret that this \nsentiment has been echoed, and to some degree instigated, by Members of \nthis body and the administration who find themselves on the losing side \nof the debate.\n\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. By rejecting this deeply \nflawed accord, the Senate has anchored the United States firmly on the \nmoral high ground.\n  My vote against this treaty rested on three premises:\n  First, we must be able to test if we are to maintain safe and \nreliable nuclear weapons because they help to secure peace for American \ncitizens and for the rest of the world.\n  Second, this unenforceable, unverifiable treaty would have little if \nany impact on the problem of proliferation. In fact, it might actually \ncause more nations to seek nuclear weapons if they became unsure of the \nreliability of the U.S. nuclear umbrella.\n  It is vitally important that our Nation pursue efforts to combat \nnuclear proliferation. But we should pursue meaningful efforts with \nreal effects. Unfortunately, while criticizing treaty opponents of not \nbeing serious about proliferation, it is the Clinton administration \nthat has not been willing to take serious actions to combat \nproliferation. For example, in 1997, when reports began to surface \nabout Russian missile assistance to Iran, I led a group of 99 Members \nof the House and Senate, in writing to the President to urge him to \ninvoke sanctions to halt this trade. The President refused. In November \n1997, the Senate unanimously passed a concurrent resolution that I \nsponsored, expressing the sense of the Congress that the President \nshould sanction the Russian organizations involved in selling missile \ntechnology to Iran. The House also passed this resolution \noverwhelmingly by a vote of 414 to 8. Again the President refused to \nimpose sanctions.\n  The Congress tried again to spur the administration to action 6 \nmonths later, when we passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions \nAct mandating sanctions on any organization involved in assisting \nIran's missile program. This bill passed the Senate by a vote of 90 to \n4. Yet when it reached the President's desk, he vetoed the bill. As \nthese examples show, this administration is simply not willing to take \nthe tough actions necessary to prevent proliferation. It is these \nmeaningful measures that will reduce proliferation, not an \nunenforceable, unverifiable treaty.\n  The third and final reason I voted against the CTBT is that the \nConstitution establishes the Senate as co-equal with the President in \ncommitting this country to treaties. I take this responsibility \nseriously, and will not simply rubber-stamp any arms control agreement \nthat does not meet at least minimum standards--and this one does not. \nRejection will help future negotiators insist on meaningful provisions \nthat are verifiable and enforceable.\n  Each of these premises is morally sound; in my view they are morally \nsuperior than a vote for this flawed pact, no matter how well-\nintentioned.\n  Because this treaty would have harmed our security, its ratification \nwould have been an abdication of our moral responsibility to maintain \npeace through strength. In 1780, President George Washington said, \n``There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to \nmeet an enemy.'' Two hundred years later, President Ronald Reagan \ncalled this doctrine ``Peace Through Strength.'' History has redeemed \nthe judgment of Ronald Reagan in first adopting this stance with the \nSoviet Union; I believe that history will redeem the rejection of the \nCTBT as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12691-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12691-S12693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CTBT COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Wednesday evening, the Senate cast a \nhistoric vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  In the aftermath of this vote, I am reminded of the old saying, ``The \npast is prologue.''\n  At some point we have to lift this issue from the cauldron of \npolitics.\n  Now, is it not time to build bridges and find common ground on the \nissue of a possible treaty covering nuclear testing? Let the issues be \nworked on, for a while, by people of the caliber, of the experience, of \nthose who wrote to the Senate, who testified, and called or sent \nstatements during the Senate's debate. Their wisdom can then be \nreturned to our next President and the 107th Congress.\n  That is why, today, I propose the creation of a bipartisan, blue \nribbon commission of experts, representing differing viewpoints on the \nbasic issues, to study this issue and make recommendations--including \npossible changes to the treaty. Colleagues, I ask for your ``advice and \nconsent'' as I pursue this goal of a commission.\n  During the course of the debate in the Senate, it was clear that a \nnumber of Members could have supported some\n\n[[Page S12692]]\n\ntype of a test ban treaty, but were troubled by several key provisions \nin the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that was before us.\n  Of a particular concern was the zero-yield threshold. Legitimate \nconcerns were raised about our ability to monitor violations down to \nthe zero-yield level, and with our need to conduct, at some point in \nthe future, very low yield nuclear explosions to verify the safety of \nour stockpile, or to ensure the validity of the stockpile stewardship \nprogram. Perhaps it would have been better to agree to a Treaty which \nallowed very low yield testing--as all past presidents, beginning with \nPresident Eisenhower, have proposed.\n  Another grave concern was the fact that this Treaty bans nuclear \ntesting in perpetuity. When we are dealing with the safety and \ncredibility of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, we should exercise the \ngreatest degree of caution. Would it not have been better to have a \ntreaty which required, specifically in its text, periodic reviews, at \nfixed intervals, as did the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT. At \nthe time the Senate considered that Treaty, the NPT provided for \nautomatic reviews every 5 years.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program was another issue of concern. In my \nview, it is just not far enough along, as confirmed by qualified \nexperts, for the United States to stake the future of its nuclear \narsenal on this alternative to actual testing. More needs to be done on \nthat issue. For example, there is currently underway a panel, pursuant \nto a provision in the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1999, to study and report on the reliability, safety \nand security of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Perhaps some of the fine \nwork of this commission, which is comprised of experts such as former \nSecretary of Defense James Schlesinger and Dr. Johnny Foster, could be \nincorporated into the work of a test ban commission.\n  These are but examples of a number of issues related to this Treaty \nwhere there are honest differences of opinion, and over which bridges \nmust be built to reach common ground. These issues could benefit from \nexamination now by a group outside of the political arena--a group of \nexperts.\n  Recent history is replete with examples of commissions, composed of a \nbipartisan group of experts, who have successfully advised the \nCongress, the President.\n  For example, in 1994, when I was Vice Chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the CIA was under attack, I included legislation in the \nFY 1995 Intelligence Authorization Act establishing a commission to \nstudy the roles and capabilities of the Intelligence Community. The \ncommission was formed by the President and the congressional \nleadership. It was chaired by former secretaries of defense Les Aspin \nand Harold Brown and former Senator Warren Rudman. They met the \nchallenge; their advice was accepted.\n  Let's join together; get it done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a number of items be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExcerpts From the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for \n                   Fiscal Year 1999 Conference Report\n\n     SEC. 3159.

intelligence community in the \n     post-cold war global environment; and\n       (2) to prepare and transmit the reports described in \n     section 904.\n       (b) Implementation.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Commission shall specifically consider the following:\n       (1) What should be the roles and missions of the \n     intelligence community in terms of providing support to the \n     defense and foreign policy establishments and how should \n     these relate to tactical intelligence activities.\n\n[[Page S12693]]\n\n       (2) Whether the roles and missions of the intelligence \n     community should extend beyond the traditional areas of \n     providing support to the defense and foreign policy \n     establishments, and, if so, what areas should be considered \n     legitimate for intelligence collection and analysis, and \n     whether such areas should include, for example, economic \n     issues, environmental issues, and health issues.\n       (3) What functions, if any, should continue to be assigned \n     to the organizations of the intelligence community, including \n     the Central Intelligence Agency, and what capabilities should \n     these organizations retain for the future.\n       (4) Whether the existing organization and management \n     framework of the organizations of the intelligence community, \n     including the Central Intelligence Agency, provide the \n     optimal structure for the accomplishment of their missions.\n       (5) Whether existing principles and strategies governing \n     the acquisition and maintenance of intelligence collection \n     capabilities should be retained and what collection \n     capabilities should the Government retain to meet future \n     contingencies.\n       (6) Whether intelligence analysis, as it is currently \n     structured and executed, adds sufficient value to information \n     otherwise available to the Government to justify its \n     continuation, and, if so, at what level of resources.\n       (7) Whether the existing decentralized system of \n     intelligence analysis results in significant waste or \n     duplication, and if so, what can be done to correct these \n     deficiencies.\n       (8) Whether the existing arrangements for allocating \n     available resources to accomplish the roles and missions \n     assigned to intelligence agencies are adequate.\n       (9) Whether the existing framework for coordinating among \n     intelligence agencies with respect to intelligence collection \n     and analysis and other activities, including training and \n     operational activities, provides an optimal structure for \n     such coordination.\n       (10) Whether current personnel policies and practices of \n     intelligence agencies provide an optimal work force to \n     satisfy the needs of intelligence consumers.\n       (11) Whether resources for intelligence activities should \n     continue to be allocated as part of the defense budget or be \n     treated by the President and Congress as a separate budgetary \n     program.\n       (12) Whether the existing levels of resources allocated for \n     intelligence collection or intelligence analysis, or to \n     provide a capability to conduct covert actions, are seriously \n     at variance with United States needs.\n       (13) Whether there are areas of redundant or overlapping \n     activity or areas where there is evidence of serious waste, \n     duplication, or mismanagement.\n       (14) To what extent, if any, should the budget for United \n     States intelligence activities be publicly disclosed.\n       (15) To what extent, if any, should the United States \n     intelligence community collect information bearing upon \n     private commercial activity and the manner in which such \n     information should be controlled and disseminated.\n       (16) Whether counterintelligence policies and practices are \n     adequate to ensure that employees of intelligence agencies \n     are sensitive to security problems, and whether intelligence \n     agencies themselves have adequate authority and capability to \n     address perceived security problems.\n       (17) The manner in which the size, missions, capabilities, \n     and resources of the United States intelligence community \n     compare to those of other countries.\n       (18) Whether existing collaborative arrangements between \n     the United States and other countries in the area of \n     intelligence cooperation should be maintained and whether \n     such arrangements should be expanded to provide for increased \n     burdensharing.\n       (19) Whether existing arrangements for sharing intelligence \n     with multinational organizations in support of mutually \n     shared objectives are adequate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url":

A bill to expand the applicability of daylight saving time; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    THE HALLOWEEN SAFETY ACT OF 1999\n\n  MR. ENZI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Halloween Safety Act of 1999.'' This Act has one simple purpose: to \nextend the date on which the daylight saving time ends from the last \nSunday in October to the first Sunday of November in order to include \nthe holiday of Halloween.\n  The idea of extending daylight saving time was first introduced to me \nby Sharon Rasmussen, a second grade teacher from Sheridan, Wyoming, and \nher students. I received a packet of twenty letters from Mrs. \nRasmussen's second grade class expressing their wish to have an extra \nhour of daylight during Halloween in order to make the holiday safer. \nThese children explained that they would feel more secure if they had \nan extra hour of daylight when venturing door-to-door in their annual \ntrick-or-treating. Halloween is a holiday of great importance to \nyoungsters throughout the United States and a large number of children \ndo celebrate by trick-or-treating in their neighborhoods and towns. I \nbelieve this reasonable proposal would make those Halloween activities \nsafer.\n  Upon conducting some research of my own, I discovered that Halloween \nis a time of increased danger for children. According to the Insurance \nInstitute for Highway Safety, fatal pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions \noccur most often between 6 and 9 p.m., comprising twenty-five percent \nof the total. Another twenty-one percent occur between 9 p.m. and \nmidnight, making nighttime the most dangerous time for pedestrians.\n  Unfortunately, these general accident trends are magnified on \nHalloween given the considerable increase in pedestrians--most of whom \nare children, on Halloween evening. A study by the Division of Injury \nPrevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control of the \nCenter for Disease Control, concluded that the incidence of pedestrian \ndeaths in children ages 5-14 is four times higher on Halloween than any \nother night of the year. In order to make this holiday safer for all \nour children, Congress should take the modest step of providing one \nextra week of daylight saving time.\n  Attempts have been made in the past to extend daylight saving time. \nMost recently, Senator Alan Simpson introduced the ``Daylight Saving \nExtension Act of 1994.'' Although Senator Simpson's legislation would \nhave changed both the starting date and the ending date of daylight \nsaving time, the legislation I am introducing today would simply extend \nit for a week.\n  The fact that the students of Mrs. Rasmussen's second grade class \ntook the time to write and request that I sponsor a bill to extend \ndaylight saving time is important to me. I believe that many of these \nchildren's parents would also be pleased with this extension of \ndaylight savings time. If children are concerned about their own safety \nand come up with a reasonable approach to make their world a little bit \nsafer, I believe that accommodating their request is not too much to \nask. Protecting the children of our country should be a primary concern \nfor all of us as lawmakers. If one life could be saved by extending \ndaylight saving time to encompass Halloween, it would be worthwhile. I \ntrust that all my colleagues will take the time to consider the \nimportance the ``Halloween Safety Act of 1999'' would have for children \nand their parents in their respective states.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1736. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \npermit certain youth to perform certain work with wood products; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  Fair Labor Standards Act Amendments\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation designed to permit certain youths (those exempt \nfrom attending school) between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in \nsawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. I \nintroduced an identical measure at the close of the 105th Congress and \nam hopeful that the Senate can once again consider this important \nissue. Similar legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague, \nRepresentative Joseph R. Pitts, has already passed in the House this \nyear.\n\n[[Page S12696]]\n\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased \nfunding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections \ncontained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, \nthat accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from \ncompulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is \nextremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be \nprovided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer \nemployment where they live.\n  The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish \ncommunity. Last year, I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster County, \nPennsylvania, and had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish \nconstituency. They explained that while the Amish once made their \nliving almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand \ninto other occupations as farmland disappears in many areas due to \npressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to \nrely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish \nculture expects youth upon the completion of their education at the age \nof 14 to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become \nproductive members of society. In many areas, work in sawmills is one \nof the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system \nlimits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are \ncurrently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they \nreach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and \nlifestyle of the Amish.\n  In the 105th Congress, the House passed by a voice vote H.R. 4257, \nintroduced by Representative Pitts, which was similar to the bill I am \nintroducing today. I am aware that concerns to H.R. 4257 existed: \nsafety issues had been raised by the Department of Labor and \nConstitutional issues had been raised by the Department of Justice. I \nhave addressed these concerns in my legislation.\n  Under my legislation youths would not be allowed to operate power \nmachinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as \nsweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires \nthat the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris \nand wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult \nsupervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to \ninsure that they are enforced.\n  The Department of Justice stated that H.R. 4257 raised serious \nconcerns under the Establishment Clause. The House measure conferred \nbenefits only to a youth who is a ``member of a religious sect or \ndivision thereof whose established teachings do not permit formal \neducation beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the ``benefit'' of \nworking in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain religions, the \nDepartment argues that the bill appears to impermissibly favor religion \nto ``irreligion.'' In drafting my legislation, I attempted to overcome \nsuch an objection by conferring permission to work in sawmills to all \nyouths who ``are exempted from compulsory education laws after the \neighth grade.'' Indeed, I think a broader focus is necessary to create \na sufficient range of vocational opportunities for all youth who are \nlegally out of school and in need of vocational opportunities.\n  I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in \nWisconsin v. Yoder supports my bill. Yoder held that Wisconsin's \ncompulsory school attendance law requiring children to attend school \nuntil the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise clause. The Court found \nthat the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on the free \nexercise of religion by the Amish since attending school beyond the \neighth grade ``contravenes the basic religious tenets and practices of \nthe Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be made with \nrespect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their population grows \nand their subsistence through an agricultural way of life decreases, \ntrades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to the \ncontinuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills \ndenies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-\nreliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish \ndo not need the final two years of public education.\n  I offer my legislation once again with the hope of opening a dialogue \non this important issue. This is a matter of great importance to the \nAmish community and I urge its timely consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1736\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXEMPTION.\n\n       Section 13(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 213(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in the administration \n     and enforcement of the child labor provisions of this Act, it \n     shall not be considered oppressive child labor for an \n     individual who--\n       ``(i) is under the age of 18 and over the age of 14, and\n       ``(ii) by statute or judicial order is exempt from \n     compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade,\n\n     to be employed inside or outside places of business where \n     machinery is used to process wood products.\n       ``(B) The employment of an individual under subparagraph \n     (a) shall be permitted--\n       ``(i) if the individual is supervised by an adult relative \n     of the individual or is supervised by an adult member of the \n     same religious sect or division as the individual;\n       ``(ii) if the individual does not operate or assist in the \n     operation of power-driven woodworking machines;\n       ``(iii) if the individual is protected from wood particles \n     or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier \n     appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or \n     flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from \n     machinery in operation; and\n       ``(iv) if the individual is required to use personal \n     protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels \n     of noise and saw dust.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Thomas):\n  S. 1738. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nmake it unlawful for a packer to own, feed, or control livestock \nintended for slaughter; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                        THE RANCHER ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr President, I rise before you today to \nintroduce legislation on behalf of Senators Bob Kerrey, Charles \nGrassley, Craig Thomas, and myself. The RANCHER Act (Rural America \nNeeds Competition to Help Every Rancher) is designed to reestablish a \nfree, fair, and competitive market for independent livestock producers.\n  South Dakota family farmers and ranchers indicate to me that one of \nthe most critical problems in agriculture today is the growing, \nunabated trend of agribusiness consolidation and concentration. Too \noften today, elected leaders overlook agricultural concentration with \nrhetoric and empty promises. But talk doesn't provide any assurance to \na cow-calf producer in South Dakota worried about what he or she will \nsell feeder calves for this fall. Talk doesn't minimize the worries of \na diversified farmer looking for competitive markets in which to sell \nhis or her grain. And talk surely doesn't assure any feeder of \nlivestock that he or she will have a fair opportunity to sell slaughter \nlivestock in this concentrated market.\n  This bipartisan legislation would strengthen and amend Section 202 of \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by prohibiting meatpackers from \nowning livestock prior to purchase for slaughter. It does provide \nexceptions for farmers and ranchers who own and process livestock in a \nproducer owned and controlled cooperative.\n  Mr. President, concern over meatpacker concentration is not new in \nthe United States. Cartoons in the 1880s negatively depicted companies \nthat pooled livestock together for sale as ``beef trusts'' engaging in \nmonopolistic pricing behavior. In 1917 President Woodrow Wilson \ndirected the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate meatpackers \nto determine if they were leveraging too much power over the \nmarketplace.\n  The FTC released a report in 1919 stating that the ``Big 5'' \nmeatpackers (Armour, Swift, Morris, Wilson, and Cudahy) dominated with \n``monopolistic\n\n[[Page S12697]]\n\ncontrol of the American meat industry''. The FTC also found these \nmeatpackers owned stockyards, rail car lines, cold storage plants, and \nother essential facilities for distributing food. This led to the \nPackers Consent Decree of 1920 which prohibited the Big 5 packers from \nengaging in retail sales of meat and forced them to divest of ownership \ninterests in stockyards and rail lines. Then, Congress enacted the \nPackers and Stockyards Act of 1921 that--among other things--prohibited \nmeatpackers from engaging in unfair, discriminatory, or deceptive \npricing practices.\n  Unfortunately, we have allowed some in the meatpacking industry to \nonce again dangerously choke free enterprise and market access. As in \nthe past, producers again look to their elected leaders to take action. \nThat is why I have introduced legislation in Congress to combat \nmeatpacker concentration in livestock markets. My legislation will \nprohibit meatpackers from owning livestock for slaughter.\n  Within the last few weeks, we've heard from pork conglomerates \nSmithfield Foods, Murphy Farms, and Tyson Foods regarding Smithfield's \nintention to own all the hogs currently held by both Murphy and Tyson. \nIf these deals are to go through, around 800,000 sows could be owned \nand controlled by Smithfield. Ask any pork producer, a breeding stock \nherd of this size could enable Smithfield to totally dominate the hog \nindustry.\n  In response, we could seek a Department of Justice investigation of \nthis deal, but it is clear to me that current anti-trust law may be \nsimply too weak to stop a marriage of this nature. Some may believe we \nneed trust busters with true grit in the Justice or Agriculture \nDepartments to keep these deals from happening, but my experience in \nCongress tells me if we wait for this type of action, we won't have an \nindependent farmer or rancher left--anywhere.\n  Mr. President, current anti-trust laws have failed to address \nconcerns of livestock producers in the marketplace. Moreover, growing \npacker concentration creates an imbalance in bargaining power between a \nfew meatpackers who buy livestock and several producers who sell \nlivestock. The relative lack of buyers means the buying side of the \nmarket has much more power than the selling side. Envision an \nhourglass: it is wide at both ends and very narrow in the middle. The \ntwo wide ends aptly represent agricultural producers and consumers. The \nnarrow middle of the hourglass is the number of processors and \nmeatpackers that buy livestock from farmers and ranchers and then sell \nfood to consumers. A decision on the part of one meatpacker may have a \nsubstantial effect on the marketplace. For instance, when Smithfield \nshut down the pork plant in Huron--formerly owned by American Foods \nGroup--pork producers in South Dakota were left with merely a single \nmarket for their slaughter hogs in the state. Alternatively, a decision \non the part of a livestock producer seller has little if any effect at \nall on price. What does this mean? It means the marketplace is not \ncompetitive.\n  Some so called experts'' in the industry claim that concentration \nleads to cheap prices for consumers. These experts believe \nconcentration is simply unstoppable, and better yet, they point to the \nvertically integrated poultry industry as a successful guide or model \nfor cattle and pork producers. They gloss over the real effects of \nconcentration by touting economies of scale and productive efficiency.\n  Apologists for the corporate conglomerates can criticize my efforts \nto keep meatpackers from owning livestock if they want, but given a \nchoice, I will side with a broad base of family farmers and ranchers \nover conglomerate agriculture any day. It boils down to whether we want \nindependent producers in agriculture, or if we will yield to \nconcentration and see farmers and ranchers become low wage employees on \ntheir own land.\n  Ultimately, if we continue to stand idle and watch control of the \nworld's food supply fall into the hands of the few, consumers will be \nthe real losers in terms of both retail cost and food safety.\n  So today, almost a century after President Teddy Roosevelt used a big \nstick to give livestock producers a square deal, we again face a choice \nbetween corporate takeover of agriculture and a fight for free \nenterprise. I proudly cast my lot with the free enterprise family farm \nand ranch agriculture that has served our country so well.\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join \nmy colleagues Senator Johnson, Senator Grassley and Senator Kerrey in \nintroducing the ``Rural America Needs Competition to Help Every Rancher \nAct of 1999'' (RANCHER).\n  Additional regulation of meat packing companies has become necessary \nbecause of a loophole my colleagues and I have long been concerned \nabout: the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 does not clearly and \ndefinitively address meat packers owning livestock for slaughter. This \nlegislation will prohibit meat packing companies from owning and \nfeeding livestock, with the exception of producer-owned cooperatives \ndefined by the majority of ownership interest in the cooperative being \nheld by co-cop members that own, feed, or control livestock and provide \nthose livestock to the co-op. An exemption for cooperatives is included \nas recognition and reward to those producers who have invested the \nresources necessary to enhance their market edge.\n  In placing a prohibition on meat packing companies, our efforts today \nwill be branded as anti-competitive and in support of ``big \ngovernment,'' versus the ``free market.'' However, our intentions are \nprecisely the opposite--we are introducing this legislation with goal \nof restoring competition to our livestock markets. In fact, this \nlegislation is long overdue. In recent years, livestock markets have \nbecome increasingly more concentrated, leaving individual producers \nwith fewer options for selling their products.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the four top \nmeat packing firms control roughly 80 percent of today's slaughter \nmarket, while less than 20 years ago, the top four firms controlled \nonly 36 percent of the market. Over the last year we have watched the \non-farm price of commodities plummet, while at the same time, retail \nprices have remained constant or even increased. The problem of price \ndisparity, I believe is in part, attributable to growing market \nconcentration. Since it is evident that market concentration exists, \nthis legislation is a first step in working to restore fair market \nprices to our producers.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation--it is an \nadmirable initiative that seeks to strengthen financial solvency for \nour family producers. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will \nrecognize the benefits this effort will generate for producers and \nrural communities across the United States and will join us in \nrestoring true market competition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1739. A bill to impose a moratorium on large agribusiness mergers \nand to establish a commission to review large agriculture mergers, \nconcentration, and market power; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    agribusiness merger moratorium and antitrust review act of 1999\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, over the past several years there \nhas been a wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions in this country \nthat is of historic proportions. Last year the dollar value of \nannounced corporate combinations in the United States was more than \n$1.6 trillion. This exceeded the amount of all the mergers in the world \nthe year before.\n  The big are getting bigger, the small are getting trampled, and this \nhas large implications for the kind of economy we are going to have \nand--more importantly--for the kind of nation we are going to be.\n  This is apparent in rural America, where the elephants have been \nstomping with a special gusto. Control of the nation's food chain--from \nproduction and processing to packing and distribution--has been falling \ninto fewer and fewer hands. Over a decade ago, the four biggest grain \nprocessing companies in the U.S. accounted for some 40 percent of the \nnation's flour milling. Today the figure is 62 percent. About three \nquarters of the wet corn milling and soybean crushing are controlled by\n\n[[Page S12698]]\n\nthe four biggest firms--and about 80 percent of the beef.\n  This extraordinary concentration of economic power has large \nimplications. It is draining the economic life out of rural America. In \n1952 farmers received close to half of every retail food dollar. Today \nthey get less than a quarter of that same dollar. From a pound loaf of \nwhite bread that costs 87 cents at the store, the wheat farmer gets \nless than 4 cents. Farmers are working harder than ever; but the reward \nfor their toil is going to the corporate conglomerates, which offer \nfarmers fewer options for marketing their products than at probably any \ntime in this century.\n  While these corporations are showing record profits, farmers are \nforced to sell commodities such as wheat and pork, at Depression era \nprices. Thousands of farmers have gone under, and thousands more are \nbarely hanging on. Farm auctions have become a grim feature of the \nrural landscape today, as has suicide. ``Everything is gone, wore out \nor shot, just like me,'' one Iowa farmer said in his suicide note.\n  When farmers go, our rural communities go. We lose the stable social \nstructures, the generations of family ties, the investment in schools \nand churches, libraries and clinics. Independent business people, from \nimplement dealers to insurance salesmen, go belly up. And what do we \nget for this human tragedy and social loss? The low prices on the farm \nhave not shown up in corresponding decreases at the supermarket. The \nprocessors and packers are getting the money instead.\n  That's not the only source of the hardship in rural America. But it's \na large one. The growing concentration of the nation's food chain into \nfewer corporate hands is something this Congress must address.\n  The Clinton Administration deserves credit for reviving antitrust \nenforcement from the dormancy of the previous administrations. But it \nis laboring under reduced budgets and a body of law that, as \ninterpreted by court decisions, may not be up to the task. When the two \ngiants of the grain trade, Continental Grain and Cargill, are permitted \nto merge, then one has to wonder if the hole in the screen has become \nso big that there's no screen left.\n  That's why I'm joining with Senator Wellstone in introducing \nlegislation to impose a moratorium on large corporate mergers in the \nagriculture sector. The legislation would also create an independent \ncommission to advise how to change the underlying antitrust laws and \nother federal laws and regulations to ensure a competitive agricultural \nmarketplace and to protect family farmers and other family-sized \nproducers.\n  A moratorium on large corporate agriculture mergers is needed to give \nCongress time to consider these important questions and craft a \nsuitable response. If we wait it could be too late. We won't be able to \nadvance the fortunes of family-based agriculture because there won't be \nmuch left.\n  Specifically, our bill imposes an 18-month moratorium on those large \ncorporate mergers in the agriculture industry that would generally be \nrequired to make a ``Hart-Scott-Rodino\" pre-merger filing with the \nDepartment of Justice. Such filings are triggered by a three-part test, \none of which is that either of the two firms proposed for merger or \nacquisition have $100 million or more in net annual sales or assets. \nThe Attorney General is granted authority to waive the application of \nthe moratorium in ``extraordinary circumstances'' such as a merging \nfirm's facing insolvency or similar financial distress.\n  The legislation also establishes a 12-member commission to study the \nnature and consequences of mergers and concentration in America's \nagricultural economy. The Commission members are appointed by the \nleaders in the Senate and House of Representatives after consultation \nwith the Chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate \nAgriculture Committees. After completing its study, the Commission will \nsubmit to the President and Congress a final report that includes its \nfindings on consolidation in agriculture and recommendations about how \nour antitrust laws and other federal regulations should be changed to \nprotect family-based agriculture, the communities they comprise, and \nthe food shoppers of the nation.\n  The family farmers of this nation are facing what could be the end \ngame. The distortions and abuses in the agriculture marketplace have \ncontributed to the loss of thousands of family farmers, and the grim \nforeboding that hangs over much of rural America.\n  This does not have to be. No harm will come from this moratorium. \nAgribusiness enterprises will continue to see record profits, if the \nmarket so permits. Farmers and food shoppers will not lose because the \nrecord is clear that concentration in the food sector does not benefit \nthem. Ironically, this merger mania means less freedom and less \nchoice--in a nation that is supposed to stand for them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this moratorium, and antitrust review \ncommission, and cast a vote for family-based agriculture and the health \nof rural America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1740. A bill to protect consumers when private companies offer \nservices or products that are provided free of charge by the Social \nSecurity Administration and the Department Of Health and Human \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                social security consumer protection act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation I \noriginally proposed during the 105th Congress, the Social Security \nConsumer Protection Act. Quite simply, this bill is designed to protect \nconstituents from what has been an all too common consumer scam.\n  I introduced a similar bill during the prior Congress after an \ninvestigation by my staff found that unsuspecting consumers--from new \nparents to newlyweds to senior citizens--were falling prey to con \nartists who charged them for services that are available free of charge \nfrom the Social Security Administration (SSA) or the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS). Many of these schemes involve the use \nof materials and names which purposely mislead consumers into believing \nthe scam artists are affiliated with the government.\n  Companies operating under official sounding names like Federal \nDocument Services, Federal Record Service Corporation, National Records \nService, and U.S. Document Services are mailing information to \nthousands of Americans, scaring them into remitting a free to receive \nbasic government services, such as a new Social Security number and \ncard for a newborn or changing names upon marriage or divorce.\n  One of my constituents, Deb Conlee of Fort Dodge, received one of \nthese mailings. It sounded very official. It began, ``Read Carefully: \nImportant Facts About your Social Security Card.'' The response \nenvelope is stamped ``SSA-7701'' giving the impression that it is \nconnected with the SSA. The solicitation goes on to say that she is \nrequired to provide SSA with any name change associated with her recent \nmarriage and get a new Social Security card. It then urges her to send \nthe company $14.75 to do this on her behalf. It includes the alarming \nstatement, ``We urge you to do this immediately to help avoid possible \nproblems where your Social Security benefits or joint income taxes \nmight be questioned.''\n  What the solicitation fails to mention, of course, is that these \nservices are provided at no charge by SSA.\n  After hearing Ms. Conlee's story, I contacted SSA and asked them to \ninvestigate these complaints. Then SSA Commissioner Shirley Chater \nresponded that the services provided by these companies, ``Are \ncompletely unnecessary. Not only do they fail to produce any savings of \ntime or effort for the customer, they also tend to delay issuance of \nthe new Social Security card.''\n  In its investigations, SSA received hundreds of complaints involving \nover 100 companies. The Postal Inspection Service has received hundreds \nof additional complaints. The Inspector General of SSA validated many \nof these complaints, including finding repeated cases of violations of \nFederal law. While it is already illegal for a company to imply any \ndirect connection with a Federal agency, it is not illegal to charge \nfor the very same services that are available at no cost to the \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S12699]]\n\n  The Social Security Consumer Protection Act addresses this issue in a \nfew important ways. First, the bill prohibits charging for services \nthat are provided for free by SSA and HHS unless the following \nstatement is prominently displayed on the first page of the \nsolicitation in bold type, 16-point font, ``Important Public \nDisclosure: The product or service described here and assistance to \nobtain the product or service is available free of charge from the \nSocial Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human \nServices. You may wish to check the government section of your local \nphone book for the phone number of your local Social Security \nAdministration or Department of Health and Human Services office for \nhelp in obtaining this service for no charge or you may choose to use \nour service for a fee.''\n  Should a consumer decide to use the services of one of these \ncompanies, they are protected from inappropriate use of their personal \ninformation. This bill prohibits the sale, transfer or use of personal \ninformation obtained on consumers through such a solicitation without \ntheir consent on a separate authorization form that clearly and plainly \nexplains how their personal information could be used.\n  I am joined in introducing this important consumer legislation by \nSenators Bryan, Kerrey, and Dodd.\n  I am also pleased that the Social Security Consumer Protection Act \nenjoys the support of such consumer organizations as the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the Consumer \nFederation of America.\n  Mr. President, these scams must come to an end. Consumers deserve \nfull disclosure. This legislation will go a long way toward ensuring \nconsumers understand their rights when it comes to obtaining services \nfrom their government. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Social Security Consumer \nProtection Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 60\n\n       Whereas the Iowa Class Battleship, the U.S.S. Wisconsin \n     (BB-64), is an honored warship in United States naval \n     history, with 6 battle stars and 5 citations and medals \n     during her 55 years of service;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Wisconsin was launched on December 7, \n     1943, by the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard; sponsored by Mrs. \n     Walter S. Goodland, wife of then-Governor Goodland of \n     Wisconsin; and commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on \n     April 16, 1944, with Captain Earl E. Stone in command;\n       Whereas her first action for Admiral William ``Bull'' \n     Halsey's Third Fleet was a strike by her task force against \n     the Japanese facilities in Manila, thereby supporting the \n     amphibious assault on the Island of Mindoro, which was a \n     vital maneuver in the defeat of the Japanese forces in the \n     Philippines;\n       Whereas the U.S.S.

Wisconsin supplied crucial firepower for \n     the invasion of Okinawa;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Wisconsin served as a flagship for the \n     Seventh Fleet during the Korean conflict;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Wisconsin provided consistent naval \n     gunfire support during the Korean conflict to the First \n     Marine Division, the First Republic of Korea Corps, and \n     United Nations forces;\n       Whereas the U.S.S.

Wisconsin, decommissioned on September \n     30, 1991, is berthed at Portsmouth, Virginia; and may soon be \n     berthed at Nauticus, the National Maritime Museum in Norfolk, \n     Virginia, where she would serve as a floating monument and an \n     educational museum: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service in honor of the U.S.S. Wisconsin \n     and all those who served aboard her; and\n       (2) the Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a postage stamp be \n     issued.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I have the distinct honor of \nsubmitting a resolution that commemorates one of the great vessels in \nour naval history and her crew members. I am joined by the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  Mr. President, the U.S.S. Wisconsin is one of four Iowa-class \nbattleships, the largest battleships ever built by the Navy. The four \nvessels, the Wisconsin, the Iowa, the New Jersey and the Missouri, \nserved gallantly in every significant United States conflict from World \nWar II to the Persian Gulf war.\n  At 887 feet, the Wisconsin carries a 108-foot, three-inch beam with a \ndisplacement of 45,000 tons. Her armor includes 9 sixteen-inch guns, 20 \nfive-inch guns, 80 40-millimeter guns, and 49 20-millimeter guns. The \n16-inch guns can lob shells roughly the weight of a VW Beetle to \ndistances of up to 24 miles. The recoil of these might guns was so \ngreat that the deck had to be built of teak wood because steel plating \nwould buckle from the stress. She was designed for a crew of 1,921 \nsailors, but she carried as many as 2,700 sailors during World War II \nand the Korean war.\n  Mr. President, the U.S.S. Wisconsin was built in Philadelphia and \ncommissioned on 7 December 1943, exactly 2 years after the attack on \nPearl Harbor. From the moment President Roosevelt selected the name of \nthe vessel, Wisconsin citizens took an immediate interest. School \nchildren volunteered to christen the battleship. Some folks even \nrecommended christening the Wisconsin with water from the Wisconsin \nRiver, instead of champagne.\n  In the summer of 1944, she underwent sea trials and training in the \nChesapeake Bay. On 7 July, the Wisconsin departed from Norfolk, VA, on \nher way to war with the legendary Adm. William F. ``Bull'' Halsey and \nhis 3rd Fleet. As U.S. Marines and infantry began their island-hopping \nstrategy toward the home islands of Japan, Wisconsin sent her shells \nhurling with deadly accuracy into the Philippines. And coincidentally \nenough, the Wisconsin's first commander, Captain Earl E. Stone, was \nborn in Milwaukee and attended the city's public schools and the State \nuniversity before his appointment to the Naval Academy.\n  The Wisconsin then joined the 5th Fleet under another legendary \ncommander, Adm. Raymond Spruance, and helped silence Japanese \nresistance on\n\n[[Page S12701]]\n\nIwo Jima and Okinawa, and then joined in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Soon \nthereafter, the U.S.S. Wisconsin became part of Fast Carrier Task Force \n38. She joined in attacks in the Philippine Islands, Saigon, Camranh \nBay, Hong Kong, Canton, Hainan, and the Japanese home islands.\n\n  After the Japanese surrender, the Wisconsin headed home with five \nbattle stars to her credit. One amazing fact about her World War II \nservice is that the Wisconsin didn't lose one crewman or get hit.\n  She spent the summer at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard where she \nunderwent an extensive overhaul. Following a 2-year stint as a training \nship, she returned to Norfolk and joined the Atlantic Fleet Reserve \nFleet for inactivation.\n  By July 1, 1948, she was taken out of commission and mothballed. \nHowever, the Korean war reawakened the Wisconsin and her sister \nbattleships. She departed Norfolk on October 25, 1951, bound for the \nPacific where she became the flagship of the 7th Fleet. When the Korean \nwar broke out, future Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, Jr., served as the Wisconsin's \nnavigator and extolled her ``versatility, maneuverability, strength, \nand power.'' During the conflict, she covered troop landings; fired \nupon enemy troops, trains, trucks, and bridges all along the Korean \ncoastline; and attacked important North Korean ports in Hungnam, \nWonsan, and Songjin. In April 1952, she steamed toward Norfolk with \nanother battle star.\n  Upon arriving in Norfolk, Wisconsin received her second overhaul at \nthe Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Following a number of peacetime and \ndiplomatic voyages showing the flag, she returned to Norfolk on June \n11, 1954 for a brief overhaul before taking her role as a training \nship.\n  On May 6, 1954, she was cruising off the Virginia Capes in heavy fog \nwhen she collided with the destroyer U.S.S. Eaton. Wisconsin returned \nto Norfolk with extensive bow damage, and a week later found herself \nback in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Shipyard workers fitted a 120-ton, \n68-foot bow section from the unfinished Iowa-class battleship Kentucky. \nWorking round-the-clock, Wisconsin's ship's force and shipyard \npersonnel completed the operation in just 16 days.\n  On June 28, 1956, the ship was ready for sea. Wisconsin steamed from \nNorfolk five more times before heading for Philadelphia and \ndeactivation in 1958. She remained on inactive status until 1986, when \nshe was towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In \n1988, the U.S.S. Wisconsin was re-commissioned for a third time.\n  In 1991, she led the Navy's surface attack on Iraq during the Gulf \nwar with the first-ever use of cruise missiles in battle.\n  Now, Mr. President, she is decommissioned and will soon be berthed at \nNauticus, the National Maritime Museum in Norfolk, VA, where she will \nserve as a floating monument and an educational museum. I wish she had \nfound her final port in the great State of Wisconsin, but getting her \nthere simply isn't possible--she's just too big.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will help me and the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin honor this great ship with a commemorative \nstamp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12701-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 204--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING NOVEMBER 21, \n1999, AND THE WEEK BEGINNING ON NOVEMBER 19, 2000, AS ``NATIONAL FAMILY \n                     WEEK'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Grams, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, \nMr. Helms, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nSmith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to submit a resolution \ndesignating the week beginning on November 21, 1999, and the week \nbeginning on November 19, 2000, as ``National Family Week.'' Such a \nresolution has been passed in every Congress since 1976, and I am proud \nto support this tradition of honoring America's families.\n  The family is the backbone of our free nation and vital to the \nprosperity of the United States. We have all seen and, hopefully, have \nfelt the tremendous impact a supportive family makes in the life of an \nindividual. A strong family nurtures and teaches children the values \nthey need to be successful in this world: hard work, honesty, loyalty \nand respect for others.\n  National Family Week is the week that includes Thanksgiving in both \n1999 and 2000. This is a very fitting time to celebrate the institution \nthat brings us together with those we love.\n  This resolution will officially recognize the great significance of \nthe family in our society and encourages states and communities to \nemphasize the importance of the family with appropriate activities, \ncelebrations, and ceremonies.\n  I hope my distinguished colleagues will join me in support of this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12701-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12701-S12714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                DASCHLE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2298\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Kerry) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 1593) to amend the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     1.

(a) In General.--There is hereby transferred from \n     the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and \n     Management Assistance Authority (hereinafter referred to as \n     the ``Authority'') to the District of Columbia the sum of \n     $5,000,000 for the Mayor, in consultation with the Council of \n     the District of Columbia, to provide offsets against local \n     taxes for a commercial revitalization program, such \n     program to be available in enterprise zones and low and \n     moderate income areas in the District of Columbia: \n     Provided, That in carrying out such a program, the Mayor \n     shall use Federal commercial revitalization proposals \n     introduced in Congress as a guideline.\n       (b) Source of Funds.--The amount transferred under \n     subsection (a) shall be derived from interest earned on \n     accounts held by the Authority on behalf of the District of \n     Columbia.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Mayor shall report to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives on the progress made in carrying out the \n     commercial revitalization program.\n       Sec. 169. Section 456 of the District of Columbia Home Rule \n     Act (Section 47-231 et seq. of the D.C. Code, as added by the \n     Federal Payment Reauthorization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-\n     373)) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``District of \n     Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance \n     Authority'' and inserting ``Mayor''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``Authority'' and \n     inserting ``Mayor''.\n       Sec. 170. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The District of Columbia has recently witnessed a spate \n     of senseless killings of innocent citizens caught in the \n     crossfire of shootings. A Justice Department crime \n     victimization survey found that while the city saw a decline \n     in the homicide rate between 1996 and 1997, the rate was the \n     highest among a dozen cities and more than double the second \n     highest city.\n       (2) The District of Columbia has not made adequate funding \n     available to fight drug abuse in recent years, and the city \n     has not deployed its resources as effectively as possible. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $20,900,000 was spent on publicly funded \n     drug treatment in the District compared to $29,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1993. The District's Addiction and Prevention and \n     Recovery Agency currently has only 2,200 treatment slots, a \n     50 percent drop from 1994, with more than 1,100 people on \n     waiting lists.\n       (3) The District of Columbia has seen a rash of inmate \n     escapes from halfway houses. According to Department of \n     Corrections records, between October 21, 1998 and January 19, \n     1999, 376 of the 1,125 inmates assigned to halfway houses \n     walked away. Nearly 280 of the 376 escapees were awaiting \n     trial including 2 charged with murder.\n       (4) The District of Columbia public schools system faces \n     serious challenges in correcting chronic problems, \n     particularly long-standing deficiencies in providing special \n     education services to the 1 in 10 District students needing \n     program benefits, including backlogged assessments, and \n     repeated failure to meet a compliance agreement on special \n     education reached with the Department of Education.\n       (5) Deficiencies in the delivery of basic public services \n     from cleaning streets to waiting time at Department of Motor \n     Vehicles to a rat population estimated earlier this year to \n     exceed the human population have generated considerable \n     public frustration.\n       (6) Last year, the District of Columbia forfeited millions \n     of dollars in Federal grants after Federal auditors \n     determined that several agencies exceeded grant restrictions \n     and in other instances, failed to spend funds before the \n     grants expired.\n\n[[Page S12723]]\n\n       (7) Findings of a 1999 report by the Annie E. Casey \n     Foundation that measured the well-being of children reflected \n     that, with 1 exception, the District ranked worst in the \n     United States in every category from infant mortality to the \n     rate of teenage births to statistics chronicling child \n     poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year \n     2001 budget, the Congress will take into consideration \n     progress or lack of progress in addressing the following \n     issues:\n       (1) Crime, including the homicide rate, implementation of \n     community policing, the number of police officers on local \n     beats, and the closing down of open-air drug markets.\n       (2) Access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of \n     treatment slots, the number of people served, the number of \n     people on waiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment \n     programs.\n       (3) Management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, \n     including the number of halfway house escapes and steps taken \n     to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house \n     residents to reduce the number of escapes.\n       (4) Education, including access to special education \n     services and student achievement.\n       (5) Improvement in basic city services, including rat \n     control and abatement.\n       (6) Application for and management of Federal grants.\n       Indicators of child well-being.\n       Sec. 171. The Mayor, prior to using Federal Medicaid \n     payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals to serve a small \n     number of childless adults, should consider the \n     recommendations of the Health Care Development Commission \n     that has been appointed by the Council of the District of \n     Columbia to review this program, and consult and report to \n     Congress on the use of these funds.\n       Sec. 172. GAO Study of District of Columbia Criminal \n     Justice System. Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall--\n       (1) conduct a study of the law enforcement, court, prison, \n     probation, parole, and other components of the criminal \n     justice system of the District of Columbia, in order to \n     identify the components most in need of additional resources, \n     including financial, personnel, and management resources; and\n       (2) submit to Congress a report on the results of the study \n     under paragraph (1).\n       Sec. 173. Nothing in this Act bars the District of Columbia \n     Corporation Counsel from reviewing or commenting on briefs in \n     private lawsuits, or from consulting with officials of the \n     District government regarding such lawsuits.\n       Sec. 174. Wireless Communications. (a) In General.--Not \n     later than 7 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of \n     the National Park Service, shall--\n       (1) implement the notice of decision approved by the \n     National Capital Regional Director, dated April 7, 1999, \n     including the provisions of the notice of decision concerning \n     the issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates; and\n       (2) expend such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Antenna Applications.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the receipt \n     of an application, a Federal agency that receives an \n     application submitted after the enactment of this Act to \n     locate a wireless communications antenna on Federal property \n     in the District of Columbia or surrounding area over which \n     the Federal agency exercises control shall take final action \n     on the application, including action on the issuance of \n     right-of-way permits at market rates.\n       (2) Existing law.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect the applicability of existing laws \n     regarding:\n       (A) judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5, United \n     States Code [the Administrative Procedure Act], and the \n     Communications Act of 1934,\n       (B) the National Environmental Policy Act, the National \n     Historic Preservation Act and other applicable federal \n     statutes, and\n       (C) the authority of a State or local government or \n     instrumentality thereof, including the District of Columbia, \n     in the placement, construction, and modification of personal \n     wireless service facilities.\n       This title may be cited as the ``District of Columbia \n     Appropriations Act, 2000''.\n\n                        TITLE II--TAX REDUCTION\n\n     SEC. 201. COMMENDING REDUCTION OF TAXES BY DISTRICT OF \n                   COLUMBIA.\n\n       Congress commends the District of Columbia for its action \n     to reduce taxes, and ratifies D.C.

Mr. President, today I would like to salute five \noutstanding young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold \nAwards by the Abnaki Girl Scout Council in Brewer, ME. The are Jodie \nComer, Kaitlin Coffin, Jessie Mellott, Sara Agouab, and Michelle \nMcLaughlin. These young women will receive their award at a ceremony \nthis Sunday, October 17.\n  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest achievement award in U.S. \nGirl Scouting and it symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the \nareas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal \ndevelopment.\n\n[[Page S12724]]\n\n  In having this honor bestowed upon them, Jodie, Kaitlin, Jessie, \nSara, and Michelle have shown that they are dedicated and committed to \nthese qualities, and, just as important, that they enjoy what they are \ndoing. For their parents, family and friends, this is a proud moment--\nand, as a Mainer, I share this feeling.\n  To reach this goal a Girl Scout must earn four interest project \npatches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership \nAward, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and \nimplement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these \nrequirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out \nthrough close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout \nvolunteer. All of the girls throughout the United States who have \nearned this award have fulfilled a personal goal which will benefit \nthem in the years to come.\n  For their project, Jodie Comer, Michelle McLaughlin, and Sara Agouab \nresearched, designed, and produced a booklet on auto care and \nmaintenance for women. In addition, they put on an auto care workshop \nfor cadette and senior Girl Scouts. Kaitlin Coffin and Jessie Mellott \nproduced a video to help recruit and retain younger girls in Girl \nScouting.\n  I have always been, and will continue to be, supportive of the Girl \nScouts and recognize the important values that it instills in young \npeople, such as service, honesty and leadership. By helping to form the \ncharacter of young women, the Girl Scouts makes a lasting contribution \non the lives of people throughout Maine and the United States.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues join me in offering my \ncongratulations to these young women for what they have accomplished. \nThis prestigious award is a testament to their convictions and \nindividual commitment to serve those in their community for the \nbetterment of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12724-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TEENAGE TRAGEDY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the city of Detroit is grieving over \nthe loss of Cody High School sophomore Darryl Towns, who was fatally \nshot just days before his sixteenth birthday. Darryl was murdered in \nhis own backyard over a minor dispute that eventually turned into a \nmajor tragedy. What started off as a fist fight between life long \nfriends ended up in murder: three fatal shots with a semiautomatic \npistol.\n  Now, Darryl's community is left in shock as they grieve over the \n``foolish'' and ``senseless'' death of their friend, known among many \nas a ``respectful,'' ``responsible'' young man. Friends and parents are \nforced to ask the troubling question: If a person like Darryl, who \nstayed out of trouble, isn't safe from gun violence, who among our \nteens is safe? Unfortunately, there is no one who can answer that \nquestion or predict the future. Yet, common sense tells us that the \nwidespread proliferation of guns will only result in additional \ntragedies like Darryl's.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up a meaningful debate on gun safety and \nend the easy access to weapons that results in the destruction of so \nmany young lives. I submit for the Record a letter printed in the \nDetroit Free Press, written to Darryl's mother, Annette Towns, \nexpressing sympathy over such a difficult loss.\n  The letter follows.\n\n             [From the Detroit Free Press, Sept. 15, 1999]\n\n                  Mothers: Teach Sons About Love, Guns\n\n                           (By Kim Kingston)\n\n       Darryl Towns, 15, died senselessly and tragically on Sept. \n     9 (``Slaying questioned: One teen in custody is a childhood \n     friend,'' Sept. 11). Many of us knew of him only as ``the \n     baby.'' Most of us knew him through the stories from a \n     mother's heart--of trials and tribulations, and the joys and \n     challenges of trying to raise a son up right.\n       Some of us knew only his voice, as it changed over the \n     years from that of a soft-spoken boy to that of a man, \n     calling his mom every evening at work, just to check in. His \n     mama was always saying with a glitter of pride in her eye: \n     ``He's such a good and responsible boy.'' Fifteen years of \n     love and dedication were ripped away in an instant by a \n     senseless act, so very irreversible.\n       For every mother of every son, teach your sons the \n     magnitude of a mother's love, and how guns lead to the \n     destruction of so many lives--but none so insurmountable as \n     that of a mother's anguish at the loss of her son.\n       Guns have no place in untrained hands--your hand or my \n     hands--let alone in the emotionally charged squabbles of \n     teenaged boys. The only ones powerful enough to stop it are \n     the young men themselves--young men like Darryl, who stood \n     apart from some of his peers. He didn't carry a gun. He tried \n     to do what was right.\n       If his death could change the heart of just one boy, then \n     he would not have died in vain.\n       To Annette, his Mother: We, your friends at work, want to \n     thank you for sharing a part of your dear son with us through \n     your eyes.\n       To Darryl, forever ``Mama's Baby'': We dedicate you to a \n     better, safer place in the loving arms of your \n     Creator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12724-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12724-S12726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. JUNIOR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, each week, each of us meets with \ndozens, even hundreds, of constituents from our home States. For some \nStates, thousands of constituents will travel to Washington to advocate \npositions on issues of concern. Being a Senator representing a sparsely \npopulated States means meeting with everyone of those constituents who \nvisits the Capitol. It is always good to see the folks from home.\n  Two weeks ago was old home week for me. It was a special time for me \nto reminisce about my service in the Jaycees. The Jaycees--now called \nthe United States Junior Chamber of Commerce--State presidents held a \nmeeting in the Nations' Capitol to talk about their organization's \npriorities. Debra Jennings, State president of the Wyoming Junior \nChamber of Commerce, and Larry Wostenberg, the sole candidate for next \nyears's State president of the Wyoming Junior Chamber of Commerce, were \nin town and I was fortunate to meet with them.\n  I'm a former Wyoming State Jaycee president. I served in 1973-74. \nThat year and the activities that led to that year played a big role in \nforming my leadership skills. I took leadership classes, then I taught \nleadership classes.\n  As president, I emphasized that the Jaycees was not a service \norganization. The Jaycees were and are a leadership organization. The \npurpose has been and is to teach young people leadership skills. \nMembers participate in the complete service projects to learn \nleadership skills.\n  My first project was a Christmas shopping tour. We raised money in \norder to take kids recommended by welfare shopping to buy presents for \nthe other members of their families. We picked them up at their home. \nWe took them shopping, took them to a restaurant where they wrapped the \npackages and had a little celebration, and then delivered them home. We \nalso spent the year gathering toys, repairing them, and purchasing \nadditional toys that were given to the kids we took on the shopping \ntour. Through activities such as the shopping tour, I developed \nleadership skills that helped me move up in the ranks within the \nWyoming Jaycees--first as a committee chairman, then the local \npresident, and State chaplain.\n  At one point in my experience, we noticed that many young businessmen \nwere devoting so much time to the Jaycees that it was breaking up their \nfamilies. I was part of a project for having one night a week devoted \nto families and family discussion. The name of that program, which \nbecame a national program, was ``Family Life.'' I spent a year \ntraveling to chapters and State meetings extolling the virtues of \nstrong families. It is my understanding that 25 years later the program \nis still intact and still being conducted.\n  Another favorite program of that time was one called ``Do \nSomething.'' It could just as easily have been labeled ``Do Anything.'' \nChapters across the Nation were encouraged to survey their community, \nfigure out what needed to be done and do it. They were encouraged not \nto do formal surveys. They were encouraged to have each Jaycee ask his \nneighbors and the people in his community what they thought the \ncommunity needed, then to do it. The emphasis was on talking to each \nother, then taking action, and it worked. Never underestimate the \nability of young people to achieve. Remember they haven't had enough \nexperience to know yet what can't be done. As a result they find that \nanything can be done and they do it. Most of them haven't been taught \nyet that only government can get things done. So, they learn first hand \nthat only individuals working together get things done.\n  Jaycees gave me my start in politics in a strange way. I was a \nbusinessman\n\n[[Page S12725]]\n\noperating a retail shoe store who was too busy to worry about politics. \nI had never anticipated going into politics. At the State Jaycee \nconvention as I was finishing my year as State president, Senator Alan \nSimpson was our guest speaker. At that time he was a State \nRepresentative and majority floor leader. I gave my speech on Jaycee \nleadership training. He gave his customarily humorous speech. After the \ndinner he took me by the elbow, led me off to the side and said, ``On \nthis leadership thing, it's time you put your money where your mouth \nis. You need to get into politics. You ought to run for mayor of \nGillette.'' Gillette, the community where I was from, was just \nbeginning a boom. I was only 29. Not a good age to run for office in \nWyoming. In addition, I had only lived in Gillette for 5 years. Nowhere \nnear being a Gillette native. I wanted to see more city planning. Not \nan exciting or good issue to run on in the West. But the young people \nmoving to Gillette in droves saw the need for an organizing force with \nnew ideas, and I was elected. You could call that a ``Do Something'' \nproject. I took a quick informal survey of what needed to be done \nfollowed by enlisting the help of everyone.\n\n  The United States Jaycees puts out an officer and directors guide. \nIt's a manual for chapter management and leadership training. I've had \na copy of that Officer and Directors Guide and a copy of the ``Do \nSomething'' manual on my desk since 1975. I've found that you can run a \ncity with them, that you can solve State problems with them, and that \nyou can organize a United States Senate office and do legislation based \non them.\n  Last week the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce--Jaycees--were in town \nlearning leadership. They were learning about projects that will teach \nleadership and they were learning about laws that will affect their \nfuture and the future of this country. They have programs for getting \nyoung people into business. They have a national business network to \nhelp them when they are in business. They have a gun safety education \nprogram available to all youth. They have a program for teaching \ninvesting. And they get into some social issues, called ``Touch one \nchild and you touch the world'' that helps provide care for infants \naffected by HIV/AIDS. They have a program called, ``Wake up. Live Big. \nBe Smoke Free.'' It's the Jaycees against youth smoking.\n  The Jaycees are about people to people dialogue and communication. \nNeighbor to neighbor. Delivering a message by those who are trusted. \nYes, these young people will make a difference. They have a message for \nus on Social Security. They've been holding townhall meetings across \nthe country and have been surveying the Nation. They've been searching \nfor solutions to our Social Security dilemma. Mr. President, I ask to \nhave printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, a \nresolution that started them on this quest on March 16, 1996. It was \nrevised and reauthorized September 23 of this year.\n  I also have an opinion editorial by the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare written by Mike Marshall who is \nthe past president of the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce, \nentitled, ``Jaycees want Social Security Saved.'' I also ask that that \ndocument be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  My fellow Senators, we've heard from the people on retirement. We've \nheard from the people almost ready to retire. We've heard from the baby \nboomers. Now we are hearing from the people at the beginning end of the \nspectrum of working for Social Security. These people will be paying \ninto the system for 30 to 45 years and they want to be sure they get \nsomething back too.\n  Perhaps the serious condition of the Social Security system as an \ninvestment program can best be understood through an example. Let's \nsuppose that only 2 percent of the present 15 percent is contributed \nfrom every paycheck to Social Security. If invested in the private \nmarkets, this 2 percent would produce the same result at retirement as \nthe entire 15 percent gives them now. That's not much of a future for \nthe current Social Security program. It would cause a revolution as \nthese young people move into decisionmaking situations. If we listen to \nthem now, if we work with them now, if we make changes in the system \nnow, Social Security as we know it can be saved and extended for the \nbenefit of our Nation's young people for years to come. If we wait very \nlong, we will see pain. Please resolve with me now to join the United \nStates Junior Chamber of Commerce in their quest to ensure the future \neconomic solvency of the Social Security system for present generations \nand those to come.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The documents follow:\n\n  Call for Legislation To Ensure the Future Economic Solvency of the \n                         Social Security System\n\n             (Revised and Reauthorized September 23, 1999)\n\n       Whereas, the membership of The United States Junior Chamber \n     of Commerce as well as most Americans are concerned about the \n     economic future of Social Security System.\n       Whereas, payroll deductions will have to be dramatically \n     increased or benefits significantly decreased unless Social \n     Security is reformed; and\n       Whereas, we need to meet our Social Security promises to \n     existing and future retirees; and\n       Whereas, the number of retirees will almost double by the \n     year 2030; or\n       Whereas, The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce has \n     conducted surveys at seventy-five Social Security Town Hall \n     Meetings in forty different states; and\n       Whereas, The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce has \n     testified before congress to address these concerns; and\n       Whereas, as a result of The United States Junior Chamber of \n     Commerce's Social Security Town Hall Report, an overwhelming \n     majority approved the establishment of individual retirement \n     accounts; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Congress has introduced legislation for \n     the establishment and maintenance of individual retirement \n     accounts; and\n       Whereas, The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce has \n     invested considerable time and resources in the solvency of \n     the Social Security System; and\n       Whereas, The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce sees \n     the need to get the average young American involved in the \n     interest of their government; and\n       Whereas, The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce \n     should actively promote getting out the vote to secure these \n     aims: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce \n     Executive Board of Directors:\n       recognizes that Social Security is in need of immediate \n     revision;\n       recognizes that the future of Social Security is a vital \n     concern for young people and future generations in the United \n     States;\n       recognizes the need for capitalization of the social \n     security system;\n       recognizes the need for personal retirement accounts;\n       recognizes that a percentage of budget surpluses should go \n     towards the solvency of Social Security;\n       recognizes a need for a national ``Get Out the Vote'' \n     campaign;\n       gives authority to the USJCC staff to pursue a course to \n     reform Social Security in local Junior Chamber communities \n     and at the national level and organize a ``Get Out the Vote'' \n     campaign.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Jaycees Want Social Security Saved\n\n                           (By Mike Marshall)\n\n       Within the last year, Republicans and Democrats have \n     expressed the necessity to take legislative action to \n     strengthen Social Security. President Clinton, during his \n     1998 State of the Union address, announced plans for a series \n     of public forums to be held across the country. He plans to \n     hold a conference on Social Security in Washington, D.C., \n     this December and then ask Congress to pass reforms in 1999. \n     Senator Bob Kerrey, Nebraska Democrat, is urging President \n     Clinton and congressional Republicans to begin ``eating our \n     national spinach'' and reform government entitlements. \n     Politicians are listening to their constituents and are \n     coming to the conclusion that Americans want Social Security \n     to be saved.\n       Members of The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce \n     (Jaycees) completed a series of Social Security town hall \n     meetings across America in 1997. They made some remarkable \n     findings. Americans attending these town hall meetings \n     indicated they want the Social Security system in this \n     country reformed. With more than 1,400 town hall participants \n     surveyed, 79 percent believe that the Social Security program \n     will need radical or major changes to survive.\n       The Jaycee surveys also indicate that 76 percent of the \n     town hall participants believe that they should be allowed to \n     place their Social Security contributions into a personal \n     retirement account. This coincides with a survey recently \n     released by the Democratic Leadership Council which indicated \n     that 75 percent of registered voters--regardless of political \n     party--said they strongly or somewhat support letting workers \n     take a third of the Social Security payroll taxes they now \n     pay and invest them into private retirement accounts.\n       The Junior Chamber of Commerce believes any changes to \n     Social Security should be\n\n[[Page S12726]]\n\n     judged on whether the current hallmarks are maintained and \n     remain dependable, universal, and available to the disabled \n     as well as all elderly. In addition, we recognize the need \n     for capitalization of the Social Security system. Americans \n     need to have ownership in the system and politicians must \n     have reduced access to the money they are taxing for our \n     retirement savings. Some type of Personal Savings Retirement \n     Accounts combined with the current system appear to be the \n     best solution.\n       Some organizations would have you believe that Social \n     Security can be saved with just a few adjustments. For 60 \n     years, with little notice or fanfare, the government has been \n     making adjustments to the system. If it was as simple as a \n     slight adjustment, we would not have elected officials \n     risking their political lives by addressing the need for \n     dramatic, system-saving changes.\n       Now is the time honest debate and real reform. We are \n     asking Congress and the President to leave a legacy of \n     leadership behind them for this country. They must act to \n     save the Social Security system for the elderly, the \n     disabled, and current and future retirees. All Americans must \n     take an active role on this issue, listen to all aides of the \n     debate, and then call their elected officials and urge them \n     to take action.\n       The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce is a \n     volunteer, non-partisan, community service organization \n     comprised of more than 100,000 men and women ages 21 to 39. \n     1-800-JAYCEES.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12726-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORT OUR TEACHING HOSPITALS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for this country's teaching hospitals.\n  These institutions provide the critical experiences of internship and \nresidency by which raw medical school graduates, who have learned the \nscience of medicine, are converted into seasoned physicians who have \nlearned the art and practice of medicine. We are all going to face \nillness at one time or another in our lives, and we want to make sure \nthat there will be well-educated, conscientious, and compassionate \nphysicians to care for us during those periods. The critical role of \nthe teaching hospitals in molding the doctors of the future cannot be \noverestimated.\n  These teaching hospitals also serve as key participants in the \nmedical research advances from which we all benefit enormously. We tend \nto forget that medicine is a relatively young science. Antibiotics, \nwhich we all take for granted, have been in use for only about 50 \nyears. Heart bypass surgery and kidney transplants, procedures so \ncommonplace that we hardly give them a second thought, were virtually \nunheard of 40 years ago. These and other medical advances have led to a \ntremendous increase in life expectancy in this country over the past \n100 years. Yet all of these innovations would have been virtually \nimpossible without the ongoing participation of teaching hospitals in \nprograms of medical research and development.\n  Finally, these teaching hospitals provide a tremendous service to our \ncommunities. For many of the most vulnerable among us, the teaching \nhospitals represent their major, and often only, source of medical \ncare. The homeless, the indigent, the elderly, the new arrivals to our \ncountry: for many in these groups, there would be no medical care at \nall if not for the care provided by the teaching hospitals, such as \nChristiana Care in my home state of Delaware.\n  So we should all agree that teaching hospitals are an absolutely \nessential resource for our society; we don't want to go back to 19th \ncentury medicine, we want to move ahead to 21st century medicine.\n  But there is a problem: the teaching hospitals' financial \nunderpinning has become very precarious, and a number of the most \nreknowned teaching hospitals in this country are now losing money each \nyear. We have come somewhat late to the unsurprising realization that \nthe time and resources which the teaching hospitals devote to the \neducation of future physicians, the research we need for better and \nhealthier lives, and the care of the indigent and working poor, costs a \nlot of money.\n  These costs are going up every year for our teaching hospitals: new \ntechnology costs money, dedicated employees must be paid a living wage, \nand so forth. But the income of teaching hospitals is not coming close \nto matching these cost increases. Health insurance companies are \nreducing their payments to health care providers, including teaching \nhospitals. Teaching hospitals, with their obligatory high costs, are \nnot able to compete financially for contracts to take care of HMO \npatients. A significant percentage of teaching hospital costs has been \npaid in the past by Medicare, but as Medicare finds itself facing \nfuture insolvency, its payment to teaching hospitals for training \ninterns and residents has also declined. We in Congress contributed to \nthe decline in teaching hospitals' income with several provisions in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, particularly the reductions in \npayments for indirect medical education and disproportionate share \nhospitals.\n  Everybody who gets health care in this country benefits from the work \nof teaching hospitals, but in the face of the financial straits that \nhave overwhelmed our health care system, nobody wants to pay for them.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely essential that this country's \nteaching hospitals remain vital and viable. Medicare may no longer be \nin a position to continue paying a disproportionately large share of \nteaching hospital expenses. In the long run, we must carefully \nreevaluate the funding mechanism for teaching hospitals to ensure their \nstability; if we all benefit from them, then perhaps we should all pay \npart of their costs.\n  These long-term changes are important, but we in the Senate must also \nbe concerned about the here and now. Teaching hospitals that are \ncurrently losing money may not be able to wait for the ``long run''; \nthey need help in the next few months. Senator Daschle has just \nintroduced the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act, which contains \nprovisions that would benefit the teaching hospitals and their \npatients, and I understand that the Senate Finance Committee is \ncurrently working on proposals to address some unintended consequences \nof the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, including those that have impacted \non teaching hospitals.\n  But time is of the essence, and the key word is urgency. Next year \nmay be too late. The Senate is working furiously to pass the necessary \nappropriations bills in the few legislative days we have remaining this \nsession, but I implore my colleagues not to move to adjournment until \nwe take action to make sure that the teaching hospitals will still be \naround next session. The teaching hospitals spend 24 hours a day, 365 \ndays a year, working to make sure we live long and healthy lives, and \nit's time for us to return the favor. If we don't have enough time this \nsession to complete the necessary major surgery on the payment system \nfor teaching hospitals, the least we can do is set aside the few hours \nor days it would take to administer a little life-saving financial \nCPR.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12726-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12726-S12727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF ``NATIONAL SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER APPRECIATION DAY''\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, October 17, 1999 is ``National \nSunday School Teacher Appreciation Day'' and I want to take this \nopportunity to honor the 15 million American men and women who serve as \nSunday school teachers. They are surely one of our nation's most \nvaluable resources.\n  Since 1993, ``National Sunday School Teacher Appreciation Day'' has \nhelped foster an increased awareness of the vital role Sunday school \nplays in the life of the local church and community. By marking this \nday, churches have an opportunity to nominate the cream of the crop of \ntheir Sunday school teachers for national recognition. An integral part \nof this campaign is the search for the ``Henrietta Mears Sunday School \nTeacher of the Year.'' This award was established in honor of Dr. \nHenrietta Mears, a famous Christian educator who influenced the lives \nof such Christian leaders as Dr. Billy Graham, and many more.\n  Through their work, Sunday school teachers offer a wealth of \ninformation and guidance to America's youth. In the wake of incidents \nat Columbine High School and, more recently, at the Wedgewood Baptist \nChurch in Texas, the importance of these volunteers, who help shepherd \ntheir communities through difficult times, only increases in value. \nThrough community-based programs--and especially those deeply rooted in \nfaith, such as Sunday School--our nation and my state of\n\n[[Page S12727]]\n\nMinnesota can help bring out the best in our children as they go \nthrough the ever-more challenging task of growing up in our society.\n  Sunday school teachers have had an enormous influence on countless \nMinnesotans, including myself. I personally recall my Sunday school \nteachers as men and women of great character who I respected and \nadmired, and who helped shape my moral fiber. As I look back on my own \nexperience, and those of my friends and relatives, it is with \nconsiderable appreciation I make this statement today. The service \ngiven by the men and women who every week give up their Sunday mornings \nto help educate and mold our children is certainly service given from \nthe heart.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I personally thank all Sunday school \nteachers in my state of Minnesota and across the country for the \ntremendous work they do for not only our youth, but for all families \nand our society as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12727-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDATION FOR THE IRISH EISENHOWER EXCHANGE FELLOWS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I would like to call to \nyour attention a very special anniversary which is taking place in my \nhome state. Ten years ago, a group of emerging leaders from Northern \nIreland and the Republic of Ireland, hosted by the Eisenhower Exchange \nFellowships, met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to launch an exciting \nexperiment in international cooperation.\n  The Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships is a private, non-profit, non-\npartisan organization created in 1953 by a group of prominent American \ncitizens to honor then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his \ncontribution to humanity as a soldier, statesman and world leader. \nEisenhower Exchange Fellowships seeks to foster international \nunderstanding and productivity through the exchange of information, \nideas and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the world. The \nEisenhower network numbers 1300 Fellows from 100 countries. Currently \ntwo Eisenhower Fellows are heads of government; over 90 Fellows have \nserved at the cabinet level or above. More than 220 have become CEOs.\n  The Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships brought this group of fourteen \nIrish Fellows, consisting of seven Fellows from the North and seven \nfrom the South, to the United States for a two-month program. They came \nfrom all types of professional backgrounds, working in business, \ngovernment, religion and law. They came from many perspectives and \ndiverse political and personal beliefs. Through the auspices of the \nEisenhower Exchange Fellowships, they met on common ground in \nPhiladelphia in 1989, and they've been meeting and working together \never since.\n  They decided to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their Single \nArea program by returning to Philadelphia. There they will gather to \nlook back on the last ten years and look forward to the next \nmillennium. These Irish Eisenhower Fellows are to be commended for the \ncontributions they have made to their region and to greater \ninternational understanding in the past decade--and they think of \nPhiladelphia as their second home.\n  In the spirit of Dwight D. Eisenhower, in whose honor the \norganization was founded, the Irish Fellows work together in a \npragmatic way to ensure understanding, respect, and reconciliation. \nBuilding bridges across cultural and political divides, they have \nplayed and continue to play important roles in the peace negotiations. \nThey have made important contributions to economic growth, to the \nsocial welfare of their communities, and to more effective and \nefficient public administration. They have worked effectively towards a \nmore dynamic economy, seeing the importance for their region to play a \nrole in an evolving Europe and in the world.\n  By continuing to find outstanding new Eisenhower Fellows from a \nnumber of professional fields, they help to promote awareness and the \nexchange of ideas between Irish emerging leaders and their American \ncounterparts. By sponsoring USA Eisenhower Fellows and bringing them to \nIreland, they expand the horizons of emerging young U.S. leaders. In \nboth these activities, they strengthen the bonds between our countries.\n  In the spirit of fellowship and unflagging curiosity about the world, \nthey come together every nine months to confer on topical issues, to \nplan for future Eisenhower Fellowships, and to renew and strengthen \ntheir friendships, which cross national borders and historical \ndifferences. They serve, in effect, as a model alumni organization, \nwhich constantly renews its parent body through its energy and \ninnovation.\n  I would like to commend their reunion weekend in Philadelphia, \nOctober 14-17, and wish them the best of luck in their continuing \nmission to establish friendships and improve understanding on a \npersonal, local, national, and international level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12727-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12727-S12728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PENNSYLVANIA BATTLEFIELDS PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  On October 14, 1999, the Senate amended and passed H.R. 659, as \nfollows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 659) entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations for \n     the protection of Paoli and Brandywine Battlefields in \n     Pennsylvania, to direct the National Park Service to conduct \n     a special resource study of Paoli and Brandywine \n     Battlefields, to authorize the Valley Forge Museum of the \n     American Revolution at Valley Forge National Historical Park, \n     and for other purposes.'', do pass with the following \n     amendments:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in the 2 days since this Senate rejected \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I've heard some of our colleagues \ninsist they are proud of that vote. Frankly, I cannot understand how \nanyone could say that.\n  I was deeply saddened and troubled when I opened my newspaper \nyesterday morning. The top headline in the Washington Post read: \n``Senate Rejects Test Ban Treaty.'' The headline just below that read: \n``For US, Fallout will be Fading Influence.''\n  How can anyone take pride in actions that increase the threat of \nnuclear weapons? How can anyone be proud of diminishing America's \nleadership in the world? How can anyone be proud that they have made \nthe world a more dangerous place for ourselves and our children?\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand that.\n  We knew before we voted that, if we rejected the CTBT, we would \nalmost certainly damage our national security and our standing in the \nworld. We knew both of those things. Our senior military leaders warned \nus. Outside experts tried to warn us. Our allies tried to warn us. In \nfact, three world leaders--representing our three oldest and strongest \nallies--took the unprecedented step of writing an open letter to us.\n  In that letter, published this week in the New York times, Jacques \nChirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder implored us: ``As we look to \nthe next century, our greatest concern is proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction . . . Failure to ratify the CTBT, will be a failure in \nour struggle against proliferation . . . For the security of the world \nwe will leave to our children, we urge the United States Senate to \nratify the treaty.''\n  Unfortunately, a majority of Senators chose to ignore these warnings. \nthey chose to ignore the serious implications that rejecting the CTBT \nwould have on U.S. security and international standing, and on the \nsafety of the entire world. If there was any doubt, before the vote, \nthat rejecting the CTBT would be a serious mistake, there can be no \ndoubt now. Look at the headlines.\n  World dismayed by U.S. Treaty Vote--Associated Press\n  International community dismayed by U.S. Rejection of CTBT--Agence \nFrance Presse\n  Germany Says U.S. Nuke Reaction a Serious Setback--Reuters\n  A Reckless Rejection--the Washington Post\n  A Damaging Arms Control Defeat--the New York Times\n  Defeat of Test Ban Treaty a Blow to U.S. Prestige--Reuters\n  Nations Assail Senate Vote on Test Ban Treaty--Washington Post\n  Asia Dismayed by US Treaty Vote--AP\n  Arms-Control World Upended--the Christian Science Monitor\n  Dismay and Anger Abroad at US Action--The Guardian of London\n  Russia Press Digest: America Has Latent Desire to Explode Nuclear \nBombs\n  Listen to the reactions of world leaders:\n  From a senior Chinese official: ``It leaves us with the impression \nthat America has a double standard, you tell the rest of the world not \nto do something and then you go ahead and do it.''\n  From a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry: ``This decision is \na serious blow to the entire system of agreements in the field of \nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. There is a definite trend \nvisible in recent times in US actions and it causes deep alarm.''\n  Some of our colleagues are quick to seize on China and Russia's \ndispleasure. They point to that as proof they did the right thing in \nrejecting the treaty. Even if you accept the premise--and I do not--\nthat what is bad for China and Russia is, by definition, good for the \nUnited States, this goes far beyond these two countries.\n  Condemnation of the Senate's action has been virtually universal. \nIt's worldwide. It's from out friends to our foes, and every nation in \nbetween. From the first world to the third world. Listen to what other \nworld leaders have said:\n  In France, President Chirac said the Senate vote would inflict \n``serious damage'' to the cause of nuclear disarmament, particularly \ndismayed that the views of America's allies were ignored.\n  In Germany, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping called the vote an \n``absolute wrong'' decision. Foreign Minister Fischer said his country \nand other European nations were ``deeply disappointed'' and feared it \nwould seriously harm the cause of nuclear disarmament. ``It is a wrong \nsignal that we deeply regret.''\n\n[[Page S12730]]\n\n  Lord Robertson, NATO's new Secretary General and former British \nDefense Secretary, called it ``a very worrying vote.''\n  A spokesman for the European Union called for the immediate \nratification of the treaty by all signatories and said ``we have \nalready stated our belief that the treaty is clearly in the interests \nof all states as an essential barrier to nuclear proliferation.''\n  In Japan, Foreign Minister Kono said the negative impact was \n``immeasurable'' on the cause of disarmament and non proliferation. \n``The adverse effects are inestimable and it is of extreme concern. We \nhas been hoping for US leadership in preventing the spread of nuclear \nweapons, so the restful is very regrettable.''\n  In the Phillipines, Foreign Secretary Siazon said the vote dealt ``an \nenormous blow to all our efforts to make the world a safer place to \nlive in.''\n  From the Mayor of Hiroshima: The United States is ``going against \ninternational efforts to reduce nuclear arms, as a nuclear power the \nUnited States should lead the way to end the proliferation of \nweapons.''\n  Mr. President, what makes our failure to pass the CTBT doubly tragic \nis that there was nothing forcing the Senate to act on this treaty at \nthis time. This vote could have, and should have, been postponed until \nthe Senate had conducted proper hearings on the treaty. In fact, 62 \nmembers signed a letter to the Majority Leader pleading with him to \ndelay the vote. Among the signers were the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Armed Services Committee. Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and Ranking Member on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Republicans and Democrats signed that letter.\n  Under the rules of the Senate, it was fully within the power of the \nMajority Leader to reschedule this vote for a more appropriate time. \nThe fact that we did not do so is a mistake of historic proportion.\n  What we have done is nothing to be proud of. What we have done is \ndeeply troubling. What we have done is dangerous. What we have done \nhas--for now--made the world less safe.\n  It has, for now, damaged the relationship between the US and some of \nour most important allies. It has, for now, diminished our standing and \nour moral authority in the world.\n  It was a serious mistake. We need to un-do it.\n  Immediately after the vote, a spokesman for the British government \nsaid ``we hope that what happened in Washington is not the end of the \nroad.'' I want our friends in England the rest of the world to know \nthat the United States Senate has not uttered its last word on the \nCTBT.\n  The overwhelming majority of the American people support this treaty. \nOur senior military leaders support this treaty. My colleagues and I on \nthis side of the aisle will do everything we can to secure the votes \nneeded to pass this treaty in the United States Senate.\n  In the meantime, we will insist that the United States continues to \nrefrain from conducting nuclear tests. The United States must not, and \nwill not, give up its position as a leader in the international effort \nto rid the world of the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/15/senate-section/article/S12730-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
