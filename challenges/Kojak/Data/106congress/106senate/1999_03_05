Mr. President, this week the Senate has been debating \nS. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. During the \ndebate, we have heard various interpretations of Ed-Flex. I want to \ntake a moment to remind my colleagues about the idea behind Ed-Flex.\n  The Department of Education, under the leadership of Secretary Riley, \nhas stated that Ed-Flex authority will help States in ``removing \npotential regulatory barriers to the successful implementation of \ncomprehensive school reform'' efforts.\n  Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives a State some \nauthority to grant waivers to a State, giving each State the ability to \nmake decisions about whether some school districts may be granted \nwaivers pertaining to certain Federal requirements.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that States cannot waive any \nFederal regulatory or statutory requirements relating to health and \nsafety, civil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, \nequitable participation of students and professional\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\nstaff in private schools, parental participation and involvement, and \ndistribution of funds to State or local educational agencies. It is \nvery limited, but very helpful.\n  I believe this week, working in a bipartisan fashion, we strengthen \nthe accountability aspects of the Ed-Flex bill even beyond that of the \nbill that was passed out of committee last year by a vote of 17-1. The \naccountability features of the bill are designed to improve school and \nstudent performance, which should be the mission of every education \ninitiative.\n  For a moment it appears that the debate on this bill has become mired \nin a debate over other education proposals not related to education \nflexibility but related to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the foundation for most \nFederal programs designed to assist students and teachers in our \nelementary and secondary schools. This year, this legislation is up for \nreview.\n  As we embark on a new century, it is the perfect opportunity for us \nto examine the Federal role in our educational delivery system. The \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--the HELP \nCommittee--is currently engaged in the hearing process and has been \nsince last December.\n  Through the hearing process, we are evaluating currently authorized \nprograms and exploring new ideas. The first hearing the committee held \nthis year in regard to education examined various initiatives that have \nbeen introduced by Members of this body. The Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act is the most important education legislation we will \nconsider this year, and probably the most important one we have. There \nare a lot of good ideas that are being discussed in and out of this \nChamber that deserve a thorough review.\n  It is for this reason that we should not be debating these issues as \namendments to the Ed-Flex bill but should be debating these proposals \nin the context of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, so that \nthey can receive adequate attention in determining their merits.\n  For this fiscal year, the Federal Government is currently spending \napproximately $15 billion on programs related to elementary and \nsecondary education. This figure excludes special education and \nvocational education.\n  How are these dollars being spent? Who is being served? Is student \nperformance improving? What types of professional development programs \nare helpful to our classroom teachers? Are those teacher training \nactivities translated into better teaching methods? What are the proper \nroles for the various levels of government? These are questions that \nmust be, and will be, addressed in the coming months during the \nElementary and Secondary Education reauthorization.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me and the other members in the \ncommittee in finding the answers to these questions through the \nreauthorization process. Do not attempt to short circuit the process by \noffering those proposals to the Ed-Flex bill.\n  The Education Flexibility Partnership Act is not meant to serve as \nthe sole solution to improving school and student performance. However, \nit does serve as a mechanism that will give States the ability to \nenhance services to students through flexibility with real \naccountability. I urge my colleagues to support immediate passage of S. \n280.\n  Now, we have had, over the past few days, the desire--and I can \nunderstand that desire--to move ahead of the schedule of hearings and \nthorough review of the present Federal programs, to introduce the \nprograms basically that have been recommended by the President for the \npurposes of trying to add them to this Ed-Flex bill way ahead of when \nthey should be offered after a thorough examination and review of the \nproblems we are facing as well as what the recommended programs would \ndo to solve those problems.\n\n  It is the unenviable position I am placed in of trying to pass a bill \ncalled the Ed-Flex bill which will immediately give help to the States \nin better utilizing those resources that are already available and not \nto encumber it in the process by amending and trying to create programs \nwhich will hold up the passage of this bill not only here in the Senate \nbut through the Government in the legislative process. So I don't know \nwhy we should or would like to do that.\n  I also point out where we are and will take a few minutes just to \npoint out where we are presently with respect to our attempts and \nability to be able to try to improve the educational process.\n  Back in 1983 during the Reagan years, Secretary Bell held a Senate \nhearing on the status of education in the United States. As a result of \nthat, a report, ``A Nation at Risk,'' was handed down in 1983 and, with \nwords which are incredibly, I would say, looking towards the future in \nexamining our educational system, said, ``If a foreign nation had \nimposed upon this Nation our educational system we would have \nconsidered it an act of war.'' Those were incredibly strong words. We \ndidn't fully understand what they meant for years.\n  In 1988, the Governors met in Virginia, in Williamsburg, and they \nagreed, after examining where we were not within ourselves, the \ntendency we have in this country is to try to compare ourselves among \nourselves. In Vermont we say, ``Oh, my gosh, we are doing better than \nmost of the other States. We must be in good shape. We don't have to do \nanything.'' But it did prevail throughout Vermont and the country for \nsome time. But gradually we recognized the problems.\n  One of the most, I think, poignant demonstrations of that problem was \nby the Motorola company when they had a real problem with the quality \nof their production in this country. They found that the Japanese were \nmoving ahead of them in the area the United States should have been the \nleader in--cell phones. The president of Motorola at that time brought \nhis leaders together, the board of directors, and said, ``What do we \ndo?'' The recommendation was, first of all, we ought to find out what \nour problem is in education, and secondly--I think the tone of it was--\nwe ought to look elsewhere, to other countries, to find the educated \npopulation that we need in order to produce in competition with the \nJapanese.\n  The CEO did not like the thought or the idea of sending our jobs \noverseas because they were better educated. So he asked to have an \nexamination of his own employees to see what could be done in order for \nthem to produce the quality that was necessary. The results were \namazing. They did not have the capacity in math. But that wasn't the \nbasic problem. They found out--this is amazing in a corporation like \nMotorola--that the people who were given the math problems couldn't \nunderstand the math problems because they couldn't read. Wow. That sent \na shudder through them. But the CEO went on, saying, ``I don't care. We \ncan do it.''\n  So they set up remedial education programs in reading so they could \nget their employees up to skills in reading sufficiently to be able to \nunderstand the math problems. Then they had the training in math. \nAlthough the staff still recommended that they ought to send the jobs \noverseas to Malaysia, the CEO said, ``We will do it here.''\n\n  It turned out that with the proper remedial training and upgrading of \nmath, they not only were able to produce on a par with the Japanese but \nwere also superior to them. Therefore, they were able, after \nconsiderable problems getting into the Japanese market, to outperform \nthe Japanese and kept the jobs at home.\n  In 1988 it was established that we had a problem by the Governors. \nBut it took until 1994 before the Congress reacted and passed what is \nreferred to as the ``Goals 2000'' bill. We took a look. Here it is now, \n15 years after the ``Nation At Risk'' report and a goals panel which \nSenator Bingaman and I sat on with respect to the Senate, and we found, \nto our alarm, that we had no measurable improvement in the 15 years \nsince the Nation was put on notice we had to improve--no measurable \nimprovement, except our children were coming to school healthier. In \nother words, when they reached the sixth grade, they were healthier \nthan they were 15 years ago. That still is not a very successful thing.\n  Then the thing we learned this last time, which was even more \namazing, was that the data we were using to determine whether or not \nour young people were improving was 1994 data. We did not even have the \ncapacity in this\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nNation, after 15 years, to find out where we were. This is very extreme \nand a key element of the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act as to why we could not as of yet find out in an \nexpeditious way where our young people stand as well on the kind of \nstandard we need to be competitive internationally.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the bill we have been discussing for the \nlast several days is a bipartisan bill entitled ``Ed-Flex.'' It really \naims at a fundamental issue, I believe, which is how we improve \neducation for our children, kindergarten through the 12th grade.\n  This particular bill, which is sponsored by myself and Ron Wyden, is \na bipartisan bill. It is a bill that is very simple.\n  My question is: It seems that over the last several hours of \nyesterday that a number of extraneous amendments which have nothing to \ndo with my bill, the Ed-Flex bill, a very specific bill which gives \nflexibility to schools and to teachers and to local communities to \naccomplish education goals--all of these amendments seem to be well \nintended, seem to be great programs, but I ask: Is it not appropriate, \nor more appropriate, so that we can deliver a bipartisan bill supported \nby the American people, supported by all 50 Governors, supported by the \nPresident of the United States, supported by the Department of \nEducation--why can't we in this body come to agreement to pass this \nbill as written with several germane or relevant amendments, which we \nhave been dealing with very appropriately, in a clean way without \ntrying to attach all of these other programs--all of these other \nprograms, I might add, which have huge price tags. My bill doesn't cost \na single cent, has bipartisan support, and will help the children \nwithin weeks or months of passage.\n  Why not--this is the question to my distinguished colleague--address \nall of these other issues, well intended, which do cost money, which \nare new programs, why not address them through the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which is the most appropriate forum where we \nare considering all of these education programs as we go forward? Why \ncan't we proceed with our bill as written, as appropriately modified, \nwithout having to consider every one of these other major issues that \ncome forward that need to be addressed elsewhere?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In answer, I say that the Senator is right, absolutely \nright. What we need to do is to get this country in a position where \nthe Governors have the flexibility to assist us as we move forward.\n  I would point out that what we have done also as a fallback in that \nsense is, with second-degree amendments, to point out that the best \nthing we can do right now for the Governors and the Nation is to fully \nfund IDEA, which is the largest expense that local schools have in \ndoing what is constitutionally required; that is, to provide a child \nwith an appropriate and free education.\n  A recent Supreme Court decision just the other day points out how \nimportant that is now, where, under the 1988 Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the schools are now responsible to ensure that health \ncare, which is necessary in order to allow the child to be able to \nobtain the maximum they can, is to be paid for by local governments.\n  Now, we promised to pay 40 percent of that bill when it was passed. I \nwas on the committee, so I feel a little personally responsible. We \nsaid we would pay 40 percent. If you look at the chart behind me here, \nyou can see that we are far from doing that. The total cost now--and \nthat is going to go up significantly with the Supreme Court decision--\nis $40.5 billion a year. The Federal Government, in order to take up \nits share, which would obviously be around $10 billion--well over $10 \nbillion, right. But we are far from that. Right now we are still $11 \nbillion short\n  Mr. FRIST. If the Senator will yield for one more question about \nwhere we stand as of this morning, again, the bill I have proposed, \nwhich passed through your committee last year by a vote of 17 to 1, \nwhich passed through your committee this year, which has bipartisan \nsupport, is Ed-Flex, flexibility given to local communities with strong \naccountability--that is the bill that we are discussing. Is what you \nhave just pointed out, and what was pointed out yesterday, that before \nwe consider a number of other programs--which may be important and \nwhich will be considered in your committee over the course of the next \nyear--before we should fund new programs, however good they might be, \nwe have an obligation to fulfill the promises that we made in the past, \npromises to fund a very good program--the Disability Education Act; \nspecial education? You pointed out that we have not fulfilled that \npromise yet and before we should dedicate specific funds to new \nprograms, we should fund that unfunded promise that we made, that we \nguaranteed in the past.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is absolutely correct. I praise the Senator for \nraising that issue and for the introduction on the Ed-Flex bill, \nbecause that is a no-cost measure. In fact, it is a ``no-brainer'' in \nthe sense of passage. It ought to be passed. All it does is give the \nStates flexibility to maximize the utilization of Federal funds. That \nshould be on the books before we add any new programs and have the \nGovernors have the maximum flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I want to also alert people about the program for this \nmorning. We have promised that we will have a vote before 10:30 in \norder to accommodate several Senators. So I want to continue to expand \non where we should be going right now. I am hopeful that we can be \nfinished with another amendment in the next 20 minutes so we can call \nthe vote before 10:30 to accommodate those Senators. I again urge that \nthe only amendments I will consider on this bill with respect to \neducation will be those that will not encumber this bill with programs \nwhich should appropriately be on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, which we will be discussing, and on which we are already holding \nhearings. We may accommodate amendments, but not those that will \ninterfere with an orderly process of this legislation going forward, \nunencumbered, on bills that should be appropriately brought before the \ncommittee with respect to education and other matters.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending Ed-Flex \nbill be temporarily set aside and the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 26, S. 508, a bill to prohibit \nimplementation of ``Know Your Customer'' regulations by the Federal \nbanking agencies. I further ask consent that there be 20 minutes for \ndebate on the bill equally divided in the usual form, there be no \namendments in order, and following that debate the bill be read a third \ntime and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators on this side, I will \nhave to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit implementation of ``Know Your Customer'' \n              regulations by the Federal banking agencies)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I call up amendment 40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. Allard, for \n     himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Gramm, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 40 to the language in the bill \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 31.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the language proposed to be stricken, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . ``KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER'' REGULATIONS RESCINDED.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the following proposed regulations \n     may be published in final form and, to the extent that any \n     such regulation has become effective before the date of the \n     date of the enactment of this legislation, such regulation \n     shall cease to be effective as of such date:\n       (1) The regulation proposed by the Comptroller of the \n     Currency to amend part 21 of\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\n     title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as published in \n     the Federal Register on December 7, 1998.\n       (2) The regulation proposed by the Director of the Office \n     of Thrift Supervision to amend part 563 of title 12 of the \n     Code of Federal Regulations, as published in the Federal \n     Register on December 7, 1998.\n       (3) The regulation proposed by the Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve System to amend parts 208, 211, and 225 \n     of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulation, as published \n     in the Federal Register on December 7, 1998.\n       (4) The regulation proposed by the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation to amend part 326 of title 12 of the \n     Code of Federal Regulations as published in the Federal \n     Register on December 7, 1998.\n       (b) Prohibition on Similar Regulations.--None of the \n     Federal Banking Agencies referred to in subsection (a) may \n     prescribe any regulation which is substantially similar to, \n     or would have substantially the safe effect as, any proposed \n     regulation described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of \n     subsection (a).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we now find ourselves in a situation where \nthe Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, or FDIC, have introduced a regulation called ``Know Your \nCustomer.'' This regulation has a 90-day public comment period which \nwill end on March 8. On behalf of the Banking Committee, Senator \nBennett and I sent a letter to each of the regulators, urging them to \ndrop this proposed regulation. I would like to briefly tell our \ncolleagues what this regulation does.\n  Under these regulations imposed on every bank and every thrift in \nAmerica, banks and thrifts would have to set up a program to document a \nsystem of internal controls for compliance with the regulation \nincluding independent testing, monitoring of day-to-day compliance, and \nannual personnel training.\n  What all this would be geared toward is looking at the bank account \nof every single American who has an account, large or small, in any \nthrift or any bank in America, to determine the identity of any new \ncustomers, to determine the customer's source of funds in bank \ntransactions, to determine the particular customer's normal and \nexpected financial transactions, to monitor account activity for \ntransactions that are inconsistent with the normal and expected \ntransactions, and to report transactions of customers that are \ndetermined to be suspicious to the regulatory authority.\n  If you ever wondered what happened to all those people in the former \nSoviet Union who used to run things there and now are permanently out \nof work, the answer is they are all in the Clinton administration and \nthey are running the banking authorities of this country. Can you \nimagine having in place in America regulations so if your mama doubles \nthe contribution she makes on Sunday to the church, her banker looks at \nit to see if it is out of the ordinary?\n  I don't doubt that somewhere, somebody had some good intention. The \nobjective here is to look at money laundering. But the problem is, this \nis such a broad-reaching regulation that it infringes on our \nconstitutional rights.\n  I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to amendment IV \nin the Constitution. Amendment IV says:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures shall not be violated. . . .\n\n  Our Federal Government has no right to routinely monitor your bank \naccount. Our Federal Government has no right to keep records on where \nyour money comes from, or how you write checks, or how you spend your \nmoney, unless there is some clear, compelling case that you are \nviolating the law. What these bank regulators have done is not only run \nafoul of public opinion--over 135,000 Americans have filed comments in \nopposition to this process--but they have run afoul of something more \nimportant than public opinion. They have run afoul of the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  As a result, not having heard a definite answer from the regulators, \nmembers of the Banking Committee are here today to begin our process of \nengaging in oversight to be sure that when we pass laws, as we did \nsetting up these agencies, that those laws are adhered to.\n  I believe our committees spend too much time writing law and too \nlittle time seeing that regulatory agencies abide by that law.\n  I have two colleagues here today who have been leaders in this effort \nto introduce the bill that we were unable to call up because a \nunanimous consent was objected to. Let me first yield to Senator \nAllard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for yielding for the purpose of a \nquestion. I just want to be clear that we are talking about the same \nissue here. My understanding is that these are the same rules and \nregulations proposed by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of \nThrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on \nDecember 7. As I understand, the regulations are going to require banks \nto set up customer profiles. I cannot imagine anything more intrusive \nthan looking into somebody's banking account any time there is a little \nbonus that they get in their paycheck or they give a contribution \nsomewhere. Then they suddenly become subject to scrutiny, not only by \ntheir banker but by law enforcement agencies and by the regulators. I \nthink that is extremely intrusive. I just wanted to clarify that.\n  The regulations that are being proposed are extremely vague and are \ncertainly a threat to our privacy in this country. The regulations, as \nI understand, were drawn up to fight fraud, tax evasion, and combat \nmoney laundering, but I do believe that they are reaching entirely too \nfar. I think these regulations are unnecessary and, frankly, I think \nthese regulations ought to be scratched.\n  One other thing that I want to clarify with Senator Gramm from Texas \nis that credit unions, security firms and insurance firms are exempt \nfrom these regulations. Again, we have one part of the financial \nindustry being regulated and none of the other parts being regulated. I \nthink the proposed regulations would create a lot of imbalance.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator would allow me to reclaim my time, very \nbriefly, not only is it an unconstitutional, unjustified, and \nunwarranted search and seizure, but wisely, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the National Credit Union Administration have not \npromulgated such rules. While we are being critical, and justifiably \nso, of the agencies that have, we should point out that these agencies \ndid not follow suit, and I think they deserve some credit.\n  The point is, if I know that the Federal Government is going to be \nspying on my little bank account that might have $1,100 in it, and I \ncan take it and put it in a credit union or put it in a mutual fund and \nhave some degree of privacy, every little bank, every savings and loan \nor community bank in America ends up being disadvantaged, because the \nFederal Government is using them to snoop on their customers. As a \nresult, they lose customers.\n  Mr. ALLARD. These are unbelievably intrusive. I congratulate the \nchairman of the Banking Committee for his hard work, and, in \nparticular, my colleague from Pennsylvania. He has really stepped \nforward on this issue, doing a great job on the Banking Committee. It \nis a pleasure to work with both of you on this issue.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to return the \ncompliment to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, who has been \nmagnificent in introducing legislation, working with Senator Enzi from \nWyoming, and coauthoring a letter with myself and sending a \ncorrespondence a couple of weeks ago complaining about this regulation.\n  He mentioned a couple of the concerns. Actually, an interesting \nconcern was brought up yesterday. If you are not aware or are you \naware, Mr. Hawke, who is the head of the OCC, testified before the \nHouse Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Commercial and \nAdministrative Law, yesterday and raised a concern. These are his \nregulations, but he raised some concerns, from all the feedback he had \nreceived, that he believed that these regulations were inadvertently \nundermining confidence in the banking system, because it violated the \ntrust and the right of privacy between the banker and the customer. \nThere are serious consequences to this. It is not just moving it from \nyour bank to your savings and loan, but literally, it undermines the \ncustomer-banker relationship and that privacy relationship that is \nexpected.\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\n  I will quote Mr. Hawke:\n\n       Law-abiding citizens . . . will understandably be \n     apprehensive that their banks will report any transactions \n     that may be the least out of the ordinary . . .''\n       A widespread loss of confidence in the privacy of bank \n     accounts could lead to widespread withdrawals and ``do \n     lasting damage to our banking system. . . .''\n\n  That is from the regulator who has proposed these. I think he has now \nunderstood. Over 140,000 people have written, with, to my \nunderstanding, 33 in favor, and the other 139,900-plus were against it. \nI can tell you, in my office we have received 200 to 300 letters, all \nagainst, and almost all from individuals. The few thrifts and banks \nthat have written us did not write us to complain about the regulatory \nburden, but wrote us to reflect all the complaints they are getting \nfrom their customers about the invasion of privacy here. This has some \nserious constitutional issues, and, I think, very serious ramifications \nfor the banking industry. I would like your comment on that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. First of all, I would guess that those 33 people who were \nfor it are the people who are going to sell all the management services \nand the training programs and the computer programs for enforcement. It \nis a foul breeze that doesn't blow somebody some good.\n  The point is, you have 260 million Americans who lose a \nconstitutional right, when you have financial institutions that have \nevery confidence that people have in the security of their deposits, \nnot that they are going to lose the money but that they are going to \nlose their freedom to take their paychecks, deposit in their bank \nwithout people knowing how much they have deposited, and spend their \nmoney on things they want to spend it on without being second guessed \nas to whether this expenditure was out of the ordinary, with language \nlike ``determine the particular customer's normal and expected \ntransaction.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. They are going to do a profile on every individual's \ntransactions within their bank?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Take a bank in a medium-sized town and take the personnel \nthey have, how in the world could they possibly comply with this \noutrageous regulation without it costing, on a nationwide basis, \nliterally billions of dollars?\n  I think one of the complaints that we have on this issue is a very \nsimple one, not only is it unconstitutional, not only is it outrageous, \nbut it shows, again, how callous Federal regulators are about the costs \nthat are imposed on American business, and the loss of freedom for \nAmerican consumers. It is sort of the idea that if someone has a social \nexperimentation, it is the job of Americans to comply with their \nexperiment and it is the job of business to pay for it.\n  Nowhere in the regulation does it suggest that the Government is \ngoing to pay the bank in your hometown or the bank that is in a \nshopping center near where you live in Colorado; there is nothing in \nthe regulation that says they are going to pay for all these costs. Who \ndo you think is going to pay for it? You are going to pay for it with \nfees on your checking account. You are going to pay for it with lower \nrates of return on your CD. You are going to pay for it when you borrow \nmoney to buy your home or buy a car or borrow money on a guaranteed \nstudent loan to send your child to college. You are going to pay for \nthese regulations in higher costs.\n  I am delighted that the Comptroller of the Currency has become \nconcerned, but why didn't they think about this before they promulgated \nthis regulation?\n  The point is, our job on the Banking Committee is to stop this kind \nof thing from happening.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ALLARD. It is interesting how their light sort of turned on after \nsuch diverse groups as the ACLU and the Christian Coalition came \ntogether and opposed these regulations. As my colleague from \nPennsylvania pointed out, the regulators have received over 100,000 \nobjections. There are so many objections coming in, that they have a \nhard time keeping the number up on the web page because so many people \nare writing in to explain their concerns. I think the American people \nhave caught on to this folly, and I think it is a shame that we have to \nbring it up in this manner to address it in the Senate.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee for his fight to \nprotect the Constitution and to protect the privacy rights of American \ncitizens.\n  It is extremely important that we do everything possible to keep from \nhaving these rules and regulations passed. They are so invasive.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield, and then I will yield to the Senator from \nWashington for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As I understand procedurally what has happened, we \ntried to call up a bill on the floor, which I introduced with Senator \nAllard and Senator Enzi, and tried to get a vote to express the will of \nthe Senate that we are against the ``Know Your Customer'' regulations.\n  My understanding is the other side objected to bringing that bill up. \nSo you have had to offer an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill to try to get \nthe Senate on record in opposition, because there will be some \ndecision--the end of the comment period will be, I think, on Monday; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct. I also remind my colleague, we sent a \nletter from the committee on February 10 objecting to these \nregulations. The point is, when the committee of jurisdiction almost a \nmonth ago said no, the time has come for them to answer. That is why we \nbrought this issue to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So it is your desire to try to get a vote on this, have \nthe Senate express itself in an up-or-down fashion in the next few \nminutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right. It would be nice if our colleagues would \nlet us have an up-or-down vote on it. I don't know why anybody would be \nopposed to this amendment. But it would be my objective, after yielding \nto the Senator solely for the purpose of a question, to move to table \nthe pending amendment and ask for the yeas and nays. But I yield to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk \nabout education. I was a little surprised we were talking about banking \nsince we haven't been able to talk about a lot of education issues that \nare critical to parents, students and teachers across the country.\n  I ask my colleague from Texas what his intent is on this amendment. I \nknow we are expected to go to a vote shortly. There are a number of us \nhere who did want to talk about education before a vote occurred. Do \nyou intend to vote in the next several minutes without yielding any \nDemocratic time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, my intention is to move to table the \namendment before 10:20 and ask for the yeas and nays. I do know we are \nhere this morning to talk about education, and that is very important. \nBut I say to my colleagues, in apologizing for having to disrupt their \ndebate, that this is about education. When we have the Federal \nGovernment imposing regulations that will cost our financial \ninstitutions billions of dollars to comply and that will end up driving \nup the cost of loans as people borrow money to send their children to \ncollege, I think it is something with which we have to deal.\n  We are reaching the point where we could have a final determination. \nWe are encouraged that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \nhas raised concern about it responding to 140,000 objections. But the \npoint is, on Monday, we are going to have, potentially, a final \ndetermination. We had hoped when we sent a letter on February 10 that \nwe would get action. We did not get that action. As a result, we are \nhere today.\n  Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 40, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 40. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called). Present.\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), \nthe Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. \nHutchinson), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Sessions), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. \nHutchinson), and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions) would each \nvote ``no.''\n  Mr. REID.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate now is in its third day of debate \non the education flexibility bill. I think that is good. This is a \nsubject we should all be more than happy to talk about. There has been \na good debate and a number of amendments have been disposed of. But \nprogress has begun to slow down.\n  I feel the need to remind our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nthat the appropriations season is fast approaching and that we have \nseveral important items to consider between now and the Easter recess. \nFor instance, I presume that by the latter part of next week the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill will be ready for \nconsideration, since the Appropriations Committee reported it out \nunanimously yesterday; and, of course, we hope to go to the budget \nresolution and get it completed before we end the session at the end of \nMarch for the Easter recess. I believe there is a genuine interest on \nboth sides of the aisle in completing both the Ed-Flex bill as well as \nthe emergency supplemental, if that can be worked out, and the budget \nresolution which will be available, hopefully, within the next 10 days \nor so.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In order to assure that we keep moving toward passage of \nthe Ed-Flex bill, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. 31 \n     to Calendar No. 12, S. 280, the education flexibility \n     partnership bill.\n         Trent Lott, Jim Jeffords, John H.

Again, Mr. President, it is my hope that the cloture vote \nwill not be needed and that the Senate will be able to enter into some \nreasonable time agreement with respect to the Ed-Flex bill.\n  I know the Senator from Oregon has been working on both sides of the \naisle, talking to his cosponsors, Senator Frist and the chairman and \nranking member of the committee, as well as leadership on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, and to the majority leader. He will \ncontinue to do that. I am hoping that he will find some way to get an \nagreement as to how we can proceed with amendments and get to a \nconclusion. But we haven't been able to get that worked out yet.\n  If we cannot get something worked out, then the cloture vote would \noccur on this cloture motion on Tuesday, March 9.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2358-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2358-S2359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate has conducted its last vote for the week.\n  Several Senators, again, on both sides of the aisle, expressed \nconcern that it was necessary to have votes on Friday. But I discussed \nthis with Senator Daschle. We just are going to have to, in order to \ncomplete the work we need to do, have votes on Friday mornings and also \nsometime around 5 o'clock on Mondays. We will try to be as flexible as \nwe can. But, as usual, we have Senators who would like us to be a \nlittle later or a little earlier. And it is very hard to find that \nnarrow window.\n  But from now until the Easter recess, and probably in May and June, \nSenators should plan on having a vote on Mondays at 5 and in the \nmorning on Fridays, but with those votes not occurring later than 12. \nThere will be some Mondays or Fridays where that will not be the case \nbecause there is a conference on one side or the other or a conflict.\n  Senator Daschle and I will talk about that, and we will try to notify \nMembers far in advance--hopefully a month or more--when a Friday or a \nMonday might be completely divided.\n  There was a cloture filed last night to the pending Ed-Flex bill. We \nare reminded that under the provisions of rule XXII all first-degree \namendments must be filed by 1 p.m. today; all second-degree amendments \nby 4 p.m. on Monday in order to qualify under the cloture rule.\n  The Senate will now continue on the Ed-Flex bill for debate only for \nMembers to make statements.\n  It is my hope that an agreement can be worked out on the Ed-Flex bill \nas we proceed. If we can, then the cloture vote could be vitiated on \nMonday, and we would have some other vote.\n  But around 5 o'clock on Monday will be the next recorded vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate continue with consideration \nof S. 280, the Ed-Flex bill for debate only until 12 noon. I further \nask unanimous consent that at 12 noon the Senate begin a period of \nmorning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to agree and disagree with the \ndistinguished majority leader. Let me point out my area of agreement \nfirst.\n  I believe it is important, as we begin our legislative session this \nyear, that Senators be fully apprised of the schedule, and we \nunderstand that we have to be here on Fridays and on Mondays.\n  I think the majority leader is absolutely right in expecting that we \nhave votes on Friday mornings and Monday afternoons or Monday evenings.\n  I hope Senators will accommodate that schedule with their own \npersonal schedules, because that is the only\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\nway, as we get into more legislative work, that we will be able to \naccommodate all of our needs legislatively.\n  I must say that I am in strong disagreement with the leader's \ndecision to file cloture. We have a very important amendment that I was \nhoping we could offer even this morning, the class size amendment, the \n100,000-teacher amendment offered by Senator Murray and Senator \nKennedy, and a number of other Senators. That was not possible because \nof the decision made by the leader.\n  What is perhaps most perplexing to me is, having filed cloture \nyesterday, that 17 Republican Senators filed cloture, then they voted \nagainst tabling a banking amendment to the education bill this morning.\n  So we have an unusual set of circumstances where the very same \nSenators who signed a cloture motion yesterday, voted not to table an \nextraneous amendment having nothing to do with Ed-Flex today, the \nbanking amendment. I must say it doesn't help us as our colleagues are \nattempting to work through this procedurally to understand what the \nnature of the strategy may be on the other side. It appears that what \nthey are trying to do is simply deny the Democrats the right to offer \nour amendments. They will vote no on a Republican amendment--they will \nvote not to table; that is, a Republican amendment--having to do with \nbanking, but then they will preclude Democrat Senators from offering \nlegitimate, important amendments having to do with education, such as \nthe class size amendment, and for having a debate on it.\n  So I am perplexed by that. It sends the wrong message. We want to \ncooperate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2359-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2359-S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an important bill. Ed-Flex is a \nbill that, in my view, as I have said before, warrants a 100-to-nothing \nvote. We ought to give States more flexibility. But we also ought to \nrecognize that if we are going to begin debate on education policy in \nthe U.S. Senate, there are other issues that also merit consideration \nand opportunity for an up-or-down vote: Whether or not we have an \nafterschool program, whether or not we have an effort in this country \nto prevent dropouts, whether or not we consider 100,000 teachers and \nclass size, whether or not we have school construction. All of those \nare legitimate education issues.\n  So I will offer to my distinguished majority leader another effort at \ncompromise. I will attempt to see if we might come down to five or six \namendments and say: Look. We will agree to those five or six \namendments; we will agree to time limits and up-or-down votes on those \nfive or six amendments; and then let's move on. The majority leader was \nvery generous, I thought, with what he said earlier to the Governors. \nAs I understand it, the majority leader said, Let's go to the Senate; \nlet's take a week; let's take 2 weeks, if necessary, but let's talk \nabout education. Let's take 2 weeks if necessary. We haven't even taken \na week yet.\n  So I really appreciate the majority leader's interest in trying to \nfind some way with which to resolve this impasse. I think he is \nunderstandably desirous of moving on to other things. We want to do \nthat. We want to pass the Ed-Flex bill. We want to pass good education \namendments. We want to resolve this matter. We want to find a way to do \nit in a bipartisan manner. And I am confident that if we continue to \nwork at it that we will.\n  So I will offer, again, to see if we might limit our amendments to \nmaybe five or six with time limits and have up-or-down votes. I believe \nthat is the best way to break through this. I am hopeful that we can \nget broad bipartisan agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to follow up briefly on this Ed-Flex \nissue, first to thank the minority leader, who is clearly making a very \nstrong effort to work this out and be conciliatory.\n  I would also like to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, who is \nmaking such an effort as well.\n  I want to advise our colleagues that we are going to work through the \nweekend to try to come up with a way that is fair for all concerned.\n\n  I think Senator Daschle made it clear these Democratic amendments are \ncritical, it is important there is an opportunity they be discussed, \nand--conciliatory on the part of the leader--that there would be time \nagreements. I think the majority leader has made a very sensible \nstatement of why this bill is a priority.\n  It is critically important that the more than $11 billion that go out \nin programs covered by Ed-Flex is spent wisely. What we have found in \nthe 12 States that are now using Ed-Flex is that a few miles from here, \njust a few miles from here, existing dollars now allocated under title \nI are being used to cut class size in half to make sure that kids can \nget the education they need.\n  For those of you who think that the Senator from Washington, Senator \nMurray, is making an important contribution in terms of the extra \nteachers, I want it clear that I support that. It is needed. But I \nsupport just as strongly--and I would say this especially to my \nDemocratic friends--the proposition that we use money that is now \nallocated wisely. And we are not doing that today.\n  Under current law, for example, poor kids who want to get access to \nadvanced computing aren't able to do it in a lot of instances because \nthese programs put them into a regulatory straitjacket. In a lot of \ninstances, we could boost the test scores up for poor kids. We haven't \nbeen able to do that because of some of the bureaucracy associated with \nthese programs.\n  Last night we had a discussion about what these programs mean to \nparents. I happen to agree with the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, the parents don't focus on Ed-Flex in bureaucratic \nterms. They do focus on results. I can assure you, the parents of those \nyoungsters a few miles from here who have had their class size cut in \nhalf as a result of Ed-Flex are very appreciative of that. Because of \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Hatfield, in 1994 we began this effort to \npass Ed-Flex. It is time to expand it.\n  Around this country there has not been one example of an abuse \nassociated with Ed-Flex--not one. But there are plenty of examples of \nwhy Ed-Flex is working for poor kids from coast to coast. Go see those \nkids in the State of Maryland--our friend, Senator Sarbanes, is here--\nwhere they have used those dollars to cut class size. Or come to my \nhome State of Oregon where, because of bureaucratic rules, it was not \npossible for poor kids to get advanced computing at their schools.\n  I know a number of my colleagues would like to speak, and I want to \nlet them have that opportunity. But just know--because of the very \nconciliatory offer that has been made by the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, this morning, and the majority leader, Senator Lott, I believe \nis also trying to accommodate both sides--those of us who are \nsponsoring this legislation are going to work throughout the weekend to \nsee if we can get a sensible time agreement that is fair to both sides.\n  As the Democratic sponsor of Ed-Flex, I want to again state to my \ncolleagues, I think the contribution of our friend from Washington, \nSenator Murray, is important and the Boxer amendment on afterschool \nprograms is critically important--but it is just as important to show \nthat those $11-plus billion that are now allocated in title I and other \nprograms are being spent wisely. In fact, for those colleagues who \nshare my view that we need more financial assistance in these key \nareas, I submit the best way to make the case for getting additional \nfunds is to show taxpayers you are spending more wisely the dollars \nthat are allocated at this time.\n  I look forward to some long hours over this weekend, working with our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. Education, in my view, is the \npremier issue of our time. I think that is why the Members of the \nSenate feel so strongly about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his work on \nthe\n\n[[Page S2360]]\n\nEd-Flex bill as well as the other cosponsors of this initiative. I know \nhe feels passionately about bureaucratic paperwork and has worked very \nhard to try to reduce some of that, as well as Education Secretary \nRiley, who has made a major effort in his tenure at the Department to \nreduce paperwork. We have heard some really good stories in the last \nyear back from him.\n  We agree with you on Ed-Flex and want to move that forward. I think \nthe Democratic leader this morning, offering to come up with limited \namendments and limited time agreements, made a very generous offer, \nbecause there are a number of Senators, I think on both sides of the \naisle, who want to spend some time talking about education, talking \nabout what is happening in our schools, talking about our \nresponsibility as Senators to be in partnership with those local \nschools and teachers and school board members; making sure that our \nkids, no matter who they are or where they come from or how much money \nthey have, have the best education possible. That is the debate we want \nto have on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  I am extremely disappointed because I came over here this morning, \nhoping to offer my class size amendment. I have been precluded from \ndoing that by the actions of the majority leader. I am ready to offer \nmy amendment so we can send a message to those school board members who \nare meeting right now, today, trying to figure out their budgets, who \nlast October listened to us tell them in a bipartisan way, Republicans \nand Democrats, Senate and House Members, that we are committed to \nhelping them reduce class size so our kids can get the adequate \nlearning they need to compete in today's global economy.\n  But we are here today, once again precluded from being able to offer \nthat amendment, to have a debate, to have an up-or-down vote, so those \nschool board members can put their budgets together and begin to hire \nthose teachers, as they must shortly do, so they can have a commitment \nthat is real.\n  Let's tell them this was not a political promise before the election \nby Republicans and Democrats. This was a real commitment on our part to \nmake a difference, to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3. We began \nthat process last year. We have an obligation, and this is our \nopportunity to make a real difference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator reminds us that in the final days of the \nlast Congress, we passed legislation that would provide local \ncommunities the opportunity to hire additional teachers so we could \nhave smaller class sizes for the first three grades. That was worked \nout in a bipartisan way. As I understand, from what the Senator says, \nthe school boards are meeting now to find out whether this was just \ngoing to be something that would be for 1 year or whether it is going \nto be continual? The President has indicated strong support to continue \nit, recognizing that we need some 2 million new teachers over the \nperiod of 10 years. He wanted to really jump-start that whole process, \nand do it particularly in the early grades, which all the research \nindicates has such enormous potential for enhancing student \nachievement.\n  I was wondering whether the Senator realized that last October, when \nwe made this agreement for the 1 year--the 1-year agreement--\nCongressman Goodling, who is chairman of the House Education and the \nWorkforce Committee, a Republican, declared:\n\n       The class size reduction was a real victory for the \n     Republican Congress. But more importantly, it is a huge win \n     for local educators, parents who were fed up with Washington \n     mandates, redtape and regulation. We agree with the \n     President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our \n     proposal does not create the big new Federal education \n     programs.\n\n  So Congressman Goodling, the Republican chairman of the Committee at \nthe time, was taking credit for a Republican victory. We considered it \na victory as well. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans, and \nthe people who were going to benefit were the children, so all of those \nwho were involved at that particular time claimed it as a victory.\n  Now, the good Senator's amendment takes that concept, which the \nSenator had championed all last year, and extends it so the local \nfamilies, school boards, principals, schoolteachers, and children will \nknow there will be a continuation in the employment of those teachers \nover the period of the next 5 years, so that we can make some \nmeaningful progress in reducing the class size.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nWhen we passed this last October, Republicans and Democrats stood up, \nstood together, and said: This is a commitment from the Federal \nGovernment. No additional redtape, no bureaucracy, the money is going \nto go out there to those local schools to hire teachers to reduce class \nsize. We stood together, shoulder to shoulder.\n  I am having a difficult time going home now, talking to school board \nmembers and my friends who are teachers--many of whom are Republicans--\nand saying, well, gee, now maybe they might not support us.\n  They don't understand that because they are putting together a budget \nright now. They need to hire those teachers. They need to make a \ncommitment to that teacher, to that class, to those parents who are \nenrolling their kids, that they are going to continue to do this. They \nneed us in that partnership. They don't want political maneuvers. They \ndon't understand why Ed-Flex is a bill we can't do this on. We are \ntalking about education. The time is right. It was bipartisan before. \nThey want us to give that commitment now, and that is why I came to the \nfloor today to offer this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, then, for a final question? \nThe Senator is the principal sponsor of this legislation and the one \nwho was instrumental in achieving its outcome in the fall of last year, \nwith bipartisan support and the support of the chairman of the House \ncommittee, Congressman Goodling. As I understand it, therefore, the \nSenator is prepared to at least urge others to withhold further \neducation amendments and support what Senator Daschle has said? There \nmay be just a few amendments, but that the Senator's would certainly be \none of the important ones because of the importance of the timing for \nlocal school districts, and that my colleague would agree to a \nreasonable time period?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I was saying that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the leaders came to you and said, We are prepared to \nenter into a time of a couple of hours to discuss this, you would be \nwilling, perhaps--I know there would be a number of people that want to \nspeak on it--but you are prepared to at least accommodate the \nleadership and the schedule on that issue. You would certainly support \nan initiative by the leaders, even from our side--maybe there are some \non the other side--to move towards a very few amendments--I think the \nleader said five or six--and do it with a time limit so that we can \nmove along with the Senate schedule. Do I understand correctly?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. I \nam more than ready to do a time agreement, to do this quickly. The \nreason it is so important to do it now is it is bipartisan. It is \nabsolutely timely in terms of school boards and school districts \nputting their budgets together. I actually heard the chairman of the \ncommittee this morning talk about the fact that the reason we should \nmove Ed-Flex forward is that it is bipartisan and it is timely, not to \nwait for ESEA.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, we could have even \nhad the debate during the course of this morning.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We could have.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We could have moved ahead towards the vote on that next \nweek, and we could have accommodated the Senate schedule.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would have been delighted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank the Senator, first of all, for her \npassion and common sense and experience, as a former school board \nmember and a former teacher and a mother. She has given a good deal of \ntime and attention to this issue. We all have enormous respect for all \nthe work she does when she is back home visiting with these communities \nand talking to parents and teachers about this proposal. She had an \nextensive inquiry as to the importance of this proposal, to bring this\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\nmatter to the Senate, and has been willing to follow a very reasonable \ntime period for consideration of it. I just want to thank her and hope \nthat she will be successful. I certainly will do everything I can to \nmake sure that she is.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Let me just finish my remarks. I know there are a number of other \nSenators present.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, because I am leaving in 30 \nseconds, I want to thank her and ask her a question. Does the Senator \nnot agree with me that we owe a real debt to Senator Wyden of Oregon, \nbecause the force of his desire to make education better resulted in a \nbipartisan agreement to bring an education bill to the floor? In doing \nso, I want to make it clear, because he and I have spoken, while we all \nagree with him that this is a good program, there have been many \nwaivers passed on by Secretary Riley because he, too, agrees that Ed-\nFlex is working. This is a golden opportunity that he has given us to \nflesh out this bill, to make it even better.\n  I say to the Senator from Washington, she worked so hard to get \n100,000 teachers into the classroom and reduce class sizes. We worked \ntogether on these issues to get afterschool funds to the school \ndistricts who wanted so much. Last year, there were $540 million worth \nof requests for afterschool programs. We only had $40 million. This \nyear, the President wants to have the money to accommodate all those \nlocal districts.\n  I say to her, as a former school board member, the kinds of \namendments that we hope to add to this bill, does she agree those kinds \nof amendments will give resources to the local districts so they will \nbe able to make up their own minds as to whether they want those \nresources, that they will be able to design the programs themselves, \nand that what we are doing here, what the majority leader has done to \nus today, by not allowing these amendments, is simply to hold back \nthese important bills from being voted upon so that those children will \nright now be denied the kinds of help they need?\n  The last point I want to make, and the last question I have to the \nSenator from Washington is this: Does she not agree that education is \nthe No. 1 issue on the minds of the people and that when we see \nfilibusters and stalls and hours of just chitchat and no work on \neducation, that we are not meeting our responsibilities? Would she not \nagree with that? Again, I want to thank her for her leadership.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from California for her tremendous \nwork on education, her passion, and in particular, her afterschool \nprograms and appreciate her remarks this morning and agree with her. \nEducation is absolutely the No. 1 priority for families across this \ncountry, but it is not just families. We go and talk to businesses, and \nbusiness people tell us we need to be able to hire students out of our \nschools with math and science and reading and English skills. Studies \nshow--and I will be delighted, when we get to the debate on this, to go \nthrough the studies again--that reducing class size makes a difference \nin a child's ability to learn to write and to read, to do math and to \ndo science, just the skills our businesses are looking for. They are \nlooking to us to make a commitment on this.\n  I commend my colleague from Oregon, as well, for his work on this. I \nknow he is committed to this issue and has pledged his support as well. \nHe knows, too, how important class size is.\n  Let me end by reminding my colleagues this is a bipartisan effort. It \nwas passed in a bipartisan way last October. There is no reason not to \ndo this now. In fact, a former Republican House Member said, on \neducation, We should champion communities and parents, reduce class \nsize, and increase accountability.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Republican Main\n\n\n                                           Street Partnership,\n\n                                                    Arlington, VA.\n\n               An Open Letter to Republicans in Congress\n\n       Dear Colleagues & Friends: The Republican Main Street \n     Partnership was founded in 1998. Our goal is to demonstrate \n     that the Republican Party can govern and achieve our goals of \n     bipartisan cooperation in enacting centrist policies. We are \n     focused on speaking out, setting the agenda and demonstrating \n     a new discipline for reaching consensus on difficult issues; \n     without that, we believe that we will not be a Majority Party \n     by the close of the Year 2000.\n       Immediately, the rhetoric of partisan hostility must stop. \n     Our language too often has been heard as mean, judgmental and \n     partisan. That ``the other side does it'' is no excuse. We \n     need Republican unity to replace division or our statistical \n     majority will never become a governing majority. We must \n     restore dignity to our debate, civility to our conversations \n     and compassion to our perspective. We need a new language and \n     a new voice.\n       Our agenda must be positive; it must be an agenda for \n     governance. On education, we should champion communities and \n     parents, reducing class size and increasing accountability. \n     On Social Security, we should press for personal choice, not \n     100% governmental custody of our retirement funds. On health \n     care, Medicaid and Medicare we must legislate with compassion \n     as well as prudence. On taxes, we must work to reduce the \n     burden on hardworking middle-class American families. And \n     when we discuss our agenda, we must do it in terms that \n     dispel the fears and inspire the hopes of American families \n     and businesses.\n       Both governance and civility will demand discipline. \n     Challenges will rise from partisan and ideological quarters. \n     That is when we must stay the course with unity, courage--and \n     discipline.\n       If we can stand tall within our own tradition--if we can \n     bring to the 106th Congress Lincoln's urgency for justice, \n     Roosevelt's commitment to the environment, Eisenhower's \n     vision of public education--then the finest elements of our \n     party's legacy, the tone of our speeches, the content of our \n     legislation and the discipline of our behavior will make this \n     a season of triumph for the Republican Party, and for the \n     nation!\n           Sincerely,\n       The Republican Main Street Partnership Board of Directors\n         Gov. John McKernan, Hon. Mike Castle, Hon. Amo Houghton, \n           Hon. Rick Lazio, Hon. Fred Upton, Mr. Allan Cors.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me just conclude, because I know the Senator from \nMaryland would also like to speak, education is an issue that is \nimportant to all of us. Education is an issue that is important to \neveryone at home as well. I will again plead with the chairman from the \ncommittee to allow us to offer our amendments, to get an up-or-down \nvote, to limit the number of amendments, but to let us move forward on \nissues like this, like class size, that are bipartisan, that have been \nagreed to before, that the American public wants and that makes a \ndifference for all of our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Maryland. Does \nthe Senator desire to speak on the bill?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I desire to speak about the extremes to which the other \nside will go to frustrate the opportunity to consider significant \neducational initiatives on this bill by now bringing into consideration \nsubject matter completely extraneous to education and the jurisdiction \nof the committee; namely, the amendment that is now pending dealing \nwith a banking issue. I want to speak on that subject for a few \nminutes. I think it is highly relevant to the situation in which we \nfind ourselves.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I see no other Senators. I desire to speak at some \npoint. I would be happy to let the Senator speak now, even though it \ndoes not appear to be totally relevant to this bill. I would like an \nunderstanding of how much time he might like.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Ten minutes at the most.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. All right. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, I am not the one who is introducing what he describes as an \nextraneous issue into this debate. I am simply addressing the fact that \nit was introduced into this debate by others. I do not think it should \nbe here, frankly.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think that is relevant to the bill so I do not have a \nproblem with you proceeding as you desire.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think the extremes to which the other \nside will go to try to frustrate considering bona fide educational \nissues on this education bill was demonstrated by the fact that the \nvote we just had\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nwas on tabling a motion on an amendment involving the ``Know Your \nCustomer'' proposed regulations that were put out by the Federal \nbanking regulators.\n  I wrote to the regulators, pointing out the problems with these \nproposed regulations and urging them to carefully consider these \nproblems before proceeding or implementing them. The regulators have \nreceived a flood of comments highly critical of the proposed \nregulations and, in fact, the comment period, which ends on March 8, is \nnot yet over. At least two regulators have already indicated, in \nadvance of the comment period ending, that they expect not to adopt the \nproposed regulations as final regulations in view of the overwhelming \nnumber of comments they have received and the complexity of the issue.\n  Many of my colleagues have, as I have done, written to them pointing \nout the difficulties connected with these regulations and the possible \nbreaches of customers' personal financial privacy.\n  On the other hand, since there is a law enforcement issue involved \nhere with respect to money laundering, we need to be very careful what \nwe do. I am concerned because the amendment not only addresses the \nproposed regulations but also precludes any other regulations being put \nforward by the agencies that would be similar to these.\n  Conceivably, the agencies could develop more narrow regulations that \nfocus on the money laundering issue, in an effort to curb criminal \nactivity, that would not carry with it the heavy burdens of regulation \non the banks and the potential intrusion into the financial privacy of \nordinary, law-abiding citizens, which none of us wants to do.\n  In fact, I have introduced a bill on the financial privacy issue, \nbroader legislation than we are talking about here. I have been joined \nin that by Senators Dodd, Bryan, Edwards, Leahy, and Hollings. That is \nS. 187.\n  I invite other colleagues to join on that legislation, S. 187, \nbecause I think financial privacy is an extremely important issue and \none that we need to address. We need to assure safeguards to our \nconsumers that their financial privacy is not to be intruded upon \nwithout their knowledge and an opportunity to object.\n  But to reach out, as happened this morning, and try to drag in a \nsubject matter unrelated to education and not directly connected with \nthis bill, as part of a constant process that has been going on over \nthe last few days to block out important educational amendments that \nwould raise significant issues which need to be addressed, it seems to \nme, is going too far.\n  Let me, on these regulations, quickly point out that the regulators \nhave received over 130,000 public comments about the regulations, \ndemonstrating a great deal of concern about the privacy of personal \nfinancial information. The regulators have already indicated they \nrecognize the problems with the proposed regulations. Some have \ntestified or written to the Congress indicating they expect withdrawal \nor substantial if not total revision.\n  We are addressing the problem in the normal course under which \nproposed regulations are addressed, the problem which this amendment \naddresses. In fact, of course, this amendment moves in and, in effect, \nseeks to shortcut or terminate the regular process which would be to \nlet the comment period run and then the regulators take the comments \ninto account. We have already had an indication from the regulators \nthat they have seen enough now so that when they take the public \ncomments into account, the concerns that Members have expressed, myself \nincluded, will be addressed.\n  The potential problem with the amendment is that it may foreclose any \npossibility of addressing the legitimate concerns of the law \nenforcement community directed towards money laundering. My very able \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has been working on that issue.\n  I simply rise to point out some of the complexity of this issue with \nwhich we are dealing, and to focus on the current situation in which we \nfind ourselves--I gather there is not the ingenuity or wit to devise \neducation-related amendments to try to block this process, as has been \ngoing on. So now we are going to reach out, wherever we can, and find \nnon-education-related amendments, to bring them in to try to close out \nthe amendment tree.\n  I am prompted to speak on that because this question of privacy is an \nissue to which we have addressed some attention. As I said, there is a \ncomprehensive bill which has been introduced by a number of us which I \nam very hopeful we will be able to have hearings on and act on.\n  I think the ``Know Your Customer'' proposed regulations is a very \nimportant issue to be addressed. But I find it interesting that here we \nare on a Friday morning and, instead of dealing with education, we have \nbrought in this issue out of the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. \nI think the regulators were about to address this issue to everyone's \nsatisfaction, but the issue has been addressed in the amendment, \npossibly in such a broad fashion that it will prevent the formulation \nof regulations specifically designed to get at money laundering, which \nthe law enforcement community has indicated is a significant concern of \ntheirs. That is an issue to which Senator Levin has addressed \nconsiderable attention.\n  I say to the distinguished chairman, to the extent he views these \ncomments as not relevant or germane to his legislation, they were \nprompted by the fact that an amendment was proposed which itself is not \nrelevant or germane to the bill before us and has nothing to do with \neducation.\n  My own preference, obviously, is to get on with the education \namendments. I hope these discussions that are going to take place will \nmake it possible for significant and important education amendments to \nbe offered to this legislation. We are out here with an important piece \nof education legislation whose basic concept I support. But I do not \nthink we should be precluded from offering other important initiatives \nwith respect to education which, I think, if brought before the body, \nwould command broad support in this institution. I think it would be \nvery important in helping to deal with the Nation's educational \nchallenges.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me explain the position I have taken. My concern is \ngetting amendments now which should be on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act which is presently under consideration by the committee, \nif we are to start passing programs out here that should be more \nproperly considered in committee as to how to allocate expenditure of \nfunds and matters like that.\n  I understand that the pending amendment--we all know in the \nexigencies of time, and sometimes in order to get a message through, a \nsituation arises where it is necessary, in a sense, to add an amendment \nthat is really nongermane in order to send a message downtown. That is \nthe understanding, and I think clear from the vote, that the Members \nwant to send a message downtown that the process toward getting \ninvolved in the privacy of individuals' banking is not one which is \nacceptable to the Senate.\n  I suspect it will disappear into the great unknown at some point, but \nmy main concern is to make sure that the committee, which is addressing \nthe serious problems we have in education in this country, does it in \nan orderly process. We do recognize that the funds which local \ncommunities would like to have in order to meet the demands of some of \nthe restrictions and regulations put on them are needed to replace the \nfunds which should have been coming from the Federal Government with \nrespect to IDEA or with respect to what is more commonly referred to as \n``special education.'' We were committed to 40 percent, and we are only \nsending less than a quarter of what we are committed to.\n  So I will do all I can to make sure that anything which is possible \nto enhance the local communities, as well as bring us closer to meeting \nthe commitment we have to 40 percent of the cost of special education, \nis considered. But I am not going to allow amendments, or do my best \nnot to allow amendments, to this bill which was meant to be expedited \nto assist the local communities to have an opportunity to be more \nflexible in meeting the needs, as they see them, under the restricted \nresources they have by virtue of the fact that we have not fully funded \nour commitment under special\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\neducation. I intend to do that, to try to see how we can ensure that \nthey get the resources to which they are entitled.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate that comment from the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Let me just make two observations: First of all, on the need for this \nbanking amendment, to send a message. The message has certainly been \nsent by many Members and by extensive public comment.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted at the end of my statement a letter which I sent to the \nChairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on January 12 on \nthis very issue of the ``Know Your Customer'' programs, sharply \ncritical of the proposed regulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Just briefly the other question, I have been watching \nwhat has been going on. I am not on a committee with direct \njurisdiction here, but I was prompted to speak by the fact that in this \ngame of delay and blockage we are now dragging in outside amendments.\n  The chairman says he wants these other amendments considered in the \ncontext of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Am I mistaken in \nmy impression that the Secretary of Education, who I think is \nsupportive of Ed-Flex measures, advanced the position that those Ed-\nFlex measures should be considered in the context of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I do not believe he has spoken out on that. He is \nsupportive of our efforts to try to improve the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I would say that he would not be unduly \nconcerned if the President's program got attached to this amendment, \nobviously. He is the Secretary, he supports the President's programs, \nand they would like to get them implemented any way possible.\n  On the other hand, I doubt very seriously if he would take a position \nadverse to knowing what we were doing when we put together the bill, \nwhich is the one which will have more impact upon elementary and \nsecondary education in this country than any other Federal act--that it \nis done well, that it proceeds with due care, and that we examine the \npresent situation to see how things can be improved.\n  Right now we are spending somewhere close to $15 billion on primary \nand secondary education. And, as I stated earlier, there is no \ndemonstration that we have had any improvement since the 1983 \nacknowledgement that this country had a serious problem in education. \nSo I think it is incumbent upon us to try to look at why, after \nspending all those billions of dollars over those years, things have \nnot improved since we understood we had a serious problem back in 1983. \nTo just continue spending the money we are spending the way we are now, \nwithout looking at why it has had no measured improvement--which is an \nimportant part of the process--and to go ahead and just pass new \nprograms without fully taking those matters into consideration, in my \nmind, would be irresponsible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that the amendment which the \nSenator from Washington, Senator Murray, is offering for additional \nteachers in effect is a follow-on to a decision that this Congress made \nin the last session. Did we not authorize additional teachers in the \nlast session?\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator knows as well as I know that in the final \nhours of any legislative session things happen in the exigencies of \ntrying to get something together where people are dealing with the \nissues and probably are not fully aware of the implications of what \nthey do. And that is what happened here.\n  These matters, through the pressure of the administration wanting to \nget something they had not been able to get through the normal \nlegislative process, were able to get on the bill, which was that bill \nthat was 40 inches high. Nobody knew what was in it until it got read. \nAnd the reason we are here with Senator Murray is there were some \nproblems in the way that bill was thrown together that need to be \nattended to. And I understand that. It may be helpful in the amendment \nprocess that we get into next week with amendments. We might be able to \nmake that bill more meaningful.\n  So that is not off the table, as far as I am concerned, as long as \nthe changes that are made are constructive in making that bill that \npassed to be more usable by the communities. But right now, obviously, \nwe are here with an amendment, because when it gets thrown together \nlike that at the end of a session, they end up doing something that \nthey do not know what they are doing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that, first of all, that was \nextensively discussed. And my understanding is that it is consistent \nwith recent educational studies, that small class size in the early \nyears has been shown to have significant benefits. You talk about, we \nare spending a lot of money and we do not know whether it is producing \nresults. One thing we seem to know, on the basis of the study, is that \nif we can lower these class sizes, particularly in the early years, we \nare going to get beneficial results.\n  If you ask anyone about the difference between the situation in the \npublic schools and private schools, for which parents pay a lot of \nmoney, the first thing that leaps out at you is small class size. If \nyou ask parents why they are laying out all of this money, one of the \nfirst things they say is, to get a small class size. And these studies \nthat have been done, as I understand it, support the proposition that \nthe small class size will produce significant results, particularly \nwhen directed toward the early years so we can get these young people \nup to standard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. There is only one study which has been considered to \nhave been done in a way that would give you evidence, and that study \ndid come to that conclusion. The other studies were not really worth \ndiscussing.\n  However, again, these decisions were made in a back room, in the wee \nhours of the night; and obviously we would not be considering an \namendment if it had been done well. Furthermore, the great debate, in \nmy mind, of what is more important, reducing the class size from 20 to \n18 or having a teacher teaching the class who knows the subject which \nhe or she is teaching--I will bet you 10 to 1 you get better results by \nimproving the quality of the teacher and the qualifications of the \nteacher than you will by reducing the class size by 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. I \ndo not think anybody would debate that.\n  That is one thing we should consider, the flexibility under the \nbill--and this may come up--as to whether those moneys could not better \nbe used and should not better be left to the discretion of the school \nsystems to use those moneys to improve the proficiency of the teachers \nrather than just merely reducing the class size by 2 or 3 or 4.\n  Certainly if we get to her amendment next week, we will consider \nother options as well. And it may prove to be a productive experience. \nHopefully it will. And I am very pleased to have listened to the \nleaders on both sides, that we can agree to a small number of \namendments which we can consider next week, and move this bill on so \nthat the benefits of the flexibility can be given to the Governors to \nhelp improve education overall; and the local communities will be able \nto do what they feel is necessary to improve that flexibility.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been very active in trying to make \nsure that the local communities have more to say on how their schools \ncan improve. So I think we are moving on a path right now that leads us \nthrough next week being a productive exercise, to have the kind of \nflexibility that the Governors need to help the communities. At the \nsame time we may make some changes that will be beneficial but that do \nnot involve superseding the normal process of the Education Committee \nto bring about some meaningful reform within the Federal structure.\n\n  As I pointed out, there has been no evidence that the huge Federal \nstructure has made any improvement over the last 15 years in our \neducation. We are on our way this year to being the most education-\nminded Congress that we have had in this century. I am hopeful that \nwhen we finish this year we will all be proud of the accomplishments we \nhave made in this country to\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\nget us on a path to making sure we will survive the strong competition \nwe are getting from overseas, unduly impaired by our present \neducational system.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman, I \nhope we are not going to leave any impression here that the growing \nconsensus on the benefit of small classes, particularly in the early \ngrades, is somehow suspect. It is my understanding that consistently \nacross the board students attending smaller classes in the early grades \nhave been found to make more rapid progress than students in larger \nclasses; that these benefits are the greatest for low-achieving \nminority children and low-income children, because smaller classes \nenable the teachers to identify and work effectively with students. In \nmany instances they are able to address the problem early on, which \nprevents its worsening, perhaps to the extent of requiring special \neducation in later years--if you are talking about conserving your \nresources.\n  I understand that Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools \nin Tennessee. Students in small classes performed better than students \nin large classes in each grade from kindergarten through the third \ngrade. Followup studies show that the gains lasted through at least the \neighth grade. The gains were larger for minority students.\n  In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education Program \nis helping to reduce class size in grades K through 3 and in low-income \ncommunities. Students in the smaller classes had significantly greater \nimprovements in reading, math and science tests than students in the \nlarger classes. The most significant achievement gains were among \nAfrican American males.\n  In Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in \ngrades K through 3 have produced a 44-percent increase in reading \nscores and an 18-percent increase in math scores.\n  So the issue which the Senator from Washington and others are trying \nto address is an extremely important issue. It follows on the \ninitiative that was taken by the Congress last year, and I very much \nhope that we will be able to address it in the course of considering \nthis legislation. We ought to put these educational issues before the \nSenate and act upon them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my colleague from Maryland made several \ncomments on the ``Know Your Customer'' amendment we had up for \nconsideration before the Senate.\n  I want to take just a couple of moments to respond. The reason that I \nfelt it was important to bring up the amendment this morning with my \ncolleagues on this side is that I serve on the Banking Committee with \nmy colleague from Maryland, and I made an attempt to bring this issue \nforward in the Banking Committee. It was objected to by the minority \nparty at that time. We also brought up a bill here on the Senate floor \nfor consideration, but again it was objected to by his side. It seemed \nthat the only way we could get this issue considered by the Senate was \nto bring it up at this particular time. It was well within the rules of \nthe Senate, and I thought it was very important that the Senate have an \nopportunity to speak on these rules and regulations before a final \ndecision was made.\n  As to his second comment on the amendment being too broad, I admit \nthat the amendment I introduced in the committee was broad. We wanted \nto do that because we were concerned that the regulators would just \nmake minute changes in the rules and regulations, and then the \nregulations would be back before the American people. After further \nconsideration, the language that was considered here on the Senate \nfloor was narrowed and applied specifically to those rules and \nregulations in the current ``Know Your Customer'' proposal.\n  I just wanted to make those two comments. I also would like to thank \nthe chairman and recognize the chairman's effort in trying to improve \neducation in this country. I want to compliment him on his confidence \nin the States as well as local school boards. That is where a lot of \nthese decisions should be made. I think there is a tendency here in \nWashington to think that we have all the answers, that one shoe size \nshould fit all, and that one regulation should fit all.\n  I am one who feels that local school boards and States really are the \nones that will come up with the innovative changes for education. We \njust need to give them the flexibility to do so. We need to allow them \nto work with parents who really do have a vested interest. We all want \nto see our children get a better education.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for his hard work and diligent \nefforts. We all appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the comments of \nthe Senator from Colorado.\n  First of all, I acknowledge that he is trying to address the problem, \nand I indicated as much when we discussed it in the Banking Committee. \nBut the proposal there and the bill that was originally introduced \nwould, in effect, have eliminated existing regulations addressed to the \nmoney laundering issue.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The amendment----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not the amendment; I will address the amendment. I want \nto talk about the bill and the proposal in the Banking Committee first. \nI think both of those propositions, the proposal in the committee and \nthe bill, went too far, and I think the Senator is prepared to concede \nthey went too far because they would have wiped out existing \nregulations--not just proposed regulations--existing regulations \naddressed to significant cash transactions that we think are tied to \nthe money laundering issue.\n  I don't think the Senator disagrees with that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator will yield, I recognize that the amendment \nI introduced in the committee was broad. We made that adjustment on the \namendment that was voted on this morning.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand that and I indicated earlier that had been \ndone.\n  I only have two observations about that. Yesterday, the Comptroller \nof the Currency in testimony on the House side stated that they \nintended to withdraw the proposals ``promptly.''\n  Now, perhaps the Senator feels that through his communications with \nthe regulators heretofore and the letters he sent--and I have sent a \nletter, and others have sent letters--we weren't able to get sufficient \ncredit for having brought about this change--so we need to come out \nhere and try to get this amendment passed so that we really show that \nwe are the ones who did it and not the regulators who were affected, \nacting in a reasonable manner after reviewing all of the comments that \nhave been received not only from the public but from Members of the \nCongress, as well.\n  Second, I do have some concern about your amendment because it \naddresses not only the proposed regulations, but, as I understand, it \nprecludes them coming forward with any similar regulations that might \nbe greatly narrowed so they get at the money laundering issue.\n  I don't assert that I am an expert on the money laundering issue and \nthat is why the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, is putting a \nstatement in the Record addressing the money laundering question, and \nthe importance of that question and how we try to get at it.\n\n  I think this problem was well on its way to being solved. I \nunderstand the other side is searching desperately for amendments to \noffer in order to try to block this amendment process on educational \nissues. It is my perception that is why this matter came before us \ntoday, in an effort to keep out of the amendment process on the Ed-Flex \nbill, important amendments, which a number of our colleagues wish to \noffer. But the Senator and I share a common view that the regulations \nwent too far, and we have expressed that opinion.\n  I think the initial proposals the Senator from Colorado made went too \nfar in the other direction--and were overly broad. I think this \nproposal has been narrowed down, but I think it still contains within \nit one remaining problem, which I indicated, and that is whether it \nprecludes any opportunity to do something that would be more effective \non the money laundering issue,\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\nwithout creating any of the privacy problems or the overregulation \nproblems that both of us and others have perceived as being contained \nin the proposed regulations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Donna Tanoue,\n     Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Tanoue: On Monday, December 7, 1998, the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the \n     Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision, each published in \n     the Federal Register and solicited public comment on proposed \n     regulations requiring insured depository institutions to \n     develop ``Know Your Customer'' programs. The regulations are \n     intended to enable financial institutions to protect \n     themselves from engaging in transactions designed to \n     facilitate illicit activities and ensure compliance with \n     suspicious activity reporting.\n       The proposed regulations would require depository \n     institutions to amass a large amount of data about customers \n     and to monitor and analyze customers financial behavior. \n     Institutions would be required to determine: a customers' \n     sources of funds for transactions; ``the particular \n     customer's normal and expected transactions involving the \n     bank''; and transactions ``that are inconsistent with normal \n     and expected transaction for that particular customer or for \n     customers in the same or similar categories or classes;'' and \n     to report suspicious transactions.\n       I support implementing focused and effective methods to \n     prevent money laundering and to promote law enforcement \n     purposes, but am concerned that these proposed regulations \n     have unintended negative consequences.\n       The scope of the proposed regulations allows for intrusion \n     into the personal privacy of bank customers by profiling \n     details of customers' lives, activities beyond what may be \n     necessary for the stated regulatory purposes. The proposed \n     regulations also could subject many low- and middle-class \n     citizens who pose little threat of improper activities to \n     such surveillance because there are no threshold limits. The \n     proposed regulations have no minimum transaction size or \n     account size, below which surveillance is not required.\n       While the proposed regulations would required banks to \n     become huge repositories of personal financial data on their \n     customers, there are no Federal limitations on the bank's use \n     of the transaction data it collects. The bank can sell or \n     share such data without a customer's knowledge or consent. \n     This creates the very real possibility of large scale \n     unwanted breaches of customers' personal financial privacy. \n     Polls and newspaper articles have indicated that Americans \n     are very concerned about their personal privacy, particularly \n     their personal financial data. New business affiliations and \n     technology advances are fueling consumer concerns about the \n     mishandling of personal financial information.\n       It is evident that the proposed regulations have aroused \n     widespread public concern. I hope that you will take these \n     concerns into account as you proceed with the rulemaking \n     process and develop policies to satisfy current law \n     enforcement needs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Paul S. Sarbanes,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I voted today in support of the Gramm \namendment which supports my belief that the FDIC's ``Know Your \nCustomer'' regulation should be withdrawn. This vote mirrors my earlier \naction where I had written to FDIC Chairwoman Tanoue asking her to \nwithdrawal the regulation.\n  While I commend FDIC's effort to identify and crack down on illegal \nactivity, I am deeply concerned the ``Know Your Customer'' regulation \nwill threaten the financial privacy of Nebraska customers.\n  When federal regulators consider any regulation like ``Know Your \nCustomer,'' the private relationship between customers and their \nfinancial institutions should be given the utmost consideration. I \nbelieve ``Know Your Own Customer'' would severely strain this \nrelationship. Customers should feel confident that their financial \ntransactions are done in confidence and not subject to uninvited \nsearches. Bankers in Nebraska already report large cash transactions, \nviolations of federal law and potential money laundering activity \nwithout invading the privacy of their customers. ``Know Your Customer'' \nwould require financial officers to infringe on their customers' \nprivacy, damaging public perception of the banking industry.\n  On behalf of the many Nebraskans, customers and bankers, who have \nrelayed similar concerns with me, I am pleased the United States Senate \nhas taken this action. In the meantime, I will remain committed to see \nthat FDIC withdraws the ``Know Your Customer'' regulation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2365-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2365-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2365-S2366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2051.

A bill to provide additional trade benefits to countries that \ncomply with the provisions of the ILO Convention; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             the international child welfare protection act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Kerrey, to introduce legislation that will chart a new United \nStates approach to the terrible problem of child exploitation in \noverseas labor markets.\n  This legislation, the International Child Welfare Protection Act, \nwill target new, additional trade benefits to countries that comply \nwith the provisions of the International Labor Organization's \nConvention Number 138 concerning the Minimum Age for Admission to \nEmployment, also known as the Minimum Age Convention.\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\n  The aim of the Minimum Age Convention is to abolish child labor \nthroughout the world by establishing a minimum age at which children \nmay be employed.\n  Our legislation will do two things:\n  It will give the President the authority to grant a country that \ncomplies with the Minimum Age Convention up to a fifty-percent tariff \nrate cut on items produced in that country that would not otherwise be \neligible for preferential tariff rates.\n  It will also permit the President to waive current limitations on the \namounts of additional goods that countries complying with the Minimum \nAge Convention may export to the United States. If, in the unlikely \nevent the President finds that domestic industries are hurt because of \nthese special, targeted trade benefits, the President also has the \nauthority to suspend, limit, or withdraw the benefits.\n  This legislation is important for three reasons.\n  First, it is a tragic fact that child labor is rampant in many places \nin the world, despite more laws aimed at stopping this inhumane \npractice. International Labor Organization statistics show that between \n100 million and 200 million children worldwide are engaged in providing \ngoods and services. Ninety-five percent of these children, according to \nthe ILO, work in developing countries. Why are children pressed into \nservice as low-paid or un-paid workers? Because, according to the ILO, \nchildren are ``generally less demanding, more obedient, and less likely \nto object to their treatment or conditions of work.'' We must all do \nwhat we can to stop this unconscionable practice.\n  The second reason we need this legislation is because it is clear \nthat regulation and enforcement alone will not work. Incentives are \nneeded as well. The reason that it is so tough to enforce child labor \nstandards is that it is often very difficult to trace specific products \nto specific plants in specific countries. The Department of Labor's \nBureau of International Labor Affairs says that quantifying the extent \nof child labor in a particular country's export industry ``can seldom \nbe done with specificity.'' If you can't even trace the goods or \nservices with certainty, you can't expect enforcement alone to be the \nanswer.\n  Finally, we need this legislation because even though the ILO Minimum \nAge Convention was adopted in 1973, only twenty-one developing country \nmember states out of 173 ILO member states have ratified the Convention \nto stop child labor. Out of the twenty-one developing country member \nstates that have ratified the Convention, none are from Asia, where \nover half of all working children are to be found. If even one \nadditional ILO member state ratifies the Convention because of the \ntrade incentives this legislation offers, we have achieved a great \ndeal.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, earlier this morning, Senator Grassley of \nIowa introduced a bill that I am a cosponsor of called the \nInternational Child Welfare Protection Act. I would like to talk about \nthat piece of legislation and the objective of that legislation.\n  I first became aware of this problem through the efforts of the \njunior Senator from Iowa, Tom Harkin, who came before the Finance \nCommittee earlier this year to describe the need to put in our trade \nauthority language that would have the negotiators negotiating for the \npurpose of reducing the use of child labor worldwide. I support that. I \nbelieve the Finance Committee should, when we mark up the normal trade \nauthority, put that language in. My hope is that this piece of \nlegislation will provide a stimulus to do that.\n  This legislation Senator Grassley and I are introducing says that \neconomic growth is not just about the bottom line; it is about \nimproving human lives.\n  I believe this piece of legislation can help do that, Mr. President, \nby taking an incentive-based approach to encourage developing countries \nto do the right thing on child labor. Instead of threatening them with \naccess to U.S. markets, this bill says we are going to hold out an \nincentive and offer them U.S. markets at a price they currently can't \naccess.\n  Now, the action we ask them to take in exchange is to sign the \nInternational Labor Organization's Convention on Child Labor. That \nconvention states that the minimum age for admission to employment \nshall not be less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling: \neither 14, 15, or 16 years of age. For that agreement, we will provide \npreferential access to the world's largest consumer market for \nadditional products.\n  As I said, I believe this is a good move for the United States to \nmake. I think it does provide incentives, for developing nations \nespecially, to change their own policies toward child labor. But I also \nthink it is important to try to get into our negotiating authority \nlanguage that directs our negotiators to keep child labor in mind and \ntry to negotiate for the purpose of reducing the use of child labor in \nnations with which we trade. There should be a connection between trade \nand growing the middle-class worldwide.\n  Unfortunately, all too often, trade is measured only in terms of the \ndollars that we export and the dollars we import. For me, it is far \nbetter and more likely that we will have public support for good, open \ntrade policies, if we use trade as a means to an objective, not just to \nproduce a better bottom line, not just to produce higher trade numbers, \nbut to increase the standard of living of people in the United States \nand to increase the standard of living of people throughout the world.\n  The single best way for us to assure access for U.S. goods overseas \nis for us to help the middle class grow in other countries. The only \nway to do that is for people to produce and sell goods that other \ncountries want to buy and their own people can afford. It is a very \ndifficult process for developing nations. We went through it in the \nUnited States of America. But for those developing nations to lift \ntheir middle class, they have to open up their markets and subject \ntheir businesses to competition. Otherwise, their standard of living \nwill constantly be depressed as a result of simply saying that we are \nonly going to complete up to the standard of our domestic marketplace.\n\n  When I talk about international trade issues, Mr. President, that is \nthe fundamental truth with which I began. Free trade--reducing tariffs \nboth here and abroad--will help the middle class to grow. And a \nprosperous and growing middle class has a positive effect on the issues \nwe face in trade policy today. Indeed, I argue that it is one of the \nreasons we have struggled to get normal trade authority from the \nPresident. As least as I see it in Nebraska, there is growing \nskepticism that there is a connection between the standard of living of \nthe people who are in the workforce today and the trade policies.\n  Many of my citizens have reached a conclusion that there is a \nnegative connection, and that free trade policies have depressed their \nstandard of living and made it more difficult for them to earn the \nwages they feel they deserve as a consequence of the work they are \ndoing every day. We have many problem in trade policies that make it \ndifficult for us to convince the American people that free trade is \nunquestionably a good thing. The legislation Senator Grassley and I \nhave introduced today says we want to make progress on these issues.\n  The International Labor Organization estimates that more than 250 \nmillion children worldwide between the ages of 5 and 14 are obliged to \nwork either full-time or part-time in developing countries alone. Many \nwork under condition that are debilitating for their physical, moral, \nor emotional well-being.\n  Far too many are employed in the fields, rug factories, and \nelectronic factories that hope to export products to the United States \nof America. What this bill does is go directly to that desire.\n  This bill would immediately cause other countries to say, desire.\n  This bill would immediately cause other countries to say, ``We can \nsell products to the U.S. consumers that we could not sell before. All \nwe have to do is agree to an internationally recognized standard on \nchild labor.''\n  If they sign that agreement today, they gain access to American \nmarkets and American dollars tomorrow. It is an approach that has \nworked for the Europeans. It is an incentive-based, rather than a \npunitive, approach; it is a trade policy that is increasingly \nrecognized as a better way to proceed on some of these very difficult \nissues.\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n  We want children to be the beneficiaries of economic growth, not the \nengines of it. To us, it is evident that it is self-defeating for \neconomic growth to come at the expense of our children.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction, and I hope it represents \nto the people I serve that I am willing, in fact, I look forward to \ncoming to the table on these very difficult and sticky trade issues \nthat have divided us in the past.\n  I hope it is seen, as well, as an important first step--but a first \nstep only--in reducing the terrible consequences of allowing these \nyoung children to be used for labor in these developing countries. It \nis a very important issue that Senator Harkin has worked on for years. \nHe brought it to the attention of the Finance Committee. I believe the \ncommittee is responding in a first-step fashion, and I hope they will \nfollow this action with further changes in the negotiating language \nthat will say to our negotiators: we want you to put child labor at the \ntop of your concerns when you are negotiating trade agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 554. A bill to amend section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 to provide alternative certification procedures for assistance for \nmajor drug producing countries and major drug transit countries; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             the drug certification improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Drug Certification \nImprovement Act of 1999 to strengthen and improve the annual drug \ncertification process of countries which are fully cooperating with the \nUnited States to fight drug trafficking. This bill is based on \nlegislation, S. 457, which I introduced in the 105th Congress.\n  I am concerned that the current system, in place since 1986, no \nlonger works as Congress intended. As we witnessed last Friday, \nFebruary 26th, the administration issued its certification for 1999. \nThis certification penalizes only two countries--Burma and \nAfghanistan--for not fully cooperating with the United States to combat \ndrug trafficking. The administration's certification also granted \nwaivers on national security grounds to four countries--Paraguay, \nHaiti, Cambodia, and Nigeria--so they will continue to receive United \nStates aid.\n  This certification, with only two countries sanctioned, raises \nserious concerns about the viability and effectiveness of the existing \ncertification process and its underlying statutory authority. This \nconcern is reflected in a Washington Post news report of February 27, \n1999, which stated: ``The Administration's relatively forgiving \napproach reflects an effort to lower the profile on the certification \nreviews and thereby reduce the political tensions it has often \ncreated.''\n  Under current law, notice provided to the target country is often too \nlate and not specific enough to address the problems. Congress also \nlacks timely and specific information that would assist in exercising \nits legislative and oversight responsibilities.\n  The existing law also gives a free ride to countries which are \ndecertified but then granted waivers and continue to receive aid \nbecause it is deemed to be in the national interest of the United \nStates. These waivers allow the provision of aid year after year to \ncountries not fully cooperating with the United States. What incentive \ndo these countries have to improve their cooperation?\n  The current certification process is set forth in section 490 of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961. It requires the president to submit to \nCongress by March 1 of each year a list of major illicit drug producing \nand transiting countries which he certifies are fully cooperating with \nthe United States\n  Under existing law, the president has three options: One, certify a \ncountry which has cooperated fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts or has \ntaken adequate steps on its own to comply with the 1988 U.N. anti-drug \ntrafficking convention. Two, decertify a country for not fully \ncooperating. Or three, decertify a country but provide a waiver because \nit is in the national interests of the United States to continue to \nprovide aid.\n  Currently, when a country is decertified, at least 50 percent of U.S. \nbilateral foreign aid is suspended in the current fiscal year. In fact, \nthat country may lose more than 50 percent of its current funding if \nthe State Department has not yet released the aid. Unless the country \nis recertified, all U.S. aid is suspended in subsequent fiscal years. \nAnd, the United States is required to vote against loans in the \nmultilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank.\n  Congress has 30 days from receipt of the President's certification to \nenact a joint resolution disapproving the President's action. If \nCongress passes such a resolution, the President can veto it and \nrequire a two-thirds majority vote in Congress to override the veto. \nCongress also has its prerogative to pass a resolution at other times, \nbut it too would be subject to a presidential veto.\n  The alternative I am proposing today would basically put countries \n``on probation.'' By putting countries on notice that the United States \nhas serious concerns about their lack of cooperation, it would provide \na fair period of time during which those countries could address U.S. \nconcerns.\n  My legislation builds on the existing carrot and stick approach in \nthe certification process. The carrot is certification although for a \nfinite period of time of 7 months. During this ``probationary period,'' \nall U.S. aid continues to flow and the United States remains supportive \nin international development banks. The President also stipulates which \nspecific conditions must be met by that country to improve its \ncooperation with the United States and to continue receiving U.S. aid. \nNot only is sufficient notice provided to the country, but to the \nCongress as well.\n  The stick is a penalty similar to that under existing law. If after 7 \nmonths the country does not comply with the stipulations made by the \nPresident to improve its cooperation with the United States, 100 \npercent of U.S. bilateral aid is cut off. The United States also would \nvote against aid in the multilateral development banks if the country \ndoes not comply with U.S. stipulations, as provided for under current \nlaw. These penalties would remain in effect until the President \nnotifies Congress that the country has complied with the stipulations \nmade in the President's original probationary certification.\n  My bill also provides reasonable notice to Congress. Under this \nalternative, Congress would be informed about those specific concerns \nwhich the President identified regarding a country's lack of \ncooperation. Congress also would be able to track that country's \nprogress during the 7-month probationary period and, of course, \nmaintain its prerogative to pass legislation as it deems necessary. I \nbelieve this would help avoid contentious battles between Congress and \nthe administration which appear to be a main reason for the limited \ncertification we see from the administration this year.\n  It is clear that the existing certification process is flawed. The \nDrug Certification Improvement Act of 1999 provides a new certification \noption to fix the process, and I urge my colleagues to support passage \nof this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 554\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to continue payment of monthly \neducational assistance benefits to veterans enrolled at educational \ninstitutions during periods between terms if the interval between such \nperiods does not exceed eight weeks; to the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs.\n\n\n                        VETERANS' EDUCATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans' \nEducation Benefits Equity Act. A similar bill has already been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by my distinguished Ohio \ncolleague, Congressman Ney.\n  This legislation would fix an unintended oversight in veterans' \neducational benefits. Currently, the law stipulates that qualified \nveterans can receive their monthly educational assistance benefits when \nthey are enrolled at educational institutions during periods between \nterms, if the period does not exceed 4 weeks. This time period was \nestablished to allow enrolled veterans to continue to receive their \nbenefits during the December/January holidays. The problem with the \ncurrent time period is that it only covers veterans enrolled at \neducational institutions on the semester system. Obviously, many \neducational institutions work on the quarter system, which can have a \nvacation period of eight weeks between the first and second quarters \nduring the winter holiday season. Consequently, many veterans unfairly \nlose their benefits during this period because of the institution's \ncourse structures.\n  It is my understanding that some educational institutions which have \na sizable veteran enrollment frequently create a one credit hour course \non military history or a similar topic specifically geared towards \nveterans in order for them to remain enrolled and eligible for their \neducational benefits. Consequently, the cost of extending the current \neligibility period to eight weeks would have a minimal, if not \nnegligible, cost.\n  The Department of Veterans' Administration has recognized the need to \ncorrect this oversight and assisted in the drafting of this legislation \nand fully supports this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense fix and allow all \nveterans to received the uninterrupted educational assistance they \nearned. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nVeterans' Education Benefits Equity Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to establish \nguidelines for the relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction \nof post offices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n         THE POST OFFICE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Post Office \nCommunity Partnership Act of 1999.\n  There has been a great deal of debate lately on the importance of \nletting states and localities make their own decisions. Whether it is \nwith highway funding, the the ``ed flex'' bill, or legislation to allow \nstates more latitude in establishing rural hospitals, there is \nincreasing sentiment that Washington really doesn't know better--states \nand localities should find solutions to the problems they know best. It \nis in the spirit of state and local control that I, along with Senator \nJeffords, introduce legislation to give citizens a say in Postal \nService decisions to open, close, relocate or consolidate post offices.\n  Since its establishment over 200 years ago, with Benjamin Franklin as \nthe first Postmaster General, the United States Postal Service has \nfaithfully delivered the mail to generations of Americans. Across small \ntown America, the post office is still the center of the community, the \nglue that holds towns like Livingston and Red Lodge, Montana together.\n  Unfortunately, Americans all over have suffered as the Postal Service \nopens, closes, or moves post offices without considering the impact \ntheir decision will have on the community.\n  Today, Senator Jeffords and I are introducing legislation to change \nthat. With passage of the Post Office Community Partnership Act, \ndowntown communities will have an increased say in their future. They \nwill have input into Postal Service decisions that affect their \ncommunities, and they will be allowed the chance to offer alternatives \nto Postal Service changes. Under current law, communities have little \nsay when the USPS decides to pull up stakes. Our bill would change that \nby allowing communities to work with the Postal Service in the \ndecision-making process.\n  With the exception of some minor changes, this is the same bill that \nwe introduced last spring, the one that received 76 votes of support \nwhen it was attached to the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill.\n  I was pleased when Senator Jeffords and I received such overwhelming \nsupport for our legislation in the 105th Congress.\n  However, the amendment was stripped when the Senate and House \nreconciled their bills; I was very disappointed that the wishes of \nthree in four senators were ignored in passing the final legislation \nthrough conference committee.\n  That small communities across America are reeling from the effects of \ndowntown post office closings is evidence enough that their voices need \nto be heard, and I am confident that this year we will pass this \nimportant bill. I believe that with mutual cooperation, the interests \nof communities and the Postal Service can be served. The nature--indeed \nthe very name--of this legislation is participation.\n  We will not give up the fight. For the sake of small communities \neverywhere,\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\nI will continue to do my utmost to see that their views are heard and \naccounted for. I am confident that with this bill's passage our \ncommunities and this important American institution may begin a new era \nof cooperation for the good of all involved. And we can put the \ncommunity back in the Postal Service.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join Senator Jeffords and me \nin passing this important legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that my \ncolleague Senator Baucus and I are reintroducing titled the ``Post \nOffice Community Partnership Act of 1999''.\n  Aside from a few technical changes, the bill is similar to the one we \nintroduced in the 105th Congress that was supported by so many of our \ncolleagues in a 76-21 vote last July. Unfortunately our postal language \nwas dropped from the underlying bill during conference with the House. \nHowever, I am hopeful that this year our bill will become law. I should \nadd that this year we have coordinated our efforts with Representative \nBlumenauer of Oregon and an identical companion bill is being put \nforward in both the Senate and the House.\n  Mr. President, I live in a small town in Vermont. I understand the \nimportance downtowns and village centers play in the identity and \nlongevity of communities. Downtowns are the social and economic hearts \nof small communities. They are where neighbors catch up on the news, \nshop, worship, and celebrate national holidays.\n  Our bill will enable the residents of small villages and large towns \nto have a say when the Postal Service decides that their local post \noffice will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. Local post offices \nare important tenants in any vibrant downtown. A recent article in USA \nToday cited a 1993 study that found that 80 percent of the people who \nshopped downtown planned their visit around a visit to the post office.\n  There is much talk in the news today about revitalizing our downtowns \nand encouraging smart growth. I say to my colleagues, if you want to \nencourage smart growth, let's start by doing what we can do to keep \nfederal facilities such as post offices in downtowns.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is necessary. A \nstory from my home state of Vermont will answer that question.\n  A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, \nVermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the \nsmall village center for a new building outside of town. By the time \nthe community was aware of the relocation, plans were so far along--the \nnew building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the \npost office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully \ninvestigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in \ncontrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we \ncertainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more \nto get postal services.''\n  Mr. President, post office closings and relocations are occurring all \nacross the country and especially in small and rural communities. My \ncolleagues will quickly discover similar examples in their own states \nwhere the removal of the post office has harmed the economic vitality \nof the downtown area, deprived citizens without cars of access, and \ncontributed to sprawl.\n  Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are \ncenters of social and business interaction. In communities where post \noffices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become \nintegral to these communities' identities. I believe that this \nlegislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal \nService, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. \nI urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and me in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2370-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 13\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sessions, the name of the Senator from Kentucky \n(Mr. McConnell) was added as a cosponsor of S. 13, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional tax incentives for \neducation.\n\n\n                                 S. 493\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sarbanes, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Robb) was added as a cosponsor of S. 493, a bill to require the \nSecretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to \nevaluate, develop, and implement pilot projects in Maryland, Virginia, \nand North Carolina to address problems associated with toxic \nmicroorganisms in tidal and non-tidal wetlands and waters.\n\n\n                                 S. 508\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n508, a bill to prohibit implementation of ``Know Your Customer'' \nregulations by the Federal banking agencies.\n\n\n                                 S. 528\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the names of the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 528, a bill to provide for a private right of action \nin the case of injury from the importation of certain dumped and \nsubsidized merchandise.\n\n\n                                 S. 543\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Ohio (Mr. \nDeWine) was added as a cosponsor of S. 543, a bill to prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to \nhealth insurance.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  At the request of Mr. Allard the names of the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Gramm) \nwere added as cosponsors of amendment No. 40 proposed to S. 280, a bill \nto provide for education flexibility partnerships.\n  At the request of Mr. Robb his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 40 proposed to S. 280, supra.\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 40 proposed to S. 280, supra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2370-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2370-S2371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 16--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION GUARANTY FEE SHOULD NOT BE \n                INCREASED TO PROVIDE INCREASED REVENUES\n\n  Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Mr. Gorton) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas the Government National Mortgage Association, known \n     as Ginnie Mae, was established as a wholly owned corporation \n     of the United States to facilitate the world-wide sale of \n     investment securities backed by mortgages insured or \n     guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the \n     Veterans Administration (VA), which is now the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs;\n       Whereas Ginnie Mae assesses a fee to lenders issuing such \n     securities and notes for the guaranty, by Ginnie Mae, of the \n     timely payment to investors of principal and interest of the \n     securities and notes;\n       Whereas the guaranty fee currently charged by Ginnie Mae, \n     at a rate of 6 basis points, has produced significant net \n     revenue for the Federal Government each year;\n       Whereas Ginnie Mae is actuarially sound and its reserves \n     are sufficient to protect the taxpayers of the United States \n     from any loss;\n       Whereas the cost of home ownership is increasing, thereby \n     making the dream of home ownership unattainable for many \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas FHA and VA loans are used primarily by first-time \n     and minority homeowners to achieve the dream of home \n     ownership;\n       Whereas Congress should seek to eliminate barriers to \n     affordable housing and reduce the costs of home ownership; \n     and\n       Whereas proposals to increase the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee \n     above the current rate, if enacted, would constitute a tax on \n     home ownership, would increase the costs of owning a home, \n     and would ultimately deny many Americans the opportunity to \n     own a home; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that any \n     increase in the guaranty fee assessed by the Government \n     National Mortgage Association above the rate currently in \n     effect constitutes an unnecessary and unwarranted tax on home \n     ownership that cannot be justified as sound public policy or \n     as necessary for financial soundness of the Government \n     National Mortgage Association and, therefore, should not be \n     used to provide increased revenues for the Federal Government \n     to offset other expenditures.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate Concurrent\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nResolution expressing the sense of the Congress that guaranty fees \ncharged by the Government National Mortgage Association--or Ginnie \nMae--should not be increased as a means of offsetting additional \nFederal spending. I am pleased that my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Gorton, is joining me in submitting this resolution.\n  As the Federal budget process proceeds over the next few months, \nthere will inevitably be attempts to manipulate revenues to fund pet \nprojects. Unfortunately, what Washington calls revenues, Americans call \ntaxes. This resolution serves notice that taxes on American \nhomebuyers--in this case through higher fees on the securities used to \nfund the loans--should not be used to fund general government.\n  I am pleased that a companion resolution--H. Con. Res. 10--has been \nintroduced in the House. I urge my colleagues to join in expressing \ntheir sense that increased taxes on homebuyers to fund general \ngovernment spending are inappropriate, and I invite my colleagues to \nadd their name to this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2371-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2371-S2377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    WELLSTONE AMENDMENTS NOS. 41-42\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto amendment No. 31 proposed by Mr. Jeffords to the bill (S. 280) to \nprovide for education flexibility partnerships; as follows:\n\n                            Amendment No. 41\n\n       On page 3, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       (8)(A) Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 is intended to provide supplementary \n     educational services to low achieving children attending \n     schools with relatively high concentrations of students from \n     low income families.\n       (B) Other than fiscal year 1966, Congress has never passed \n     legislation that provided the maximum funding authorized to \n     carry out such part.\n       (C) The fiscal year 1999 appropriation for such part is \n     less than half of the level required to fund such part of the \n     maximum authorized level.\n       (D) By funding such part at the maximum authorized level, \n     the Federal Government will provide more assistance for \n     disadvantaged children than the Federal Government did for \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       (E) The Senate is committed to funding such part at the \n     maximum authorized level.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n       On page 15, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (F) local and state plans, use of funds, and \n     accountability, under the Carl D.

DEMONSTRATION GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the length of the academic year at most elementary and \n     secondary schools in the United States consists of \n     approximately 175 to 180 academic days, while the length of \n     the academic years at elementary and secondary schools in a \n     majority of the other industrialized countries consists of \n     approximately 190 to 240 academic days;\n       (2) eighth-grade students from the United States have \n     scored lower, on average, in mathematics than students in \n     Japan, France, and Canada;\n       (3) various studies indicate that extending the length of \n     the academic year at elementary and secondary schools results \n     in a significant increase in actual student learning time, \n     even when much of the time in the extended portion of the \n     academic year is used for increased teacher training and \n     increased parent-teacher interaction;\n       (4) in the final 4 years of schooling, students in schools \n     in the United States are required to spend a total of 1,460 \n     hours on core academic subjects, which is less than half of \n     the 3,528 hours so required in Germany, the 3,280 hours so \n     required in France, and the 3,170 hours so required in Japan;\n       (5) American students' lack of formal schooling is not \n     counterbalanced with more homework as only 29 percent of \n     American students report spending at least 2 hours on \n     homework per day compared to half of all European students;\n       (6) extending the length of the academic year at elementary \n     and secondary schools will lessen the need for review, at the \n     beginning of an academic year, of course material covered in \n     the previous academic year; and\n       (7) in 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning \n     recommended that school districts keep schools open longer to \n     meet the needs of children and communities.\n       (b) Demonstration Grants Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Education, from amounts \n     appropriated under subsection (d) for a fiscal year, shall \n     award demonstration grants to local educational agencies to--\n       (A) enable the local educational agencies to extend the \n     length of the school year to 210 days;\n       (B) study the feasibility of an effective methods for \n     extending learning time within or beyond the school day or \n     year, including consultation with other schools or local \n     educational agencies that have designed or implemented \n     extended learning time programs;\n       (C) conduct outreach to and consult with community members, \n     including parents, students, and other stakeholders, such as \n     tribal leaders, to develop a plan to extend learning time \n     within or beyond the school day or year; and\n       (D) research, develop, and implement strategies, including \n     changes in curriculum and instruction, for maximizing the \n     quality and percentage of common core learning time in the \n     school day and extending learning time during or beyond the \n     school day or year.\n       (2) Definition.--In this section, the term ``common core \n     learning time'' means high-quality, engaging instruction in \n     challenging content in the core academic subjects of English, \n     mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and \n     government, economics, arts, history, and geography.\n       (c) Application.--A local educational agency desiring a \n     grant under this section shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary of Education at such time, in such manner, and \n     accompanied by such information as the Secretary may require. \n     Each application shall describe--\n       (1) the activities for which assistance is sought;\n       (2) any study or other information-gathering project for \n     which funds will be used;\n       (3) the strategies and methods the applicant will use to \n     enrich and extend learning time for all students and to \n     maximize the percentage of common core learning time in the \n     school day, such as block scheduling, team teaching, longer \n     school days or years, and extending learning time through new \n     distance-learning technologies.\n       (4) the strategies and methods the applicant will use, \n     including changes in curriculum and instruction, to challenge \n     and engage students and to maximize the productiveness of \n     common core learning time, as well as the total time students \n     spend in school and in school-related enrichment activities;\n       (5) the strategies and methods the applicant intends to \n     employ to provide continuing financial support for the \n     implementation of any extended school day or school year;\n       (6) with respect to any application seeking assistance for \n     activities described in subsection (b)(1)(A), a description \n     of any feasibility or other studies demonstrating the \n     sustainability of a longer school year;\n       (7) the extent of involvement of teachers and other school \n     personnel in investigating, designing, implementing and \n     sustaining the activities assisted under this part;\n       (8) the process to be used for involving parents and other \n     stakeholders in the development and implementation of the \n     activities assistance under this section;\n       (9) any cooperation or collaboration among public housing \n     authorities, libraries, businesses, museums, community-based \n     organizations, and other community groups and organizations \n     to extend engaging, high-quality, standards-based learning \n     time outside of the school day or year, at the school or at \n     some other site;\n       (10) the training and professional development activities \n     that will be offered to teachers and others involved in the \n     activities assisted under this section;\n       (11) the goals and objectives of the activities assisted \n     under this section, including a description of how such \n     activities will assist all students to reach State standards;\n       (12) the methods by which the applicant will assess \n     progress in meeting such goals and objectives;

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n     small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n     progress than students in larger classes, and that these \n     achievement gains persist through at least the elementary \n     grades.\n       ``(2) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for \n     lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One \n     study found that urban fourth-graders in smaller-than-average \n     classes were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their \n     counterparts in larger-than-average classes.\n       ``(3) Teachers in small classes can provide students with \n     more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction \n     and less on other tasks, cover more material effectively, and \n     are better able to work with parents to further their \n     children's education.\n       ``(4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n     more effectively with students who have learning disabilities \n     and, potentially, can reduce those students' need for special \n     education services in the later grades.\n       ``(5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n     actively engaged in learning than their peers in large \n     classes.\n       ``(6) Efforts to improve educational achievement by \n     reducing class sizes in the early grades are likely to be \n     more successful if--\n       ``(A) well-prepared teachers are hired and appropriately \n     assigned to fill additional classroom positions; and\n       ``(B) teachers receive intensive, continuing training in \n     working effectively in smaller classroom settings.\n       ``(7) Several States have begun a serious effort to reduce \n     class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n     may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n     hiring well-prepared teachers.\n       ``(8) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n     providing funding for class-size reductions in grades 1 \n     through 3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers \n     brought into the classroom are well prepared.\n\n     ``SEC. 6603.

Mr. President I rise today as one of the proud \ncosponsors of S. 529, Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act. This \nissue has been at the forefront of reform for American agriculture this \nsession.\n  The language offered today will bring about much-needed changes in \nthe area\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nof risk management for farmers and ranchers. Maintaining an effective \nfarm income safety net is paramount to the survival of agriculture. I \nbelieve an effective crop insurance program will provide farmers and \nranchers greater possibilities for economic sustainability in the \nfuture and help them out of the current financial crisis.\n  A truly effective crop insurance plan involves simply three things: \nprivate insurance, the federal government and the farmer or rancher. \nThe federal government can help facilitate a program to unite the \nproducer and the private insurance company. Privatization with \ngovernment intervention will ultimately put the control in the hands of \nthe agricultural producer. With a risk management plan, bankers are \nalso more likely to finance producers if they have both their commodity \nand their price covered, with a reliable insurance program.\n  This bill will render relief to the inadequacies of the current \nprogram. All agricultural producers are painfully aware of the problems \nwith the current crop insurance program. Unaffordable premiums are the \nprimary stumbling block for producers. In years of depressed market \nprices, crop insurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for \nfarmers and ranchers. Other problems prevalent in the current program \nare inequalities in rating structure and the issue of unfair coverage \ngiven to multiple year disasters.\n  This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide \nthe highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of \nbuy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the unaffordable premiums. It also \nallows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized.\n  This bill also removes the exclusion for livestock in the current \ncrop insurance program. For Montana, which derived $991 million from \nlivestock sales in 1996-97 this exclusion is extremely important. Of \ncourse, the choice will remain up to the livestock producer whether \nthey wish to purchase a policy. It is important however, that they are \ngiven the option. With several years of depressed market prices, \nlivestock producers can no longer remain in business without \nassistance.\n  This bill will also ultimately put more control in the hands of \nactive producers. It restructures the Federal Crop Insurance board of \ndirectors to include two active producers; one in crop insurance, and \none in reinsurance. The board would also include the Under Secretary \nfor Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the Under Secretary for \nRural Development and the Chief Economist of USDA. In addition, it \nmandates that the Board Chairperson be one of the non-governmental \nmembers. These are important steps to ensure that the new program is \nrun for the producers by the producers.\n  A larger step towards private enterprise is the initiation of a \nflexible subsidy pilot program for the private sector to compete on \nrates and delivery expenses. I believe this will ultimately put the \naccountability factor on the companies carrying the policies. Much like \nauto insurance, health or medical insurance, companies will be forced \nto compete for agricultural producers business, in effect lowering \npremiums further.\n  This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance \nprogram into a risk management program, designed to help the producer \nin the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for \nfarmers and ranchers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to \ncontinue to produce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a \nprofitable margin.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senators Roberts and \nKerrey on this important piece of legislation. I will have some \namendments forthcoming, that I believe will make this bill even more \neffective. I believe this bill will pave the way for massive crop \ninsurance reform and help producers out of this economic \ncrisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/05/senate-section/article/S2378-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HUMANITARIAN OF THE YEAR JOHN GINOPOLIS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.
