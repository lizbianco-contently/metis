The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are making progress on this legislation. \nOn our side, we have approximately seven or eight amendments remaining. \nOf course, there could be others offered, but we think we have been \nmoving well on this legislation. I alert my colleagues, Senators Boxer, \nFeinstein, Schumer, Kennedy, Dorgan, Graham, Kerry, Harkin, and \nWellstone, that they should be ready to offer their amendments in the \napproximate order I have read off their names, and we will try to alert \ntheir offices to give them adequate notice to get over here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 10 o'clock be scored \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think it is already in the order, but I would \ncertainly agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The time is equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2827\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Mack-\nHatch amendment that is currently before the Senate. This is an \nimportant issue both as a matter of educational policy and as a matter \nof fairness in tax policy. I congratulate the Senator from Florida for \njoining me in bringing it up as a part of the debate on this bill.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in recent months about the problem \nof the so-called marriage tax penalty. Actually, if we were to be \ntotally accurate, we would talk about the marriage penalties. The \nAmerican Institute of CPAs has found that the Internal Revenue Code \ncontains at least 66 separate\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nprovisions that can cause a marriage penalty--66. Think about it. Many \nof our colleagues may not realize this, but at the same time we were \nsupporting legislation to eliminate marriage penalties, we were busy \ncreating new ones.\n  This brings me to the purpose of our amendment. The bill we are \ndebating today would expand the education savings account Congress \ncreated in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This is a great idea, and I \nfully support it. However, the provision creating the education savings \naccount in 1997 contained a flaw--a marriage penalty. This penalty is \nfound in the fact that the phaseout threshold for married couples found \nin joint returns is less than twice as high as the threshold for single \ntaxpayers.\n  The amendment before us would correct this problem by raising the \nthreshold for married couples from the current level of $150,000 to \n$190,000, which is twice the $95,000 threshold for individuals. It is \nthat simple.\n  Some may argue that this is a trivial matter. Why are we taking up \nthe Senate's valuable time on such a minor change. While to some this \nmay not be the important tax change we should consider if this one \nproblem is viewed by itself, this issue is much larger than that.\n  First, let's start with the obvious. We are debating S. 1134 to \nprovide incentives for American families to save for their children's \neducation: tuition payments, books, tutoring, computers, and other \nthings. The idea, of course, is to benefit children. The goal is to \nfurther their educational opportunities. But without the Mack-Hatch \namendment, we discriminate against some two-parent families who wish to \ntake advantage of an education savings account. In some cases, the \nallowable resources in the account available for their children's \neducation would be greater if mom and dad merely divorced and set up \nseparate accounts. That is not what we want in this country.\n  Second, it is time we raise the consciousness of the Senate about how \nseemingly minor boilerplate provisions in tax bills can eventually harm \ntaxpayers in big ways. I would venture a guess that one of the reasons \nwe have 66 separate marriage penalties built into the Tax Code is that \nCongress simply copied over and over, year after year, the faulty \nlanguage referring to returns filed by single taxpayers and married \ncouples. Once enacted, of course, they spread like a computer virus.\n\n  Later today, I plan to offer another amendment that would correct yet \nanother marriage penalty we created in 1997, this time in the student \nloan interest deduction. I hope my colleagues will support Senator Mack \nand I on behalf of these amendments.\n  These amendments represent a good start on finding and correcting \nsome of these tax inequities that riddle the Internal Revenue Code. I \nam looking forward to working more on this issue when the Finance \nCommittee takes up marriage penalty legislation in the next few weeks. \nI congratulate Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, for \nmaking meaningful relief in this area a high priority.\n  In listening to my constituents talk about the issue of taxes, I \ncontinue to hear one thing over and over again. The No. 1 complaint I \nhear from Utahans even more than that of taxes being too high is that \nof the Internal Revenue Code's complexity and unfairness. In my view, \nfew things in our jumbled up Tax Code are more unfair than the \nprovisions that make taxpayers pay more just because they are married.\n  Let's take this simple first step and eliminate this one marriage \npenalty by adopting this amendment. Then later, when I bring up my \namendment on the student loan interest deduction marriage penalty, \nlet's take on that one as well. Later this spring, we can do even more \nwith the larger marriage penalty bill. We should fix all 66 of these \nmarriage penalties, even if we have to do it one by one.\n  Let's strike a blow for tax fairness. I urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the remarks of Senator Hatch of Utah. I \nbelieve Senator Brownback is here. How much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Brownback and the \nremainder of the time then to the cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank Senator Coverdell and add my voice in support \nof the amendment by Senator Mack and Senator Hatch.\n  The marriage penalty appears in the Tax Code 66 different places. \nThat is a situation where we have a married couple who do not get the \nsame advantages as two people filing individually. Here is another case \nwhere the marriage penalty occurs, and here is another case where we \nare trying to pull it out of the Tax Code. That is why I add my voice \nof support to this amendment by Senator Hatch and by Senator Mack to \neliminate this portion of the marriage penalty that appears in the \neducation IRAs.\n  Annually, there are about 22 million married couples who pay a \npenalty of some sort or another in the Tax Code, for being married. \nThey pay an average of $1,480 more in Federal income taxes than they \nwould if they were single living together. I think it is a bad signal \nthat we send across the country. It is a bad signal in the Tax Code. It \nis one we ought to ferret out wherever we possibly can.\n  This is a good place for us to address this particular issue. Our Tax \nCode is riddled with provisions that penalize America's families. The \nHouse has passed a bill to provide marriage tax penalty relief that is \nseparate and distinct from this particular area of the marriage \npenalty. What they would do is provide marginal rate brackets that are \nfair for the families. They would eliminate the marriage penalty that \nexists in the standard deduction as well. However, even with those \nchanges, which I am hopeful we can pass this year, we still will have \nmore to do to ensure married people are not discriminated against in \nour Tax Code.\n  In fact, our Tax Code penalizes marriage in over 60 different ways, \naccording to the American Association of Certified Public Accountants. \nThis is unacceptable. We must continually work to make our Tax Code \nbetter, to make it fairer for America's families.\n\n  This amendment being offered by my colleagues, Senator Mack and \nSenator Hatch, takes an important step in our Tax Code to end a bias \nagainst marriage. I am hopeful we will pass this amendment on a strong \nbipartisan basis. We will pass more substantive marriage tax penalty \nrelief later this year.\n  As my colleagues have already described, the Hatch-Mack amendment \neliminates the marriage penalty and the reduction in contributions to \neducation and individual retirement accounts. This important provision \nwill remove one of the marriage tax penalties that exists in our Tax \nCode. I believe we must pass this important amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues who are introducing the amendment for allowing \nme this time to speak on the bill and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 2827. This \namendment, cosponsored by Senators Hatch and Murkowski, is very simple \nand straightforward. It eliminates the marriage penalty in the \neducation savings accounts.\n  Married couples should not suffer a tax increase just because they \nare married. The so-called marriage penalties in the Tax Code do just \nthat. Married couples often have to pay higher taxes than the couple \nwould owe if they were single filers. The House has recently addressed \nthis issue in the broader Tax Code, and we will soon do the same. But \nit makes no sense to have marriage penalties built into newer programs \nwe have created, such as the tax-free education savings accounts.\n  Under this amendment, as under the administration's HOPE scholarship \ntax credit and Lifetime Learning credit, the income eligibility for \njoint filers would be double the amount for single filers. People who \nqualify for these accounts when they are single should not lose this \nvaluable opportunity to provide for their children's education just \nbecause they got married.\n  When the Senate first passed education savings accounts in the 1997 \nTaxpayer Relief Act, all Americans\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nwere eligible to use these vehicles to save for their children's \neducation. While that bill was in conference, however, income limits \nwere added to this tax benefit, but these limits injected a marriage \npenalty into this provision. There is absolutely no policy \njustification for a marriage penalty in education tax benefits. This \nshould not be a partisan issue.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the administration's education proposal did \nnot contain a marriage penalty, but the income limits the \nadministration negotiated when the 1997 bill was in conference created \na marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. Now is the time \nfor us to eliminate this marriage penalty.\n  According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, this amendment will \nallow over 2 million households to establish education savings accounts \nfor their children.\n  We should be looking to remove marriage penalties in the Tax Code \ninstead of making them worse. Our amendment will ensure that married \ncouples can save for their children's education on an equal basis, as \nsingle individuals can.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is interesting that on a bill pertaining \nto education, we are talking about how we can help 4 or 5 percent of \nthe people in this country. First of all, I have nothing against people \nmaking $150,000 a year. I think that is wonderful, and I hope they make \neven more money. But the Hatch amendment will allow married couples \nearning between $150,000 and $190,000 to make full contributions to \nESAs and will allow couples with incomes up to $220,000 to make partial \ncontributions.\n  Under current law, the maximum income a married couple can earn for \nan ESA contribution is $150,000. The proponents of this amendment \ndescribe this amendment as a marriage penalty relief. Well, I guess \nfrom one perspective they are right. The ability of the single tax \npayer to make ESA contributions phases out between $95,000 and \n$110,000. For married couples filing jointly, the phaseout range is \n$150,000 to $165,000.\n  The Hatch amendment would make the phaseout range for married couples \ntwice that of single individuals; that is, $190,000, twice $95,000, to \n$220,000, twice the $110,000 previously spoken of.\n  Accordingly, the only beneficiaries of this amendment are married \ncouples filing joint returns earning more than $150,000 but less than \n$220,000 in a year. As I have said before, people making up to $220,000 \na year can make partial contributions.\n  We have yet to obtain an estimate from the Joint Tax Committee. \nNotice, no one has talked about how much this is going to cost. It will \ncost plenty. We do know that families earning $150,000 in income are in \nthe top 5 percent of all American families.

I am not too sure that is \na proper allocation of income.\n  We have limited resources. We can talk about all the surpluses we \nwant, but, as we know, when it comes time to allocating moneys in the \nappropriations process, there are very scarce dollars. There are very \nscarce dollars for public education. As has been established in this \ndebate, the Federal Government contributes 2 percent of its resources \nto public education in America. The Governors were in town from all 50 \nStates crying for more money for all kinds of things, especially \neducation. Of course, we don't want to take the control of education \naway from the local schools, but local schools, as Senator Murray from \nWashington talked about yesterday, a former school board member, need \nto get some financial relief. We should be spending these limited \nresources not on trying to help somebody who makes up to $220,000 a \nyear; we should be getting resources to these schools with tight \nbudgets. We must focus on what we know works, what is going to help \nchildren in school more. Is it this tax relief to 4 or 5 percent of the \nAmerican people or to do something about getting teachers who are \nbetter trained? We need to recruit and monitor high-quality teachers \nand principals. We need to do something about creating smaller classes.\n  With all due respect to the majority, they talk about smaller class \nsize--the Senator from New Hampshire talked about that yesterday. \nCommon sense dictates that if a teacher has 25 or 30 children as \ncompared to 15 children, where is that teacher going to do the better \njob? Of course, it would be with 15 children. We need to have smaller \nclasses and we need to work on having smaller schools because we know \nthat works, too. We need to hold schools accountable for results. This \ntakes resources that local school districts don't have. We need to \nensure that children learn in modern, safe classrooms.\n  Some schools are badly in need of repair. It has been established in \nthe debate we have had over the last few days that the average school \nin America is 42 years old. Well, I am sure those schools need some \nrenovation and repair. We need to expand access to technology. We rush \ndown--Democrats and Republicans--sponsoring and voting for a bill to \ngive these big corporations tax credits for donating computers to \nschools. I think that is wonderful, but we should also be concerned \nabout the many schools that aren't properly equipped to use these \ncomputers. They are not wired properly. They can't be wired properly a \nlot of times because the schools are simply too old. We need to spend \nmoney to ensure universal access to high-quality preschool programs and \nto make college affordable.\n  I hope we all understand what we are here talking about. We are \ntalking about helping kids become better citizens of this country, and \nthe best way is through education. I respectfully submit that helping \npeople making up to $220,000, that is, 4 to 5 percent of the American \npeople, is not the best way to expend our very limited resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I wanted to put some information in the \nRecord. It is unfortunate that all Members did not have the information \nas to what the cost of this amendment would be. It is nowhere near what \nwas implied by my friend who just concluded his comments.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has estimated the amendment will reduce taxes \nby only $7 million over 10 years. That is point one. Point two, the \nreason that is the case is because the individuals who would be \naffected by this already have the option to use prepaid tuition plans.\n  Now, there seems to be agreement with respect to tuition tax plans of \npeople of high income, as Senator Reid indicated a moment ago. We have \nall agreed it was fair to them. Why is it not fair to allow the same \nbenefits to derive to them under the education savings accounts as \nunder the prepaid tuition plan?\n  So, again, the cost is $7 million over 10 years. Roughly 2 million \nfamilies would be affected, not 20 percent of potential families. It is \nnarrowly focused and it is addressing the issue of a marriage penalty; \nthere is no place in our proposal, the education savings plan, for \ndiscriminating against those who are married.\n  I thank the Chair for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment to S. \n1134, the Affordable Education Act.\n  First, my amendment makes this legislation a true tax cut bill for \neducation. My amendment removes all the bill's tax increases. We should \nnot be taxing away with one hand what we return with another in a time \nof Federal budget surplus. Americans should not be taxed again to pay \nfor a national priority.\n  Second, my amendment makes permanent the increase from $500 to $2,000 \nin the annual contribution amount for a kindergarten-to-college \neducation IRA. Without these permanent increases in contribution limits \nand spending flexibility, both would end after the year 2003. My \namendment removes that sunset because I believe that we should not be \nsunsetting our Nation's future, which is the education of our children.\n  Education IRAs are extremely important. Not only does the increase to \n$2,000 I propose make these accounts more attractive to families who \nwant to use them, but to institutions who want to offer them. And even \nmore important than these additional incentives to adults is the one \nthey give to children. As experts have testified, there is something \nspecial about knowing that money is being put away for your future \neducation. It is an incentive to excellence for both today and \ntomorrow.\n  Third, my amendment fixes a trap for the unwary. Currently, a student \nwho takes money from an education IRA is not able to use the HOPE or \nLifetime Learning Credit--even if they are for different education \nexpenses. That is wrong, and it is downright deceptive to families who \nneed both. My amendment allows parents to use both and to use both \npermanently.\n  Finally, my amendment makes the tax-free treatment of employer-\nprovided educational assistance permanent--both undergraduate and \ngraduate. Something as important and necessary as continuing education \nshould not be wrapped up in the uncertainty of frequently needed \nlegislative action.\n  Why is the permanency of my amendment's provisions so important? \nBecause they would allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually \ntoward their child's education--from the day of birth to the first day \nof college.\n  Even that may not seem like a lot but, like a train, it may start \nslowly but it is very powerful. It will gain speed. It is a savings \nexpress to college.\n  By putting their child on the savings express, after 18 years when \nthat child is ready to go to college, the parents will have over \n$65,000. And that just assumes a 6-percent rate of interest--the rate \non a government security. Of course, other investments could yield even \nmore. Parents would have at least $65,000 toward their child's \neducation. Twenty-nine thousand dollars of that would be solely due to \nthe power of compounding interest. And every cent of that $29,000 would \nbe tax-free--it would go straight into education.\n  Maybe that still does not seem like a lot to some folks, but it sure \nseems like a lot to parents who are struggling today to insure college \nfor their children tomorrow.\n  The national average annual cost of college--tuition, room, and \nfees--is roughly $10,000 per year or $40,000 for the cost of college \neducation.\n  My amendment before us today will cover this. It will give parents \nand students peace of mind and a piece of the American dream.\n  My amendment is a powerful incentive to save. It is an engine. It is \nthe engine that can pull a long train of savings--and dreams.\n  Like the ``Little Engine that Could,'' my amendment makes this \nlegislation the ``Education Savings Plan that Will.'' Parents and \nchildren getting on this savings train, will get off at college to a \nbetter future.\n  America has waited for this education savings plan for three long \nyears. This legislation brings it home today. My amendment makes sure \nit stays there for families--not just for today, but for tomorrow and \nall the days that follow. It is time that the President got on board.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in a bipartisan effort to make \neducation affordable for America's families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I could not agree more with the comments \nthat were made by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee \nrelative to the importance of America investing in its future, and \neducation is one of the most fundamental ways in which we are able to \nshape our future, by assuring that our young people are fully prepared \nto meet the challenges of this exciting new century.\n  It was for that reason that I supported this legislation when it was \nreported with a bipartisan vote from the Senate Finance Committee. I \nalso supported it because it recognized another aspect of our \nresponsibility to the future, and that is to act in a fiscally prudent \nmanner, particularly at this rare moment of opportunity we have before \nus today.\n  The U.S. Government had its last surplus in 1969. We then had 30 \nyears of deficit financing. Our national debt went from 1979's little \nbetter than $900 billion to 1999's national debt of almost $5.5 \ntrillion. That is trillion with a T.\n  That is the extent of the profligate fiscal policy in which this \ncountry has engaged for the better part of three decades. But in the \nlast few years, we have started to get seriously committed to not \nasking our children and grandchildren to pay our debts, and the result \nof that has been a dramatic reduction in our annual deficits to the \npoint that now we are, for the first time in over three decades, in a \nsurplus position.\n  We have made a decision--and I hope we will stay faithful to that \ndecision--that we will commit all of the surplus\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\nwhich is generated from Social Security to the reduction in the \nnational debt as the means by which we can make our greatest \ncontribution to the long-term solvency of the Social Security system.\n  Second, we would husband the non-Social Security surplus to use \nagainst a set of yet-to-be-determined national priorities.\n  My concern is that the pattern we are now following--and I am going \nto give a little history of what has happened in the past few months--\nis that we are dissipating that opportunity to use the non-Social \nSecurity surplus against a set of national priorities by an incremental \napproach. A good idea or an appealing idea is presented, and we say: We \nwill buy that, and we will pay for it out of the non-Social Security \nsurplus.\n  Then a few days later another good idea comes along and we say: We \nwould like to buy that, too; we'll pay for it from the non-Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  Do you know what is going to happen? It will not be long before there \nisn't any credit line left in that non-Social Security surplus. We will \nawaken and say: There were some really big things we needed to do. We \nhave a contract out here--a contract between the Federal Government and \nthe people of America for their Social Security.\n  Right now, our ability to meet that contract, even with the \ninvestment we are going to make in reducing the national debt, is very \nuncertain. We should be using some of this non-Social Security surplus \nto help shore up our long-term ability to meet that contractual \nobligation. But because we spent all the non-Social Security surplus on \nthese incremental piece-by-piece, toy-by-toy ideas, we will not have \nany money when we want to give America a big gift, the security of the \nSocial Security system.\n  We also are not going to have any money to do other important things \nfor which we have a contract with the American people, such as to \nassure there will be a health care system for our older citizens. We \nknow the Medicare system, as Social Security, has some very daunting \nchallenges facing it in the next few decades, as the number of eligible \nAmericans for Medicare and Social Security will double. Yet we will not \nhave the resources to make that kind of a commitment.\n  To focus on this specific issue, as I indicated earlier, I voted for \nthis bill when it was reported from the Finance Committee because I \nthought it made good education policy but also because it was paid for. \nWe were not asking future generations to sacrifice the non-Social \nSecurity surplus to pay for this program. We found some means within \nour current spending and taxing policy to generate the resources to pay \nfor this program. We thought this program was important enough to pay \nfor it, not ask our grandchildren to pay for it. I think that is not a \nfailure; that is a statement of the seriousness of our intention.\n  It is a lot easier to buy something somebody else has to pay for than \nto buy something you have to go into your own bank account and write \nthat check to pay for. That is a statement of an important and serious \ncommitment to the objective. We had made that statement of the \nseriousness of this goal by our willingness to pay for it.\n  We are proposing to do two things: One, make it substantially more \nexpensive; and, two, not pay for it.\n  My amendment does a simple thing; that is, it says we should at \nleast, at a minimum, keep in this bill those items that would help to \npay for it, which the Senate Finance Committee, just a matter of a few \nweeks ago, found to be an appropriate method of financing this program.\n  Let me put that simple principle into the context of what we are \ndoing.\n  First, we are making a series of significant fiscal decisions before \nwe have adopted the budget resolution. For those who are new or \nunfamiliar with this process, the Congress, as one of its earliest \nefforts to get a handle on the 30 years of deficits, adopted a complex \nbudget process which has, as its linchpin, a congressionally adopted \nbudget resolution.\n  That resolution would be analogous to an architect's set of plans for \nconstructing a building. It gives the general direction, framework, and \nprioritization of Federal fiscal policy each year. Those priorities \nthen drive the individual appropriations and tax measures which will \nsupport that architectural plan.\n  We have not yet seen the architectural plan for fiscal year 2001 \nwhich will be affected by this measure, and, therefore, we do not know \nwhat within that plan is going to be the provision for tax-and-spending \nmeasures that would support this educational proposal. We do not know \nwhat will be the scale of the non-Social Security surplus.\n  We do know this: The scale of the non-Social Security surplus could \nbe as much as $1 trillion from the high to the low estimate. That \ndepends largely on what is going to be our spending appetite.\n  In the next 10 years, if we spend at the same rate we did in the last \nyear, for the year 2000 fiscal budget, according to CBO, we are going \nto end up with a budget surplus of approximately $838 billion over the \nnext 10 years for the non-Social Security account.\n  If we go back to the budget caps we adopted in 1997--which I \nsupported last year, and for that reason I voted against the omnibus \nappropriations bill--we would have a surplus over the next 10 years of \nabout $1.9 trillion. Those are the two extremes of the resources we \nwill have. Yet before deciding that fundamental question: Are we going \nto be dealing with a surplus of $838 billion or are we going to be \ndealing with a surplus of $1.9 trillion? we are making decisions as to \nhow to distribute the surplus.\n  Second, this is not the first example of that spending.\n  Let me catalog what we have already done.\n  In the Patients' Bill of Rights bill--and today is the start of its \nconference--we have proposed to spend $30 billion over 10 years of non-\nSocial Security surplus in various tax reductions. The bankruptcy \nbill--which has passed both Houses, and which is or soon will be in \nconference--proposes to have tax cuts of $103 billion. The educational \nsavings bill--the bill before us today--with the amendment the Senator \nfrom Delaware has proposed, would have a cost of approximately $13 \nbillion. I use the word ``approximately'' because several of the \nmeasures that are in this bill or may be proposed to the bill have not \nbeen scored by the Congressional Budget Office. The marriage penalty \nbill, which passed the House, has a cost of $182 billion over the next \n10 years.\n  If we were to reject the House approach and adopt the legislation \nwhich has been introduced in the Senate Finance Committee, and which \nwas contained in last year's Taxpayers Refund Act of 1999, that would \nincrease the cost of the marriage penalty to $311 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  The consequence of what we have already done, using the conservative \nlevel on the marriage penalty, is we have already spent approximately \n$328 billion of our $838 billion, 10-year, non-Social Security \nsurplus--before we have adopted a budget resolution, before we have \ndecided how much of the non-Social Security surplus should be used for \npriorities such as strengthening Social Security and assuring its \nsolvency for three generations, before we have made a decision as to \nhow much should be spent on strengthening Medicare and modernizing \nMedicare so it represents the kind of health care program our older \nAmericans deserve, before we have made decisions on what our defense \nbudget should be in order to protect the security of America.\n  All of those things have gone undecided. Yet we have decided to spend \n$328 billion on this collection of tax-and-spending measures before we \nhave an architectural plan. It would be similar to the family who wants \nto build a house, and before they have the architect draw the plans for \nthe house, they decide, ``We will go ahead and put in an attic family \nroom,'' without any context of how that is going to relate to the rest \nof the house. It is always fun to be able to spend your money on those \nthings that are joyful and happy without having to put your mind to the \ntask of deciding what is of greatest importance.\n  My amendment is a very modest one. It proposes to put back into the \nbill exactly the same items which were in the bill when it left the \nSenate Finance Committee. Let me briefly mention what those items are.\n  First is a modification of the foreign tax credit carryover rules. \nThis has a\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\nfinancial impact of $3.6 billion over 10 years. I point out that this \nis not a new idea for the Senate to consider. In fact, the Senate has \nalready passed this bill, first in 1997, as part of the Taxpayer Relief \nAct; in 1998, as part of the IRS restructuring program; in 1998, as \npart of the Parent and Student Savings Act; in 1999, as part of the \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act; and in 1999, as part of work \nincentives. It appears from that record that the Senate has studied, is \naware of, knowledgeable of this tax issue and has decided this would be \nan appropriate measure to use as a partial offset for the educational \nsavings account.\n  The second measure is to limit use of the nonaccrual experience \nmethod of accounting. This would contribute $300 million over the next \n10 years. That proposal was first adopted in 1999 as part of the \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act, passed in 1999 as part of the trade \nbill offset, and passed in 1999 as part of the Work Incentives Act--\nagain, not a novel idea, an idea that the Senate has had repeated \nexposure to and repeatedly has found to be worthy.\n  The third item is the extension of IRS user fees. This would produce \n$278 million over 10 years. This was passed as part of the 1999 \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act and the 1999 work incentives.\n  The fourth item is to allow employers to transfer excess defined \nbenefit assets. That would make a contribution of $156 million. That \nwas included in the 1999 Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act.\n  Finally, with a contribution of $1.2 billion over 10 years, is to \nimpose a limitation on the prefunding of certain employee benefits. \nThis passed the Senate in 1999 as part of the Taxpayer Refund and \nRelief Act and in 1999 as part of the Trade Act offset.\n  These five items aggregate to $5.5 billion over 10 years. These items \nwere part of the package that had the objective of fully funding the \neducational savings account so it would not contribute to any reduction \nin the non-Social Security surplus when this bill passed the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  I do not represent that these items will fund the bill in its current \nform, because the bill has ballooned in cost since it has been on the \nSenate floor. I suggest we ought to first take this modest step of at \nleast retaining the offsets that have already been voted by the Finance \nCommittee and which are in the bill and then, before we take a final \nvote on this legislation, assess what the cost of this total program is \nas amended by the full Senate, and then find an offset to pay for those \nadditional amounts.\n  Failing to do so is to make a statement that we are prepared to spend \nthe non-Social Security surplus without any frame of reference, without \nany budget resolution, without any architectural plan as to what we \nwant to do. That is a prescription to return to the three decades of \ndeficit spending which threatened the fiscal solvency and the economic \nfuture of this Nation. I believe it would be reckless for this \nCongress, having worked so hard to get to a surplus, not to now use \nthis opportunity to make the hard decisions as to what is the priority \nfor the use of this surplus and then to have the discipline to follow \nthat set of priorities.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment which will be a \nsymbolic statement that we are prepared to exercise fiscal discipline \nin times of potential prosperity and plenty, just as we had to exercise \nfiscal discipline during the 1990s in order to remove ourselves from \nthe quagmire of deficits and exploding national debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida has offered an \namendment he claims will offset the cost of this bill by keeping in \nplace its current tax increases. It will not and what's more it should \nnot, even if it did.\n  Senator Graham claims this education savings bill must be paid for. \nLet me say the bill is already paid for. It has been paid for by a \nsurplus in income tax revenues from America's families.\n  According to the Senate Budget Committee, federal revenues, not \ncounting a cent of Social Security's surplus, will be $1.9 trillion \nhigher over the next ten years than this year's level of federal \nspending. That means a $1.9 trillion overpayment by America's income \ntaxpayers. Are we saying that despite a $1.9 trillion overpayment that \nwe cannot afford to let families keep less than one percent of it for \ntheir children's education?\n  Second, leaving these tax increases in this bill will still not pay \nfor it fully. They are simply tax increases then--not offsets.\n  Finally, when Senate Democrats offered their tax relief package last \nJuly, it amounted to $290 billion over ten years. None of this was \noffset. Why now, when the issue is education and the tax relief is just \na fraction of the amount that Senate Democrats supported last year, \nmust we now raise taxes to pay for it? This is simply inconsistent.\n  Perhaps an even better question is: Why must we raise taxes to \nconstitute this offset? Why could those wishing to pay for this, not \nfind the small amount of money necessary from a $1.8 trillion budget? \nTo pay for this from Washington's budget rather than the American \ntaxpayer's?\n  I am sympathetic to the argument of fiscal responsibility. However at \na time of substantial tax overpayment, why should it be so hard to \nallow families to keep some of their own tax overpayment for their \nchildren's education?\n  If we cannot say that when the federal government is running federal \nsurpluses worth, according to our Budget Committee, almost $2 trillion \nover the next ten years; and we are seeking to return less than half a \npercent for education, when can we ever have a reason to cut taxes?\n  The federal tax burden as a percentage of the economy is the largest \nthat it has been since World War II. The federal income tax burden as a \npercentage of the economy is the largest in history. Those are not my \nestimates but the President's. Once again I ask: if we cannot cut taxes \nwhen they are at historically high levels, when can we cut them?\n\n  The tax overpayment is huge, the tax burden is historically high, and \nthe cost of this education provision is small, if we cannot cut taxes \nnow and for education--when and for what can we ever cut them?\n  Sadly, I cannot help but believe that there are some Senators who \nmust think that we can never cut taxes. That taxpayers' money is always \nbetter spent in Washington than by the people who earned it. I am one \nSenator who does not believe this is true.\n  I intend to vote against this amendment to raise taxes. Furthermore, \nI intend to bring more legislation to the floor that will cut taxes--\nnot raise them.\n  I believe that this education legislation is precisely what America's \nincome tax surplus should be used for: America's families.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and reject the Graham amendment \nand keep my proposed permanent tax relief for education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the issue is not whether we believe \ninvestment in education is an important part of America's future; we \nall agree with that. It is not even whether we believe there should be \nsome tax reductions to encourage people to invest in their children's \neducation as well as other desirable goals. Most of us believe in that. \nI certainly do. The question is, How do we have a rational process of \ndeciding how we are going to use the opportunities that are presented \nto us here today?\n  It is interesting to me that as we start the third full century of \nAmerica's national history we might reflect back on what happened at \nthe beginning of the 19th century and the 20th century--the two other \nfull centuries of this Nation's existence. In both of those periods, \nthere seemed to be an energy that came from a new century and the new \nbeginnings that it represented--an energy that was channeled into areas \nthat have had a lasting, positive impact on our Nation.\n  In the beginning of the 19th century, the President of the United \nStates was one of the gentlemen whose bust appears above our Presiding \nOfficer--Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson had the vision to see that \nAmerica's future was not in being a scattering of States along the \nAtlantic but, rather, as a continental empire. And at a time\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nwhen our country was small and struggling, and in some areas of Europe \nderided as a false dream of a democracy, Thomas Jefferson had the \nboldness to commit us to purchase from France the Louisiana Territory \nand fundamentally reshaped America and created the possibility of the \ngreat Nation we are today. That was the vision Thomas Jefferson and his \ncolleagues had for America at the beginning of the 19th century.\n  In the beginning of the 20th century, another man whose bust is close \nto this Chamber, Theodore Roosevelt, was our President. He had a vision \nof an America that would begin to achieve its international goals. The \nPanama Canal was a statement not only of America's great technological \ncapacity but also America's understanding of its role in the world. \nTheodore Roosevelt also understood the importance of investing in this \ncountry. During his Presidency, we added to our national land trust an \namount of land that would be the equivalent of every acre from the \nState of Maine to my State of Florida along the Atlantic coast of \nAmerica. Those were bold visions of the generation of Thomas Jefferson \nand the generation of Theodore Roosevelt.\n  We have the opportunity now, both because of the start of a new \ncentury and a new millennium and because we have paid the price to get \nour national financial house in order, to begin to think boldly of what \nwe want to have history write about what America did at the beginning \nof the 21st century. The concern I express today is that we are \ndissipating that opportunity through a series of incremental, \nuncoordinated, nonprioritized decisions that are going to have the \neffect of continuing to dissipate the resources that could be used to \ndo something as bold as purchasing Louisiana or building the Panama \nCanal.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee said that the Budget Committee \nhas indicated we will have a budget surplus over the next 10 years from \nnon-Social Security funds of almost $2 trillion. Well, I say, let's \nwait until we pass a budget resolution that indicates that is going to \nbe the amount of our budget surplus. As you will recall, we made a \ncommitment in 1997 that we were going to exercise budget discipline and \nabide by budget caps. Those decisions would have caused us, last year, \nto have had a discretionary spending account of approximately $575 \nbillion. In fact, we ended up spending over $620 billion. We crushed \nand we pulverized the budget ceilings that were supposed to be the \nhallmark of fiscal discipline.\n\n  I want to be sure that we are going to declare that our 1999 actions \nwere an aberration rather than the path of future lack of fiscal \ndiscipline before I conclude that we are going to have a nonbudget \nsurplus of $1.9 trillion. We are being asked to take a leap of faith \nthat runs directly counter to what we did a matter of a few weeks ago \nwhen we passed that bloated final appropriations bill--that that was a \nmistake, and that we asked for the repentance of the American people, \nand we are going to go back to the fiscal discipline that would be \nrequired to have a $1.9 trillion non-Social Security surplus, which is \nthe discipline of returning to those 1997 budget caps. I want to see us \nmake that commitment and live up to that commitment before we start \nspending the money. Let's eat our spinach before we start having our \nice cream party.\n  Second, in addition to not having set a budget resolution, which is \nthe architecture of our fiscal policy, we haven't even had a serious \ndebate on what our strategic priorities should be at the beginning of \nthis century, that capability which fiscal discipline would give us. We \nhaven't decided what we are going to do about the fact that, whereas \ntoday there are approximately 40 million Americans on Social Security \nand Medicare, at the end of the next generation we are going to have 80 \nmillion Americans looking to Social Security and Medicare--looking to \nthe solemn contract that exists between the Government of the United \nStates of America and the people of the United States of America to \nprovide them financial and medical security in retirement. I think we \nought to be figuring out how we are going to meet that solemn \nobligation before we do any of these other items--as attractive, \ndesirable, and important as we might think they are. I believe those \nare our first two priorities.\n  I am seriously concerned that the course we are on, which is \nfollowing exactly what we did in 1999, is going to lead us to a \ndissipation of our capacity to set rational priorities, that we will \nbecome the first political leadership of America at the beginning of a \nnew century, and instead of being the giants of Jefferson and Theodore \nRoosevelt, we will be the Pygmies in the toy store trying to fulfill \nour immediate desires and needs without focusing on what is in the best \ninterests of America in this 21st century.\n\n  This vote today is not a giant vote of fiscal policy. I said in my \nconcluding remarks that this does not even purport to fund the bill \nthat is before us, in large part because the bill before us has been \ngrowing almost hourly since it has been on the floor. This amendment \nthe Senator from Delaware offered would be the most gargantuan growth \nof this bill we have experienced since it has been on the floor, an \naddition of approximately $10 billion over 10 years.\n  I do not purport that this amendment will fund fully this bill. I say \nthis amendment is a critical statement of whether we are serious about \nfiscal discipline, whether we are serious about setting a plan for the \nfiscal future of this Nation--at least a plan for the next fiscal year \nbefore we start spending our non-Social Security surplus--and whether \nwe are serious about setting some longer range priorities to meet these \nvery significant legal and moral obligations the American Government \nhas to the American people. That is what this vote is about.\n  Are we willing to take the very minor step of saying that we are \nwilling to strip out of this bill five relatively small tax changes, \nall of which have been passed by this Senate, in most cases on multiple \noccasions, and ask our grandchildren to pay out of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus they will be contributing to over the next 10 years, \nor are we going to step up and say this is the time we will make a \nstatement, a commitment, a pledge for fiscal discipline?\n  It is my strongest wish we in the Senate do not see this as some kind \nof a partisan divide. We were able to contain the deficits and get to \nthe point that we are because we worked together as Americans, not as \nmembers of any particular party or representatives of any region or \ninterest of this country. It is in America's interest that we exercise \nthis fiscal discipline.\n  Today is the day we can make an important statement that we are \nprepared to do so. I urge us not to let this opportunity pass.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is somewhat fascinating to me that this \nweek and today we are being accused of spending too much on education; \nthat we cannot afford to dedicate something close to one-half of 1 \npercent to assure our American families the kind of education they need \nthese days. Yet a few days ago, the legislation was belittled for not \nspending enough. We can't have it both ways.\n  What I think is particularly important to understand is that No. 1, \nno matter is more important to the American family or to this Nation \nthan a well-educated citizenry.\n  I believe what is remarkable about this legislation as modified by my \namendment is it takes a very little amount to accomplish so much.\n  The continuing education of Americans is obviously critically \nimportant because of the continuing technological revolution we are \nenjoying. The new generation is going to be facing the need to continue \ntheir education to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future.\n  I find it very puzzling when we recognize--and the administration, as \nwell, recognizes--that over the next 10 years we will have nearly a $2 \ntrillion surplus, and we cannot take a very small part of that to help \nassure American families of all backgrounds the opportunity to be well-\neducated citizens.\n  I urge my friends and my colleagues to vote against the Graham \namendment, the Senator for whom I have the highest respect.\n  I think this is something for which we should use the surplus. I \nthink there is nothing more important than American education.\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\n  Let me point out once more that American families are paying higher \ntaxes than any time since the end of World War II. Close to 20 or 21 \npercent of gross domestic product is going to Federal taxes. It is my \nsolid belief that it is important we return part of that to the \nAmerican family. One of the most important reasons for returning it is \nto assure they have the resources and are able to send their children \nnot only to the schools of their choice but to college and graduate \neducation as well.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the second-degree \namendment and to support my amendment which would make permanent many \nof the benefits contained in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, wishes to speak on this amendment. It is my understanding \nhe is on his way over.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that the yeas and nays be ordered on \nthe second-degree amendment, No. 2870.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for the yeas and nays on the first-degree amendment, \nNo. 2869.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how is the time managed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will begin by talking about the \nunderlying bill which is entitled the Affordable Education Act. I stand \nin opposition to the bill as it is presented because I don't know who \ncan afford it. Can the citizens of this country afford to have \nresources diverted from the public school system? With all of its \ndeficiencies, it is the underlying educational system that exists \nthroughout the country. The bill will shortchange our public schools \nand provide more than 70 percent of the tax breaks to families in the \ntop 20 percent of the income brackets.\n  I come from the State of New Jersey. As everyone knows, New Jersey is \nthe most densely populated State in the country. We are essentially an \nurbanized State. We do have some suburbs; we have very little by way of \nrural population.\n  When we say we are going to provide our citizens with an ``option,'' \nthe option is more or less to abandon the public school systems, \nparticularly in our urban centers which are struggling to make ends \nmeet and struggling to educate our children.\n  I was born in the city of Paterson, NJ. It is highly industrialized. \nInitially its growth was from textile production, textile \nmanufacturing. My father and grandfather worked in those mills. I visit \nthe city of my birth quite often. It is a very low-income city, as is \nNewark, our largest city in New Jersey, as is Jersey City, another of \nour large cities in New Jersey--small in comparison with other States, \nwhere one city can be 10 or 20 percent of the population. We don't have \nthat. We have lots of cities.\n  They struggle, and we are often disappointed in the SAT scores. We \nlook beyond the SAT scores and we see young people who can learn and \naccomplish things and get through the maze and make something of their \nlives despite the inconveniences that often come with insufficient \nphysical structure in the schools, schools with instructors who do not \nhave the appropriate teacher training, and schools that do not have \nsufficient revenues to make the needed investments.\n  I, personally, since I come out of the computer business, have been \ninvolved with some of our schools. I picked Patterson, NJ, in \nparticular and tried to make a financial as well as a physical \ncontribution, pulling wires into some of the schools so they could have \nsome connection to the Internet--not fully, not sufficient for all the \nstudents, but we are living almost on spare change in cities such as \nthat. We have to figure out a way to improve those educational \nstandards.\n  By permitting people to avoid going to those schools, those few who \nhave enough income to go elsewhere, we are not going to help the basic \neducational system that has done so well in this country. Before \nprivate schools became as interesting as they are now, public schools \nproduced the talent and the brilliance and the leadership this country \nhas seen. We put up a sign that says: Abandon the schools if you can \nafford it, abandon the public school system; get out of town if you \ncan.\n  We made mistakes in our planning over the years. One of the most \nobvious is, although we did something very positive by building our \nNational Highway System--it was begun in the 1950s--it had an \nunanticipated consequence and that was to encourage abandonment of the \ncities. Move out of town, get some nice space--and I don't blame people \nfor wanting to do that--and leave the problems behind. As a \nconsequence, the average income of the people who inhabit the cities \nhas gone down substantially; the tax base has gone down substantially, \nand the revenues are just not there.\n  So, as that happened, as people had less loyalty to the cities, they \nalso wanted different school options. Now what we are seeing is, with \nthese tax breaks for people who can afford to send their kids to \nprivate schools, that they, too, will abandon their interest. It will \nalso cost the country, by my calculation, somewhere close to $15 \nbillion over the next 10 years, possibly even more. That is significant \nwhen we are trying to pay down the debt, trying to find ways to provide \nprescription drugs for people who need them, when we are trying to find \nother ways to improve the educational system altogether. Now we are \nsaying the plan in this act is to have the revenue losses offset by \nother opportunities. Adding insult to injury, our distinguished friend, \nSenator Roth, has offered an amendment that would eliminate the \nrevenue-raising portions of the bill and seek to spend surplus funds \nfor the tax breaks in the legislation.\n  To use an expression: That compounds the problem. Before we start \nspending projected surpluses that may or may not exist, we ought at \nleast understand how large those surpluses are likely to be and have an \noverall plan for using them. Otherwise, before we know it, we will have \nfrittered away the surpluses and used up funds that will be needed for \nhigher priorities.\n\n  In particular, I am concerned we reserve enough of the surpluses to \nensure we can protect Social Security, extend the life of Medicare, \nmake sure we consider the prescription drug program, give targeted tax \nbreaks, and pay down the debt. The American people salute that. They \nknow when you are in debt it is never easy to plan ahead. Boy, we would \nset one incredible example if we could get our debt paid down by 2013, \nwhich is the objective of the President's plan. I also think we ought \nto make sure we protect those surpluses for other needs that will be \ndiscussed in our upcoming budget debate, which I hope will commence \nvery shortly.\n  In my view, those priorities I discussed are more important than \nsubsidizing private schools for a relatively small number of families. \nBut even if you support the goals of this bill, I hope my colleagues \nwill agree that, at a minimum, we ought to have in front of us a plan \nfor using the surpluses before we start spending them. That makes \nsense. Not many people make expenditures without knowing what their \npaycheck is going to be. That is why we have a budget resolution. That \nis why we have a budget process.\n  I am the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee and the chairman of \nthe committee, someone widely respected, is Senator Domenici. While we\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\nhave our differences, there is a process at play, and we want to see it \nworked out before we start making expenditures from surpluses we are \nnot even sure of arriving or what the amount of those surpluses is \ngoing to be.\n  The Budget Committee has not begun to mark up the budget resolution. \nWe still have some time to meet our deadline, so it is premature to be \nconsidering a bill such as this. Before we start handing out scarce \nprivate resources to public-subsidized private schools for a few \nfamilies, let's adopt a plan to protect Social Security, protect \nMedicare. Let's provide prescription drugs for our seniors. Let's make \nsure we are on a path toward eliminating our publicly held debt.\n  I also point out there is a technical flaw in this amendment. By \neliminating the revenue-raising provisions of the bill, this amendment \nwould trigger an across-the-board cut that we know as a sequester. Such \na cut would be required under the Budget Act. The end result is it \nwould force a cut in Medicare, veterans' benefits, farm aid, child \nsupport enforcement and foster care, among other programs. I do not \nthink that is the intent of the sponsors. I think the point of this \namendment is to spend future projected surpluses. But its actual \neffect, unless corrected, would be to cut programs such as Medicare and \nothers. Either way, I think it would be a mistake to support this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. Let's adopt a budget \nresolution before we start squandering projected budget surpluses. \nLet's make sure we can protect Social Security and Medicare before we \nstart raising these funds. And let's not adopt an amendment that \nperhaps would unintentionally require real and immediate cuts in \nMedicare, veterans' benefits, and other programs.\n  While I urge defeat for this amendment, I do not want it \nmisunderstood. I do not want it to ensure the passage of the underlying \nbill, which is to give those tax benefits to people at the upper end of \nthe income scale and help abandon our schools, as opposed to facing up \nto our problems and working on the public school system; just help \npeople walk away from it. I don't think that is a good way to solve \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold for a second, I think on the \npending amendment, the second-degree amendment, we should yield back \nthe time on that?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. We are pleased to yield back the remainder of time on \nboth the first- and second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. I also say the two leaders want to schedule a vote at some \nlater time. So with the permission of the majority, we will go to \nanother amendment.\n  I would say the order of business is to go to the Boxer amendment.\n  We have submitted to the majority the Boxer amendment. They indicated \nthey want some time to look at it. It deals with a very important \nsubject, and that is the safety of our children in schools.\n  We hope we can get to that debate as soon as possible. While they are \nlooking at that amendment, the Senator from North Dakota has an \namendment he desires to offer at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside to \nallow the Senator from North Dakota to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2871\n\n  (Purpose: To provide parents, taxpayers, and educators with useful, \n                  understandable school report cards)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. It is an \namendment that has been duly noticed under the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2871.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2 between lines 2 and 3, add the following:\n\n              TITLE ____--STANDARDIZED SCHOOL REPORT CARDS\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Standardized School Report \n     Card Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the report ``Quality Counts 99'', by \n     Education Week, 36 States require the publishing of annual \n     report cards on individual schools, but the content of the \n     report cards varies widely.\n       (2) The content of most of the report cards described in \n     paragraph (1) does not provide parents with the information \n     the parents need to measure how their school or State is \n     doing compared with other schools and States.\n       (3) Ninety percent of taxpayers believe that published \n     information about individual schools would motivate educators \n     to work harder to improve the schools' performance.\n       (4) More than 60 percent of parents and 70 percent of \n     taxpayers have not seen an individual report card for their \n     area school.\n       (5) Dissemination of understandable information about \n     schools can be an important tool for parents and taxpayers to \n     measure the quality of the schools and to hold the schools \n     accountable for improving performance.\n\n     SEC. ____03. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide parents, taxpayers, \n     and educators with useful, understandable school report \n     cards.\n\n     SEC. ____04. REPORT CARDS.\n\n       (a) State Report Cards.--Each State educational agency \n     receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 shall produce and widely disseminate an \n     annual report card for parents, the general public, teachers \n     and the Secretary of Education, in easily understandable \n     language, with respect to elementary and secondary education \n     in the State. The report card shall contain information \n     regarding--\n       (1) student performance in language arts and mathematics, \n     plus any other subject areas in which the State requires \n     assessments, including comparisons with students from \n     different school districts within the State, and, to the \n     extent possible, comparisons with students throughout the \n     Nation;\n       (2) attendance and graduation rates;\n       (3) professional qualifications of teachers in the State, \n     the number of teachers teaching out of field, and the number \n     of teachers with emergency certification;\n       (4) average class size in the State;\n       (5) school safety, including the safety of school \n     facilities, incidents of school violence and drug and alcohol \n     abuse, and the number of instances in which a student was \n     determined to have brought a firearm to school under the \n     State law described in the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994;\n       (6) to the extent practicable, parental involvement, as \n     measured by the extent of parental participation in school \n     parental involvement policies described in section 1118(b) of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (7) the annual school dropout rate, as calculated by \n     procedures conforming with the National Center for Education \n     Statistics Common Core of Data;\n       (8) student access to technology, including the number of \n     computers for educational purposes, the number of computers \n     per classroom, and the number of computers connected to the \n     Internet; and\n       (9) other indicators of school performance and quality.\n       (b) School Report Cards.--Each school receiving assistance \n     under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or \n     the local educational agency serving that school, shall \n     produce and widely disseminate an annual report card for \n     parents, the general public, teachers and the State \n     educational agency, in easily understandable language, with \n     respect to elementary or secondary education, as appropriate, \n     in the school. The report card shall contain information \n     regarding--\n       (1) student performance in the school in language arts and \n     mathematics, plus any other subject areas in which the State \n     requires assessments, including comparisons with other \n     students within the school district, in the State, and, to \n     the extent possible, in the Nation;\n       (2) attendance and graduation rates;\n       (3) professional qualifications of the school's teachers, \n     the number of teachers teaching out of field, and the number \n     of teachers with emergency certification;\n       (4) average class size in the school;\n       (5) school safety, including the safety of the school \n     facility, incidents of school violence and drug and alcohol \n     abuse, and the number of instances in which a student was \n     determined to have brought a firearm to school under the \n     State law described in the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994;\n       (6) parental involvement, as measured by the extent of \n     parental participation in school parental involvement \n     policies described in section 1118(b) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (7) the annual school dropout rate, as calculated by \n     procedures conforming with the National Center for Education \n     Statistics Common Core of Data;\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n       (8) student access to technology, including the number of \n     computers for educational purposes, the number of computers \n     per classroom, and the number of computers connected to the \n     Internet; and\n       (9) other indicators of school performance and quality.\n       (c) Model School Report Cards.--The Secretary of Education \n     shall use funds made available to the Office of Educational \n     Research and Improvement to develop a model school report \n     card for dissemination, upon request, to a school, local \n     educational agency, or State educational agency.\n       (d) Disaggregation of Data.--Each State educational agency \n     or school producing an annual report card under this section \n     shall disaggregate the student performance data reported \n     under section ____4(a)(1) or ____4(b)(1), as appropriate, in \n     the same manner as results are disaggregated under section \n     1111(b)(3)(I) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today deals with a \nstandardized school report card. I want to describe that, but first, I \nwill talk generally about this issue of education and about the debates \nwe have had in recent hours and days in this Chamber.\n  I talked about the schools I have visited recently in North Dakota. I \nhad a meeting yesterday in Washington, DC, with some people from the \nOjibwa School on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in North \nDakota.\n  I want to describe it because we are talking today about how to spend \nmoney to improve this country's education system. Some say: Let's \nprovide it in the form of tax credits for education savings accounts \nthat will allow parents to accrue money to send their kids to this \nschool or that school.\n  There is another way to handle it, and that is to make investments in \nour schools so children are walking into school buildings that are \nwell-equipped and in good condition, repaired and renovated, and they \nare going into school classrooms where they have quality teachers and \nthe classrooms are not crowded. That is another way to improve our \ncountry's schools.\n  Because I just had a meeting yesterday with the folks from the Turtle \nMountain Indian Reservation about the Ojibwa School, a school I have \nvisited many times, I will read a couple of comments from eighth grade \nstudents so Members of the Senate, as they discuss these issues, will \nunderstand what eighth graders are saying about their school. I can \nverify everything they say in these letters is true, and in some cases, \nworse.\n  This is Cathy Renault. Cathy says:\n\n       In the 2 * * * short years I've been at Ojibwa, I have had \n     to go home during the day very often.\n\n  This is an eighth grader.\n\n       It isn't because of sickness or being checked out or \n     because a teacher or substitute weren't available. No, it's \n     because of very threatening subjects, things you wouldn't \n     find at other schools: Sewer backup, mold growing in \n     buildings, heat that's too hot in the summer and too cold in \n     the winter; harsh weather and having to walk from building to \n     building just to go to lunch.\n\n  This is an eighth grade kid. The Ojibwa School is in mobile \nbuildings, small buildings on a hill where young children are moving \nback and forth. By the way, the fire escapes are made of wood. Figure \nthat one out. There are all kinds of problems with this school.\n  Does this eighth grade child get the same education as another child \nwhere they have less crowding and better facilities? The answer is no.\n  Leslie Champagne is another eighth grade student. This is what she \nsays:\n\n       Last year our seventh grade teacher slipped and broke a \n     part of her foot and at the same time the other seventh grade \n     teacher had a cast on and had to step in all of the mold and \n     dirty water on the floor. There has been a lot of elders--\n\n  Again, this is on an Indian reservation--\n\n       There has been a lot of elders and children falling down \n     outside and getting seriously hurt walking to another \n     building.\n\n  Again, they are mobile buildings, like a double-wide trailer, sitting \non the side of a hill on the Indian reservation at Turtle Mountain.\n\n       There are even roofs caving in and leaking because of heavy \n     rain or snow. I haven't seen anything new in this school \n     for a long time. The only time I've seen something new is \n     just this year when we got a more decent gymnasium.\n\n  From Belcourt, ND, Shelly Selina Davis:\n\n       . . . we don't have shower systems that work properly. \n     After physical education class, we are not able to take a \n     shower and are forced to go through the rest of the school \n     day feeling our hygiene is unhealthy.\n       Last year and one time this year, the whole school had to \n     eat lunch in their classrooms or office, because there was a \n     sewage problem in the kitchen and it made the whole cafeteria \n     smell very badly.\n       Each year, during the winter, there are many students who \n     become ill and miss many school days because of their \n     sickness. The students became ill from having to walk from \n     building to building in the very cold winter weather.\n\n  These are grade-school students saying kids do not get to make the \ndecision if they want to be poisoned by a poor sewer system or mold. \nKids should be worrying about how they are going to do on a big test, \nnot whether the building is going to collapse. A new school is \nsomething we need and have wanted for a long time. This is an eighth \ngrade kid imploring that they need help.\n  Yesterday, I talked about the Cannonball School. It is no different \nthan this school. Part of the Cannonball School is 90 years old and has \nbeen condemned as a fire hazard. The second level of the school is \nunusable because the stairs leading up to it are unsafe and the school \ncannot afford to replace the steps. The sewer and the water systems are \nold, and they back up regularly, sending the smell of sewage gas \nthroughout the school. Classes routinely have to be moved because of \nthe smell of sewage gas becoming so bad in classrooms. One wing of the \nschool does not have running water. There are 150, 160 kids and two \nbathrooms, one water fountain. They are packed in 8-foot-by-12-foot \nclassrooms with desks so close they almost bump each other. They do not \nhave to worry about whether or not they have computers; they would not \nhave a place to put them. Of course, they could not hook them up anyway \nin a school in that condition because they do not have the capability \nto wire the computers.\n  I have said before that when Little Rosy Two Bears asked me the day I \nvisited that school--and I have done it a couple of times--``Mr. \nSenator, are you going to build me a new school?'' the answer is I \ncannot build her a new school. This is a public school with a public \nschool district and no tax base. We have mice running around, mold \ngrowing, sewer gas coming up, kids crowded into classrooms, and that \nlittle third grader walking through that classroom door is not getting \nthe same kind of education other kids are getting, and we ought to do \nsomething about that.\n  We know about the value of education. This is not rocket science. The \nway to solve this is not to give tax breaks to folks. The way to solve \nthis is to decide we are going to renovate, improve, and rebuild these \nschools that are falling down. The Ojibwa folks need a new school, and \nthey need it now. Cannonball School needs to be replaced and replaced \nnow. If we care about kids all across this country who are going to \nschool under those conditions, we will do something about it. We will \nnot talk about it, we will do something about it.\n  My father left school at age 9. His mother died giving birth to a \nyounger sibling. His father was institutionalized for tuberculosis. My \nfather quit school in order to go to work and raise money. My father \nworked all through his youth, so he had almost no education. Then my \nfather, in his fifties, one day came home and announced to us, when all \nthe family was together, with a smile, that he had just passed his GED. \nHe never even told us he was studying for it. He did not tell us he was \ngoing to take it, but in his fifties, he decided he wanted to become a \nhigh school graduate because he never had the opportunity. He had to \nquit school when his mother died, and he had to help provide for his \nbrothers and sisters. Then at age 50, with a smile on his face, he told \nus he was now a high school graduate.\n  We understand how much people care about education. I guess it is one \nof the reasons my father and mother always impressed upon us that \neducation was paramount, you must invest in yourself.\n  Ben Franklin once said: Anyone who empties their purse in their head \nwill never be without riches.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said: Anyone who believes a country can be both \nignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can \nbe. We understand the value of education. That is why we are debating \nit now.\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\n But we are debating it in circumstances where I fear we will come out \nwith a wrong result.\n\n  One piece of a series of steps that makes sense to me is to provide \nfor a standardized school report card so parents will understand what \nthey are getting out of that school system. All parents get a report \ncard on how their child is doing every 6 weeks, every 9 weeks. They get \na report card on how their child is doing. But no parents get a report \non how their school is doing. How is their school doing in educating \nchildren as compared to other schools in other school districts, in \nother States, in other communities?\n  It seems to me, there ought to be some standardized way for parents \nto understand: How is this school doing? We spend $350 billion a year \non elementary and secondary education and have no earthly idea how our \nindividual schools are doing for our children. Could we do that? We \ncould have a basis for a comparison of our schools with other schools--\nour schools with other schools in the school district, between school \ndistricts, between communities, and between States.\n  Some will say there already is a school report card. Most parents \nhave never seen it. Thirty-some States have some version of a school \nreport card, but most of them provide very little information, if any \nat all.\n  I believe there are about eight standard things we ought to require \nthe State education authorities to provide on this school report card. \nIf we did that, every parent in this country--as a taxpayer and a proud \nparent--would understand what the school is producing for their \nchildren.\n  I say this, if we get to this kind of approach of providing a \nstandardized school report card on how the school is doing--not only \nhow the kids are doing but how the school is doing--we will only be \nable to say, as parents, this school is doing fine if we are willing to \naccept our responsibility to schools, such as the Ojibwa School and the \nCannonball School, and to rebuild, renovate, and repair schools that we \nare sending children to that are not up to standards for educational \npurposes.\n  In conclusion, there are two principal issues we have fought for on \nthe floor of this Senate--so far unsuccessfully. One issue is having a \nsmaller class size, because we know that with 15 or 18 kids in a \nclassroom there is a better relationship between teacher and students, \nand education is much more effective than if a teacher is teaching in a \nclassroom with 30 or 35 students. We need more teachers to reduce class \nsizes.\n  The second issue is that we also want to improve and renovate schools \nthat are in the condition I have just described that exist in \nCannonball and Ojibwa that ought not to exist. It is not going to be \nsolved by some scheme of giving tax cuts.\n  For every national ache or pain, we have someone who trots to the \nfloor of the Senate and says: I have a new idea. Let's provide a tax \ncut. That is not a new idea. That is a substitute for what we ought to \ndo to fix real problems in education. Every time someone suggests \nanything that describes some kind of national aspiration or goal, \nsomeone else pops up and says: Oh, so you want some Federal bureaucrat \nto run the education system? The answer to that is no, of course not. \nBut let's not brag about having no national goals or no aspirations \nnationally as a country for our education system. Let's stop bragging \nabout that. That ought to be a source of despair.\n  We, as a country, ought to have national goals of what we want to \nproduce in our education system. If we develop those goals, then we \nwill also accept our responsibility to improve our schools, invest in \nour schools, renovate, repair, and rebuild our schools, and reduce \nclass size. We know that works. We know how to do it, if we have enough \npeople who will stand up in the Senate and cast the right votes.\n  I will not seek a vote at this point. My understanding is that my \namendment will be set aside and dealt with at a later time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the managers have been working to try \nto get some parameters on these amendments. Let me propound a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent the following amendments be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order, limited to 30 minutes \nequally divided, except where noted differently, to be equally divided, \nand all amendments subject to relevant second degrees, under a 20-\nminute time constraint, and following the disposition of these \namendments the bill be immediately advanced to third reading, and \npassage occur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  Those amendments are: a Schumer amendment; a Feinstein amendment on \nstandards, 1 hour, equally divided; a Kennedy amendment, 90 minutes, \nequally divided, on teacher quality; a Kerry amendment on quality; a \nBoxer amendment on safety and protection in schools, 90 minutes, \nequally divided; a Wellstone amendment regarding school counselors, 90 \nminutes, equally divided; a Dorgan amendment regarding school report \ncards--which we have just considered--a Coverdell amendment; a Reid \namendment; a Kennedy amendment regarding Pell grants; a managers' \namendment; a Gramm amendment regarding the Federal Home Loan Board; a \nHatch amendment regarding student loan interest; a Graham of Florida \namendment, No. 2848, regarding school construction; and a Graham \namendment regarding offsets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we want to make sure if, in fact, there are \nrelevant second-degree amendments, that will be fine--it is under a 20-\nminute unanimous consent agreement.\n  I also note that under the unanimous consent request dealing with the \nWellstone amendment, he would have 45 minutes of the hour.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We changed it. It is 90 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Furthermore, the Harkin amendment has been deleted. \nDid you note that?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I do not have it.\n  Mr. REID. It was deleted. The only addition would be another Boxer \namendment dealing with pesticides. She asks for 20 minutes on that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Equally divided.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Did you add a Harkin amendment?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We have eliminated the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. REID. But as a result of a note handed to me, we add a Senator \nBingaman amendment dealing with teachers, for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thirty minutes?\n  Mr. REID. For him.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That would be an hour equally divided.\n  I assume the one on pesticides is education related?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--I \nsimply want to understand. I have been waiting since last night to \noffer an amendment on safety in schools related to gun violence. \nOriginally, I was told I would have the first Democratic amendment up \ntoday. There was some objection on the other side. I wonder if I could \nget some idea from the other side of the aisle, if not from my own \nside--Senator Reid has been trying to give me assurances of time--when \nI could finally get to offer that amendment.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from California, who has been here \nsince yesterday, Senator Kennedy has been doing many things today. With \nthe permission of the majority--which we have already obtained--Senator \nKennedy is going to offer his amendment next. We would hope, following \nthat, we would be able to go to the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, I say to my friends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Will the Senator from Massachusetts renew his amendment request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Has the pending amendment been temporarily set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2872\n\n(Purpose: To establish programs to enable States and local educational \n       agencies to place a qualified teacher in every classroom)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2872.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The text \nof the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have a time limitation on \nthis of 45 minutes a side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 90 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The Teacher Quality amendment would strike the underlying Coverdell \nK-through-12 tax breaks and authorize $2 billion for the Qualified \nTeacher in Every Classroom Act. The amendment would direct the $1.2 \nbillion from the Coverdell bill to the teacher quality program, and the \nother would consist of an authorization for appropriations at a later \ntime.\n  We have had a debate about the Coverdell tax bill over the last few \ndays. One of the things we are asking the Senate to consider is whether \nwe ought to be putting the $1.2 billion equally between the public and \nprivate schools, even though 90 percent of the children in this country \ngo to public schools, or whether we can use those resources more \neffectively.\n  I believe they can be used more effectively. That is what this \namendment is about. As an alternative to the Coverdell tax bill, I \noffer this amendment on behalf of my colleagues to say let us move our \nNation forward to insist that we are going to have a well-qualified \nteacher in every classroom--that the key to enhancing academic \nachievement and accomplishment is not going to be subject to just any \none single or simple solution but certainly among a handful of \nsolutions. I suggest perhaps the most important one is to make sure \nthat a teacher, who is before the 50 million children who are going \nthrough K through 12, is going to be well qualified to teach \neffectively with regard to the academic subject in which the teacher \nteaches. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  It is reasonable to ask, where did you come up with these various \nproposals that you have in this qualified teacher amendment? I refer my \ncolleagues to a very important study from 1996, the National Commission \non Teaching and America's Future in Education. The board itself is made \nup of some of the most distinguished educators and is bipartisan in \nnature.\n  We have effectively incorporated in our amendment the series of \nrecommendations this panel virtually unanimously recommended including: \nhow to recruit individuals who will be the best for the students in \nthis country; how we will maintain them by the development of mentoring \nprograms; how we will ensure professional development and; how to \nutilize and expand some of the imaginative and creative efforts to \ndevelop teachers, including hometown teachers, which are developed \nwithin various constituencies, and expanding Troops to Teachers, which \ncurrently has 3,600 teachers nationwide.\n  What did this panel, made up of some of our best educators and most \nthoughtful teachers in the country, conclude virtually unanimously? \nThis commission starts with three simple premises: First, what teachers \nknow and can do is the most important influence on what students learn; \nsecond, recruiting, preparing and retaining good teachers is the \ncentral strategy for improving our schools; and, third, school reform \ncannot succeed unless it focuses on creating the conditions in which \nteachers can teach--and teach well.\n  Those are the principles. I wonder how anyone in this body could \nquestion those rather basic, common sense principles, a well-qualified \nteacher in every classroom. This study has indicated how that best can \nbe done, and we have followed these various recommendations.\n  First of all, they talk about some problems. They are talking about \neducation generally. Some problems are national in scope and require \nspecial attention. Critical areas such as math and science have long \nhad shortages of qualified teachers that were only temporarily solved \nby Federal recruitment centers during the post-Sputnik years. \nCurrently, more than 40 percent of math teachers and 30 percent of \nscience teachers are not fully qualified. They recognize there has to \nbe a particular focus on math and science teachers, and we incorporate \nthat in our legislation.\n\n  Secondly, it talks about, how we distributed the funds, basically the \nsame formula that was used by our Republican colleagues when they had a \nproposal to try to deal with the teacher shortage. That falls short for \nmany different reasons. We had hoped to be able to get into that if we \nhad continued our markup in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee yesterday. Nonetheless, what we are basically doing is saying \nwe will have a program in terms of recruitment, we will have a program \nin terms of mentoring.\n  We find there is a very important and significant contrast with the \nresults of maintaining teachers with a mentoring program; we have 23% \nof teachers leave within their first three years of teaching, and 30-\n50% leave within the first three to five years. Yet 93% of teachers \ntaking part in mentoring programs stayed on the job--far above the rate \nfor new teachers.\n  Let's take what we know works. Let's make sure that when we are going \nout and recruiting the teachers, they are going to be recruited in the \nareas of most critical need; that is, in math and science. Let's make \nsure that when they go into the classroom, they are going to be well \nprepared in their courses.\n  This amendment will insist that these teachers are going to qualify \naccording to the State requirements in the course they have selected. \nNo other legislation is going to do that. It is going to make sure they \nhave a mentoring program. We will also make sure that there is going to \nbe professional development, that very important third factor this \nstudy has pointed out. They mention in this study that most U.S. \nteachers have no regular time to consult together or learn about new \nteaching strategies, unlike their peers in many of the European nation \ncountries, which teach at a substantial time plan and at a higher \nlevel.\n  What this amendment is about is very simple and fundamental. We are \nsaying it is a wiser use of taxpayer funds to move us to an effective \nprogram in terms of ensuring we will have a well-trained teacher in \nevery classroom, rather than having the tax credits, only half of which \nwill even be available to parents whose children will be going to \npublic schools, the other half to the parents of children who will be \ngoing to the private schools.\n  Having well-qualified teachers is absolutely essential. Now, we can \nargue--and we have colleagues on our Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee who say this really isn't a role for the Federal \nGovernment. We know we provide only 7 cents out of every dollar that \ncomes from the Federal Government and goes into the local communities. \nIt comes through the States--about 98 cents of the dollars that come \nthrough the Federal Government actually go into the classrooms \nthemselves, according to the General Accounting Office.\n  What we are saying is, with a very limited amount of resources, we \nought to target areas where there are very important needs and where \nthere is a very sound and compelling case to be made in support of it. \nCertainly, I think that of all of the areas we are talking about in \nterms of classrooms today, we are all reminded by recent tragedies \nabout the importance of safety and security in the classroom--we are \nreminded constantly about that issue.\n  Secondly, we are reminded that there is nothing more important than \nhaving\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\nwell-trained teachers. That is why we think this amendment is so \nimportant and so compelling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nbe postponed to occur in a back-to-back series at 2:15 today in the \nfollowing order: No second-degree amendments in order prior to the \nvote, and 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation. They are: \nGraham, No. 2870; Roth, No. 2869; Dorgan, No. 2871; Kennedy, No. 2872.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. For the information of all Senators, Senator Dorgan's \nwill be a voice vote. Therefore, we expect 3 back-to-back votes at 2:15 \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me review specifically exactly how \nthis amendment works. Our amendment provides the States with $1.7 \nbillion by a formula--50 percent poverty, 50 percent population--to \nimprove the teacher quality. States can keep up to 10 percent for State \nactivities, including strategies to raise teacher salaries, reduce the \nnumber of teachers placed out of field, and reduce the number of \nemergency certified teachers.\n  Second, this guarantees that 56 percent of the funds that go to the \nStates--$960 million--is for professional development and mentoring, \nwhich provides for 200,000 new teachers a year. We know we need 2 \nmillion teachers over the next 10 years, or 200,000 a year. This will \nprovide the mentoring for those 200,000 teachers each year. Funds go by \nformula to the districts on the basis of 75 percent poverty, 25 percent \npopulation. That allocation, in terms of poverty population, is \nbasically noncontroversial. It is basically the formula we have used in \nthe past and is the formula being used even under the current \nlegislation being considered.\n  This guarantees that 30 percent of the funds that would go to the \nStates for competitive local recruitment programs in high-need \ndistricts, to recruit and train highly qualified candidates.\n  Next, it guarantees that teachers are trained to address the needs of \nchildren with disabilities. None of the other teacher programs or \nteacher training programs ensures that we are going to have teachers \nwho will be able to teach children with disabilities--it is enormously \nimportant.\n  It holds the States accountable for having a qualified teacher in \nevery classroom within 4 years of enactment of the law.\n  It requires that the first $300 million of the State grants go toward \nprofessional development, the mentoring and recruitment in the math and \nscience area. There is an incredible need there. Ninety-five percent of \nurban districts report a critical need for math teachers; 98 percent \nreport the need in science; 97 percent report a need for special \neducation teachers. That is what the current reports are. That is why \nwe have given focus in terms of the recruitment in math and science.\n  It also holds districts accountable for results. They must show \nprogress in: improved student performance; increased participation in \nsustained professional development and mentoring; reduced beginning \nteacher attrition rate for the district and; reduced number of teachers \nwho aren't certified or licensed and the number who are out-of-field \nteachers for the district.\n  Listen to what the Wall Street Journal reported on February 29:\n\n       Schools turn to temp agencies for substitute teachers. Most \n     school districts begin each day with a nerve-racking hunt for \n     substitutes to fill in for absent teachers. With the tight \n     labor market making the task especially tough, a few are \n     starting to outsource the job. Kelly Services, Inc. unveiled \n     the first nationwide substitute teacher program four months \n     ago and now handles screening and scheduling for 20 schools \n     in 10 States.\n       A school official in Edinburg, Indiana, says the contract \n     the system signed this month with Kelly simply acknowledges \n     ``they're more proficient than we are'' in the temporary help \n     arena. Temp outfits generally charge schools a premium while \n     paying subs at the same rate as before.\n  That is what is happening in the United States of America. That is \nwhat is happening. Last year, 50,000 unqualified teachers were hired \nacross the country and are appearing before classrooms of children \ntoday--50,000 hired last year appearing before them today. We ought to \nbe able to say, OK, we only have a limited amount of resources; how are \nwe going to be able to expend those resources effectively?\n  I believe the case has been made about having a well-qualified \nteacher in every classroom, having smaller class sizes, having \nafterschool programs that do so much in terms of helping and assisting \nchildren in doing homework and keeping the children out of trouble--a \nprogram, I might point out, that still has a broad opportunity to reach \nhundreds of thousands more children.\n  It is important to make sure we have the new technology, so children \nare able to learn with new computers. Various studies show that it \ntakes time for teachers to get up to speed--not just in using the \ncomputers, but in training the teachers to use computers in ways that \nare going to be consistent with the curriculum they are trained to \nteach. We are not doing that.\n  And then we know there is obviously the pathway in continuing in \nhigher education. These are the components and the elements that are \nbeing offered out here. The bottom line on the issue of accountability \nhas been to make sure the scarce resources that we have are actually \ngoing to be utilized in an effective way with effective results.\n  I recognize that starting in 1965 when we started the ESEA program, \nwe expended a good deal of resources and we didn't have the kind of \naccountability we should have had. But what we have seen is that over \nthe period, particularly since the last reauthorization, where we are \nbeginning to make some progress--measurable progress--we will hear \nspeeches that, oh, no, we are not making progress, we are falling \nfurther behind. Certainly, there are some schools where progress still \nhasn't been made. But if you are looking across the board, we are \nmaking measurable progress. I think we should find out what is \nhappening, and what is best to continue that measured progress.\n  When we look over the range of different activities that are out \nthere today, how can we measure the activities? One of the important \nways we measure it is by the various programs such as Project STAR in \nthe State of Tennessee, where students in smaller class sizes performed \nbetter than student in large classes in each grade from kindergarten \nthroughout third grade.\n  The second one, which I think should be self-evident and obvious, is \nhaving teachers in front of classes who are qualified to teach in the \nsubject matter.\n  The third is the afterschool programs that assist children with their \nhomework, and offer availability and accessibility of computers to make \nsure they are going to keep up to speed with technology.\n  When we have limited resources and have an opportunity to focus some \nof these scarce resources on a needed national problem, we ought to be \nwilling to consider what the overwhelming majority of thoughtful \neducators, Presidents, practitioners, and individuals who have studied \neducation over the course of a lifetime have virtually unanimously \nrecommended: Increasing teachers' knowledge of academic content and \neffective teaching skills through sustained, intensive professional \ndevelopment; mentoring programs to keep new teachers in the job; and \nrecruitment programs to draw talented individuals into the teaching \nprofession. That is really what our proposal does.\n  I see my colleague and friend, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman. I have stated many times, with the progress made in the \nvarious programs, that Senator Bingaman has been the leader in the \nSenate in making sure that whatever resources are going to be accounted \nfor, are accounted for effectively in every one of these educational \nprograms. He has done that in other programs as well but particularly \nin the education. We have incorporated his recommendations into this \nlegislation. We know that at the end of the day we are going to have \nimproved school performance, we are going to have teachers who are \ngoing to be able to teach and pass the State exams, and we know we are \ngoing to hold the States and local communities accountable.\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\n  I see him now. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield whatever time the Senator wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his \nleadership on this and all of the issues that relate to education that \nwe deal with in the Senate. I commend him particularly for this \namendment that deals with teacher quality and recruiting and training \nthe people who go into the teaching profession.\n  I think it is clear from the experience in my State--that is the \nexperience that I come from and understand a little bit, at least--that \nwe have too few funds available for the training of teachers, people \nwho are already in the workforce who need additional training, and \npeople who are going into teaching. Clearly the Federal funds made \navailable for that purpose meet a real need. Despite the fact a lot of \nmoney is spent on education nationally--I certainly concede a lot is--\nthere are other pressures on local school boards. There are other \npressures on States that tend to result in too little of the money \ngoing to train the teachers and going to upgrade their skill levels.\n  This amendment would ensure that at least a portion of the Federal \nfunds we are providing to States for education go to this vital \nactivity.\n  I think the amendment is absolutely crucial. I hope every Senator \nwill vote for it.\n  When you look at all the factors that affect education, I think there \nare many studies which have concluded correctly that the factor, if you \nhave to pick one, that is most significant in determining the quality \nof a child's education is the quality of the teacher and the training \nof that teacher to provide that instruction. This amendment goes \ndirectly to that. It says we need to keep our priorities straight when \nwe spend public money. We need to be sure the funds go to what is most \nimportant in terms of improving the education of the children involved. \nThat means training the teachers.\n  I compliment Senator Kennedy very much for this amendment. I am very \npleased to speak for it, and am very pleased to support it. I think \nthis goes to the heart of what we are trying to do. It goes to the \nheart of the concern I hear all over my State from a lot of people \nabout the inadequacies of our educational system.\n  We have a sad circumstance in my State. I have encountered something \nwhich we call a ``permanent substitute.'' I go to school districts and \nthey say: OK, you are trying to ensure that more of the accredited \nteachers are actually accredited to teach in the subjects they are \nteaching. That is not our problem. Our problem is we have people \nteaching on a semipermanent basis in our classrooms, and we call them \n``permanent substitutes.'' They not only are not qualified in the \nsubject area they are being asked to teach, but they are not really \nqualified to be teaching. They haven't been accredited.\n  This is a sad commentary. You have to go through licensing procedures \nto be a hairdresser in our State. You have to go through licensing \nprocedures to pursue virtually any career. We need to be sure we impose \naccountability on the teaching of professionals as well.\n  Teachers themselves want to see this happen. This is not an \nantiteacher proposal. This is something teachers themselves want to see \nmore funds available for in training and upgrading their skills.\n  This is an amendment I strongly support. I commend Senator Kennedy \nfor proposing this amendment. I hope all Senators will review it \ncarefully and will determine to support the amendment when it comes up \nfor a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis statement. He has, as I mentioned, enormously contributed in terms \nof these accountability provisions.\n  Professional development, mentoring, and the recruitment have been \nfound to be important and significant in communities across the \ncountry. Let me mention some of the examples.\n  Since the late 1980s, New York City's District 2 has invested in \nsustained, intensive, professional development and made it the central \ncomponent for improving schools. The district believes student learning \nwill increase as the knowledge of educators grows--and it is working. \nThe investment has contributed to steady increases in student \nachievement and in 1996, student math scores were second in the city.\n  According to a recent study, the longer California math teachers \nengaged in ongoing, curriculum-centered and professional development, \nthat supported a reform-oriented teaching practice, the better their \nstudents did on the State math assessments.\n  This demonstrates what is happening out there. It is happening in too \nfew districts. Let's make sure we are going to do it in other places \nacross the country.\n  In the area of mentoring and recruitment, in Illinois, the Golden \nApple Scholars Program recruits promising young men and women for \nteaching professions by selecting them during their junior year in high \nschool, then mentoring them through the rest of high school, college, \nand 5 years of actual teaching. Sixty of the Golden Apple scholars \nenter the teaching field each year; 90 percent of them are staying in \nthe classroom compared to 50 percent of others dropping out within \ntheir first five years.\n  These are young people, recruited locally, involved through high \nschool, attending various kinds of meetings and conferences on \neducation, furthering their efforts through college, coming back to \ntheir communities.\n  I have visited programs similar to this in Dade County, FL. They have \nhad extraordinary success locally. That is what we are talking about.\n  Project Promise at Colorado State University recruits prospective \nteachers from fields such as law, geology, chemistry, stock trading, \nand medicine. Current teachers mentor these new recruits in the first 2 \nyears of teaching. More than 90 percent of the recruits enter the field \nand 80 percent stay in the teaching for at least 5 years.\n  There are some very creative ways of recruiting. A North Carolina \nTeaching Fellows Program recruits talented high school students in the \nteaching profession with a minimum 1,100 SAT score, higher that 3.6 \nGPA, and in the top 10 percent of the class. The program provides \n$5,000 per year for 4 years to 400 outstanding North Carolina high \nschool seniors who agree to teach for 4 years, following graduation in \none of the North Carolina public schools or U.S. Government schools. \nThey find they are retaining some 90 percent of these teachers.\n  There is a similar program called Teach Boston, a collaborative \neffort between Boston Public Schools, Boston Private Industry Council, \nand Boston Teachers Union. They created model future teacher academies \nin two Boston high schools.\n  There are different ways of doing this. We give local communities the \nflexibility in the development of the programs. We say to those who \nwant to do this kind of a program in their local community that there \nwill be some resources that will be available to them.\n  The Hometown Program provides $25 million to support the efforts of \nhigh-poverty school districts to recruit teachers as early as the high \nschool to meet long-term teacher shortages. Currently, 20 districts--\nincluding Wichita, Milwaukee, Wayne County, North Carolina, and States, \nincluding South Carolina, Ohio, and Washington--have pipeline systems \nfor long-term programs for teacher recruitment.\n  In South Carolina, between 35 and 40 percent of students who complete \nthe State Teacher Cadet Corps either become or plan to become teachers. \nCurrently, there are approximately 5,000 graduates of the Teacher Cadet \nCorps serving as teachers in South Carolina. Independent evaluators of \nthe South Carolina program have found one former cadet entered college \nwith a jump-start on the teacher education program, and two reported a \nhigher rating than other teachers. They have raised standards for \nclassmates in college.\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\n  In Wichita, KS, 70 participate in the Grow Your Own Teacher projects \nand completed their college education; 58 are currently employed as \nteachers in the Wichita public schools.\n  These programs are around the country but in too few places. We are \nsaying we will provide some $25 million to support those programs that \nhave worked.\n  Finally, the success of the Troops to Teachers. They have hired over \n3,600 teachers nationwide. These teachers are likely to be in math and \nscience, and more likely to be minorities than the general recruitment \nof high school teachers. There are more than 85 percent male, compared \nto 25 percent nationally--from the Troops to Teachers program. They are \nteaching in over 900 rural counties, 25 percent; 40 percent are in \nsuburban areas; 40 percent in urban. They have an 82-percent retention \nrate, returning each year to teaching.\n\n  We have a significant expansion of that program. The opportunities \nare out there. California has hired nearly 300 teachers from the Troops \nto Teachers, including a former Navy pilot who used to hunt submarines \nand now faces two dozen kindergarten students. He says it does not pay \nas much but the job satisfaction is incredible. Florida hired 200 \nTroops to Teachers, including a former Navy instructor who now teachers \nhonors algebra to high school students. The students say he gets \nexcited and he definitely knows what he is talking about. The teacher \ntook a pay cut but he enjoys the kids and enjoys the school.\n  Today, we are talking about Kelly Girls--or Kelly Men--as substitute \nteachers advertised in the Wall Street Journal this week. We are \ntalking about limited resources.\n  We have recommended smaller class sizes, which are key and have \ndemonstrated effectiveness; well-trained teachers, with the support of \nmentoring; professional development; afterschool programs; computer \nprograms so children will not be left out or left behind; and strong \naccountability measures. We believe these are the ways we can make \nimportant difference in terms of enhancing the academic opportunities \nfor children in this country.\n  My friend and colleague from the State of Washington has been our \nleader in moving this Nation toward smaller class sizes. Having visited \na number of the schools in my own State of Massachusetts, it is making \na major difference. We want to make sure that effort is going to be \ncontinued.\n  I yield such time as the Senator desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor with my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, to talk about an issue that many think is \nthe most important issue facing America today. That is the issue of \neducation. We are finally in the Senate talking about issues that are \nrelevant to families. As they sit at the kitchen table in the evening, \nthey, too, understand education is absolutely critical to the future of \nthis country.\n  We are finally today with this amendment talking about a measure \nwhich will ensure that every teacher in this country is fully qualified \nand has the tools and the support to help our children reach their full \npotential. For years, parents and teachers have been asking for support \non teacher quality.\n  Last year, I came to the Senate floor to introduce a bill to help \nrecruit, retain, and reward America's best educators. I am thrilled \ntoday to discuss many of the items in that bill. I hope we will have an \nup-or-down vote on this amendment so families across our country can \nsee whether or not this Senate supports quality teaching.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for helping this day become \npossible and by leading to make education a front and center issue in \nthis Congress, as it is in the classrooms and homes across America.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of the amendment, I wish to make \nanother point loudly and clearly: Today there are thousands of world-\nclass, high-quality teachers in our schools. They are professionals. \nThey care deeply about the quality of our children's education. Any \nMember would be lucky to have our children in those classrooms.\n  However, the current system makes it harder and harder for teachers \nto do their best. Instead of offering them the support they need to \nmake a difference--smaller classes, classrooms that are safe, \nafterschool care--this current system puts too maybe roadblocks in \nfront of too many teachers.\n  We are here today to discuss teacher quality. I want my colleagues to \nkeep in mind that we are not criticizing teachers. They are overworked \nand underpaid and not given enough respect. They are, indeed, heroes. \nWe are trying to change the system to allow more teachers to become \nmaster teachers.\n  I hope throughout this debate my colleagues will refrain from \nattacking the very people who try their hardest day in and day out to \nhelp our children and do the right thing for our country. As I said \nmany times before, teachers do one of the most important jobs in \nAmerica, and we should make it easier, not harder, for them to do their \nbest.\n  The amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts could not come at a \nbetter time because there are so many challenges to quality teaching, \nand those challenges just keep growing.\n  Teachers and parents have told me the main challenges are the three \nRs: Recruiting great teachers, retaining great teachers, and rewarding \ngreat teachers. Statistics today show we need more educators to meet \nour growing student population. In fact, in the United States, we are \nexpecting to face an unprecedented teacher shortage in the next few \nyears. The National Center for Educational Statistics estimates we will \nneed between 1.7 to 2.7 million new teachers by the year 2008.\n  One reason not many people want to go into the teaching profession is \nthere are not enough incentives for recent college graduates to become \nteachers. With the wide range of employment opportunities available to \nyoung people today, to our college graduates, teaching is not the most \nattractive option. The teaching profession, as we all know, is just not \na lucrative place to be. In the USA Today Teacher Survey, 69 percent of \nteachers said most people do not consider teaching to be an attractive \ncareer choice. So we are not attracting enough talented people into the \nteaching profession.\n  As I am sure has happened to many of my colleagues, I have gone into \na classroom and asked: How many of you young people intend to be a \nteacher? Very few hands go up. But if you ask those young people: How \nmany of you would become teachers if you knew you would get the \ntraining, the support, the money, and the respect that other \nprofessionals get? A lot more hands in those classrooms go up. So our \nfirst challenge is recruiting young people into the teaching \nprofession. That is what this amendment does.\n  Next, we need to retain great teachers. When you think about it, \nthere really is nowhere for a great teacher to go. If they move up, \nthey move out of the classroom into administration or into another \nprofession. While we need great administrators, we should do everything \nwe can to keep our really great teachers in the classrooms. We need to \ngive our teachers options such as becoming master teachers, so they can \ncontinue to grow while helping our kids in their classrooms.\n  There are a lot of reasons for this retention problem. Unlike any \nother profession, teachers do not have adequate access to continuous \nhigh-quality professional development, so we need effective, ongoing \nprofessional development programs that are aligned with local standards \nand curricula.\n  Finally, we need to reward our good teachers.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to thank Senator Kennedy for \nhis leadership on the most critical issue we see facing our students \ntoday--making sure every teacher in every classroom is a quality \nteacher. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this critical amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota. How \nmuch time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Rhode Island, if he will \ngive me 1 minute, I will be pleased for him to have the last 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Surely. I yield 1 minute, or Senator Kennedy does.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for this \namendment. I want to mention the part of this amendment I have had a \nchance to work on. I thank the Senator for letting me do this with him. \nIt is the Teacher Corps part, where we basically put together a \nmarriage of school districts that need teachers in certain areas along \nwith schools of education. It is actually after students have already \ngraduated, but they may want to go back and get certification, or they \nmay be in their forties or fifties and go into teaching.\n  During that 2-year certification period, it will be tuition free if \nthey agree to teach in these areas for 3 years. It is allocated to \nlocal needs, it puts everything together in a promising way, and it is \ngood for inner-city and suburban schools. It puts the schools together \nwith good teachers. Everybody agrees this is the key.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Kennedy \namendment. Senator Kennedy has focused on one of the critical aspects \nof education reform in the United States; that is, improving the \nquality of teachers in this country. Teachers want this kind of \nassistance. If you ask them, they are universally disappointed in their \nopportunities to improve their skills as teachers.\n  Just a few days ago, in this debate we supported, in large part, \nSenator Collins' amendment to allow increased tax preferences for \neducational courses teachers might take. But that is just the surface. \nThe way to reinvigorate and reform schools in this country is to \nimprove the professional development in the classroom--not in graduate \nschools, not in taking correspondence courses, but getting those \nteachers in classrooms watching other qualified teachers, giving them \nthe opportunity to participate with their principals in developing \ncurricula, developing their own skills and their own attributes.\n  That is what the Kennedy legislation does. It calls for the \nincorporation in our schools of professional development that is \nembedded within the curriculum. It is consistent, sustained, long-term, \nthroughout the academic year--indeed, throughout the entire year.\n  What is happening today? The reality is, teachers spend between 1 \nhour and 8 hours during the academic year on professional development. \nMost times, it is gathering in a big hall listening to a lecturer who \nthe superintendent of the system thinks makes sense, but in some cases \nthe teachers are wondering why they are at that location.\n  We can change that. Indeed, we must change that. Unless we improve \nthe quality of teaching--and I agree wholeheartedly with Senator \nMurray; we have excellent teachers in America--we will not respond to \nthe challenges of this new century to prepare, in public schools, the \nbest educated citizens of this country. Indeed, our first obligation \nhas to be this effort to reform and reinvigorate and reignite the \nquality of excellence in our public education system throughout the \ncountry.\n\n  The underlying proposal does not do that. It essentially siphons off \ndollars to those, principally wealthy, Americans who choose to send \ntheir children to private schools. Our obligation, I believe very \nfervently, is to ensure there is a real choice so that, indeed, there \nare excellent public schools and an American family can choose those \nexcellent public schools or a private, independent or parochial school. \nBut until we have excellent public education throughout this country, \nwe are failing in a fundamental obligation we have to our country and \nto our citizens.\n  One of the best ways to assure excellent public education is the way \nthat has been suggested by the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and that is to provide professional development that is \nsustained, embedded in a classroom, that calls upon mentoring, that \ncalls upon all the things we are learning from the real world.\n  We are learning from observing places such as district II in New York \nCity, which is committed to this type of professional development. I \nhad a chance to visit with a school in that district and listen and \nwatch the teachers as they discussed among themselves the issues that \nwere critical as they developed new curricula, as they talked about new \nstrategies. This is what is going to improve the quality of our \nteaching. When we do this, we will improve the quality of education \nthroughout the entire country.\n  This is also what we heard at hearings during consideration of the \nESEA. We heard experts from around the country, teachers from around \nthe country, coming to tell us they need more support for this type of \nprofessional development. If we are really, fundamentally asking \nourselves how we can improve education in this country, it is not \nthrough a tax credit device that will essentially subsidize, on \naverage, wealthy Americans to send their children to private schools; \nit is investing in teachers in our public schools so they will be able \nto educate this generation of Americans to continue the leadership role \nof this Nation in the world in this new century.\n  I emphatically and fervently support the Kennedy amendment. I urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time now is controlled by the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from Rhode Island \nis here. I did not have a chance to respond to his remarks the other \nday on the education savings account, and we do have a fairly \nsignificant disagreement, beyond the philosophy, over some of the data. \nI think we are making headway on this.\n  The implication that the education savings account is a vehicle for \npeople who drive around in limousines is inaccurate. The Joint Tax \nCommittee has found the education savings accounts would be used 14 \nmillion times over, it would be used by 14 million families, 70 percent \nof whom have incomes of $75,000 or less.\n  More importantly, though, the point I want to make--and I am not \ngoing to dwell on this because I know we have our differences--is that \nseveral years ago the President and the Congress passed the higher \neducation savings account. It was for $500. The criteria for the \nfamilies who could use those accounts are the identical criteria being \nused for these education savings accounts. There is no difference.\n  I take some issue with the fact we in Congress and the President are \napplauding this wonderful account we have set up for higher education \nfor $500, and yet on an identical scope of use for this savings \naccount, it somehow gets into class warfare.\n  All that has happened is we have taken a $500 account we all passed \nand applauded and said it could be expanded to $2,000 or four times. If \na family chooses to, they can use it in kindergarten through high \nschool. The odds are the majority of them will use it just as the \nhigher education savings account does, for college.\n  I did want to make that point. It has come up several times.\n  I am the only one who has time, but I yield a few minutes to my \ncolleague from Rhode Island to respond.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I respect the Senator's efforts to try to \nimprove education. We may very well disagree on the philosophy.\n  In specific response to his question about the Joint Tax Committee \nstudies, I think there is a difference between coverage and effect. The \ncoverage might include a broad range of American families, from the \nvery wealthiest to low-income families, but the effects--who gets the \nbenefits--are decisively skewed toward very wealthy Americans.\n  That same tax analysis in 1998 showed that 7 percent of families who \nhave children in private schools who use this provision will receive 52 \npercent of the tax benefit and the other 93 percent of the families \nwill receive 48 percent.\n  Frankly, the way, as we all realize, the tax structure is \nestablished, tax credits and tax benefits are more beneficial to the \nhigher income level, unless\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\nthey are particularly targeted to low-income citizens. These are not.\n  Essentially, what we have is, yes, low-income families and medium-\nincome families will, in fact, be able to get some benefits. It has \nbeen estimated that over 4 years, this benefit to the average family is \nabout $20. The benefit for very wealthy Americans will be significantly \nmore.\n  Again, this might be more anecdotal than analytical. If you look at \nthe population of students going to private schools, they generally \ncome from upper-middle-income to upper-income families because of the \nnature of funding.\n  I know the Senator wants his time. Let me make a quick point. When we \nstart making these comparisons between higher education and elementary \nand secondary education, not only do we have a principle difference, \ni.e., we have a fundamental obligation to elementary and secondary \neducation, do we have the same to higher education? We can disagree \nabout that.\n  The other thing we have to do is put it in context. The tax benefits \nin higher education are on top of Pell grants which are specifically \ndirected at low-income parents. They are really, if you will, icing on \nthe cake, and the cake is really Pell grants, Stafford loans--a whole \npanoply of higher education benefits which we supported for years and \nyears. To make the transfer or analogy of it is just like what we do \nfor higher education, it is not only philosophically questionable but \nalso, in terms of the context, questionable. I thank the Senator for \nhis time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will respond briefly because the \nclock is running. The demographics in parochial schools and private \nschools--and we studied this very closely--are within 10 percent, the \nsame as demographics in public schools. Parochial schools, for example, \nin New York, have identical demographics as the public schools. Sixty \npercent in parochial schools make $50,000 or less. The idea that people \nin these parochial or private schools are somehow a class of wealth is, \nI believe, not correct and cannot be substantiated, No. 1.\n  No. 2, 70 percent of the families who use this education savings \naccount are going to be in public schools; 30 percent in private. The \nfunds the Senator from Rhode Island describes are pretty much evenly \ndivided. I suspect because people in private schools are still paying \nlocal property taxes for public schools, they have a higher hurdle, and \nit does make them save more. This is a debate we can continue at \nanother time. I appreciate the Senator's response. I give him 1 minute.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am not familiar with the data about New \nYork parochial schools, but I am very eager to look at it, if the \nSenator will provide it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. REED. Second, it is one of those things: What do you measure? Do \nyou measure parochial schools in New York City or are you measuring all \nthe private schools, very exclusive schools? All I can speak to with \ngreat compulsion and experience is in my home State of Rhode Island, \ngenerally speaking, the parochial schools mirror some of the public \nschool systems. But when you go to some of the private schools, that is \nnot quite the case. I suggest if it is not limited to parochial \nschools, it is going to be taken advantage of.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will show the Senator the data. We all see private \nschools that stand out. That is what forms the image. I am saying when \nyou look at all the private schools across the country, you come up \nwith a lot of people who do not have many resources.\n  We will discuss this at a further time. To explain to my good friend \nfrom Nevada, I am going to talk for 5 minutes and then yield back our \ntime. It would then be appropriate, in the queue of events, that we \nmove to Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the Kennedy amendment, which I have \nhere, this amendment was laid down yesterday in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. It is the first amendment that was \noffered in the committee, and it is in the process of being discussed.\n  There are controversies in it. Folks on our side think, once again, \nit is a story of mandates and regulations and instructions to local \nschools about how to manage the affairs at the local level. The \nappropriate place for this amendment to be decided is in the committee \nof jurisdiction.\n  The other point I want to make, and I have made it repeatedly, is \nthat this is about the fifth or sixth attempt by the other side to come \nto the Senate floor with what are very laudable ideas, but they are all \nconstructed in a way that is either/or. If we adopt the Kennedy \namendment or any one of these other five amendments we have been \ndealing with for the last several days, the main effect is to cancel \nthe education savings account.\n  If we do that, we are saying to 14 million American families: Sorry, \nwe are not going to let you create an education savings account. These \nhappen to be the parents of 20 million children, which is almost half \nthe school population. No deal; we are not interested in letting your \nfamilies create education savings accounts that will direct money to \nyour specific needs and, most important of all, they blow away, they \nopen the safe and run off with $12 billion of savings that would occur \nwith these education savings accounts for families to use for \neducational purposes anywhere from kindergarten through college and \nbeyond college, frankly, if there was a disability incurred.\n  The amendment, while it may be laudable--maybe it will be adopted in \ncommittee--the way it is designed is to destroy the opportunity to \nempower 14 million families and parents who are raising 20 million \nchildren and their attempts to save money to help them get that job \ndone.\n  Obviously, we will, once again, when the appropriate time for voting \ncomes, oppose this amendment, not necessarily on its merits--the \ncommittee will decide that--but because its main purpose is to destroy \nthe education savings account.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time on the Kennedy \namendment. I believe the other side has chosen to go ahead with the \nBoxer amendment at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the Kennedy amendment \naside, which was envisioned in the unanimous consent request we \npropounded a few minutes ago.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kennedy \namendment prior to it being set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers for accommodating me. \nI have been waiting for a while.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2873\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on improving the learning \n                 environment by ensuring safe schools)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Robb, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2873:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SAFE LEARNING \n                   ENVIRONMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Every school child in America has a right to a safe \n     learning environment free from guns and violence.\n       (2) Any education measure passed by Congress is undermined \n     by violence in the schools.\n       (3) The February 29, 2000 shooting at Buell Elementary \n     School in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is evidence that \n     the tragic gun violence in America's schools continues.\n       (4) In the last 12 months, there have been at least 50 \n     people killed or injured in school shootings in America.\n       (5) Every day in America, on average, between 12 and 13 \n     children under the age of 18 die of gunshots from homicides, \n     accidental shootings, and suicides.\n       (6) In the 10\\1/2\\ months since the shooting at Columbine \n     High School in Littleton, Colorado, the United States \n     Congress has failed to pass reasonable, common-sense gun \n     control measures that would help to make schools safer, \n     improve the learning environment, and stem the tide of gun \n     violence in America.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that before April 20, 2000, Congress shall make schools safe \n     for learning by\n\n[[Page S1063]]\n\n     implementing policies that will reduce the threat of gun \n     violence in schools.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the clerk for reading the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It is a \ncommonsense amendment. It is an opportunity for the Senate to be heard \non the issue of gun violence.\n  I thought we were making progress after Littleton when we passed--a \nmonth after Littleton--a number of very important, commonsense gun \ncontrol measures. We have yet to see those measures come back to us for \nfinal passage. We have yet to see those measures come back to us from \nconference. We have yet to see an interest on the part of the majority \nto move these important, commonsense gun control measures.\n  I am hopeful that this sense of the Senate, which calls on the \nCongress to act by the year anniversary of Littleton, will have some \nmeaning to people. I trust this will pass 100-0.\n  Children in schools have a right to be safe. It is very fundamental \nthat they be safe, almost as fundamental as their right to a free \npublic education.\n  A safe school is essential to ensuring an environment where children \ncan learn. We can stand here, from morning until night, with great \nideas on education. Governors can come up with their own proposals on \neducation. Local school districts can do the same. But if there is a \nshooting in a school, no one learns. The only thing they learn is \ntragedy, at an age way too young to deal with it.\n  We have an unacceptable situation in our country. If children sit in \na classroom wondering if they are going to hear gunshots in the \nschoolyard or in the hallway, they cannot concentrate on a math problem \nin their classroom.\n  Again, I know the Senator from Georgia believes very strongly in his \neducation savings account legislation. I know that we all have issues \nwe want to put forward: smaller class sizes, rebuilding our broken-down \nschools. We all have a tremendous interest in improving education. But \nit means nothing when violence invades our schools and children are \nhurt or they die--schools are closed; education is disrupted. None of \nit means much if we cannot at least ensure safety.\n  As we said in the resolution, in the last 12 months, at least 50 \npeople have been killed or injured in school shootings. This week it \nwas a little 6-year-old girl who was killed in an elementary school in \nMichigan. My God, what is it going to take for this Senate to act? A 6-\nyear-old child gets a gun and kills a classmate. He got the gun because \nan adult left it lying around. There was no trigger lock.\n  We have a bill dealing with that; it has been tied up. I do not think \nthat is a very radical proposal. I do not think it is a dangerous \nproposal to put a child safety lock on a gun. That child would have \nbrought the gun to school, it would not have gone off, and a child \nwould not be dead. We would not have to see these children, at a tender \nage--a tender, tender age--I have a 4\\1/2\\-year-old grandchild, and I \njust think about the horror of a child at that age, 5\\1/2\\ or 6 or 7 \ndealing with this kind of violence. It is wrong. It is unacceptable.\n  Last December, it was four middle school students who were injured by \ngunfire in a middle school in Oklahoma.\n  Last November, it was a 13-year-old girl who was shot in the head in \na New Mexico school.\n  Last May, six students were injured at a high school in Georgia.\n  Of course, last April, 15 people died and 23 more were injured in \nColumbine High School in Littleton, CO. Anyone who has watched the \nfollowup stories in that community knows that the injuries done then \nare not fading. They have torn that community apart.\n  What are we waiting for? Sensible gun control legislation was passed \nby this Senate. The Vice President, Al Gore, cast a tie-breaking vote \non closing the gun show loophole so people who should not have a gun \nwould not be able to get a gun. I do not know what it will take for \nthis Senate to act.\n  I see a couple of my friends who have come to the floor to discuss \nthis issue with me.\n  Yesterday, there was a multiple shooting outside Pittsburgh.\n  There was a shooting in September in a Baptist church in Texas.\n  Last September, there was a shooting in the West Anaheim Medical \nCenter in California.\n  Last August, there was a shooting at the North Valley Jewish \nCommunity Center's day-care center in Los Angeles. Will we ever forget \nthose children, holding the hands of the police officers --babies \ntrying to cope with what was going on.\n  Last April, there was a shooting at the Mormon Family History Library \nin Salt Lake City.\n  These bullets are randomly shot. It does not matter how old you are. \nIf you are there, you are in trouble.\n  This is chaos, my friends. What did we do after Littleton? We came \ntogether. We passed gun control measures that are very sound. They are \nreasonable, they are moderate, and they will keep guns out of the hands \nof children. They will keep guns out of the hands of criminals. They \nwill keep guns out of the hands of people who are mentally ill. They \nwill not take guns out of the hands of people who need to have a gun to \nprotect themselves, who are upstanding citizens.\n  So what are we waiting for? More and more of these deaths?\n  I ask my friends from California, Illinois, and Michigan how much \ntime they would like to take on this? I am delighted to yield to them. \nWhy don't they give me that information, and then we will set up an \norder.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If it is convenient, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Three minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Done. Why don't we start with Senator Levin. I yield him \n3 minutes of my time. We will then go to Senator Durbin and then \nSenator Feinstein. Then I will take it back and close the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nraising the question of the proliferation of guns and gun violence in \nour schools as we debate education on the Senate floor. We should not \nbe debating education without addressing the question of the gun \nviolence which strikes so many of our schools.\n  It has now been almost a year since the deadly shooting at Columbine. \nThe images of Columbine's teenagers clinging for life and screaming in \nterror are forever printed in our minds. Not many of us could forget \nthe horror of those scenes as they unfolded before us on national \ntelevision. Yet somehow it seems that Congress has forgotten the \nunforgettable.\n  Now, in yet another school shooting, the tragic, senseless death of \nanother child--this time in my home State of Michigan --has reminded us \nof the terror of gun violence and the toll it takes on young people.\n  According to a press report, the shooting stunned even gun control \nadvocates immersed in the details of school violence. If a 6-year-old \ncan get a gun, they said, the problem is worse than anyone thought. The \nfirst grade shooting that occurred this week in Mount Morris Township \nnear Flint, MI, is surely shocking because of the nature of the \ncircumstances: An alleged 6-year-old gunman living in a house with easy \naccessibility to guns and little comprehension of the consequences of \nhis actions. No one can really any longer claim shock or surprise that \nanother young life was lost to gun violence. No one can any longer \nclaim shock or surprise that another one of our children did not make \nit home from school.\n  We have known, long before Columbine, that gun violence claims the \nlives of 12 children, on average, each day. We know gun violence \nresults in injury and death, destroys families, and causes lasting \npsychological and emotional harm. Buell Elementary's counselors will \nnow try to cope with the trauma that comes when schoolchildren shoot \nschoolchildren. Too many other districts now know that violence and the \nfear of violence is not only devastating to the children and the \nfamilies involved, it can also infect the learning environment. We \ncannot allow ourselves to become desensitized to the tragedies of gun \nviolence. As a Detroit Free Press writer put it:\n\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\n\n       [At Buell] the first-grade classroom, so vibrant with the \n     piping voices of children early Tuesday morning, had been \n     commandeered by police detectives, searching for the meaning \n     behind the unthinkable.\n\n  Congress must pass gun safety legislation before more children's \nvoices are silenced by the sounds of gunfire and sirens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from California for her leadership. \nIt is critically important that this issue be raised at this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Michigan.\n  My friend from Illinois wanted 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I totally support this resolution.\n  Could one imagine the Senate today debating education and ignoring \nthe obvious? When the front-page headlines, news story after news \nstory, remind us that mere infants now have access to handguns, that a \n6-year-old can take a handgun to school and kill your son, your \ndaughter, grandson, and granddaughter, is this America? Is this the \nbest we can do? I think we can do a lot better.\n  Senator Boxer challenges this Senate to go on record when it comes to \nschool safety. I support her completely. It is important to talk about \nhow you pay for schools. It is important to talk about the \nqualifications of teachers and how many kids are in a classroom and \nwhether you have access to the Internet. But the most important \nquestion is whether you can send that little child you love to school \nin the morning and expect them to come home safely at night. That is \nwhy this resolution is important. Before we start talking about the \nfiner points of improving education, let us first dedicate ourselves to \nsafety in classrooms across America.\n  I will support her resolution. It should receive a unanimous vote. \nWho in the world can stand here and say we should not be on record \nagainst the school violence we find taking place more and more every \nsingle day? A little later on in this debate, I will offer a specific \ngrant program through the Department of Education to deal with school \nviolence and gun violence.\n  Make no mistake about it, that 6-year-old didn't go out and purchase \nthat handgun. Some adult failed in their responsibility. I don't know \nthe circumstances; maybe we will never know the circumstances. But time \nand again, children are getting access to guns with tragic results. \nMany times, they take them down from the top shelf in the closet and \nplay with them, either harming themselves or another classmate or \nanother one of their friends who ordinarily visits the home. Then the \nsad stories when they take them to school. What we saw in Michigan is \nnot an exception; it is happening more and more.\n  My wife and I decided early on never to have a firearm in the house \nas long as our kids were small. We just thought it was too dangerous. \nThat was our family decision. But even though we made that decision, it \ndidn't cross my mind until much later to really wonder what the parents \nof my kids' friends had decided. That happens, too. Your little boy or \ngirl goes to the house next door to play, and you don't know what those \nkids are doing. How many times do you pick up the newspaper and read \nabout kids playing with guns and one kid being injured? It happens too \noften.\n  In this case, we are finding more and more that kids are picking up \nthese guns and carrying them to school, where they find victims in \ntheir classmates and teachers. This isn't an isolated situation. Those \nwho want to dismiss it and say, come on, you are just responding to a \nsingle headline, ignore the obvious.\n  The U.S. Department of Education, in the 1997-98 school year, found \nthat 3,930 children in schools across America were expelled for \nbringing guns to school. Almost 4,000 kids in that school year brought \nguns to school across America. I am glad to say that very few of them \nresulted in death, but think about the potential for disaster and \ntragedy.\n  I sincerely hope--and I mean this, though I fought the gun lobby and \nthe National Rifle Association every step of the way--that for once \nthey will have a heart and the good sense to support this resolution \nthat says, as a matter of policy, before we talk about education and \nits future, we will talk about the safety of kids in the classroom.\n\n  Take a look at the language in this resolution. In the last 12 \nmonths, 50 people killed or injured in school shootings in America. \nEvery day, on average, between 12 and 13 children under the age of 18 \ndie from gunshots, from homicides, drive-by shootings, accidental \nshootings, and suicides.\n  America has made a decision. We have decided as a nation that people \ncan own guns, legally, constitutionally; they have the right to do so. \nBut make no mistake, an obligation comes with the ownership of those \nguns, not just to buy them, not just to buy the ammunition, not just to \nown them and use them for sport or hunting, but to store them safely.\n  I have introduced legislation called the child access prevention law. \nIt says that, as with 17 States across America, the whole Nation should \nbe held to a standard where gun owners keep their guns away from kids. \nIt is not enough to put it on the top shelf in the closet or to put it \nin a drawer by the night stand because, mark my words, kids are always \ngoing to find Christmas gifts and guns no matter where we put them.\n  And any adult owner who believes they have hidden them and the kids \nwill never find them ignores reality.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator 1 more minute. I hope he will leave \ntime for me to ask him a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senate goes on record \nunanimously, on a bipartisan basis. If it doesn't, I hope families \nacross America who are worried about the safety of their kids ask each \nand every Senator how we can vote against a resolution saying we are \ngoing to make it a national priority in the sense of the Senate to make \nschools safe and implement policies that reduce the threat of gun \nviolence.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to share with the Senator two numbers because \nhe had a lot of important statistics. This is from Time magazine: Fifty \npercent of children ages 9 to 17 are worried about dying young, and 31 \npercent of children ages 12 to 17 know someone their age who carries a \ngun. I ask my friend to respond to that, and take as much time as he \nneeds, and then we will yield 10 minutes to Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a sad reality that with the \nproliferation of over 200 million guns in America, more and more \nchildren who, in my generation, would be the schoolyard bullies are now \nthe kids bringing guns to school, and other children know it. They know \nabout the easy access to these weapons. The kid who used to go out in \nthe schoolyard and punch somebody in the nose now turns out to be the \nkid who brings the gun to school. It is a sad reality, one that every \nfamily in America faces.\n  I don't care if you live in California, Illinois, or Michigan; there \nis not a school district or a child we can be sure is safe today until \nwe take measures to restore sanity to the classrooms across America, to \nprotect not only the kids but the teachers and all of the parents who \nshare, as we do, the love for these children.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his leadership.\n  I yield to my colleague, the senior Senator from California, who, I \nthink it is important to note, brought us our first victory on \ncommonsense gun control several years ago with her assault weapons ban. \nShe has kept on this issue continuously, and I am very honored that she \nis here to speak in connection with this sense of the Senate.\n  I yield to Senator Feinstein for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Boxer \nfrom California, for her leadership and for this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, which I am very happy to support fully.\n  Today, I received a packet of letters. They are from fourth and fifth \ngrade children. I want to read just a few parts of these letters:\n\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\n\n       My name is Nikki. * * * I am 11 years old. * * * No one in \n     my household has a gun, not one of them. * * * One day, I saw \n     a neighbor of mine get shot on her way to the candy house. \n     She got shot 4 times. She got shot 3 times in her side and \n     once in her leg. Now she's paralyzed for life. That really \n     hurt me and a lot of other people. She was only 12 years old \n     and she was a nice girl.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       I am Talia and I am 11 years of age. And when I'm coming \n     home from school, I see little 13 year old teenagers playing \n     with guns like it's a thing to do. I walk across the street \n     to go get some ketchup for my cousin's house and I see people \n     dragged into the * * * park.\n       * * * We're little kids. We need to live in a safer \n     community and this is not safe. So write to all the gun \n     stores and let them know what kids think about guns.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       My opinion is no people should have guns, because one day \n     in the summer that passed this girl was in her house. Then a \n     man dragged her out of her house up the stairs. After he \n     punched her and shot her in the leg, she had a hole in her \n     leg. The police and ambulance had to come and wrapped her leg \n     up.\n       * * * I want the Senator to make guns no more. No more guns \n     in this world.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       I am a fifth grader. And mainly every year I hear at least \n     20 gunshots. I am scared at night because I think it's going \n     to be a drive-by. I even sometimes can't go outside to recess \n     because gunshots are heard.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       My name is Justin. I am in the fifth grade.\n       * * * At night in my neighborhood there are gunshots and \n     sometimes it keeps me awake. When I walk home from school, \n     there is gangs in one spot and another gang in another spot.\n       Could you please help and make guns illegal? All the kids \n     in my class want you to help. If you help, then I thank you \n     very much.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       What I know about guns and gun control is to not let guns \n     get into the wrong hands.\n       * * * What I want is to not let guns get in the wrong \n     hands. To let it not go to people that just came out of \n     prison to get payback. That is what I want and I hope you can \n     do something about this and I want support of gun control \n     laws.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       * * * When I was 3 years old, I saw a black and silver gun. \n     When I saw it, I ran in my house and saw the person get shot \n     by it. I was so scared I cried my eyes out. So please support \n     us.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       * * * I think you should stop people from shooting other \n     people. People should have to get a license and people should \n     have to have a background check for getting guns. \n     Please support gun control laws.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       * * * My experiences are hearing guns, like one day when it \n     was my Aunt's birthday, we were all in the house looking out \n     the window. We had seen this man on top of the hill. He had a \n     gun. Then he just started to point it and then he started to \n     shoot. We all had to drop to the floor. It was scary.\n       What I want is only the police to have guns because they're \n     the only ones who's using them right. I want you to vote to \n     have only police have guns, it's just right. And if police \n     are not using them right, please take them away. I want gun \n     control over guns.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       * * * I am 10 years old. And I have seen people shoot \n     another person. One night I had heard gunshots. I looked out \n     the window and saw a man running, and another man lying on \n     the street. He was shot about fifty times. My uncle was shot \n     on Christmas night on his way home from work.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is the real world. This is \nwhat is happening out there. How can we stand by and not do anything?\n  I speak as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have been on \nthis committee for as long as I have been in the Senate. I am a \nsupporter of the juvenile justice bill. That day when we debated four \ncommonsense, targeted gun measures--all of them, I thought, no-\nbrainers--I was so proud to be a Member of this body. I remember that \nSenator John Ashcroft moved an amendment to say that youngsters, \nchildren, could not buy assault weapons. That was a no-brainer. It went \nthrough this body. The second amendment was on trigger locks. My \ncolleague from California and others in this body have championed \nthat--that is, that guns should have trigger locks. That way, a 6-year-\nold can't use the gun.\n  A 5-year-old from Memphis, TN, took a gun to school to kill his \nkindergarten teacher because the teacher gave him a ``time-out'' the \nday before. A simple $15 gun lock, or trigger lock, would have stopped \nthat from happening. That was the second measure. Plugging the gun show \nloophole so that children from a school can't go to a gun show and buy \na gun, no questions asked, was the third one.\n  The fourth one was mine, to prohibit the importation of these big \nclips that are coming in from all over the world by the tens of \nmillions. Some of them are as big as 250 rounds.\n  Those are four simple, commonsense, targeted gun regulations. And \nwhat has happened? Nothing. The children from Columbine came here and \nthey begged for help, as did the children in these letters, and what \nhappens? Nothing. I talk to Members of the Senate and I ask, ``Why is \nnothing happening?'' They tell me that the Gun Owners of America are \nreally resolved that they don't want any legislation.\n  We say the time has come to recognize that the majority of our people \nhave certain basic rights--that our children have the right to go to \nschool without fear, that our children have the right to sleep without \nhearing gunshots, that you have the right to walk down the street and \nnot fear getting killed by a drive-by shooter.\n  In Los Angeles, in the last 16 years, over 7,000 people have been \nkilled by drive-by shooters. That is what the plethora, the abundance, \nthe avalanche of guns in this country is doing to the real world \noutside of this beltway.\n  I say to those who yield to this special, unrelenting interest that \nsays, ``You either vote our way or we will defeat you at the polls,'' \nthat the American people have had enough, and the time has come to pass \nsome targeted, commonsense regulations.\n  The resolution of my colleague from California is a beginning. It at \nleast puts us on record. Hopefully, if it should pass, it will send a \nmessage to the Judiciary Conference Committee of both these noble \nHouses. That message is: Pass the juvenile justice bill, and pass these \nfour targeted measures.\n  I defy any Member of this House or the other House to tell me that \nthe second amendment of the Constitution of the United States prohibits \nthe regulation of firearms.\n  Let me add one thing. Today in gun shops all around this great \ncountry they are selling .50 caliber weapons, a military weapon, a \nweapon capable of sending a bullet 4 miles, a weapon capable of \nproducing a shot that can go through a concrete wall. Tell me that we \nneed weapons such as this in a civilized society. Tell me that the \nsecond amendment of the Constitution prevents us from regulating \nfirearms. Tell me that these children begging to be safe and to not \nhear gunshots at night, to not get shot in the car, and not to stand in \na living room and have a bullet come through their wall are wrong.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her good work. I add my \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: -Date: -\nSubformat:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I say to my friend from California how proud I am to have her \nsupport. She brought to the floor of the Senate today the voices of the \nchildren. How can we possibly have a bill dealing with education that \ndoesn't address these voices begging us to act?\n  I am so pleased she took the time because I know she has another \namendment which she has to get ready for. I appreciate the Senator \ncoming over to the floor.\n  Thirteen children every single day are killed by gun violence--13 \ninnocent lives. There is not one Senator who doesn't agree with the \nstatement that our children are our future. How many times do we put \nthat in our speeches?\n  I am saddened that I don't see Members from the other side of the \naisle on the floor. I don't understand why we don't have unanimity in \nthis. In April, it is going to be a year since the tragedy of \nColumbine. The vision of that tragedy is on everyone's mind--the young \nman, not even 18 years old, trying to get out of the window of a school \nlibrary with his limbs dangling from the injuries he received, the \nfaces of the parents, and the tearing apart of that community, which \nhas been happening ever since that tragedy. If we don't act by that \ndate, we don't deserve to be here.\n  I agree with Senator Feinstein. This is harsh talk, yes. But what are \nwe\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\nhere for if we are not protecting our citizens and our children? What \ncould be more important? An education savings account that gives people \n$7 a year? That is lovely. Great. But what does it mean if they lose \nthe child for whom they are saving this money?\n  This is in many ways, yes, an emotional issue. It is frustrating for \nso many of us.\n  Senator Feinstein told you about the four commonsense gun control \nmeasures that were voted out of the Judiciary Committee and that passed \non this floor. There was one more that requires the Federal Trade \nCommission and the Attorney General to study the gun industry's \nmarketing practices for children. I think the American people would be \nstunned to know these manufacturers are now producing shocking pink \nguns and green guns and guns that look like camouflage. They are making \nreal guns now look like toy guns. We used to have a problem with toy \nguns looking like real guns. Now they are making real guns look like \ntoy guns. That needs to be studied, too.\n  This is an amazing place. I offered the simplest amendment to an \nappropriations bill that passed unanimously. All it said was, if you \nare obviously inebriated--in other words, drunk--you cannot walk into a \ngun store and buy a weapon. Talk about a no-brainer.\n  We already have a law that says if the vendor thinks you are high on \ndrugs, you can't buy a gun. So we said: Gee, this must have been an \noversight. And after a little bit of debate, the other side said: Oh, \nOK. That is fine. They asked if I thought there ought to be a \nbreathalyzer test. No. Of course not; this is just common sense. If you \nwalk in and you are, obviously, inebriated such that it is obvious to \nthe vendor, he or she cannot sell you a gun. It passed unanimously. But \nsomething happened on the way out of the conference. When the bill came \nback--the appropriations bill for Commerce-State-Justice--guess what \nwas missing? This amendment. A simple amendment such as that was \ndropped because the NRA didn't like it.\n  Let us not be vague about this. This is what it was.\n  We have to start thinking about the welfare of the people of this \ncountry, the welfare of the children of this country, the well-being of \nthe families of this country, and the well-being of the students of \nthis country ahead of some special interest group that has it in its \nhead that because you would enact a few sensible gun control measures \nyou are threatening the country. No one is threatening the country.\n  Our European friends look at us; they cannot believe it. Our Japanese \nfriends look at us; they cannot believe it because of these rates of \ndeath.\n  To me it is not even common sense to argue with them that we are \nright and they are wrong. This is from 1996: New Zealand, 2 people were \nmurdered by guns; in Australia, 13; in Japan, 15; in Great Britain, 30; \nCanada, 106 in that year; Germany, 213; and, in the United States, in \nthat same year, 9,390 of us died by gunshot wounds.\n  What are we doing? Nothing is the answer. We are doing nothing \nbecause of a special interest that gives a lot of money.\n  This is a war that is going on in this country. In 11 years of the \nVietnam war, which was a tragedy, 58,168 of our citizens were killed. \nTheir families will never be the same and they have never been the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, 58,168 of our brave men and women were killed in 11 \nyears of the Vietnam war where this country came to its knees. Do you \nknow how many gun deaths there were in America in 11 years? 396,572. \nLet me say that again: In 11 years of the Vietnam war, roughly 58,000 \ndeaths; in 11 years of gun violence rampant in our country, 396,000-\nplus deaths.\n  Does it make any sense that our country would come to its knees over \nthe Vietnam war--as we all did, whatever side one was on--and have the \nbiggest debate we have ever had in the history of our country over a \nwar--many Members got into politics because of that situation--and yet \nwith 396,572 gun deaths in America over the same period of time we \ncannot get out of the conference committee five commonsense gun control \nmeasures?\n  It is not to be believed.\n  In 49 days it will be the 1-year anniversary of Columbine. In this \nsensible measure before the Senate, we are calling for the President, \nthe Senate, and the House to work together and get these commonsense \nproposals into law. That must be the finish line. Mr. President, 49 \ndays; that is a long time. It is enough time to do this job. After all, \nthese proposals have gone through rigorous debate and they have passed.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that before April 20, 2000, \n     Congress shall make schools safe for learning by implementing \n     policies that will reduce the threat of gun violence in the \n     schools.\n\n  Pretty simple.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a listing of \nthe recent school shootings in our Nation and, in addition, a list of \nthe multiple shootings in general, in public places such as McDonald's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am very proud that Senators came to the floor, with \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\nvery busy schedules, on behalf of this amendment.\n  Again, I don't know whether the Republican side of the aisle will \nsupport this amendment. I hope they will. I cannot imagine why they \nwould fail to support it. I want to have a vote on this. I want \neveryone to be on record. If they vote for this, they are saying that \nby April 20 we should have these proposals back before the Senate on \nthe way to the President's desk.\n  How many more shootings is it going to take? How many more people \nhave to write condolence notes or call parents and families? I trust, \nmy friends, that we will not take any more time. We have done the heavy \nlifting. We have had the debate. We have had the Vice President in the \nChair. He has cast the tie-breaking vote so that we can close the gun \nshow loophole. God bless him for that. Without him in that Chair, that \nwould not have happened. Closing that gun show loophole means people \nwho are mentally imbalanced, people with a criminal record, people who \nare underage, will not get guns.\n  I could spend a long time on this floor reading more into the record \nabout these instances that have occurred in our Nation, but I think I \nhave said what I have to say. I trust the other side will not offer a \nsecond-degree amendment to this. I trust the other side will reach over \nand take the hand of those on this side of the aisle who believe it is \nimportant to work on this in a bipartisan fashion.\n  How much time remains of the 45 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with \nthe time being counted equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time in discussing \nthe Boxer amendment for a moment.\n  First, I came to the floor to commend Senator Boxer for her amendment \nand applaud her for her leadership in drawing attention once again to \nthis very important matter. This amendment simply highlights the fact \nthat students can't learn when they are afraid.\n  Why are they afraid? They are afraid because too many communities and \ntoo many children live worried that today's playground will be \ntomorrow's crime scene. This week's tragedy in Michigan is just one \nmore bloody reminder of this phenomena.\n  As the President stated today, now is the time for us--for the \nAdministration, for the Congress--to do its part to respond. So, I say \nwith as much heartfelt emphasis as I can, now is the time for Congress \nto stop stalling.\n  It was on May 20 of 1999 that the Senate passed the juvenile justice \nbill. That was over 9 months ago. It was on June 17 of 1999 that the \nHouse passed the juvenile justice bill. That was over 8 months ago. \nAfter waiting weeks, on August 5 of 1999, almost 7 months ago, the \njuvenile justice conference had its first, and regrettably, only \nmeeting.\n  We are still stalled, with a phantom conference, today. Stalled in \nthat conference are measures that will help keep guns out of the hands \nof criminals and children, help keep schools safe, and provide some \nbalance, some degree of confidence that children can go to school more \nsafe and more secure than they are today.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about handgun safety locks, \nsomething that could have easily helped this week. We are talking about \na measure to close the gun show loophole. We are talking about a \njuvenile Brady bill. And we are talking about the banning of the \nimportation of high-capacity ammunition clips, once and for all. That \nis what we are talking about.\n  On virtually every one of these issues, the overwhelming majority of \nthe American people said: Why didn't you do this last year or years \nbefore? Why is it now, the year 2000, 9 months after the Senate began \nthis debate, and we still have yet to act? How many more children must \ndie? How much more must we and the American people endure? We need to \nstop listening to narrow special interests and pass these commonsense \ngun safety measures now.\n  The tragedy in Michigan should shock us all into action; although \nColumbine and Jonesboro, and countless other shootings have not seemed \nto prompt Congress into action. Just think, a 6-year-old girl lost her \nlife, lost her life, because a young boy, who probably still doesn't \nunderstand the consequences of his act, had access to a deadly weapon. \nThe truly sad fact is these tragedies happen every day in this country \nand do not generate the news attention this particular incident did. If \nthey did, we would all be in the Chamber today. If we had a daily \nrollcall of those who no longer are living as a result of our inaction, \nwe would all be called to action. Thirteen children under the age of 19 \nare killed with guns every single day, and other children suffer from \nwitnessing those deaths and fearing for their own lives.\n  I just listened to the letters by children read by Senator Feinstein. \nAll you have to do is listen to one of them. All you have to do is \nimagine a child sitting down writing that letter. A child should be \nwriting about baseball and soccer and all the good things that happen \nin school. But they are writing about fear. They are writing about \nguns. They are writing about violence. They are writing about death. I \ndo not know how much more tragedy this country has to endure before \nCongress wakes up.\n  This amendment simply asks us to recognize we need to act now. This \namendment should be more than just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It \nshould be a call to action. Today, we lay down a marker that if by \nApril 20, the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, the Congress has \nnot sent the President a juvenile justice bill that includes \ncommonsense gun safety measures, we have failed. We have failed. That \nis what this amendment is all about. That is the endeavor in which I \nhope all my colleagues will join.\n  This does not have to be, and is not, a partisan issue. This is an \neducation issue. It is a family issue. It is a life or death issue. I \nhope we all realize its consequences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been almost a year since the \ntragic shooting at Columbine High School. In literally dozens of cases \nsince then, youths have brought guns to schools, and there have been at \nleast four school shootings since Columbine. Yet in spit of wake-up \ncall after wake-up call after wake-up call, Congress has failed to act.\n  It is time for Congress to finish the job we began last year and pass \nthe gun control provisions in the juvenile justice legislation. \nStudents, parents, and teachers across America are waiting for our \nanswer.\n  We need to help teachers and school officials recognize the early \nwarning signals and act before violence occurs.\n  We need to assist law enforcement officers in keeping guns away from \ncriminals and children.\n  We need to close the gun show loophole.\n  Above all, we need to require child safety locks on firearms, so that \nwe can do all we can to prevent the senseless shocking first grade \nshooting that occurred two days ago in an elementary school in \nMichigan.\n  The Senate passed such legislation with overwhelming support last \nyear. The House of Representatives also passed its own version of this \nlegislation. It is time for House and Senate conferees to write the \nfinal bill and send it to the President, so that effective legislation \nis in place as soon as possible.\n  Every day we delay, this critical problem of gun violence affecting \nschools and children continues to fester. This is not a new problem, \nbut as this week's events have shown, it is an increasingly serious \nproblem, and Congress cannot look the other way and continue to ignore \nit.\n  The public overwhelmingly supports more effective steps to keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals and juveniles. We cannot accept ``NO'' \nfor an answer from the National Rifle Association. It is long past time \nfor Congress to face up to this challenge. The continuing\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\nschool shootings are an urgent call to action to every Member of \nCongress. Will we finally do what it takes to keep children safe? Or \nwill we continue to sleepwalk through this worsening crisis of gun \nviolence in our schools and our society?\n  The lack of action is appalling and inexcusable. Each new tragedy is \na fresh indictment of our failure to act responsibly.\n  We have a national crisis, and common sense approaches are urgently \nneeded. If we are serious about dealing with youth violence, the time \nto act is now. There is no reason why this Congress cannot enact this \nneeded legislation now. This month the citizens of this country deserve \nbetter than what this do-nothing Congress has given them so far.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support Senator Boxer's sense-of-the-\nsenate amendment that Congress pass effective juvenile justice \nlegislation by the one year anniversary of the Columbine High School \ntragedy--April 20, 2000. Unfortunately, the Senate-passed Juvenile \nJustice legislation has been languishing in a House-Senate conference \nfor months.\n  Sadly, another school shooting is in the news. In Mount Morris \nTownship in the State of Michigan, a six-year-old boy fatally shot a \nsix-year-old girl at an elementary school. As a father and grandfather, \nit breaks my heart to hear about a first grader shooting one of his \nfellow classmates. And yesterday a deranged man shot five people in a \nMcDonalds in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n  I have owned firearms for many years and often enjoy target shooting \nwith my friends and family in Vermont. I understand that the vast \nmajority of gun owners in Vermont and around the country use and enjoy \ntheir firearms in a responsible and safe way.\n  I am, however, deeply disturbed by the rash of recent incidents of \nschool violence throughout the country. The growing list of schoolyard \nshootings by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, \nCalifornia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, and Georgia \nis simply unacceptable and intolerable.\n  It pains me even more to now add the Michigan elementary school \nshooting to this growing list of schoolyard shootings. This tragic \nincident of school violence took the life of a 6-year-old, Kayla \nRolland.\n  What we should be doing is redoubling our efforts to enact the Hatch-\nLeahy juvenile crime legislation and its sensible public safety \nprovisions that passed the Senate last May with 73 votes. I do not \nfault Senator Hatch. I know that he is doing what he can on this and \nthat he shares my frustration that the House-Senate conference \ncommittee has been stymied in our effort to report that measure back to \nthe House and Senate for final passage.\n  I again urge the Republican leadership in the House and Senate to \npass that bill without further obstruction and delay. Let the Congress \nact and do what it can to help end this senseless violence. Six-year-\nolds killing other 6-year-olds is unthinkable but now, tragically, all \ntoo real.\n  For more than two years, I have worked with other Senators to craft \nresponsible and effective juvenile crime legislation to curb this \nsenseless violence. Last May, the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile justice bill, S. 254, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25.\n  Our comprehensive legislation provides states and local governments \nwith resources to fund programs to prevent juveniles from committing \ncrimes and to properly handle juvenile offenders if they commit crimes.\n  Our balanced approach to juvenile justice also includes provisions to \nkeep children who may harm others away from guns. These provisions \ninclude: bans on the transfer to juveniles and the possession by \njuveniles of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips; \nincreased criminal penalties for transfers of handguns, assault \nweapons, and high capacity ammunition clips to juveniles; bans on \nprospective gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records; trigger \nlocks to be sold with all handgun sales; background checks on all \nfirearm sales at gun shows; and increased federal resources to enforce \nfirearms laws by $50 million a year.\n  But the majority refuses to move ahead with final passage of a \njuvenile justice conference report. In fact, the majority even refuses \nto reconvene the House-Senate conference to meet to discuss the bill.\n  The members of the juvenile justice conference have met only once--on \nAugust 5, 1999. That one meeting of the House-Senate juvenile \nconference was more than six months ago.\n  It is shameful that the majority refuses to act upon a final juvenile \njustice bill. A bill that would help keep guns out of the hands of \nchildren and criminals, while protecting the rights of law-abiding \nadults to use and enjoy firearms.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I support the objective of the Senator \nfrom California that the Senate should do all it can to implement \npolicies ``that will reduce the threat of gun violence in schools.''\n  I would like, however, to note that the amendment contains an \nerroneous factual finding. This amendment states that ``Every day in \nAmerica, on average, between 12 and 13 children under the age of 18 die \nof gunshots from homicides, accidental shootings and suicides.'' That \nis incorrect.\n  According to the 1997 statistics collected by the National Center for \nHealth Statistics there were 4,205 firearms-related deaths of persons \naged 0 to 19, 85 percent of whom were between the ages of 15 and 19. \nThus, the daily average stated in this amendment is young adults and \nchildren under the age of 20, not under 18 as this amendment says.\n  Of course, this number is far too high regardless of whether it is \nyoung adults and children under 18 or under 20. It is a national \ntragedy either way, and the Senate should do all it can to reduce that \nnumber. I just want to make the record clear, consistent with my belief \nthat the Senate has an obligation when it makes findings of fact to be \naccurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of the bill, the Senator from \nGeorgia, has graciously agreed to allow 5 minutes of the time on this \namendment to be yielded to the Senator from Virginia to speak on behalf \nof the Graham amendment which was a second-degree amendment to the Roth \namendment.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia. Since I am, in effect, speaking for the other side, I am \nparticularly grateful. I am in wholehearted support of the Boxer \namendment. I commend the Senator from California for all she has done \nto raise our consciousness with regard to school violence, and the very \ndifficult environment that is created for learning if we cannot \nguarantee our children go to their classrooms with relative safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2870 To Amendment No. 2869\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to spend a moment talking in \nsupport of my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, in his efforts to \nmaintain at least a semblance of fiscal discipline at a time when many \nof our colleagues are thinking primarily about how to spend the surplus \non new programs or major tax cuts. As the baby boomers head toward \nretirement, we have a responsibility to address their future needs. The \ncurrent Social Security and Medicare programs simply are not equipped \nto handle our aging population. We need to strengthen these programs, \nbut we cannot do that with our current national debt. Conventional \nwisdom has always been, in times of prosperity we save for the bad \ntimes. It is hard to fathom more prosperous times than we are currently \nenjoying. Yet we continue to avoid making tough choices that will \nprepare us for the future.\n  Until we muster the political courage to strengthen Social Security \nand Medicare, we need to focus on paying down the debt. There are three \nways to pay for our priorities. We can borrow from our parents by using \nthe Social Security trust fund, we can borrow from our children by \nadding to our Nation's debt, or we can pay for our priorities \nourselves. In my view, the only responsible approach is to pay for our \npriorities ourselves. How can we even consider tax cut legislation that \nis not paid for when we have not even determined how much of the budget \nshould be allocated to tax cuts?\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\n  We are still several weeks away from the actual debate on the budget \nresolution and even further away from an agreement. If we are going to \nvote tax legislation off the floor before the budget resolution is in \nplace, it should be paid for. That is the only responsible thing to do.\n\n  Currently, the public debt is more than $5.75 trillion. In order to \nmaintain this debt, we need to dedicate billions of dollars to making \ninterest payments. Last year alone we paid over $230 billion in \ninterest payments on the publicly held debt. Can you imagine what we \ncould do if we were able to use even one-tenth of this money on our \nNation's schools?\n  We can argue all day about the proper role of the Federal Government \nin public schools, but I assume we all agree something needs to be \ndone. We owe it to our children to give them the best head start \npossible. Mr. President, $230 billion would go a long way toward \nsolving this problem.\n  We need to remember that the surplus is what we have left over once \nwe have met all our obligations. We have not yet decided what our \nobligations are, so how can we know how much our surplus is going to be \nand how much extra money we are going to have?\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Graham amendment when it comes \nup for a vote. I yield any time that may be allotted to me.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for his courtesy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to associate my remarks with those \nof my colleagues over the past few days while we have discussed S. \n1134, the education savings accounts bill. I am pleased that education \nhas been raised as a priority by this body. Education will continue to \nbe a high-profile issue as we continue to work on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee has started to markup. At this time, I would like to \ntalk about a number of related issues that need to be addressed from \nthe Federal level.\n  I began my career as an educator. I taught music, social studies, \nmath, and other subjects in Hawaii's classrooms. I ran schools as a \nvice principal and principal. In my current position, I still come in \ndirect contact with students who travel thousands of miles from my \ngreat State of Hawaii to tell me what is good and what is bad about \ntheir education. It is no surprise that the bulk of these students are \nin public school, since 90 percent of American students are served by \nthe public school system. When I ask students what makes the biggest \ndifference in how they learn, they talk about teachers who motivate and \nthe commitment they put into subjects. When asked about how their \neducation can improve, students lament the poor conditions of \nplaygrounds and classrooms, overcrowding in classrooms, the lack of \nproper textbooks, and the need for more and better computers.\n  My colleagues have touched on these, and many other problems, as they \ndebated amendments to S. 1134. I supported the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Robb, which sought to authorize $24.8 \nbillion in school modernization bonds and a $1.3 billion grant and \nzero-interest loan program for urgent school repairs. The modernization \nbonds would build or modernize 6,000 schools and the grant/loan program \nwould finance about 8,300 urgent repair projects. Although states have \naddressed some of these needs, students are still learning in \nsubstandard conditions.\n  The Federal Government can assist with these projects. This has been \nacknowledged through the inclusion of a school construction provision \nin S. 1134. Unfortunately, this provision will only help a handful of \nschools in need, as opposed to the comprehensive assistance that would \nhave been made available if the Robb amendment were adopted.\n  Regarding the conditions in Hawaii's schools, 73 percent need to \nupgrade or repair buildings to good overall condition, 57 percent have \nat least one inadequate building feature--such as a condition related \nto plumbing or electricity--and 78 percent report at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental factor such as poor air quality or \nventilation. Because of Hawaii's temperate climate, we do not have to \nworry about having to heat our classrooms in the winter. However, we \nface other challenges such as corrosion due to the amount of salt in \nthe air from the ocean. Funding in the Robb amendment would take into \naccount the differences across states and provide assistance for the \nmyriad of problems facing our schools.\n  The Campaign to Rebuild America's Schools tells me that Hawaii faces \na $955 million cost for school modernization--nearly 80 percent for \ninfrastructure and more than 20 percent of that for technology needs. \nThe school modernization initiative would provide Hawaii's schools with \n$63 million to meet some of these needs. I will continue to work with \nmy colleagues to pass this legislation.\n\n  I have also been a long-time supporter of class size reduction \nefforts. I voted for the Murray amendment, which would continue the \nhelp to communities to hire 100,000 quality teachers to reduce class \nsize in lower grades. I was pleased to see the second installment of \nthis initiative funded through last year's appropriations process, \nwhich will provide Hawaii with more than $6 million in fiscal year \n2000. The President's budget request for fiscal year 2001 would \nincrease this funding to Hawaii to more than $8 million.\n  Our students deserve the best possible learning environment. Larger \nclasses of 30 or 35 students tend to be noisier, have greater potential \nto be disruptive, and provide less teacher time to each student, \ncompared to classes with fewer students. Many students are struggling \nthrough courses, and some of this can be attributed to their presence \nin larger classes. Impending teacher shortages will compound this \nproblem, as well as will record school enrollments that will only \nincrease, into the new millennium. The class size reduction initiative \nwould help mitigate these problems facing our school-age generations.\n  I support other amendments that were taken up and are anticipated to \nS. 1134, and I commend my colleagues for their work on this bill. These \ninclude Senator Abraham for working to provide more computers and \nincreased technology in classrooms and Senators Graham and Hutchison \nfor encouraging individuals to transition their careers into teaching. \nI also support Senator Wellstone in his ongoing effort to look at the \nlevels and effects of child poverty.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a final point about worthy \nlegislation in this area. I have a bill, S. 1487, the Excellence in \nEconomic Education Act, that would work to boost economic literacy in \nthe country. I will not offer my bill as an amendment to S. 1134 at \nthis time, but I intend to do so when the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act comes before the Senate. In this debate about education, \nI must highlight the need for us to educate Americans, starting from a \nyoung age, about the importance of many aspects of economic education: \npersonal finance, consumer education, entrepreneurship, career and \nretirement planning. It is important for our students to have a \npractical understanding of economics to help them in their daily lives, \nand my bill would help. It provides funding directly to the State and \nlocal level by giving grants to economic education councils and centers \nnationwide through the National Council on Economic Education. It also \nprovides assistance on the national level to boost resources developed \nby the National Council that help states and schools teach economics to \nteachers and students. I hope that my colleagues will support my effort \nto pass this legislation during ESEA debate.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to have this opportunity to talk about the \nimportance of education. We must continue to make significant \ninvestments in the future of this country, and we can accomplish this \nby magnifying the resources that we provide to education.\n  To finish my remarks, I would like to comment on one more thing that \nI hear\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\nfrom Hawaii's students. I am frequently impressed by the thoughtful \nideas and expressions of concern voiced by the young men and women I \nmeet. Students talk about issues that are surprisingly values-based: \nthe need to treat one another with kindness and respect. Or, as we say \nin Hawaiian, ``malama'': to take care of, to care for, or to support. \nWith all of the tragic incidents at our schools, I hope that our \nstudents can achieve a better understanding of the value of human life \nso that these incidents can be reduced. America's youth should strive \nto understand why we must treat others as we would like to be treated. \nSome of this helpful dialogue is occurring naturally, initiated by the \nstudents themselves, in our schools. We must do what we can to support \nour young people as they tangle with these often overwhelming and \ndisturbing issues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I believe a voting order has been established to begin at \n2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2870\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the understanding, there will be \n2 minutes evenly divided before we vote on the amendment. The first \nvote is on the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprescribed time for debate before this vote be vitiated and we proceed \nwith the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2870. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

My amendment increases from $500 to $2,000 the annual ESA \ncontribution. It makes the educational savings account permanent. It \nwould make employer provided educational assistance permanent. It \nremoves all tax increases and makes this a pure education tax cut bill.\n  America has waited for this education savings plan for 3 long years. \nThis legislation brings it home today. My amendment makes sure it stays \nthere for families, not just for today but for tomorrow and all the \ndays that follow.\n  I yield the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement, the next order of business is the Dorgan amendment. I have \nconferred with Senator Dorgan. He has agreed to a voice vote. I yield \nback the proponents' and opponents' time. I, of course, oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2871.\n  The amendment (No. 2871) was rejected.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may I ask one question? What happened \nto our 10-minute votes? Can we try to do these in 10 minutes?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2872\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis the Kennedy amendment No. 2872.\n  Who yields time on the Kennedy amendment?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, are there 2 minutes to a side or 1 minute \nto a side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute per side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we all know, there are scarce \neducation resources. The Federal Government only\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\nprovides 7 cents out of every dollar. The question is: How are we going \nto use those scarce resources?\n  This amendment is basic and fundamental. It says we need a well-\ntrained, qualified teacher in front of every classroom in America. That \nis what this amendment provides. We know we need 2 million teachers \nover the next 10 years. We are training 200,000. This last year, we \nemployed 50,000 unqualified teachers.\n  The situation has become so desperate that the Wall Street Journal \nnow shows the ad of Kelly Services which unveiled for the first time \nnationwide substitute teachers.\n  This amendment is simple. It provides assistance to local communities \nto recruit qualified teachers, provides current teachers with \nprofessional development, and it provides 200,000 new teachers a year \nwith trained mentors. My amendment also holds States and schools \naccountable for the results.\n  This seems to be a wiser way to expend scarce resources than the \nunderlying bill, and I hope it will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have several points to make. This \namendment was laid down in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee today. There are controversies. It embraces the idea of \nFederal intervention, but that will be settled in committee, A.\n  B, this is about the fifth time we have had to deal with an amendment \nthat makes moot the entire debate we have had for the last week and a \nhalf because it removes the funding from the education savings account, \nsweeping away 14 million people, 20 million students who will benefit, \nand, more importantly, $12 billion in new resources that will be \nvolunteered by these families for education.\n  We ought to do the same thing we have done with all these amendments \nthat make moot the proposal for which we have been fighting. I will \nvote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2872.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there probably will not be any other \nvotes until 6 or after. It has taken us an hour and 15 minutes to cast \none 20-minute vote and two 10-minute votes. Both sides are really \nsuffering from this. If it is a 10-minute vote, let's vote in 10 \nminutes.\n  If there is any remaining time on our side on the Boxer amendment, I \nyield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2874 to Amendment No. 2873\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on improving the learning \n                 environment by ensuring safe schools)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment to \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2874 to amendment No. 2873.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Every school child in America should have a safe \n     learning environment free from violence and illegal drugs.\n       (2) Violence and illegal drugs in the schools undermine a \n     safe and secure learning environment.\n       (3) Any instance of violence or illegal drugs in schools is \n     unacceptable and undermines the efforts of Congress, state \n     and local governments and school boards, and parents to \n     provide American children with the best education possible.\n       (4) In the last 12 months, there have been at least 50 \n     people killed or injured in school shootings in America.\n       (5) From 1992 through 1998, the number of referrals made by \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation for federal firearms prosecutions \n     fell 44%, which resulted in a 40% drop in prosecutions and a \n     31% decline in convictions, allowing criminals to remain on \n     the streets preying on our most vulnerable citizens, \n     including our children.\n       (6) From 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department only \n     prosecuted an average of seven persons per year for illegally \n     transferring a handgun to a juvenile.\n       (7) Since 1992, the percentage of 8th grade students using \n     marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the past 30 days has \n     increased 162%, 86%, and 50%, respectively, according to the \n     respected Monitoring the Future survey.\n       (8) The February 29, 2000, shooting at Buell Elementary \n     School in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is evidence that \n     gun violence in American schools continues, that the drug \n     culture contributes to youth violence, and that the breakdown \n     of the American family has contributed to the increase in \n     violence among American children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools \n     program that Congress soon will be considering should target \n     the elimination of illegal drugs and violence in our schools \n     and should encourage local schools to insist on zero-\n     tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2874, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending second-degree amendment be modified to reflect a first-degree \nstatus and that the time restraints be limited to 10 minutes equally \ndivided on both amendments, and following the use or yielding back of \ntime the amendments be laid aside with votes occurring at a time to be \ndetermined by the two leaders and no second-degree amendments be in \norder to either amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the votes occur in relation to \nthe Coverdell amendment to be followed immediately by a vote in \nrelation to the Boxer amendment and that no other amendments relative \nto guns be in order other than the Durbin amendment which replaces the \nReed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I apologize to my friend, \nbut I was preoccupied speaking to another Senator. We will have to go \nover the unanimous consent request again.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Would my colleague like me to read the request again?\n  Mr. REID. Please.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending second-degree amendment be modified to reflect a first-degree \nstatus and that the time restraints be limited to 10 minutes total, \nequally divided, on both amendments. That means we\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\nwould each have 5 minutes before our amendment. And following the use \nor yielding back of time, the amendments be laid aside with votes \noccurring at a time to be determined by the two leaders and no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to either amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the votes occur in relation to \nthe Coverdell amendment to be followed immediately by a vote in \nrelation to the Boxer amendment and that no other amendments relative \nto guns be in order other than the Durbin amendment which replaces the \nReed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the unanimous consent agreement \nbe amended. What the Senator from Georgia has read is just fine, but \ndue to the grace of the Senator from California, she has agreed to \nallow Senator Bingaman to offer the Kennedy amendment next. That would \nbe the next amendment that would be offered. Senator Bingaman has asked \nfor 8 minutes on his side.\n  After that, for the information of other Senators, following that \nwill be, of course, the Feinstein amendment. Senator Feinstein has been \nhere all day waiting to offer her amendment. After that, Senator \nLandrieu; Senator Landrieu is going to make a statement for \napproximately a half an hour. She will not require a vote, she has \nindicated to us. Following that, there would be an amendment by Senator \nJohn Kerry, and he has asked for 7 minutes on his side. Following that, \nwould be Senators Schumer, Boxer, Durbin, and Wellstone.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have no objection. That is basically just embracing \nthe order of amendments on the other side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want \nto be clear that I will have a second-degree amendment to the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. You have a right to do that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest that the unanimous consent \nrequest be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request being so \nmodified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SAFE LEARNING \n                   ENVIRONMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Every school child in America should have a safe \n     learning environment free from violence and illegal drugs.\n       (2) Violence and illegal drugs in the schools undermine a \n     safe and secure learning environment.\n       (3) Any instance of violence or illegal drugs in schools is \n     unacceptable and undermines the efforts of Congress, state \n     and local governments and school boards, and parents to \n     provide American children with the best education possible.\n       (4) In the last 12 months, there have been at least 50 \n     people killed or injured in school shootings in America.\n       (5) From 1992 through 1998, the number of referrals made by \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation for federal firearms prosecutions \n     fell 44%, which resulted in a 40% drop in prosecutions and a \n     31% decline in convictions, allowing criminals to remain on \n     the streets preying on our most vulnerable citizens, \n     including our children.\n       (6) From 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department only \n     prosecuted an average of seven persons per year for illegally \n     transferring a handgun to a juvenile.\n       (7) Since 1992, the percentage of 8th grade students using \n     marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the past 30 days has \n     increased 162%, 86%, and 50%, respectively, according to the \n     respected Monitoring and Future survey.\n       (8) The February 29, 2000, shooting at Buell Elementary \n     School in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is evidence that \n     gun violence in American schools continues, that the drug \n     culture contributes to youth violence, and that the breakdown \n     of the American family has contributed to the increase in \n     violence among American children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools \n     program that Congress soon will be considering should target \n     the elimination of illegal drugs and violence in our schools \n     and should encourage local schools to insist on zero-\n     tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest to anybody trying to figure \nout their schedule that we are not likely to see any votes until 6 or \nafter. We would begin with the Coverdell-Boxer amendments and then \nfollow down the amendments as enumerated by the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2875\n\n         (Purpose: To increase funding for Federal Pell Grants)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Reed, and Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. \n     Kennedy, for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Feingold, \n     and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 2875.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 101 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101. FEDERAL PELL GRANTS.\n\n       There are appropriated to carry out subpart 1 of part A of \n     title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1070a) $1,200,000,000, which amount is equal to the projected \n     revenue increase resulting from striking the amendments made \n     to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by section 101 of this \n     Act as reported by the Committee on Finance of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes of the 8 \nminutes allocated for advocating this amendment. Then I will defer to \nSenator Feingold.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It would provide an \nadditional $1.2 billion for the Pell Grant Program. I think all of us \nwho have paid any attention to Federal support for education know that \nthe one program that is most helpful to those trying to go to college \nin our States is the Pell grant. We have a great many young people in \nthis country--and some of them not so young--who are taking advantage \nof this program. In fact, we have nearly 4 million people in this \ncountry who receive Pell grants every year. The average size of those \nPell grants this year will be a little over $2,000. This amendment \nsays, let's take the funds that were otherwise provided as a $5-per-\nstudent tax benefit in this pending bill and increase by $400 the \nmaximum grant for Pell grants. The current limit on what can be \nprovided in the Pell grant is $3,300 per year. We say, let's raise that \nto $3,700 per year.\n  Now, most students don't get that maximum amount, but we want to have \nthe opportunity there for them to get the maximum amount, if possible. \nThe estimate we have is that, today, the maximum grant permitted under \nthe Pell Grant Program is 86 percent of the 1980 value of the Pell \ngrant in constant dollars. The simple fact is that we are not keeping \nup with the increase in the cost of higher education. We used to \nprovide substantial support by providing grants and much less in the \nway of loans. In the time I have been in the Senate, we have seen that \nchange dramatically. Now we provide loans but little in the way of \ngrants. This amendment would help to correct that to some small degree. \nThis is very meaningful for my State. Over $64 million, this year, goes \nto Pell grants, and that amount would increase if the amendment I have \noffered on behalf of Senator Kennedy and the other Senators is \naccepted.\n  The average family income for families whose children are taking \nadvantage of the Pell Grant Program is $14,500 a year. So if a Senator \nis concerned about getting the money to where it is most needed--to the \nfamilies who most need that money for education--this amendment will do \nthat. It takes money that otherwise is being spread to many people who \nare much better off than that and concentrates it where the families \nneed it the most--in this case, the families who are eligible for Pell \ngrants.\n  This $400 increase will translate into 96,000 new recipients of Pell \ngrants this next year. In May of 1999, the Health and Education \nCommittee that Senator Jeffords heads and of which Senator Kennedy is \nthe ranking member passed a bipartisan resolution to increase the basic \nPell grant by $400, which is exactly what this amendment does.\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\n  We have a chance with this amendment to make good on that promise \nwith real money for a change and not just a resolution. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to put aid to needy college kids ahead of the tax \nbreaks that are provided in this bill for families or individuals who \nare much better off.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment of Senator Bingaman and Senator Kennedy to raise the maximum \nindividual Pell grant to $3,700, an increase of $400.\n  Higher education is one of the most vital keys to open the door to \nsuccess in this country. Without a college degree, or significant \npostsecondary education, it is a lot harder to find a successful path \nthrough today's labor market. Without Pell grants, many individuals \nsimply can't consider college. Without a college degree or serious \npostsecondary training, some employers won't consider hiring these \nindividuals.\n  In general, workers with a bachelor's degree are much better off \nfinancially compared to less-educated workers. In 1998, the average \nmale college graduate earned about 92 percent more than the average \nhigh school graduate.\n  While I commend the supporters of this legislation for their desire \nto promote increased access to an affordable higher education, I think \ntheir approach is seriously flawed. Specifically, I take exception with \nthose who believe that the education IRA component of this legislation \nis the best way to help increase accessibility to affordable education. \nInstead of helping those truly in need, as Senator Bingaman has said, \nthis provision would disproportionately help the most affluent families \nand provide little or no assistance to low- and middle-income families.\n  A Treasury analysis concluded that 70 percent of the tax benefits \nfrom this provision would go to the top 20 percent of all taxpayers. \nNow, in sharp contrast to these targeted tax breaks, Pell grants \nprovide essential financial assistance to those who are truly in need. \nUnfortunately, the individual Pell grant award has not kept pace with \nthe rising cost of a postsecondary education. In fact, I have been told \nthat the maximum Pell grant has declined in constant dollars by 14 \npercent over the last 20 years.\n  This decline is even more significant when we look at the rising cost \nof a college education. Over the past 10 years, tuition alone has \nincreased by 41 percent at 4-year private colleges, and 53 percent at \n4-year public colleges and universities. What is even more troubling \nabout the trends of increasing tuition and decreasing grant value is \nhow students, especially low-income students, make up the difference \nbetween aid and tuition. Because of a decreasing real value of \nassistance, such as the Pell grant, more and more students are relying \non debt to finance their college education. Last year alone, the number \nof students who took out non-Federal loans increased by 25 percent. \nThese loans inevitably are, in large part, the reason students are \nleaving college with more and more debt every year.\n  One of the other concerning trends is the emergence of a widening \neducational gap between the rich and poor. Statistic after statistic \nillustrates that students from low-income families are pursuing a \npostsecondary education at a much lower rate than individuals from \nupper- and middle-income families. By supporting an increase for the \nPell Grant Program, Congress has a chance to address this growing \ndisparity. After all, Congress created need-based student financial aid \nprograms to ensure that individuals from low-income families are not \ndenied postsecondary education because they cannot afford it.\n  The Pell Grant Program is vital to paving the way to an affordable \nhigher education. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nsupport a real increase in the individual Pell grant award. I thank my \nfriend from New Mexico for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Your side had 8 minutes?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will keep my remarks within that same constraint.\n  Let me say that every year since the Republicans gained the majority \nwe have worked to increase the maximum Pell grant. For more than 7 \nyears, the Pell grant maximum fluctuated between $2,300 and $2,400. \nLast year, the President's budget cut the Pell grant. But we have been \ndedicated on this side.\n  This is about the seventh time I have lost track of an amendment that \nhas come from the other side. They may have a laudable goal, but the \nunderlying goal is to make moot the central premise of the legislation \nwe are discussing, which is to allow families to set up education \nsavings accounts.\n  If you take the amendment the way it is constructed, it obliterates \nthe possibility to set up these education savings accounts, which means \n14 million people will not set up an account who otherwise would. Of \nthe 20 million children in school, almost half the population will not \nbe beneficiaries of the account that otherwise would. But, more \nimportantly, $12 billion that would be accumulated voluntarily in these \naccounts to help education at every level--kindergarten through \ncollege--would go away similar to snuffing out a candle. It makes no \nsense to do that.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin cited statistics from the Treasury \nDepartment that we can't get but the Joint Tax Committee finds \nincorrect, which is that 70 percent of all benefits from these savings \naccounts will go to families making $75,000 or less.\n  I will tell you why that is undoubtedly the correct analysis--because \nthe people who would open these savings accounts are identical by \ncriteria to those who can open up the college savings account the \nPresident and the Congress passed several years ago. It is identical. \nThe same families who can use those accounts are the ones to whom these \naccounts would apply. I don't think the President or the Congress \npassed an education savings account for people driving around in black \nlimousines. It was means tested to help the middle class or less, and \nthe identical means testing applies to this amendment that this \namendment would obviate.\n  I yield the floor. I believe the next order of business is Senator \nFeinstein.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment that was just offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is a \nset-aside.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2876\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for achievement standards and assessment of \n             student performance in meeting the standards)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Sessions, Byrd, \nand Lieberman, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein) for herself, \n     and Mr. Sessions, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2876.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. ACHIEVEMENT STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT \n                   PERFORMANCE.\n\n       In order to receive Federal funds under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 each local educational agency \n     and State educational agency shall--\n       (1) require that students served by the agency be subject \n     to State achievement standards in the core curriculum, to be \n     determined by the State, for all elementary through secondary \n     students; and\n       (2) assess student performance in meeting the State \n     achievement standards at key transition points, such as \n     grades 4, 8, and 12, before promotion to the next grade \n     level.\n\n     SEC. ____. POLICY PROHIBITING SOCIAL PROMOTION.\n\n       (a) Policy.--No education funds appropriated under the \n     Elementary and Secondary\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\n     Education Act of 1965 shall be made available to a local \n     educational agency in a State unless the State demonstrates \n     to the Secretary of Education that the State has adopted a \n     policy prohibiting the practice of social promotion.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``practice of \n     social promotion'' means a formal or informal practice of \n     promoting a student from the grade for which the \n     determination is made to the next grade when the student \n     fails to achieve a minimum level of achievement and \n     proficiency in the core curriculum for the grade for which \n     the determination is made.\n       (c) Waiver Prohibited.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Secretary of Education may not waive the \n     provisions of this section.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators Sessions, Byrd, \nLieberman, and I are offering an amendment to address one of the most \nsignificant detriments to good education in our public schools. That is \nthe practice of passing children on to the next grade regardless of \nwhether they make passing grades. It is called social promotion. While \nthis practice may be politically correct, it has, I believe, become the \nsingle most important factor leading to the decline in quality of \npublic education in America.\n  Under our amendment, in order to receive Federal funds, States would \nbe required to prohibit the practice of social promotion and adopt \nachievement standards in the core academic subjects. Decisions about \nhow to implement a nonsocial promotions policy would be left to the \nStates and localities.\n  Implicit in the amendment is that remedial education is necessary and \ncan be provided through a number of different Federal, State, and local \nsources.\n  This amendment is carefully written so that implementation is left \nwith State and local governments. For example, State and local \nofficials would decide all specifics of promotion policy and the \ncriteria for passing and holding back students, achievement standards, \nsubjects that constitute the core curriculum, grades when students \nwould be tested, grading methods, testing methods, and remedial \neducation.\n  The amendment defines social promotion as a formal or informal \npractice of promoting a student from the grade for which the \ndetermination is made to promote or not to promote to the next grade \nwhen the student fails to achieve a minimum level of achievement and \nproficiency in the core curriculum for the grade for which the \ndetermination is made.\n  The amendment covers elementary through secondary grades--grades 1 \nthrough 12. It is carefully crafted so that reform changes could be \nmade incrementally, grade by grade, or in any fashion the State or \nlocal school districts see fit.\n  Social promotion misleads our students, their parents, and the \npublic. Even educators have concluded that it doesn't work.\n  Let me give you the conclusion of a study conducted by the American \nFederation of Teachers. I quote:\n\n       Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school \n     failure and creates problems for everyone: For kids who are \n     deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be \n     successful, or get the message that achievement doesn't \n     count; for teachers who must face students who know that \n     teachers wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for \n     the business community and colleges that must spend millions \n     of dollars on remediation; and for society that must deal \n     with the growing proportion of uneducated citizens unprepared \n     to contribute productively to the economic and civic life of \n     the nation.\n\n  The American Federation of Teachers has said that social promotion is \nrampant and that only 22 States have standards in the four core \ndisciplines of English, math, social studies, and science that are well \ngrounded in content and that are clear and specific enough to be used.\n  They surveyed 85 of the Nation's 820 largest school districts in 32 \nStates representing one-third of the Nation's public school enrollment.\n  None of the districts in the AFT national survey has an explicit \npolicy of social promotion. But almost every district has an implicit \npractice. According to the U.S. Department of Education, a third of \nstudents across the United States perform below the basic level of \nproficiency; 15 percent who graduate from high school cannot balance a \ncheckbook or write a letter to a credit card company to explain an \nerror on a bill.\n\n  Mike Wright, a San Diegan, told the San Diego Tribune he continued to \nget promoted from grade to grade and even graduated from high school \neven though he failed subjects. At the age of 29, he enrolled in a \ncommunity college to learn to read.\n  Let me talk for a moment about social promotion in Los Angeles.\n  School officials decided they would end the practice. That is the \ngood news. The bad news was that if it were done all at once, they \nfound that one-half of the entire student population --350 students--\nwould have to be held back. More than two-thirds of eighth graders \nwould be flunked if social promotion were fully ended.\n  The problem was so massive that they have had to scale back their \nplans and implement the new policy more slowly. They have taken a \nmultistep, phased-in plan, and this legislation is structured to give \nschool officials the flexibility to do just that.\n  I would like to read a letter sent to me yesterday from the \nsuperintendent of that school district, a man who was superintendent of \npublic instruction when I was mayor of San Francisco and whom I respect \ngreatly. He points out:\n\n       One of the solutions is to institute an intensive program \n     of standards-based promotion, eliminating the dastardly \n     practice of social promotion that has advanced the student \n     from one grade to the next without having learned what was \n     required in his current grade. In its initial phase, we are \n     targeting the second and eighth grade and focusing on \n     reading, because that is the foundation of all learning. Our \n     program is very practical in design, and is based on \n     classroom space, materials, professional development, and the \n     availability of staff.\n       It would be my proudest hope that we can and will provide \n     the education for our children of poverty that they deserve. \n     These are the disadvantaged, who in this district are \n     predominantly children of color. I see the end of social \n     promotion as a way to ensure that all children will have \n     the basic skills to become contributing Members of their \n     community.\n\n  The Governor of California, Gov. Gray Davis, has endorsed our \namendment. In a February 29 letter to me he wrote:\n\n       I write to express my support for your amendment that \n     provides for achievement standards, assessment of student \n     performance in meeting those standards, and an end to the \n     practice of social promotion. As you know, improving \n     education in California is my first, second, and third \n     priority. Last year, I sponsored the California Public \n     Schools Accountability Act which established a comprehensive \n     high stakes school accountability system, the various \n     components of which will be phased in over the next several \n     years. Your amendment will provide an added impetus to \n     reinforce our State's commitment to ensuring the achievement \n     of all students.\n\n  Mr. President, at least half of my State's 5.6 million students \nperform below their grade level. California ranks 36th out of 39 States \nin fourth grade reading proficiency, 32nd out of 36 States in eighth \ngrade reading proficiency, 41st out of 43 States in fourth grade math \nperformance.\n  Let me speak about Chicago, the major city of the Presiding Officer. \nOn June 1, I took a group of top-level California educators and experts \nto Chicago and spent the day discussing what was being done. In \nChicago, they have abolished social promotion. They have established \ncontent standards. They test student performance in meeting the \nstandards. They have adopted a core curriculum, teacher lesson plans. \nThey evaluate schools on a regular cycle. They intervene with failing \nschools. They have performance criteria for teachers and principals and \nthey put in place extensive remedial and afterschool programs providing \nthe very necessary help for struggling students. The Chicago school \ndistrict is 90 percent minority and 90 percent poverty.\n  If it can be done in Chicago, it can be done everywhere else. The \nresults are there: Reading, up 12 percent; math, up 14 percent. Scores \nare improving.\n  Chicago stands as an example, but it takes political will and courage \nto make these changes. Our legislation provides the incentive.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia and appreciate being able to work together with the Senator \non this\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nimportant piece of legislation and with the others who are cosponsoring \nit.\n  I think this Senate will come together, both sides of the aisle. The \ntime has come. We know social promotion, the concept of moving kids \nalong when we have failed to make sure they have learned the basics of \nthe course level in which they should be operating, is the wrong thing \nto do. I believe that very strongly. I think the American people \nunderstand it and care about it.\n  We need to identify, at the earliest possible time, children who are \nfalling behind. If we do not have a core curriculum, if we do not have \nstandards, and we cover up or we deny what is happening when we know \nstudents are not getting the required amount of knowledge in school, it \nis time to confront this.\n  In some ways we are utilizing that psychiatric principle called \n``enabling.'' We are enabling bad behavior to successfully continue \nunacceptable behavior, unacceptable performance by a school system, \nunacceptable performance by students.\n  It is time to confront that, not because we want to be mean or harsh \nbut because we love these children. We care about the children. If we \nlove them and if we care about them, we will set reasonable and tough \nstandards; we will insist they adhere to them. When we find out they \nare not consistently adhering to them, we find ways to get them to the \nlevel they need.\n  Maybe their parents need to be more involved. Some say: I didn't know \nBilly was that far behind.\n  If we end social promotion, they will know; if there is testing, they \nwill know. Maybe they need a member of the family to help with the \nhomework. Maybe a tutor would be appropriate. Something has to be done. \nThe school systems are going to have to participate better, also.\n  We had an incident in Alabama not long ago where a former all-pro \nfootball player could not pay his child support and could not get a \njob. He said the reason he couldn't get a job was because he couldn't \nread and write.\n  Such a sad statement. Too often in America we are passing kids along \nwho have not learned how to read and write effectively. They are not \ngoing to be able to perform effectively in the commercial sector, and \nthey are not going to be able to care for their families effectively.\n  Alabama has adopted one of the toughest programs in the Nation. The \nFordham Foundation says it is the toughest. They have tested the 4th, \n8th and 11th grades. We will do that this year. We want to know at what \nlevel the children are operating. A 60-person commission is undertaking \nright now a detailed study on how to implement the end of social \npromotion. It is something that ought to be done around this country. \nWe want our education system in Alabama to be better. I want it to be \nbetter all over America. I know we can do that.\n  There are a number of things we have to recognize when we ask: Is \nthis really a problem; do we need to confront this?\n  American 12th graders rank 19th out of 21 industrial nations in \nmathematics achievement and 16th out of 21 nations in science. Our \nadvanced physics students rank dead last.\n  Since 1983, 10 million Americans have reached the 12th grade without \nhaving learned to read at a basic level. Over 20 million have reached \ntheir senior year unable to do basic math. Almost 25 million have \nreached the 12th grade not knowing the essentials of U.S. history.\n  In 1992, a Department of Education survey found between 21 and 23 \npercent--more than 1 out of 5--or 40 million of the 191 million adults \nin this country were in the bottom 5th of literacy assessment \nproficiency categories.\n  We are saying we do care about education. That is not always \nreflected in how much money we spend. I hope we can continue to spend \nmore. We increased the budget this year substantially over last year, \nand we will increase the education budget next year.\n  Kansas City brought their per pupil spending up to $11,700 and \nbrought down the student teacher ratio to 13-1 without seeing any \nincrease in test scores.\n  What is it that we are about? I think children respond to challenges. \nI think children reach up to the level they are asked to reach, that \nthey are expected to reach. If we set reasonable standards and we \nchallenge students to meet them, and the teachers are motivated to make \nsure the children reach certain standards, and parents get engaged \nbecause they know what the tests are going to be like and they want to \nbe sure their children meet those standards, this will increase \nlearning more in this country than any other thing we can do.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation with the Senator from \nCalifornia. I think it will have broad support in this body.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who seeks recognition? The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do my colleagues have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls 13 \nminutes. The opposition has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall not take all my time. I will be \ninterested in hearing from my colleagues. Then I will have a second-\ndegree amendment after this debate is over.\n  I hope Senators will look at the empirical evidence. I appreciate the \nsentiment behind this amendment, but I think it is profoundly mistaken. \nPart of the language reads:\n\n       No education funds appropriated under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be made available to a \n     local educational agency in a State unless the State \n     demonstrates to the Secretary of Education that the State has \n     adopted a policy prohibiting the practice of social \n     promotion.\n\n  Then it goes on to be a definition.\n  I want my colleagues to carefully examine the evidence. I want to \noffer a second-degree amendment which says these provisions would apply \nas long as we make sure every child has the same opportunity to learn.\n  We had testimony in the HELP Committee from Dr. Hauser, who is a \nprofessor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He \nhas received numerous awards. He also serves on the Board of Test and \nAssessment for the National Research Council. He is a prolific writer, \na very key researcher in the field.\n  Can I summarize his findings? His findings related to social \npromotion:\n\n       Students who have been held back typically do not catch up. \n     Low-performing students learn more if they are promoted even \n     without remedial help than if they are held back. Students \n     who have been held back are much more likely to drop out \n     before completing high school. The long-term costs of holding \n     students back are high to students and to school systems. The \n     negative effect of holding students back are often \n     invisible to those who make retention decisions because \n     they occur many years later.\n\n  I now wish to move on to some of the critical findings. There is \nabundant evidence which shows that this practice of high stakes testing \nand holding kids back as young as age 8 has not only been unsuccessful \nbut it is also harmful. It is ethically questionable, basically, to \nexperiment with our children. I am going to cite evidence. Maybe my \ncolleagues can refute it. I am not sure they can.\n  First of all, low-achieving students do better academically if they \nmove forward with their peers rather than if they are held back. Dozens \nof studies over the past two decades have found that retaining students \ncontributes to academic failure and behavioral difficulties rather than \nsuccess in school. That is the evidence.\n  I quote from ``Using Standards and Assessments To Support Student \nLearning,'' Linda Darling-Hammond and Beverly Falk. Linda Darling \nHammond addressed our caucus. She is a distinguished professor at \nStanford University. This piece was in the Phi Delta Kappan, November \n1997. A scientific review of 63 controlled studies of grade retention \nthrough the mid-1980's revealed that 54 of the 63 yielded overall \nnegative effects of retention.\n  The best of these studies have shown the negative effects of \nretention. The authors concluded that ``[o]n average, retained children \nare worse off than their promoted counterparts on both personal \nadjustment and academic outcomes.''\n  I am just giving my colleagues the evidence.\n  Ignoring educational research, too many of us and too many school \ndistricts have continued to hold out retention as educational reform \ninstead of the failed approach that it is.\n  In Chicago, they tried to do this in the 1970s and 1980s, and it \nfailed. Then\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\nthey decided to do it again. Here is some of the data that is now \nforthcoming:\n\n       In 1998, researchers Ann McCoy and Arthur Reynolds at the \n     University of Wiconsin-Madison completed longitudinal studies \n     on the population of the Chicago students retained in grade. \n     Their report, cited above, found ``[f]or all achievement \n     comparisons, retained children consistently underperformed \n     their promoted [low-achieving] peers, and usually \n     significantly. No positive effects of grade retention were \n     detected.''\n\n  There is no evidence that this works.\n\n       They concluded that grade retention is, at best, an \n     insufficient intervention strategy for promoting student \n     achievement and, at worst, it impeded children's academic \n     success and should be substantially modified or replaced by \n     programs and policies which demonstrate effectiveness . . .\n       On January 21, 1999, the New York Times reported that a \n     whopping 5,500 Chicago students are repeating the third grade \n     and 964 are repeating the third grade for a second time.\n       The Washington Post reported on August 1, 1999, that 1,300 \n     15-year-old Chicago students were sent to ``academic \n     halfway houses between the eighth and ninth grades'' \n     because of failing scores.\n\n  The evidence from all of the studies is that retention leads to \nincreased school dropouts. ``Researchers at the University of Wisconsin \nalso found that 30 percent of those who were retained dropped out of \nschool compared to 21 percent of those students who were not,'' \ncontrolling for academic ability; thus, there was a 42-percent increase \nin dropping out. That is from a piece titled ``Grade Retention Doesn't \nWork,'' Arthur Reynolds, Judy Temple, Ann McCoy, Educational Week, \nSeptember 17, 1997.\n\n       The August 21, 1999, New York Times reported preliminary \n     results showing that 35 to 40 percent of the third, sixth, \n     and eighth graders who took standardized tests at the end of \n     mandatory summer school in New York City had failed to make \n     the required score . . . Predictions are that many other \n     students will be held back.\n\n  Chicago showed similar results following mandatory summer school \nduring its first 2 years. Summer school has not moved a large extent of \nthese low-achieving students to acceptable levels of performance. They \nare held back, and when they are held back, they do not do better; they \ndo worse.\n  Research does show that there are preventive measures that do work, \nthat if you put the emphasis--are we surprised?--into early childhood \ndevelopment, it makes a huge difference.\n\n       Researchers found preschool participation was associated \n     with a 24-percent reduction in the rate of school dropout and \n     that participation for 5 or 6 years was associated with a 27-\n     percent reduction in the rate of early school dropout . . .\n\n  My second-degree amendment, which we will get to, says that the \nprovisions of this section will not apply to any child who was not \nafforded by the State educational agency or the local educational \nagency an opportunity to learn the material necessary to meet the \nachievement standards. I do not know how colleagues can be opposed to \nit. I hope we will put the two amendments together.\n  When I offer the second-degree amendment, I will list specifically \nwhat I have in mind. Again, I have cited study after study which shows \nretention has not worked. I have cited study after study which show it \nleads to increased dropout. I have cited study after study by the best \npeople in the country, including those who testified before our \ncommittee and addressed our own Democratic caucus, that this is a \nmistake. Then what I said is, at least let's make sure these children \nhave the same opportunity to achieve these results, to pass these \ntests, before we make this operational.\n  I will yield the floor and listen to my colleagues, but when we look \nat what is going on with these tests and the assessments, I hardly \nthink retention has been a successful strategy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the NAACP Legal Defense \nand Educational Fund, which is adamantly opposed to the direction of \nthis amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   September 1999.\n\n NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund Opposes ``Quick Fix'' Repeat-a-\n Grade Policies for Low-Achieving Students Because Abundant Empirical \n  Research Shows Grade Retention To Be Unsuccessful and Educationally \n     Harmful, LDF Calls for High Quality, Early and Comprehensive \n                       Educational Interventions\n\n       So-called ``end social promotion'' proposals to require \n     schools to hold low-achieving students back in grade until \n     they meet certain standards--often an arbitrarily set score \n     on a standardized test unrelated to instruction provided in \n     the classroom--have been gaining popularity recently as a \n     viable instrument of school reform. Chicago leads the list of \n     school districts that have recently adopted retention-in-\n     grade policies. This approach unquestionably is targeted \n     primarily for disadvantaged youth in failing schools. But \n     retention in grade is not new. Despite its apparent drawing \n     power, districts that have recently embraced, such as Chicago \n     and New York City, often have a record as recent as the \n     1980's of trying it and abandoning it--for good reason. They \n     learned that holding children back in grade decreased \n     achievement and increased drop outs.\n       Numerous empirical studies establish that in the vast \n     majority of cases, retention causes serious harm to those who \n     are retained. Thus, current efforts to promote retention-in-\n     grade as a sound and useful educational practice warrant \n     strong opposition. Where abundant evidence shows that an \n     educational practice is not only unsuccessful but also \n     harmful, it is at best ethically questionable to continue to \n     experiment with it on children.\n       For students who are facing learning difficulties, LDF \n     calls instead for interventions that have shown promise such \n     as high quality early childhood education, increased \n     instructional time, high quality teaching, standards and \n     corresponding curricular materials, smaller classrooms, \n     parental involvement programs, and adequate resources.\n       Large numbers of children, especially minorities and the \n     poor, are retained in grade now. While there are no national \n     statistics on the numbers of children retained in grade, \n     available data show that ``among children who entered school \n     in the late 1980's, 21 percent were enrolled below the usual \n     grade at ages 6 to 8; 28 percent were below the usual grade \n     at ages 9 to 11; 31 percent at ages 12 to 14; and this rose \n     to 36 percent at ages 15 to 17 . . . [M]inorities and poor \n     children are the most likely to be held back . . . by ages 15 \n     to 17, 45 percent to 50 percent of black and Hispanic youth \n     are below the expected grade levels for their ages.'' (``What \n     if We Ended Social Promotion?'' Robert M. Hauser, Education \n     Week, April 7, 1999.) General estimates are that by the time \n     children reach the third grade, one in five has been \n     retained. (``Grade Retention and School Performance: An \n     Extended Investigation,'' Ann McCoy and Arthur Reynolds, \n     Institute for Research on Poverty, University of \n     Wisconsin-Madison, 1998). In large, urban districts \n     upwards of 50 percent of the students who enter \n     kindergarten are likely to be retained at least once \n     before they graduate or drop out. (``Retention Policy,'' \n     Nancy R. Karweit, Encyclopedia of Educational Research, \n     Vol. 3, 6th Edition, 1992.)\n       Low-achieving students do better academically if they move \n     forward with their peers than if they are held back. ``Dozens \n     of studies over the past two decades have found that \n     retaining students contributes to academic failure and \n     behavioral difficulties rather than success in school.'' \n     (``Using Standards and Assessments to Support Student \n     Learning,'' Linda Darling-Hammond and Beverly Falk, Phi Delta \n     Kappan, November 1997.) A scientific review of 63 controlled \n     studies of grade retention through the mid-1980's revealed \n     that 54 of the 63 yielded overall negative effects of \n     retention, and the best studies showed the largest negative \n     effects of retention. The author concluded that ``[o]n \n     average, retained children are worse off than their promoted \n     counterparts on both personal adjustment and academic \n     outcomes.'' (``Grade Level Retention Effects: A Meta-Analysis \n     of Research Studies,'' (C.T. Holmes, in Flunking Grades; \n     Research and Policies on Retention, eds, L.A. Shephard and \n     M.L. Smith, 1989).\n       Ignoring educational research, politicians and school \n     districts continue to hold out retention as a promising \n     educational reform, instead of the failed approach that it \n     is. Ironically, despite research showing that retention \n     failed to improve academic achievement in the Chicago Public \n     Schools in the 1970's and 1980's, in 1996, Chicago again \n     adopted a strict retention in grade program for students in \n     the third, sixth, eighth and ninth grades. Those who fail to \n     make a set score on a norm-referenced, standardized test, the \n     Iowa Test of Basic Skills, are held back.\n       In 1998, researchers Ann McCoy and Arthur Reynolds at the \n     University of Wisconsin-Madison completed longitudinal \n     studies on populations of Chicago students retained in grade. \n     Their report, cited above, found, ``[f]or all achievement \n     comparisons, retained children consistently underperformed \n     their promoted [low-achieving] peers, and usually \n     significantly. No positive effects of grade retention were \n     detected.'' They concluded that grade retention is at best an \n     insufficient intervention strategy for promoting student \n     achievement . . . [and] [a]t worst, grade retention impeded \n     children's academic success and should be substantially \n     modified or replaced by programs and policies with \n     demonstrated effectiveness.'' Chicago presses ahead \n     nonetheless. On January 21, 1999, The New York Times \n     reported that a whopping 5,500 Chicago students are \n     repeating the third grade and 964 are repeating the third \n     grade for the second time. The Washington Post reported on \n     August 1, 1999, that 1,300 15\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\n     year old Chicago students were sent to ``academic halfway \n     houses between the eighth and ninth grades'' because of \n     failing scores.\n       Retention leads to increased school drop outs. Researchers \n     at the University of Wisconsin also found that 30 percent of \n     those who were retained dropped out of school compared with \n     21 percent of those students who were not. Thus, retention \n     was associated with a 42 percent increase in dropping out. \n     (``Grade Retention Doesn't Work,'' Arthur Reynolds, Judy \n     Temple, and Ann McCoy, Education Week, September 17, 1997.) A \n     1996 study found that only 24 percent of retained students in \n     their study graduated compared to 52 percent of their low-\n     achieving peers. (``Is Grade Retention an Appropriate \n     Academic Intervention? Longitudinal Data Provide Further \n     Insights,'' S.R. Jimerson and M.R. Schuder, June 1996.) In \n     1994, a large-scale, longitudinal study with extensive \n     statistical controls, including test scores, examined the \n     effect of grade retention on 5,500 students whose school \n     attendance was followed from 1978-79 to 1985-86. That study \n     found that students who were currently repeating a grade were \n     70 percent more likely to drop out of high school than \n     students who were not (Douglas Anderson study, cited in \n     Hauser above.) A similar study conducted in 1998 using \n     longitudinal data for almost 12,000 students and controlling \n     for academic achievement, including test scores and grades, \n     found that being held back before the 8th grade increase the \n     relative odds of dropping out by the 12th grade by a factor \n     of 2.56. (R.W. Rumberger and K.A. Larson, American Journal of \n     Education, 1998).\n       LDF urges comprehensive approaches to improve the academic \n     performance of low-achieving students. LDF recognizes that \n     the problem policy makers attempt to address with retention \n     is a difficult one. What can we do to improve the academic \n     achievement of students who are performing at low levels? \n     Simply moving them on the next grade is not the answer. LDF \n     supports an approach that keeps students in age-appropriate \n     settings while providing immediate and intensive \n     interventions to help them master the necessary skills.\n       Some lessons are evident from recent experience, such as \n     the fact that summer school alone is insufficient. The August \n     21, 1999, New York Times reported preliminary results showing \n     that approximately 35-40 percent of the third, sixth and \n     eighth graders who took standardized test at the end of \n     mandatory summer school in New York City had failed to make \n     the required score. School Chancellor Rudy Crew is quoted as \n     saying, ``It's that absolute. I am not letting kids go \n     forward if they did not pass the tests.'' Predictions are \n     that many thousands of students will be held back. Chicago \n     showed similar results following mandatory summer school \n     during its first two years. Clearly, summer school alone is \n     not effective in moving a large percentage of low-achieving \n     students to acceptable levels of performance.\n       Research does show that preventative measures are \n     critically important. A recently completed longitudinal study \n     of the Chicago Child-Parent Center program showed very \n     positive results. The program provides child education and \n     family support services from preschool through second or \n     third grade in 20 sites in Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. \n     Researchers found that preschool participation was associated \n     with a 24 percent reduction in the rate of school dropout and \n     that participation for 5 or 6 years was associated with a 27 \n     percent reduction in the rate of early school dropout, \n     relative to less extensive participation. (``Can Early \n     Intervention Prevent High School Dropout? Evidence from the \n     Chicago Child-Parent Centers,'' Judy Temple, Arthur Reynolds, \n     Wendy Miedel, August 1999.) Other studies have shown the \n     benefits of quality teacher preparation and smaller class \n     size. (``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future,'' \n     Report of the National Commission on Teaching and America's \n     Future, New York, 1996; Ronald F. Ferguson, ``Paying for \n     Public Education: New Evidence on How and Why Money \n     Matters,'' Harvard Journal on Legislation, Vol, 28, Summer \n     1991).\n       Stifling educational opportunities for thousands of low-\n     achieving students by making them repeat a grade is not only \n     unfair, it is unwise. LDF opposes punitive schemes that try \n     to flunk our way our of the effects of failing schools \n     instead of providing children with the means to experience \n     the positive and continuous educational progress necessary to \n     become productive citizens interested in life-long learning \n     and self-improvement.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think Members can now see the Catch-\n22. Of course, retention without remedial education is not going to \nwork, but there is not one who can say that our public education system \nis working with the policy of promoting youngsters even when they are \nfailures, of never coming to grips with failure and then promoting them \nand graduating them when they cannot read or write, multiply, divide, \nadd, recognize China on a map, or count change in their pocket. How do \nthey get a job in the workplace of this new millennium? They do not.\n  That is why we have had employers come in to us and say: You have to \nraise the H-1B quota. We need more foreign nationals from other \ncountries because we cannot hire public school graduates who can think, \nwho can do what they need to do, and more and more employers have to \nprovide remedial education which should be the job of the public school \nsystem.\n  I went to public school for all of my elementary school. There was a \npolicy of no social promotion, and youngsters learned. There was \nremedial education. Districts are putting that back into play now.\n  We have different statistics. My staff yesterday talked with the \nsuperintendent of the Chicago school district, and these are the \nfigures we were given:\n  No. 1, in 1996, 20.5 percent of students performed at or above \nnational norms in 9th and 11th grade reading. In May of 1999, 32.5 \npercent of students performed at that level. That is a 12-percent \nincrease in performance.\n  No. 2, he told us elementary reading scores are at their highest \nsince 1990. In 1996, 26.5 percent of students were at or above national \nnorms. In 1999, 36 percent were. That is up 10 percent.\n  No. 3, math scores are up, too. In 1996, 30 percent of children \nscored at or above national norms in elementary math. In May of 1999, \nthey had risen to 44 percent. That is up 14 percent.\n  During this time, the very mayor who put this system into effect was \nup for reelection, and the people of Chicago reelected him. The day I \nwas there, there was no question in my mind what parents thought about \nthis program. They liked it. They wanted their children to learn, \nparticularly parents of students of color. They know this is the only \nway their children are going to get the kind of education they need.\n  The President of the United States has called for ending social \npromotion. The Secretary of Education has prepared guidelines for \neducators on ending social promotion and guidelines for using Federal \nfunds to adopt sound promotion policies.\n  In 1998, the California Legislature ended social promotion. Districts \nare now implementing it. For example, San Diego school officials will \nnow require all students to earn a C overall average and a C grade in \ncore subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending social \npromotion for certain grades for high school graduation.\n  I have a hard time understanding how people can speak against having \naccountability and excellence as a goal in public education, how they \ncan rationalize this to say that the system that has brought us to be \nthe 39th among 41 industrialized nations in education is one that we \nshould not change.\n  Studies show that title I moneys are not producing the dividends we \nhad hoped they should. Better those funds be spent on remedial \neducation for poor children, better they be spent in teaching \nyoungsters the basic fundamentals than spent diffusely throughout \nschool districts and not achieving any change.\n  Public education, as we know it today, is in deep trouble. The \nAchilles' heel of education is this path of least resistance: Simply \npromoting a youngster regardless of whether they are in school, whether \nthey are a truant, whether they are getting Ds or Fs, and not worrying \nabout it because next year the light may go on and they might learn. I \nthink the facts are clear, the light does not go on.\n  I tell you, I do not buy this business about increasing dropouts \nbecause you work with them in remedial education. I do not buy that at \nall. I think that unless our schools have basic standards, hold \nteachers and students accountable for performance, public education, as \nwe know it today, will simply continue to sink below the waves.\n  I am proud that the largest State in the Union has taken some steps. \nI think if we were to target and provide the incentive that title I \nmoneys from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would only go to \nschools that were willing to observe accountability, and were willing \nto put in remedial education, and were willing to see the grades mean \nsomething, and that students are able to master basic core \nfundamentals, we would have the enlightened workforce of the future, \nwhich would mean that we would not have to continue to increase H-1B\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\nquotas to bring foreign nationals into this country to carry out some \nof the finest occupations we have that should be going to our own \nstudents.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time does my colleague from \nCalifornia have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes more in opposition under \nthe control of Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think that is my time. I am the one opposing the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I heard the Chair say that 15 minutes was \ncontrolled by Senator Coverdell, but that is not the case. I think if \nyou check with the Parliamentarian the time is controlled by whoever is \nin opposition to the amendment. At this time, that would be Senator \nWellstone.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I make a point of inquiry, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is correct. He has \n15 minutes more.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Point of inquiry: How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Six minutes. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, it would seem to me that \nif we are talking about children doing well--and we want to look at the \nevidence about what makes for a good education and equal opportunity \nfor every one of our children--then the second-degree amendment that I \nhave to this amendment would be agreed to.\n  What I am simply saying with the second-degree amendment is: Let's \nmake sure, in fact, every child has had the opportunity to learn the \nmaterial that is necessary to meet the achievement standards. Don't we \nwant to make sure that every child has had that opportunity?\n  I talk about how a child has to be taught by fully certified or \nqualified teachers as defined by the State; that the child's parents \nhave multiple opportunities for parental involvement; that the child \nhas access to high instructional materials; that the child has the \nopportunity to reach the highest performance level, regardless of \nincome or disability; that the child receives the services for which \nthe child is eligible under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act; that the child receives proper bilingual education and \nspecial education services; and that the child has good early childhood \ndevelopment. Let's get real. If you do not do that, then we already \nknow which children are going to fail. I am saying, before you start \nfailing third graders and holding them back, let's make sure every \nthird grader has the same opportunity to do well.\n  Does anybody on the floor of the Senate want to argue that you do not \nneed to do that first? When Secretary Riley testified, he said: Yes. \nLet's have standards, but let's also make sure every child has the same \nopportunity to meet those standards.\n  This is incredible. We do not make the investment in early childhood \ndevelopment. We do not have the title I money. We do not put the money \ninto bilingual education. We do not make sure these children have the \nsame support services. We do not do enough to help children who are in \nsome schools where they do not have the good teachers and they do not \nhave adequate resources.\n\n  Without doing that, and without making that commitment to every child \nhaving the same opportunity to learn--it is called equity; it is called \nequality of opportunity--then what we do is we fail these students. And \nthen we pound our chests and say: We're being rigorous, and we have \ndone something good for these children. That is my first point.\n  My second point is, in all due respect, the superintendent from the \nChicago schools can say one thing, but I say to the Senator from \nCalifornia and other Senators, I have come out on the floor and I have \ncombined the best evidence of studies around the country.\n  Again, I go to Robert Hauser, who is an acknowledged expert. He \ntestified before our HELP Committee. Here are what his findings were \nrelated to retention: Students who have been held back, they don't \ncatch up. You are not doing them any favor. Low-performing students \nlearn more even if they are promoted, even without remedial help, than \nif they are held back. Students who have been held back are much more \nlikely to drop out of school.\n  In all due respect--we talk about Chicago--there was an independent \nstudy done, the 4-year Evaluation Report of the Chicago Public Schools \nLeadership by Parents United For Responsible Education and the Chicago \nAssociation of Local School Councils. This is what they found on \nretention: rising dropout rates, declining enrollment citywide, \nincreased instructional time devoted to testing for the tests. That is \nanother thing the teachers are ending up doing, testing for the test. \nJust rote drills, memorization.\n  Then, drawing from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund \nletter, which pulled together such important research, the fact is, \nthere is abundant evidence that--frankly, I have not heard any of my \ncolleagues refute any of it--not only has retention been unsuccessful \nbut it has been harmful.\n  I cited a number of different studies. I cited the work of Linda \nDarling Hammon, who addressed us Democrats. In fact, I asked her about \nthis. She said that as we look at dozens of studies that have been done \nover the past two decades, they have found that retaining students \ncontributes to academic failure and behavioral difficulties rather than \nsuccess in school.\n  Then I went on and talked about work that the professor had also done \nwith Beverly Falk. Then, I went on and quoted from another study: \n``Grade Level Retention Effects: A Meta-Analysis of Research Studies,'' \nC.T. Holmes, in Flunking Grades: Research and Policies on \nRetention, that concluded that on average retained children are worse \noff because of retention.\n\n  Then I went on and quoted about four or five different studies of \nwhat has been going on in Chicago and New York and quoted from the \nWashington Post and the New York Times and pointed out that the summer \nschool remedial program didn't even help these kids.\n  We don't have the evidence that retention has helped these kids \nbecause there isn't the evidence. The evidence is the retention has had \na harmful effect on these kids. These kids don't do better; they do \nworse. They drop out of school. It has a devastating impact. If you \nkeep them in age-appropriate settings, you move them on, but you give \nthem the additional help. We should do that. If you want to make sure \nby the time they graduate they are, indeed, qualified, do that, but \ndon't do something that is harmful.\n  Given the evidence, I don't know how we can support this amendment \nunless my second-degree amendment is accepted, which says, again, the \nprovisions of this section shall not apply to any child who was not \nafforded by the State educational agency or the local educational \nagency an opportunity to learn the material necessary to meet the State \nachievement standards.\n  Do my colleagues mean to tell me they are going to vote for retention \nwhen the evidence shows it is harmful and they won't even vote for an \namendment that says, let's make sure that at least every child has the \nsame opportunity to pass these tests before we fail them and hurt them? \nThat is unbelievable.\n  I would be interested, if my colleagues have a lot of evidence from \nacross the country that retention has been a great reform that has \nhelped these children who have been retained, who have been flunked as \nyoung as age 8. I see no evidence.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I just read statistics given to me by \nthe superintendent of public instruction of Chicago which showed a 12- \nto 14-percent improvement in core curriculum grade scores since Chicago \nended the policy of social promotion and put in motion remedial \neducation and decreased class size and also set some standards holding \nstudents accountable for performance and teachers accountable for \nperformance as well.\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\n  I have a very difficult time with what the Senator from Minnesota is \nsaying because he is essentially calling this a policy, in a sense, of \nguaranteed retention. It is not that at all. It is a policy that says \nthere should be standards; that there should be achievement levels set \nin each of the grades; that there should be a minimum pass requirement \nfor promotion; and that schools should mean something in terms of \nlearning.\n  The problem with the amendment is it obfuscates our amendment. It \nprevents a clean vote on our amendment, and in effect it would destroy \nour amendment because it sets up a series of seven conditions which \nwould make it virtually impossible to enact our amendment.\n  For example, the child was taught by fully certified or qualified \nteachers as defined by the State. In my State, we probably have 30,000 \nteachers who are not certificated. This would mean under this \nprovision, California should not go ahead and abolish social promotion, \nput forward standards of accountability for teachers and for students, \nwhich, of course, California is now in the process, by the Governor's \nstatement, by the legislature's action, and by individual school \ndistricts, of beginning to do.\n  Secondly, that the child's parents had multiple opportunities for \nparental involvement. I don't know what multiple opportunities for \nparental involvement are, but it is not just opportunities for parental \ninvolvement. It is multiple opportunities for parental involvement, \nwhich gives a basis, again, to essentially poison what we are trying to \nachieve.\n  In addition, that the child has access to high-quality instructional \nmaterials and instructional resources to ensure that the child had the \nopportunity to achieve the highest performance level, regardless of \ndisability, income, and background, that is something we would all \nsubscribe to, but when it is put in this form, it becomes a way of \navoiding accountability and avoiding performance.\n  We do not tell a State or a local jurisdiction how to do this. This \nis up to them. As I have tried to point out, Los Angeles is now doing \nit in an incremental fashion, in a grade-by-grade fashion. I suspect \nthat schools throughout this country would implement accountability and \nstandards in a different way. That is fine with me. But what this \namendment says is, we are not going to waste taxpayers' money by \nproviding money when there is no evidence it is going to provide the \nremedial education or the kind of opportunity for students that the \nframers intended in the first place.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague says: What the Senator has \nsaid is that the child has to be taught by fully certified or qualified \nteachers.\n  You don't have that. You don't have the certified or qualified \nteachers, but you are willing to go ahead and flunk these kids.\n  I am saying the children who are in classes as young as age 8, who \ndon't have fully certified and qualified teachers, probably ought not \nto be flunked and held back because other kids in other schools who had \nhighly qualified and certified teachers were able to pass those tests. \nDon't Senators think we should include an amendment which would say \nevery child is going to have the same opportunity to pass these tests? \nThat is an incredible argument to make. To make an argument to \nSenators, wait a minute, Senators, you can't vote for the Wellstone \nsecond-degree amendment because he is saying there have to be qualified \nand certified teachers before we flunk these third graders, that is \nunbelievable. That is exactly the point of my amendment.\n  Let us have the standards, but let's make sure all the children have \nthe same opportunity to achieve those standards. If the second-degree \namendment is accepted, if passed, then we have an amendment that talks \nabout standards, but we also have an amendment that makes sure these \nchildren have the same chance to reach those standards.\n  I hate to say this but, one more time, I have presented about 10 \ndifferent studies. I have presented the best testimony we have had in \nthe Senate. I have presented the best testimony we had in our Senate \nDemocratic conference about retention. Again, we had what the \nsuperintendent of the Chicago schools said.\n  Well, I gave the Senate a different report, a 4-year independent \nevaluation: rising dropout rates, declining enrollment citywide. Then I \nhave drawn on the best research from around the country, and the \nSenator from California and the Senator from Alabama have not refuted \nany of it.\n  I don't want to repeat it again, but please vote on the facts. What \ndid they show? Students who have been held back typically don't catch \nup. Actually, low-performing students learn more if they are promoted \neven without remedial help than if they are held back. Students who \nhave been held back are much more likely to drop out.\n  With all due respect, there is not a shred of evidence that my \ncolleagues have presented which shows retention works.\n  Again, I have a second-degree amendment which says, let's at least \nmake sure every child has the same opportunity to pass these tests, \ndetermining whether or not they will pass a grade. That seems to me to \nbe reasonable. Let's make sure they have certified teachers. Let's make \nsure we fund it properly, fund title I. Let's make sure we have the \nbilingual education fund so the kids who come from homes where English \nis a second language, such as the Hmong children in St. Paul, have a \nchance. Why would that not be accepted?\n  And the second point I made is, right now, what we have out here is \nan amendment that says retention is really good, it is all about rigor \nbut there is not a shred of evidence that it works for these children. \nIn addition, it is an amendment which doesn't recognize that these \nchildren aren't going to do well unless we get it right on the \nprevention piece.\n  I have a second-degree amendment that talks about what we should do. \nI ask unanimous consent that I may send my second-degree amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object. I don't believe it is time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may inquire of my friend from Alabama, \nwe have approximately 4 minutes left. We would like to say that he can \noffer that amendment when that time has expired, but is there any \nreason he can't offer it now?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He has the floor. He can use his time or not. I believe \nthe Senator from Minnesota can use his time or not.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Chair notify me when the time has expired--\nwhen the other side's time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2878 To Amendment No. 2876\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a limitation regarding the policy prohibiting \n                           social promotion)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2878 to amendment No. 2876.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, after line 23, add the following:\n       (d) Limitation.--\n       (1) In general.--The provisions of this section shall not \n     apply to any child who was not afforded, by the State \n     educational agency or the local educational agency, an \n     opportunity to learn the material necessary to meet the State \n     achievement standards.\n       (2) Opportunity.--A child shall not be considered to have \n     been afforded an opportunity to learn under paragraph (1) \n     unless--\n       (A) the child was taught by fully certified or qualified \n     teachers as defined by the State;\n       (B) the child's parents had multiple opportunities for \n     parental involvement;\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\n       (C) the child had access to high quality instructional \n     materials and instructional resources to ensure that the \n     child had the opportunity to achieve to the highest \n     performance levels, regardless of disability, income, and \n     background;\n       (D) the child received the services for which the child is \n     eligible under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 and the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act;\n       (E) if necessary, the child received proper bilingual \n     education and special education services; and\n       (F) the child had the opportunity to receive high quality \n     early childhood education.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is an amendment I think Senators \ncan vote for and I think feel comfortable about because, on the one \nhand, you can vote for the first-degree amendment, but you can also \nvote for the first-degree amendment with the understanding that the \nprovisions of this section shall not apply to any child who was not \nafforded, by the State educational agency or the local educational \nagency, an opportunity to learn the material necessary to meet the \nState achievement standards.\n  I am simply saying, let's make sure every child is afforded the \nopportunity to do well on these achievement standards. This says: ``the \nchild has been taught by fully certified or qualified teachers as \ndefined by the State; the child's parents had multiple opportunities \nfor parental involvement.''\n  My colleague asked what that meant. That means to understand what \nhomework is about, make sure you know when you can come in, understand \nwhat the standardized tests are about, understand how the child's \nperformance is being measured. We are all for parent involvement.\n  Next is: ``the child had access to high quality instructional \nmaterials and instructional resources''--how can anybody be opposed to \nthat?--``to ensure that the child had the opportunity to achieve the \nhighest performance levels, regardless of disability, income, and \nbackground; the child received the services for which the child is \neligible under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . \n. . and if necessary, the child received proper bilingual education and \nspecial education services, and that the child had the opportunity to \nreceive high quality early childhood education [developmental child \ncare].''\n  Colleagues, even if you don't believe me, all I have to tell you in \nthis debate is, I presented all kinds of evidence suggesting that \nretention has been harmful and hasn't worked. I never was refuted at \nall. Now what I am saying is that even if you want to go in that \ndirection, at least let's make sure that every child has the \nopportunity to do well in these tests and to achieve, that there are \nhighly qualified instructors and certified teachers, that we have \nfollowed through on title I commitment, that we make sure they are the \nsame resources.\n  Don't you think we want to make sure children in our schools have the \nlab facilities and the textbooks and the good teachers, that there has \nbeen good pre-K education? Let's make sure every one of our children \nhas had the same opportunity to achieve. That is what this amendment \nsays. I hope there will be 100 votes for it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will speak in opposition to the \nsecond-degree amendment proposed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  First and foremost, as everybody knows who has been participating in \nthis debate and can understand how the system works, the second-degree \namendment, as proposed, would gut Senator Feinstein's and my first-\ndegree amendment. It would simply make it impossible to enforce. Of \ncourse, that is what the Senator from Minnesota desires. He is not for \ntesting or accountability or the end of social promotion.\n  I respect that position. But his President, the President of the \nUnited States, in his State of the Union Address, to a cheer from the \naudience, called for an end of social promotion. It is something whose \ntime has come and gone. It is time to care about children and to care \nabout the billions of dollars we are spending on education. And we are \ngoing to spend more next year than we did this year. But if we care \nabout what is happening with it, we have to ask if there is some \naccountability. We can't simply allow children to go on and on, be \npromoted, and end up being an all-pro football player who can't read \nand write. That is happening in America, to a lesser degree mostly, but \nto a sad degree too often throughout this country. We are not making \nsure children are meeting minimum standards. When we do so, problems \narise. They have to be confronted.\n  Right now, we are denying the problem. We are enabling an inefficient \nsystem to continue. We refuse to do what is required to point out to \neverybody who is not meeting minimum standards. Once we find that out, \nthen we can all get together and do something to fix it. There is \nplenty of money in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--soon to \nbe passed, I hope--that will provide a continual flow of money for \ndisadvantaged schools throughout America, so we can improve that \nsystem.\n  This amendment is nothing more than a gutting and an elimination and \na wiping out of the total intent of the Feinstein-Sessions amendment. \nIt will not allow an end to social promotion in America. Our amendment \nwill. But it will allow the States to decide how to do it. If the \nStates decide to have different standards for children who have \ndifficulties, or disadvantaged or special education kids, they can do \nso. We are not saying how they ought to do it. But if we care about \nthose children, we have to know, ourselves, whether or not they are \nlearning. If they are not learning, we have to confront that fact. We \ncan't enable this unacceptable behavior to continue. Some of it is on \nthe part of the kids, some of it is on the part of their parents, and \nsome of it may be a poor school. We have to end that.\n  We care about our children. I think Senator Feinstein has made it \nclear that she cares about them. I do. I want to see the system \nimproved. I am convinced that we must move to eliminate the passing \nalong of kids who are not meeting the most basic of standards. That is \nwhy I will oppose the Senator's second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, all this amendment says is let's have \nthe standards, though I presented a lot of irrefutable evidence about \nretention not working and even being harmful. I understand the politics \nof some of these votes. It is not a pretty picture if anybody cares \nabout the evidence.\n  This second-degree amendment requires that if you are going to have \nthese tests and these standards which determine whether or not a child \nas young as age 8 passes or not, or is held back, especially if \nretention is so harmful, and there is no evidence it is helping \nchildren--I thought we were trying to help the children--at least let's \nensure we have met the standards that all these children have had the \nopportunity to pass these tests and do well.\n  My colleague from Alabama says I am trying to gut the amendment \nbecause by this amendment we want to ensure these children are taught \nby fully certified and qualified teachers. If that guts his amendment, \nhis amendment should be gutted.\n  To make sure the child has had access to high-quality instructional \nmaterial, to make sure the child has received the services for which \nthe child was eligible under title II, to make sure the child has \nreceived adequate bilingual education, to make sure the child has had \nthe opportunity to receive high-quality early childhood education, this \nis a no-brainer, colleagues.\n  We all know this is critical to making sure the children do well in \nschool. My colleague was referred to those who graduate and have a \nthird-grade reading level. What I am talking about is critical to that. \nLet's make sure that before we fail all of these children and act as if \nthat is doing something great for them, why don't we make sure those \nchildren also have the same opportunity to do well and to pass our \nachievement tests.\n  Is it too much to ask other Senators to vote in favor of certified \nand qualified teachers, making sure there is parental involvement, \nmaking sure there are good instructional materials, making sure we live \nup to our title I commitments, and making sure there is adequate \nbilingual education?\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\n  Colleagues, you know this is critically important. Let's vote for \n``standards.'' That is the way you view it. But let's also vote for \nequality of opportunity for all of our children.\n  I especially thank the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund for all \nof the research they have pulled together that I have been able to \npresent today about why it is so important that we pass the second-\ndegree amendment and meet the test of decency. This is true equality of \nopportunity for our children. If you do not do that, then what you have \ndone is very harmful. It is brutal.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Are my colleagues prepared to yield the remainder of time?\n  I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will use 2 minutes and then yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment provision of \nthis section--that is, the end of social promotion--shall not apply to \nany child who is not afforded by the State educational agency an \nopportunity to learn the material necessary. I don't know what that \nmeans. That can mean almost anything to anyone.\n  One of the requirement that has to be in the amendment or this bill \ndoes not apply is that a child has the opportunity to receive high-\nquality early childhood education. What does that mean? It means \nanything anybody says it does.\n  The President of the United States says it is time to end social \npromotion. The overwhelming majority of American people believe so. \nCertainly the people on this side of the aisle believe so. I believe a \nmajority on that side of the aisle believe so.\n  Let's not go with some meddling second-degree amendment that will, in \neffect, undermine the import of the amendment Senator Feinstein has \noffered. Let's not do that. Let's send a clear message that we care \nabout children and we want to confront them at an early age and find \nout whether or not they are meeting basic standards. If they are not, \nlet's start helping them. We are not going to put them in jail if they \nare not meeting standards. We ought to set about to find out who is not \nmeeting those standards and start helping them. That is what it is all \nabout. That is what we need to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me conclude this way.\n  I think there is a bitter irony here. There is no evidence the \nretention works, and there is a certain amount of evidence that it is \nharmful. We should let the States decide, for those colleagues who \nworry about States and States making decisions. This amendment requires \nStates to do retention, and if they do not do retention, then they are \nnot going to get education funds.\n  That is flaw No. 1. I think some of my colleagues would be troubled \nby that. Frankly, I think my colleague from Alabama would be troubled \nby that.\n  If the States decide, on the basis of what they know, not to do the \nretention because of all of the evidence, we are now saying: You have \nto do it, States, or we will cut off Federal money.\n  That is unbelievable. This amendment should be defeated for that \nreason. The Federal Government ought not to be doing that to States, \nespecially given the evidence.\n  The second point my colleagues are bothered by is my second-degree \namendment which says let's make sure every child has the same \nopportunity to do well in these achievement tests. Let's make sure \nthese children are taught by fully qualified teachers, that there is \nparental involvement, that they have good instructional material, that \nwe live up to our commitment on title I, that we make sure the child \nhas had the opportunity to receive good early childhood development, \nthat there is bilingual education available.\n  My colleagues are telling Members to vote against this? We are all \nfor that.\n  The evidence says retention doesn't work and can be harmful. If your \nState decides it doesn't want to do that, it doesn't matter because now \nif Members vote for this amendment, they are telling States they have \nto have retention of students, even if it is harmful. If they don't do \nwhat they think is right, we will cut off Federal funds.\n  Do Members want to vote for that?\n  I have a second-degree amendment I think colleagues should vote for \nbecause it makes elementary sense. Let's make sure these children have \nthe same opportunity for achievement on these tests. If we don't do \nwhat I suggest in this amendment and don't make that commitment, what \nwe will have done to children will be very harmful, brutal, and \nunconscionable.\n  I yield back the remainder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I conclude by explaining why this \namendment is so impractical. It says children have to have multiple \nopportunities for parental involvement.\n  I don't know what that means.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I defined that twice. I didn't know the Senator would \nspeak against the amendment. I talked about the amendment three times.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator does not define it in the statute. They \nwon't know what the Senator said on the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We want to make sure parents know what the homework \nrequirements are, know what the standards are.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What is the balance of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Minnesota, \nbut I say to the Senator, parents would get a lawyer and sue: You can't \nhold my child back; you didn't call me enough times.\n  The amendment doesn't say how many times.\n  Or my child didn't have an opportunity to receive a high-quality \nearly childhood education.\n  Well, you had kindergarten; that was not enough.\n  This amendment does not say what it is. It will turn it into a \nconglomeration of things that are not healthy.\n  I note, as Senator Feinstein from California so eloquently said, we \nare not saying what the standards are. The States can set standards \nthat require parental involvement. I hope they do. I hope they do a lot \nof things that are not mentioned by the Senator from Minnesota in \nsetting a fair, objective standard for testing.\n\n  However, we do need some objective standards for testing. If we do \nso--as Chicago has found, as California will be moving toward, as \nAlabama will move very soon to accountability and the end of social \npromotion--we will find that students are learning more because they \nare challenged. There is an incentive there. Parents are going to know \ncertain standards must be met. Teachers and principals will know it. \nThe children will know it. They will respond and meet the challenges.\n  We will end this slide in which we spend more and more money and get \nless and less productivity.\n  From 1960 to 1990, we tripled the amount of money spent on education \nin America. It went up every single year. But SAT scores declined 73 \npoints.\n  In Kansas City, they spent $11,700 per pupil. They raised education \nfigures consistently to reach this very high level; they had a teacher-\npupil ratio of 13-1, without raising test scores for the kids.\n  We have to challenge children because we care about them. We care \nabout America. We cannot continue to move children through the system \nwhen they do not know how to read and write and perform effectively in \nthis society of which we are a part. I wish we could do it kindly, \nwithout having to tell people: Sorry, you didn't meet the standards; \nyou have to take this course over again.\n  Oftentimes that is what we have to do. It is the way life is on the \nfootball field or in a military unit. You have to meet certain \nstandards. We are in a world that demands first rate competition. If we \nare not prepared, we will lose out. I am concerned about it. All of \nAmerica is concerned. I think we can make progress toward that goal.\n  I believe we should reject this amendment to the underlying amendment \nproposed by Senator Feinstein and myself. With that, we can send a \nmessage to America that we will have\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\nsome accountability, that we will encourage children to improve. When \nwe recognize that large numbers of students are not meeting those \nstandards, we can redirect resources to find out exactly what that \nproblem is and rectify it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to state \nthat I agree with the position of my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia on the issue of social promotion. We must end this practice. \nFar too many of our young people are graduating without the skills that \nthey need to secure good jobs because they are being passed from grade \nto grade without accountability for what they have learned. Many young \npeople are also dropping out of school because they find themselves in \nhigh schools without the knowledge that they need to succeed in that \nforum. I am a strong supporter of efforts to end this practice.\n  I have voted for legislation in the past that would have given States \nand local districts incentives to eliminate social promotion policies. \nI currently am cosponsoring legislation, based on a proposal from the \nPresident, which seeks to end social promotion in all our schools. I \nmust vote against Senator Feinstein's amendment, however, because it \nwould cut all federal funding for education to a State based on this \nsole issue and provides no flexibility on the State or local level. If \nthis amendment were to become law, we would be imposing a strict \nrequirement without providing adequate resources to achieve the goal. \nAs the Elementary and Secondary Education Act moves to the floor, \nhowever, I will work with my distinguished colleague from California to \ndevelop legislation that addresses this critical issue.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2859 and 2824, en bloc\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \ntwo amendments be considered en bloc: The amendment introduced by \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts, No. 2859, relating to AmeriCorps; the \nHatch amendment, No. 2824, relating to the marriage penalty and student \nloan interest deduction.\n  These amendments have been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendments be agreed to, any statement relating to these \namendments be printed, and that the motions to reconsider to be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my amendment addresses a specific and \nserious problem for Americans repaying student loans. Many of our \ncolleagues may not be aware of it, Mr. President, but there is a severe \nmarriage penalty lurking in the deduction for student loan interest \nexpense that Congress enacted in 1997.\n  This marriage penalty arises because, when Congress established the \ndeduction for student loan interest, we targeted it so that only \ntaxpayers with incomes below a certain amount could use it. For single \ntaxpayers, that income threshold is $40,000. For taxpayers with \nAdjusted Gross Income above $40,000 the deduction begins to phase out. \nThe deduction is fully phased out over the next $15,000 of income, so \nthat when a single taxpayer's income reaches $55,000, there is no \ndeduction allowed.\n  For married taxpayers filing a joint return, there is a different \nthreshold--$60,000. This is where the deduction begins to phase out, \nand it is gone at an income level of $75,000. This is the heart of the \nproblem, Mr. President. Because the threshold for married taxpayers \nfiling a joint return is less than twice as high as the threshold for \nsingles, there is a marriage penalty.\n  Let me illustrate the problem with an example. Let's consider a \ncouple from my home state. Dave and Joann met at Utah State University \nand married right after graduation last year. Dave is the assistant \nmanager of a grocery store an earns $38,000 per year. Joann is a \ncomputer programmer making $40,000 annually. These are not high income \npeople, Mr. President, although their income puts them in the 28 \npercent marginal tax bracket.\n  Dave and Joann each borrowed to finance their education, and each has \n$2,000 in interest expense from their student loans. The full $2,000 \ninterest expense would be fully deductible if they were single, saving \nthem each $560 in taxes. However, simply because Dave and Joann are \nmarried, and their combined income exceeds $75,000, they lose the full \n$4,000 student loan interest deduction.\n  Unfortunately, the $1,120 marriage penalty inherent in the student \nloan interest deduction is only the tip of the marriage penalty iceberg \nfor Dave and Joann. This is only one of at least 66 marriage penalties \nthat resides in the Internal Revenue Code. Not every one of these 66 \nmarriage penalties affect every married couple in America, but many \ncouples are hit with at least one, and often more than one, marriage \npenalty. In our example here, Dave and Joann are hit with two other \nmarriage penalties.\n  As you can see, the total amount of marriage penalty affecting Dave \nand Joann is a whopping $2,650. This means their tax burden is 27 \npercent higher than it would be if they were single, Mr. President! \nThis is simply not fair. It is poor tax policy, it is poor education \npolicy, and it is poor family policy. Taxpayers should not pay more in \ntaxes just because they are married.\n  The other marriage penalties affecting Dave and Joann stem from the \nfact that the standard deduction for married couples is less than twice \nthe amount of the standard deduction of singles, and from a similar \nproblem that exists in the tax rate schedules. These two marriage \npenalties are not the subject of this amendment.\n  I will note, however, that H.R. 6, the marriage penalty alleviation \nbill passed by the House in early February, would correct most of this \nmarriage penalty for Dave and Joann. I know that Chairman Roth plans to \ntake up marriage penalty legislation in the Finance Committee in the \nnext few weeks. I look forward to working with him to solve these other \nproblems.\n  The marriage penalty problem the House bill would not correct, \nhowever, is the one inherent in the student loan interest deduction. \nThe solution to this marriage penalty is simple. This amendment merely \nincreases the income threshold for joint returns to $80,000, twice the \nlevel of the single taxpayer threshold.\n  The marriage tax penalty problem is a complex one. We are not going \nto solve it all at once. I am gratified to see the Congress focusing on \nthis important family issue, and I hope we can see real progress on \nalleviating the problem this year.\n  This amendment is a good place to start. Some might argue that this \nis relatively minor marriage penalty. And, compared with some of the \nother ones. maybe it is. However, it is not small to Dave and Joann and \nto the millions of young Americans who pay more in taxes simply because \nthey have formed the basic unit of society--a family.\n  This small step today will eliminate the marriage penalty that hurts \nmarried taxpayers who are repaying educational loans. Then, in a few \nweeks when the Finance Committee takes up broader marriage penalty \nlegislation, we can address some of the other problems.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2859 and 2824) were agreed to en bloc, as \nfollows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2859\n\n   (Purpose: To exclude national service educational awards from the \n                       recipient's gross income)\n\n       On page 21, between lines 3 and 4, insert:\n\n     SEC. 204.

Mr. President, the headlines in our morning papers are a \nsad reminder: America Faces a National Gun Crisis.\n  USA Today is published across America. This morning's paper, on its \nfront page, speaks of the shooting of a little 6-year-old girl in Mount \nMorris Township, MI. Her name was Kayla Rolland. Her parents sent her \nto the first grade. She never came home.\n  Turn the page and find on page 3:\n\n       Pa. Gunman Flies into a Fatal Rage.\n\n  Firearms are easy to come by--for 6-year-olds and psychotics. That is \nthe state of affairs in America today. The violence in America is not \nconfined to mean streets. It is in our homes, it is in our fast food \nrestaurants, and, yes, it is even in our schools. We passed legislation \nseveral years ago to make certain that Congress and the American people \nwould know, on an annual basis, about the evidence of gun violence in \nour schools. From the school year 1997 and 1998, the Department of \nEducation reports to us grim statistics about what we face as a nation. \nLet me recount for you what they have told us.\n  The U.S. Department of Education's recent report on the \nimplementation of the Gun-Free Schools Act found that 3,930 children \nwere expelled for bringing guns to school during the 1997-1998 school \nyear, almost 4,000 children. Nationwide, 57 percent of the expulsions \nwere high school students, 33 percent were junior high, 10 percent were \nelementary school. That means almost 400 elementary students were \nexpelled for bringing firearms to school. These children were as young \nas 6 years old.\n  In this situation in Mount Morris, MI, Kayla Rolland, this beautiful \nlittle girl, was gunned down by a 6-year-old killer. In my home State \nof Illinois, 86 students were expelled during the year in question for \nbringing a gun to school: 49 high school students, 31 junior high \nschool students, and 6 elementary school students.\n  In Illinois, firearms are the leading cause of injury and death to \nchildren. The next most common cause is car crashes. On average, 364 \nchildren die every single year in Illinois from guns, almost 1 child \nevery single day. Do not believe for a moment this is a story unique to \nIllinois. The tragedy of Kayla Rolland was in Michigan. Another tragedy \nyesterday occurred in Pennsylvania.\n  If you follow the headlines in the paper, you will see a sad reminder \non a regular basis of infants and children who have access to guns: \n``Eighth Grader Takes Principal Hostage''; ``5-Year-Old Girl Shoots \nHerself In The Head,'' in New Orleans; in Chicago, ``Girl Killed In An \nAccidental Shooting''; Kansas City, ``6-Year-Old Accidentally Shoots 1-\nYear-Old Cousin To Death''; Memphis, ``Angry 5-Year-Old Takes A Gun To \nSchool''; Miami, ``15-Year-Old Takes Gun To School, Injures Himself In \nHorseplay''; in Cleveland, ``4-Year-Old Caught Again For A Second Time \nWith A Gun At Day Care.''\n\n  Did he say 4 years old? Yes, a 4-year-old with a gun at day care; a \n5-year-old accidentally shoots to death a 10-year-old boy in Grand \nView, MO; a child brings guns to school in Topeka, KS--on and on and \non. What I am addressing today is not an exception. It is becoming a \nrule. It is becoming a sad reality in America.\n  We talk a lot about education on the floor of the Senate, as we \nshould. It may be America's highest priority. But before we start \ntalking about funding education and paying and training teachers, \nbefore we talk about smaller class sizes, before we talk about modern \nbuildings and new technology, for goodness' sake, should not we first \ntalk about the safety of our children in the schools themselves?\n  It is unfortunate that this Congress is in virtual denial about the \ncrisis which I have described. We have had an opportunity ever since \nColumbine High School, and even before, to pass sensible gun control \nlegislation. We have\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nfailed to do it. America faces a national epidemic of gun violence. \nGuns are a deadly social virus. The same USA Today in its editorial \npage spells this out so well:\n\n       Guns are a deadly social virus that can strike down \n     children like the horrible diseases of old.\n\n  And yet this Congress refuses to acknowledge it. We refuse to \nconsider even the most basic commonsense gun control. Because this \nCongress refuses to seriously consider any efforts under law to keep \ndeadly firearms out of the hands of children and convicts, I urge my \ncolleagues to, at the very least, consider as an alternative the \namendment which I offer today. It is an amendment which tries to give \nfamilies across America fair warning of the scourge of gun violence and \nwhat it can do to so many families. Guns kill 34,000 Americans every \nyear; between 12 and 13 children every day. They kill more teenagers \nthan any natural cause. The American people, especially mothers in \nsuburban areas who are sending their children to school, want some \nassurance that their children will come home at the end of the day.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. It creates the School \nViolence Reduction Act. What will it do? It is simple. It establishes a \ngrant program for the U.S. Department of Education to develop and \ndisseminate model programs to reduce violence in schools. I would much \nrather these dollars, the $7 million part of this amendment, be used \nfor other purposes--to buy computers, to train teachers, to reduce \nclass size, to modernize school buildings. But I say to those who \nfollow this debate, we have to deal with the basics, the safety of our \nschools, before we can consider even the process of education. We need \nto educate students about the dangers associated with guns. I am sad to \nreport we have to start at the earliest ages to educate them.\n  We need to provide information about safe gun storage to children and \ntheir parents. The amendment provides funds for public service \nannouncements and other information to reduce violence in our schools. \nSix-year-olds do not go out and buy guns, not in the ordinary course of \nevents. The guns are left lying around the house.\n\n  I read some about this child's situation in Mount Morris, MI. It is \nclear this child lived in a terrible situation, exposed to things with \nwhich no adult could cope. This tiny little boy, for whatever reason, \nfaced the life of a dysfunctional family, of drugs, God knows what kind \nof abuse, and exposure to guns on a regular basis. But that is not the \nonly way kids come by guns. Kids come by guns when parents are \nneglectful, when they are negligent, when they do not meet their \nobligation to store guns safely.\n  The President, after this situation in Michigan, renewed his call for \na national standard for trigger locks to make sure if a child gets his \nhands on a handgun he can't shoot it and kill someone, some other \ninnocent victim or himself. But we can't do that in Congress. That is \nbeyond us. The gun lobby will not stand for it.\n  The idea of putting safety devices on guns is something the National \nRifle Association will not buy. So let us at least try, through our \nschools, to create public information and education efforts so families \nacross America at least know that there is a right way to store guns \nsafely, out of the hands and out of the reach of children.\n  We passed legislation last year, when Vice President Gore came to the \nfloor of the Senate and broke a tie, which dealt with some of the \nproblems we have in our country involving guns: for background checks \nat gun shows, the amendment of Senator Feinstein of California to \nreduce the importation of these high-capacity magazine clips from \noverseas into the United States, things that move us down the road \ntoward protecting Americans from the abuse of guns. Trigger locks: \nSenator Kohl of Wisconsin has been a leader on that as well.\n  What happened to this legislation? Dead on arrival in the House of \nRepresentatives. There has not even been a conference committee on this \nbill. Yet day in and day out we read these terrible headlines.\n  I looked in the face of this little girl, Kayla Rolland, and saw so \nmany thousands of little kids I have seen across my State of Illinois, \nkids I have seen in the day-care classes with my 3 1/2-year-old \ngrandson. This beautiful little girl is no longer with us because of \nsomeone who was negligent in handling a gun and because of a 6-year-old \nwho took a gun to school.\n  There are so many who do this across America on a regular basis that \nwe have to come to grips with this challenging national situation. I \nurge my colleagues, whatever their opinion of gun control, to at least, \nat the very least, join me in this effort to create a program so \nschools across America, on their own, with a voluntary application, can \nreceive assistance from the Federal Government to deal with this gun \nviolence. I believe this is a step in the right direction. I believe it \nwill give to many schools the resources they need to educate the \nchildren and the parents and all who will listen to the public service \nannouncements about the reality of reducing gun violence in our \nschools.\n  I pray to God this is the last story we will read in the year 2000 of \nanother infant, another child who lost her little life because of this \nkind of gun violence, because of the negligence of a gun owner or \nsomeone who possessed a gun so a child could come in contact with it.\n  History tells me it will not be the only story of the year. It will \nbe one of many.\n  To those parents who think it is not their problem, I am sorry to \nreport it is. If you do not have a firearm in your house, can you ever \nbe sure your little child's playmate does not have a firearm in his \nhouse? Can you ever be certain the child sitting behind your son or \ndaughter at school does not have a handgun in his backpack?\n  That is the reality of America today. That is the national gun crisis \nwe face. There have been a lot of suggestions about improving education \nin America. This bill suggests one of the ways to do it is to save \nfamilies on average $7 in this tax benefit package if they will send \ntheir children to public schools. Before we start saving less than $10 \nwhen it comes to education, let's talk about saving the lives of our \npriceless children in our schools.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in this \neffort.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Illinois. A long \ntime ago, he and I talked about the importance of having a school \nsafety fund where if schools felt they needed assistance, whether it \nwas to purchase equipment--a metal detector--whether it was to teach \nthe children about how to resolve their differences without violence, \nthat we should set this up in a way that local schools could put \ntogether their own programs.\n  I want to ask my friend this: There is a lot of talk around here of \nlocal control. Isn't this what my friend is doing, he is designing a \ngrant program so if school districts decide they want to partake, if \nthey have this problem, they have an opportunity to do so?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from California is absolutely right. It is \ntotally voluntary. There is no Federal mandate involved. If a school \ndistrict says they are concerned enough about this problem that they \nwant to put together a program that is going to try to educate children \nabout the danger of guns, that is going to try to educate parents about \nthe safe storage of guns, public service announcements to encourage \ntrigger locks, then they can apply for these funds. It is only $7 \nmillion, which by Federal standards is a very small amount of money.\n  I hope it will give some school districts the resources they need to \nstep forward and protect children from needless tragedies which we read \nabout every day.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend another question. As I read these hair-\nraising accounts of what happened in Michigan with this little baby of \n6 years old bringing a gun to school, shooting a child, and then \nactually after it was done, coloring something, drawing some pictures, \nhaving no concept he committed this murder, if you will, I think this \npoints out to us that kids do not understand what gun violence can \nreally do.\n  I commend my friend and ask him if he has read those accounts and how \nchilling it is and how appropriate it is\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nto have a vote on this. As my friend said, the underlying bill gives $7 \na year. Now they want to give help to people even in higher incomes \nwhile our kids are losing their lives. I am very pleased my friend has \noffered this amendment, and I am proud to join him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California who earlier offered a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment as to whether we are going to make a \nconcerted and dedicated effort to reduce violence in the schools. Her \nleadership on this issue in her State and across the Nation has been a \nmodel for all of us. This program I am suggesting is a very modest \napproach as well. It is a $7 million grant that is available, and when \nyou consider these headlines which I went through earlier about \nchildren coming to day care with a gun, a 4-year-old caught a second \ntime bringing a loaded handgun to day care in Cleveland, OH.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to those in the Senate, regardless \nof your position on gun control, I hope we all concede we need to get \nthe resources to schools, parents, and families so they can do their \nbest to protect their kids and try to eliminate a senseless tragedy \nsuch as we saw in Michigan this week and, sadly, we have seen repeated \nacross America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin \namendment be set aside and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, \nbe allowed to offer his amendment with a 14-minute time agreement \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. What was the agreement on time? I am sorry, I could not \nhear you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Fourteen minutes equally divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2866\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nscholarships for future teachers and loan forgiveness and cancellation)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n2866 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, and I \nthank the Senator from Nevada for their assistance in moving things \nalong. I will try not to take very long. In fact, I want to say a few \nwords about the schoolchild my friend from Illinois was talking about. \nLet me try to get through the substance and see where I am timewise \nbefore I do that.\n  Whatever the dynamic we are locked into in the Senate, it is clearly \nnot promising or anything substantive to pass. Our friends on the other \nside of the aisle have decided that nothing substantive with respect to \neducation will fundamentally pass. Yesterday we passed a study on \nwelfare offered by Senator Wellstone, but every other effort to deal \nwith education is preordained.\n  I understand in standing up here the fate of this amendment. \nNotwithstanding that, I want to make it clear, and I think my \ncolleagues who preceded me have made it clear, that these are the real \nissues that face the country and these are the choices the Senate ought \nto be making. If our colleagues simply choose to dismiss them out of \nhand, then that is a reality the American people, I hope, will begin to \ndigest at the appropriate time, which is obviously election time in \nthis country. There may be another chance when we will deal with some \nof these issues. We certainly hope there will be. But not being \nguaranteed that opportunity, we have to take this opportunity now.\n  Everyone in this country knows we have a teacher shortage of \nremarkable proportions. We are supposed to hire some 5 million teachers \nover the course of the next 10 years, 2 million of them in the next 5 \nyears. If one looks at an article that appeared in the Washington Post \nat the beginning of this school year, it tells us the story of some of \nthat hiring. A principal in Northern Virginia was so desperate for \nteachers to begin the school year that she was wooing shoppers at Wal-\nMart in an effort to find people to teach in her school.\n  The last thing the parents of our children and our school \nadministrators want is an unprepared, unqualified, uncertified adult \nsimply there supposedly to fill a quota and ``teach,'' and I put quotes \naround that.\n  If we continue on our present course, we are going to face many \nsimilar stories. But we know because of the pressures of attrition, the \npressures of the classroom itself, the lack of pay, and other problems \nattendant to teaching today, we are losing many more people than are \ncoming into the profession. Thirty to 40 percent of the people who \nteach leave within the first 3 to 5 years. We have a remarkable rate of \nloss and a remarkable rate of turnover.\n  We also know we have an incredible shortage of teachers who teach in \nthe field for which they may have gone to school or in which they have \na degree. Again, I am not going to take up all the time, but the \nstatistics with respect to teachers who are qualified to teach math or \nscience is extraordinarily distressing, not to mention other subjects \nthat people also come to teach.\n  The amendment I offer today addresses this by seeking to address the \nquestion of how do we create an incentive to draw people into teaching.\n  I met with young people this morning, interns in my office, about 15, \n16 of them. Not one of them is planning to be a teacher or is even \nthinking about it.\n  When I speak at colleges and universities there may be whatever \nnumber of people in the room, and I ask them: How many of you are \nplanning to be teachers? You are lucky if you get one or two or three \nhands going up because most people cannot afford to do it based on the \nloans they have at the end of their schooling. Also, many of them find \nthe opportunities of the private sector simply too great, too alluring, \nso they are drawn away from teaching. Thirdly, our school systems \ntoday, because of the lack of adequate resources, structures, support, \ncurriculum, reform standards, and other things, are not particularly \nenticing to many young people in terms of a career option.\n  We have to offer greater incentives to attract people, particularly \nmeasured against the marketplace. Therefore, the current law already \nforgives $5,000 in student loans after 5 years in teaching.\n  My amendment seeks to recognize the reality of that principle, which \nwe have already adopted, that an incentive works. But recognizing that, \nthe second reality is that because of the marketplace, the incentive \nisn't strong enough. So we need to find a way to add an additional \nincentive. My amendment would provide an additional $5,000 in \nforgiveness for teachers after 2 years of teaching, providing \nadditional relief for those who are faced with leaving teaching in \norder to make more money.\n  In addition, we would offer a grant for States to be able to \nestablish a program to provide college scholarships to students with \nSAT scores or grade point averages in the top 20 percent of each \nState's high school graduating class. That would be in return for a \ncommitment by the individual to become a State-certified teacher for a \nperiod of 5 years.\n  We have always tried to attract people into our military service by \noffering them, either through the Service academies or through ROTC or \nthrough the GI bill, the opportunity to be able to have payment in \nexchange for a service that we value greatly: Service to country.\n  Here we are trying to apply the same principle, and we are trying to \ndraw some of the top students. Those who have performed the best in \nhigh school will have an opportunity to have college scholarships so \nthey can go to college, not come out with the burden of debt and, \nindeed, dedicate 5 years of their life to teaching in return.\n  In a sense, it is a GI bill for teaching. I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize this principle and the value of it.\n  The teacher shortage our schools are facing now will pale in \ncomparison to what we're looking at over the next 10 years as large \nnumbers of teachers are expected to retire and enrollments are expected \nto increase. The pressures of attrition, of retirements, will only be \ncompounded by the impact of hundreds of other important education \nimprovement efforts taking root all over the country, whether it's \nclass-size reduction or higher standards for teachers, and that too \nwill exacerbate the teacher shortage.\n  So what do we do about it? We must pass legislation that helps \nincrease the supply, and the quality, of teachers in this country. And \nto do that, we must make the teaching profession more attractive to our \nyoung people and to those many thousands of people who are certified \nteachers but have left the profession because of financial constraints.\n  The amendment I offer today addresses the teaching crisis plaguing \nour Nation's schools and impairing our children's ability to learn and \nsucceed.\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\nMy amendment will provide full-time state certified public school \nteachers who teach in low-income areas or who teach in areas with \nteacher shortages such as math, science, and special needs with loan \nforgiveness of up to $5,000 after 2 years of teaching and an additional \n$5,000 after 5 years of teaching.\n  I know the Congress believes loan forgiveness is an important way to \nattract and retain qualified teachers, because current law already \nforgives $5,000 in student loans after five years of teaching. My \namendment would provide an additional $5,000 in forgiveness for \nteachers after 2 years of teaching, providing relief for teachers who \nare faced with leaving teaching to make more money, and providing an \nincentive for them to continue in the field. Coupled with increased \nongoing education opportunities that are the focus of so many Senators, \nparticularly my colleague from Massachusetts, who has contributed so \nmuch to the education debate over the years, Senator Kennedy, coupled \nwith increased professional development opportunities that I hope we \nwill enact, we have the capability of recruiting and retaining \nthousands of highly qualified teachers around the country.\n  My amendment would also provide grants for states to establish a \nprogram to provide college scholarships to students with SAT scores or \ngrade point averages in the top 20 percent of each state's high school \ngraduating class in return for a commitment to become a state certified \nteacher for 5 years. States would contribute 20 percent of the funds \nfor the scholarships. This amendment would also establish a national \nhotline for potential teachers to receive information on a career in \nteaching.\n  Demand for teachers is so great that it is projected that 50,000 \nunqualified teachers have been hired annually on emergency or \nsubstandard licenses. And the situation is most severe in poor urban \nand rural areas. According to the National Center for Education \nStatistics, these districts have such a hard time recruiting and \nretaining qualified teachers that 39 percent of their teachers have \nneither a college major or minor in their primary field of course work.\n  What does this mean for our children's education? In urban schools \nwhere children are already crippled by an unfair playing field, a lack \nof adequate resources, too often the teachers they do have are \nunqualified. And over the next 10 years the situation will get even \nworse, virtually guaranteeing that the percentage of unqualified \nteachers in these schools will increase.\n\n  I ask you this: How are our young people supposed to get engaged in \nthe learning process if they only have warm bodies in their classrooms? \nWho will answer the questions that children have about their lessons if \nthe teachers themselves are not sure of the answers? I have heard from \npeople all over my state, deans of engineering schools in my state, \nhigh school administrators, parents, about a decrease in the number of \nyoung people interested in pursuing math, science, and engineering \ndegrees after they graduate from high school. Is it any coincidence \nthen that the greatest shortage of teachers in this country is in the \nareas of math and science? No wonder our young people are seeking math \nand science degrees in lower numbers. They aren't excited about these \nsubjects because the teachers weren't there to get them excited, to \nprovide them with good instruction, to encourage them on. And I won't \neven get into the shortage of hi-tech workers before us now and that we \nare in dire need of greater numbers, not fewer, of graduates in math, \nscience, and engineering.\n  I can guarantee you that this additional loan forgiveness and a \nscholarship program are necessary, that the existing laws will not \nrecruit the numbers and quality of students we need. Thirty to fifty \npercent of all new urban teachers leave the teaching profession within \nthe first 3 to 5 years of teaching. And while we can't be sure that all \nof these young teachers leave because of inadequate salaries and \nblossoming student loans, when you look at the data you can be sure \nlooming students loans and low paying comprise a great deal of the \nincentive for these teachers to leave.\n  We need to attract the best and the brightest teachers into our \npublic schools to cultivate the minds of our children. But can we \nrealistically expect those students graduating from 4-year institutions \nand saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans--the average \nprivate college students graduates with $14,000 of loans that must be \nrepaid--to enter career where they can expect a starting salary that \nbarely reaches the mid-twenties? How can we expect our young people to \nturn their backs, particularly in this booming economy, on higher-\npaying jobs as analysts, in technology companies.\n  Consider the case of Bridgewater State College, which was the first \ncollege in Massachusetts to obtain accreditation under the new National \nCouncil for the Accreditation of Teacher Education standards. One-fifth \nof Bridgewater State students go on to become teachers in Massachusetts \nand throughout the country. But these students graduate with an average \nof $8,693 in student loans that must be repaid. And that is from a \npublic school, where in-state tuition is just $8,000. A student \ngraduating from a private college, of which there are many in my state, \nfaces a average of $14,000 in loans to be repaid.\n  Now, we all know that first-year teachers are poorly paid. The \naverage starting salary is in the mid-twenties. it is simply too \ndifficult for young teachers to make ends meet when, in addition to \npaying rent, buying groceries, maybe saving for graduate school, or for \na car, they must also pay back these loans.\n  We must act on this legislation now. If not because we are facing an \nimminent teacher shortage, then because of the rising cost of tuition. \nFrom 1990 to 1996, average tuition for a full-time resident \nundergraduate student rose 43.8 percent, but during that same period, \nthe consumer price index rose only 15.4 percent. And at the same time, \nMr. President loans are comprising a greater percentage of student's \ntuition than grants or income. In the early 1980s, loans covered about \n40 percent of total aid. Now, loans cover 58 percent of total aid and \nduring that period, grants went from covering 55 percent of total aid \nto just 40 percent of total aid. Mr. President, we must address this \nissue. We must provide assistance to aspiring teachers. We must act \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask my colleague from Georgia if he would mind if I took \na moment, maybe 3 or 4 minutes, to say something about the shooting in \nMichigan. May I ask for 4 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from our time.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator is very generous. Knowing the outcome of this \nvote, I know the Senator does not have to expend a lot of eloquence to \ndefeat me. I am very appreciative for his consideration.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1087-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1087-S1088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          YOUNG LIVES IN CHAOS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today there was an article on the front \npage of the Washington Post. I thought the words captured in the \ncaption really summarize the situation that the Senate needs to stop \nand think about much more seriously as we come into the budget \ndeliberations for this year.\n  The title of the story is: ``A `Life in Chaos' Shaped Young \nShooter.'' The description in the story talks about the life: Living in \na place where drugs are rampant, where a gun is under a pillow, where \nparents are not paying attention. Literally, they define this as a life \nin chaos.\n  I have come to the floor many times over the course of the last few \nyears to talk to my colleagues about exactly that: the difference for \nchildren between a life in chaos and a life lived in order, in \nstructure.\n  The fact is, this child in Michigan, who saw fit to pick up a gun and \nshoot another student of the same age in their classroom, is tragically \nnot an aberration in the context of life in America today. There are \ncountless numbers of children living lives in chaos.\n  One-third of all of our children in this Nation begin life in a \ndeficit because they are born into a parenting situation where there is \nonly one parent, born out of wedlock. With the failure rate of \nmarriages, when you add to\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\nthe one-third that begin life that way, maybe as many as 45 to 50 \npercent of America's children are being raised in a single-parent \nstructure.\n  Too many kids who are raised with even two parents are often the \nvictims of lives in chaos, where the parents are not paying attention, \nwhere there are not afterschool programs, there are not early start \nprograms, there are not child-care programs.\n  Children, 5 million strong a day, are let out of school to go back to \napartments and homes where there is no adult until 6 or 7 in the \nevening. We know that 5 million children are let out of school and \nreturned to apartments and homes in that situation.\n  I know of cities in Massachusetts where, tragically, because of the \nsituation in a housing project or the situation of a single parent who \nis struggling with two jobs, working to make ends meet, and they do not \nhave a proper child care situation, children are also being raised in a \nkind of chaos.\n  Talk to any child psychologist anywhere in the world, and they will \ntell you the negative impact that kind of chaos or disorder or lack of \nstructure has on children.\n  My prayer is that in the course of the next weeks, when we have the \nopportunity in this budget, in a year of surplus, in a year where we \nare talking about huge sums of money in tax rebate, and too much of it \ngoing back to people who already have more than most people in America, \nI hope that in that context the Senate is going to do the business of \nthis Nation in helping parents to be able to parent and helping \nchildren to be able to live lives in order, not lives of chaos. There \nis no greater mission for this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 A `Life in Chaos' Shaped Young Shooter\n\n                         (By William Claiborne)\n\n       Mount Morris Township, Mich., March 1--The 6-year-old boy \n     who shot and killed a first-grade classmate in an elementary \n     school here Tuesday was living in a rundown crack house just \n     blocks from the school--without even a bed to sleep on--and \n     leading a ``life in chaos,'' authorities said today.\n       Two men living in the house were arrested last summer on \n     charges of breaking into and burglarizing a house down the \n     street in this gritty, unincorporated neighborhood just north \n     of Flint in central Michigan, neighbors said.\n       Another man, who police said kept a .32-caliber revolver \n     under a blanket in his bedroom--the weapon that authorities \n     say the boy stole and used in shooting 6-year-old Kayla \n     Rolland once in the chest--was a fugitive being sought on \n     drug charges and for possible indictment for involuntary \n     negligent homicide before he surrendered to police late this \n     afternoon. The 19-year-old man, who has not been identified \n     by police, was held on outstanding warrants.\n       When police raided the house Tuesday night and seized drugs \n     and a stolen 12-gauge shotgun, they arrested a third man, \n     identified as the boy's uncle, on an outstanding felony \n     warrant for concealing stolen property. The uncle, identified \n     as Sirmarcus B. Winfrey, was also held in connection with the \n     seized drug cache and the shotgun. He is the brother of the \n     boy's mother.\n       Genesee County Prosecutor Arthur A. Busch said the boy, \n     whose name has been withheld because of this age, ``comes \n     from a very troubled home. . . . It is obvious to me he is \n     the victim of the drug culture and a home that is in chaos.''\n       Nonetheless the boy's mother Tamara Owens who police say \n     has a criminal record, and his father, Dedric Owens, who is \n     in jail on a parole violation, appeared briefly in Genesee \n     County Probate Court today asking for custody of the boy and \n     his 8-year-old brother. The father, appearing in court in \n     handcuffs, said he was sorry for what happened but added, ``I \n     miss him and I can't wait to see him.'' He said he was \n     seeking custody for when he is eventually released from jail.\n       Speaking briefly in court, Owens said, ``I'm very sorry for \n     what happened to the child and the family. I wish it would \n     never had happened. There's nothing I can do about it.''\n       Probate referee Peggy Odette denied the custody requests, \n     saying that there was evidence the mother had a background of \n     drug use. But she said Owens, who sat quietly in court and \n     wept occasionally during the brief proceedings, would be \n     allowed supervised visits with the boy while he is in state \n     custody. The boy and his brother are living with an aunt.\n       The parents' custody requests were made after state \n     children's services officials filed a petition for state \n     custody on the basis of alleged parental neglect. Busch said \n     the petition would go to Family Court for a hearing.\n       Busch said the boy, who along with his brother apparently \n     had been passed from house to house after their father was \n     sent to prison on a home invasion conviction, was incapable \n     of forming an intent to shoot his classmate and should not be \n     prosecuted for that reason.\n       ``Especially after the detectives say that he has not \n     appreciated what has happened, that he takes this as, well \n     this is something that happens like on television,'' Busch \n     said at a news briefing at County Court in Flint.\n       After police questioned him, the boy ``just sat there \n     drawing pictures,'' said Township Police Chief Eric King.\n       The prosecutor said there is ample case law, supported by a \n     recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, that youths under 7 years \n     old cannot be prosecuted on felony charges. ``He is a victim \n     in many ways and we need to put our arms around him and love \n     him,'' Busch said.\n       Genesee County Sheriff Robert J. Picknell said today that \n     he interviewed the boy's 29-year-old father Tuesday night at \n     the county jail. The father was paroled on Dec. 20 from a \n     home invasion sentence but two months later was back in \n     custody for the parole violation.\n       Picknell, in a telephone interview, said the father told \n     him that, after being evicted from her house, the boy's \n     mother dropped off the youngster at the crack house about 10 \n     days ago to live with his uncle. The move followed a series \n     of behavior problems at the Theo J. Buell Elementary School, \n     where Kayla was shot as three first-graders and a teacher \n     watched in horror Tuesday morning.\n       Branch said the shooting followed a quarrel ``and maybe a \n     scuffle'' between the boy and Kayla at the school the \n     previous day, but he insisted that he had no information \n     indicating the boy went to the school with the intention of \n     shooting the girl.\n       Picknell noted that Owens, whose name had been withheld to \n     protect the boy until today's Probate Court appearance, said \n     his son told him he had been suspended three times this \n     school year, once for stabbing another pupil with a pencil \n     and twice for fighting.\n       When asked about the suspensions, Ira Rutherford, \n     superintendent of the Beecher School District, declined to \n     comment, saying information about the boy's behavior is \n     confidential. Rutherford said that ``seriously disturbed'' \n     youths are referred to mental health programs for help, but \n     he declined to comment when asked if the boy had been \n     referred to such a program.\n       Rutherford also said he thinks the boy may be too young to \n     come under a 1984 Michigan law requiring the expulsion of \n     students who violate gun prohibitions, even though the law \n     appears to cover pupils of any age. He said he would not \n     speculate where the boy may attend school if he is not \n     charged, even as a juvenile.\n       Picknell said the father was aware of the known drug house \n     at 1102 Juliah St., around the corner from the school, and \n     that when he heard about the shooting on a radio newscast, he \n     immediately had a ``sickening feeling'' that his son may have \n     been involved. Picknell said Owens told him that shortly \n     after he was paroled in December, he saw his son and asked \n     him why he committed the offenses that led to the \n     suspensions.\n       ``He said that the kid told him he did it because `I hate \n     them.' '' Picknell said.\n       Picknell said Owen's suspicion that the boy was involved in \n     the school shooting was heightened because of his knowledge \n     that guns were always kept in the house for protection and \n     for trading for drugs.\n       Picknell said he was troubled by the fact that the \n     suspensions did not prompt educators to seek special help for \n     the boy, or at least lead to a referral to child protection \n     services for an investigation into his home life.\n       ``If he [the father] could figure it out so quickly, why \n     can't we, the police, the educators and the psychologists?'' \n     Picknell said. ``All the warning signs were there, but we are \n     not very good about recognizing them,'' the sheriff said.\n       Today there was nobody at the Juliah Street house, a one-\n     story bungalow with an old car on cinder blocks on the muddy \n     front lawn. But a neighbor, who said she was too afraid of \n     reprisals to give her name, said there was a lot of traffic \n     in and out of the house late at night and that the occupants \n     ``never went to sleep.'' She said that even before two \n     occupants were arrested in connection with the burglary \n     nearby last summer, residents had complained to the police \n     about drug dealing in the house, but that no action was \n     taken.\n       Another neighbor, Tammy Fortin, who said she coincidentally \n     is related by marriage to Kayla, said, ``It's a drug house. \n     There are so many in this area that I'm scared for my kids, \n     and the cops won't do anything about it.''\n       Fortin, who said her husband's brother is Kayla's \n     stepfather, said the dead girl was a ``very well-behaved \n     little girl, loved by everybody. It's just an awful \n     tragedy.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ______. PESTICIDE APPLICATION IN SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each school that receives Federal funding \n     shall--\n       (1) take steps to reduce the exposure of children to \n     pesticides on school grounds, both indoors and outdoors; and\n       (2) provide parents and guardians of children that attend \n     the school with advance notification of certain pesticide \n     applications on school grounds in accordance with subsections \n     (b) and (c).\n       (b) EPA List of Toxic Pesticides.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall distribute to each school that \n     receives Federal funding the current manual of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency that guides schools in the \n     establishment of a least toxic pesticide policy.\n       (2) List.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall provide each school that receives \n     Federal funding with a list of pesticides that contain a \n     substance that the Administrator has identified as a known or \n     probable carcinogen, a developmental or reproductive toxin, \n     or a category I or II acute nerve toxin.\n       (c) Parental Notification of Toxic Pesticide Applications \n     in Schools.--\n       (1) In general.--On or after the date that is 18 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, any school that \n     receives Federal funding shall not apply any pesticide \n     described in paragraph (b)(2) on school grounds, either \n     indoors or outdoors, unless an administrative official of the \n     school provides notice of the planned application to parents \n     and guardians of children that attend the school not later \n     than 48 hours before the application of the pesticide.\n       (2) Notice.--The notice described in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) shall include--\n       (i) a description of the intended area of application; and\n       (ii) the name of each pesticide to be applied; and\n       (B) shall indicate whether the pesticide is a known or \n     probable carcinogen, a developmental or reproductive toxin, \n     or a category I or II acute nerve toxin.\n       (3) Incorporation of notice.--The notice described in \n     paragraph (1) may be incorporated in any notice that is being \n     sent to parents and guardians at the time at which the \n     pesticide notice is required to be sent.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very hopeful that this amendment, \nunlike the other one that I have pending, will get the support of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle.\n  For a long time I have been talking about the need for a children's \nenvironmental protection act. It is very important we understand that \nour children are not little adults; they are quite different from \nadults. They are growing; they are changing; and certain exposures are \nmuch more harmful to them than they would be for us.\n  My amendment does two things. It gives parents notification before \ntoxic pesticides are applied in their children's schools. It also \nrequires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \ndistribute to schools its guide on the establishment of a least-toxic-\npesticide policy. In other words, we have already got the work done. \nHere it is. It talks about how we can lessen the bad impact on our \nchildren by using the kinds of products that will harm them the least. \nRight now, the EPA does send this out, but it is a spotty situation; \nthey don't send it to all of the schools.\n  What we are asking for is a 48-hour notice so parents know that these \nsubstances are being sprayed, if they are, in fact, toxic, and if they \nare, in fact, a product that could harm the children.\n  Of course, what we really want to do is lower the use of toxic \npesticides. That would be the very best thing we could do. That is our \nultimate hope. That is why we are encouraging the Environmental \nProtection Agency to work with our schools. But, unfortunately, we have \nvery toxic products being sprayed on our schools today.\n  Why is it important that parents know this is occurring? Because \npesticides, by definition, are meant to kill living things. Exposure to \npesticides has been linked to cancer, neurological disorders, and \nlearning disabilities. A common insecticide schools currently spray on \nbaseboards and floors to kill cockroaches and ants--it has an active \ningredient called chlorpyrifos--is classified by the EPA as a nerve \ntoxin. Since we know some of these common pesticides contain a nerve \ntoxin, we have to ask what are the effects of our children's exposure \nto nerve toxin.\n  The acute effects of this type of toxin include headaches, dizziness, \nmental confusion, and vomiting. We know potential effects include \ndecreased neurological performance. We know that because there have \nbeen some studies about which I will discuss.\n  These risks are much more prevalent in children than adults because, \nagain, children are not little adults; they are different. A 1993 \nNational Academy of Sciences report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants \nand Children, documented what has long been known by children's health \nprofessionals: Children are at greater risk to experience the harmful \neffects of pesticide exposure than adults. The National Academy \nexplained that children face greater exposure to pesticides because, \npound for pound of body weight, they eat more food and drink more water \nand breathe more air than adults. In other words, they are smaller and \ntherefore their intake is greater as a proportion of their body weight.\n\n  Children are rapidly growing, and their developing systems are more \nvulnerable to harmful effects of pesticides. I referred to a study. A \nstudy conducted in Mexico had children exposed to these very harmful \npesticides make a drawing of a stick figure. I have that in the \ncloakroom, if anyone is interested in looking. The children who were \nexposed to the pesticides could not put together a stick figure. The \nones who had no exposure were able to do it as a normal child would. \nThat study certainly helps demonstrate why we should encourage schools \nto adopt the least toxic pesticide program.\n  I will close with this: My amendment is not some new idea, because \nmany schools in my home State go beyond what is provided for in this \namendment. For example, in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Mendocino, \nand Arcata school districts in California, they have all adopted \npolicies to prohibit the use of these toxic pesticides. I am not even \ngoing that far. My amendment merely requires, if we are going to use \nthem, let the families know in advance.\n  We should try to help schools get off of these products. My amendment \ntakes the first step toward reducing the use of toxic pesticides in \nschools nationwide by encouraging schools to adopt similar policies to \nthose I have cited in my home State.\n  I think it is important, since we look to parents to protect their \nchildren, that those parents have the information and can decide how to \nproceed. Maybe if they find out there is toxic spraying going on, they \nwill get together and try to come forward with a different brand of \npesticide. All in all, I think we are giving parents more tools to be \nable to control the lives of their children and what their children are \nexposed to.\n  I am very hopeful that the Republican side of the aisle will reach \nacross the aisle and accept this amendment. If they do so, I will not \nrequire a recorded vote; a voice vote will do just fine.\n  I ask my friend from Georgia does he have any information as to \nwhether this amendment will be able to be accepted and disposed of by a \nvoice vote at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, if I might respond to the Senator from \nCalifornia, I am not 100 percent certain. As I told her when she came \nto the floor, it appears that that will be acceptable; in which case, \nwe will do a voice vote. But I am not totally certain\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\nyet. I am sure I will be by the time we start voting.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much because I think we could all \nbe proud of this amendment. It is quite simple. Again, we are giving \nparents information they should have, and we are essentially telling \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to do a better job of getting this \nbooklet out to all the school districts.\n  I thank my friends for their indulgence and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer \namendment be set aside and Senator Landrieu be allowed to speak for 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2867\n\n  (Purpose: To promote teacher and principal quality and professional \n                              development)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Bayh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment numbered 2867.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, and myself. Others may be joining.\n  The amendment has to do with improving the quality of teaching in our \npublic schools, to provide resources to our States and our local \ncommunities to help teachers gain additional professional skills to \nhelp them do a better job in the classroom.\n  The amendment will provide an additional $1 billion to States and \nlocal governments. It will encourage States to design their own \ninitiatives. Many States are well on their way in this regard and are \nseeing great progress. Other States and other communities have a long \nway to go.\n  I am not going to spend my time right now relaying all the statistics \nin this regard, only to say that a large percentage--by some estimates, \n40 percent; in some communities, 50 percent--of the teachers teaching \nin public elementary and high schools are not certified and, by the \nstandards set by their own local communities and States, not qualified \nto teach a particular subject matter.\n  In particular, we have had a shortage of teachers in the math and \nscience areas. Although we have made great progress in that particular \narea in the last couple of years, we have a way to go.\n  On the general issue of education, I thank my colleague from Georgia \nfor his handling of this issue. I say to both of the leaders and to my \ncolleagues, I hope we will stay on the issue of education. It is the \nmost important issue to the American public. Whether our children are \nin public school or not, as taxpayers, as parents, as grandparents, as \nyoung people, this issue is weighing heavily on the American people \ntoday. They want the proper and appropriate response from Washington. \nThey want us to discuss it, but, more importantly, they want us to act.\n\n  Whether we agree to pass this bill or not, one thing is clear in our \nminds: We all agree that elementary and secondary education in America \nis in need of reform. We must accelerate the progress and the reforms \nthat are underway.\n  It is simply taking too long. We are not making enough progress in \nthe areas where we need to, satisfied with the status quo. It is not \nbecause public schools aren't working, it is that they are just not \nworking well enough for the children and families who need them the \nmost and depend on them the most. And we have reams and reams and reams \nof material to back up this statement. We all agree that the current \nrate of student achievement is simply not satisfactory for a large \nnumber of our students.\n  Again, there are many public schools that are working well. There are \nmany classrooms--hundreds and thousands--that are functioning \nbeautifully. Yet, under the status quo, many students are being left \nbehind, many districts left out, many States not meeting the goals.\n  We must begin in this year, the year 2000, to consider new ways to \nhelp increase the quality of learning for our youth. We are not alone \nin this sentiment in the Senate or in the House. Pick up any newspaper \nor magazine daily and you will see articles on the need for reform and \nthe need for new testing results and smaller class size. School \nconstruction has been in the daily headlines for months--in fact, \nyears. Speak to any parent and they will tell us about the need for \nchange. Talk with teachers who are in the classrooms.\n  Of the eight goals set by the National Goals Panel in 1992, which \nmany of us and many Governors and grassroots leaders worked on, not one \nhas been satisfactorily accomplished to date.\n  Admittedly, some of the goals were quite lofty--if you will, reaching \nfor the stars. Nonetheless, in the 6 years after a tremendous amount of \nwork, a tremendous amount of money, we are not making significant \nprogress. Up to 28 categories were chosen to monitor these 8 goals in \nthe United States as a whole, and we have improved in only 12 of those \ncategories. We have made no progress in 11, and we have actually \ndeclined in 5.\n  Here is the National Education Goals Report which contains all of \nthese details. They are discouraging, in my opinion. I am happy to see \nthat we have made significant progress in increasing our math and \nscience scores. But we have gone down in some very important areas--in \nteacher certification; reading scores at the 4th grade, 8th grade, and \n12th grade levels have not appreciably improved. According to the \nNational Commission on Teaching in America, fewer than 75 percent of \nall teachers have been licensed specifically in their area.\n  This is not the kind of reform--or at least the pace of reform--we \nshould accept, or we need to accept, or we need to embrace. We need to \nsay, yes, while we are doing some things very well, we have to \naccelerate the pace of reform and make some fundamental changes.\n  My husband and I are building a house here on Capitol Hill, and it \nhas been a wonderful experience--if we can get through this without \nfighting too much and all of the things that go along with building a \nhouse. It sort of reminds me of this debate. We spend a lot of time in \nthe Senate and House floor giving speeches about specific areas. We \ntalk about school construction, early childhood education, teacher \nquality, or new reading programs, which are all good. It is like \ntalking about redesigning a window or redesigning a kitchen or redoing \na living room. I am talking about something many of us feel strongly \nabout--a new foundation.\n  We need to build a ``bigger house'' so that all the children can find \na place in this house. We need to build a much better house. You can't \ndo it by arguing about the size of windows, or the color of the carpet, \nor the decor of the living room, which is how we are spending a lot of \nour time here. We need to talk about fundamental, foundational change \nin the way the Federal Government helps to reform and accelerate the \npace of reform in America today.\n\n  Let me outline a few principles that I think are very important.\n  No. 1, in my opinion, we can't do this in the piecemeal manner in \nwhich we have been approaching it--whether it is a great idea for a new \ntax gimmick or scheme, or a good tax policy, depending on how you look \nat what we have debated, whether it is about a specific amendment, or \nschool construction, or a new bond issue that will give us interest-\nfree loans for our local governments or even extend the debt.\n  We need to accept the fact that comprehensive reform is necessary. We \nhave that opportunity in this Congress. As we go to the reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is now in \ncommittee and being debated in our Education Committee, it is my great \nhope that out of that committee and to this floor will come not a \npiecemeal approach, but a fundamental, foundational approach that would \nhave a couple of components: One, that we would trust our\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\nlocal government and our Governors and our mayors and our legislators, \nand that it would be a bipartisan trust, and say that many Governors--\nnot all--have been making considerable headway in their States with new \naccountability standards, new innovation, pressing hard to make sure \nthe resources get to the classroom.\n  One of the great changes we need to make in a comprehensive way is \nsaying that we don't have all the answers, and we don't want to \nmicromanage, that we want to trust our local government officials and \ngive them the flexibility they need toward this accelerated reform \nabout which I am speaking. We need to reward them for their \nperformance, reward them for being successful. Stop rewarding failure. \nStop giving more money to the schools that have poor results, and start \nencouraging our local officials through the way we fund elementary and \nsecondary education, and base our funding on the rate of improvement so \neach school area competes against its own standards; and when a school \nfails, encourage the local system, when there is a failing, to take \nreal measures. Don't leave the children in a school that is not \nworking. They have already been punished enough.\n  Let us create a comprehensive system of reform that rewards \ninnovation, that expects excellence, and that stops being satisfied \nwith failure, and trust our local officials to do that.\n  I feel very strongly about the word ``accountability,'' but we toss \nit around so much. I am not sure we all agree on what it means. I don't \nwant them accounting for the number of pencils purchased or the numbers \nof textbooks. I don't want them accounting for the number of computers. \nI want to have the locals account for the improvement of test scores of \ntheir students. How are the teachers improving? Is there greater \nparental involvement? These are the measures of accountability on \nwhether a school is working or not. And I will also go so far as to say \nit is not only test scores, although that is clearly important, and we \nneed to have national standards set perhaps at local levels, but \nnational measurements of achievement. But also the morale of the \nschool, the enthusiasm of parents, and the spirit of the teachers and \nthe principals all should be considered in terms of the way we fund \nschools and what we expect.\n\n  I can walk into a school--and I have walked into hundreds of them, as \nyou have, Mr. President, and as many of our colleagues have--and tell \nfrom the minute I walk in the door whether the school is working or \nnot, and whether there is learning going on. It doesn't matter if the \nplace is shiny and painted, although that helps and lifts your spirit. \nBut it is also about the brightness in the eyes of the students, and \nthe brightness in the eyes of the teachers and the principals, that \nthey are a team, that they are working together and accomplishing great \nthings.\n  Some of the schools I have visited in very poor areas with very poor \nchildren are doing a beautiful job. In some places, it seems everything \nshould be going well because on the outside it all looks good, but \nthere is not a lively spirit.\n  It is hard to legislate along these lines. But I think it is a real \ngoal we should strive for to determine our funding in a way that \nencourages that kind of light and commitment at the local level and to \njoin with our Governors and with our legislators and not against them \nin this effort.\n  It is my great hope we will continue this debate. I know we are going \nto vote on this particular bill tonight. But, again, this is like \ndiscussing a particular window dressing. It might help the overall look \nof the house and actually make the house be part of a great looking \nbuilding, but we need to be talking about the great foundation. I hope \nthis Congress will stay on education week after week this year, and \nnext year if necessary, until we get the new foundation laid for the \nway the Federal Government should work with our local governments so \nthat we can have accelerated, positive reform in public schools.\n  I know people are frustrated. The answer is not to abandon the public \nschool system. It is not to walk away through vouchers or other \nsystems. It is to stand steady and redo the foundation in a \ncomprehensive reform at the national level, which is only 7 to 9 \npercent of the budget, but an important 7 to 9 percent of the total \neducation budget, and stand steady and produce comprehensive Federal \nlegislative reform from this level to ensure every school is working in \nevery community for every child. I believe we most certainly can meet \nthat test.\n  One of my colleagues, Senator Herb Kohl from Wisconsin, is also \nsupportive of this amendment and wanted to associate himself with the \nstatement. I certainly appreciate his help and his support.\n  Let me close by saying, again, I thank the leaders who have been \nhelping us with this particular debate and thank all of my colleagues \nwho have spent their time coming down to the floor and talking about \nvery important and significant issues. But, again, I believe the time \nis now, since this report was issued in 1999, to recognize that while \nsome good things are happening, they are not happening fast enough. We \ncannot be satisfied with the status quo. We cannot continue to be \npiecemeal in our efforts. A comprehensive overhaul of the way the \nFederal Government funds education, trusting our local officials, \ngranting flexibility, focusing on accountability, and, yes, increasing \nresources.\n  I am one of the Members of this body who has agreed on a tax cut that \ncan be reasonable and responsible. I also agree it is a great time to \nmake some strategic investments. I, for one, would be willing to make a \nhuge investment in education but not unless structural reform is in \nplace. We cannot continue to throw more money at an old problem and be \nsatisfied with a rate of result which is not good enough and is leaving \ntoo many of our students behind.\n  I believe the budget is at least poised to make some significant \ninvestment in education. Let us do it with comprehensive reform and a \nnew direction of Federal support that will result in greater \nperformance of our schools at the local level. I think we are up to the \ntask. I know we can do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I thank the Senators who have joined me in this particular amendment. \nI may or may not ask for a vote on this particular amendment before we \nfinish this debate.\n  But I also wanted to mention Senators Lincoln and Breaux. I mentioned \nSenator Bayh. Senator Lieberman is supportive of this particular \namendment. We may or may not ask for a specific vote on it, but, again, \nI want to reiterate how important comprehensive reform us and to take \nthe time this year to get it done.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of both the pending \namendment and the underlying Education Savings Account bill. Education \nSavings Accounts will clearly help some families save money for their \nchildren's education, but they are only part of the solution to \nimproving education in our country.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana is another part. \nIt represents the work of several Senators who are trying to take a \nrealistic, effective approach to improving public education. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a serious look at our \nbill, the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and \nResponsibility Act--better known as ``Three R's''.\n  We have made great strides in the past six years toward improving \npublic education. Nearly all States now have academic standards in \nplace. More students are taking more challenging courses. Test scores \nhave risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased. But there are still \nsignificant improvements to be made. A recent study of students from 41 \ndifferent countries found that American students still score far behind \nthose in other countries.\n  Addressing this sort of fundamental failure is going to take more \nthan cosmetic reform. We are going to have to take a fresh look at the \nstructure of Federal education programs. We need to let go of the tired \npartisan fighting over more spending versus block grants and take a \nmiddle ground approach that will truly help our States, school \ndistricts--and most importantly, our students.\n  Our ``Three R's'' bill does just that. It makes raising student \nachievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap \nbetween low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To \naccomplish this, our bill centers around three principles.\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\n  First, we believe that we must continue to invest in education, and \ninvest wisely, targeting funds where they are needed the most. Second, \nwe believe that States and local school districts are in the best \nposition to know what their educational needs are. They should be given \nmore flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars to meet \nthose needs. And third, and most importantly, in exchange for increased \nflexibility, public schools must be accountable for results. These \nprinciples are a pyramid, with accountability being the base that \nsupports the federal government's grant of flexibility and funds.\n  For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to \nStates and school districts--regardless of how well they educate their \nstudents. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good \njob. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are \nstruggling to do a better job. And we need to stop subsidizing failure.\n  The amendment before us now is the Teacher Quality and Professional \nDevelopment section of the ``Three R's'' bill. It would increase \nfunding for teacher quality and professional development to $2 billion, \nand target those funds to the neediest school districts. It gives \nStates and school districts more flexibility to design teacher \nrecruitment, mentoring, and professional development programs. And it \nrequires States and school districts to ensure that every student will \nbe taught by a fully qualified teacher--and holds them accountable for \nmaking sure that happens.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us today is just one part of the \n``Three R's'' bill. It focuses on one of the most important parts of \nimproving education--improving teaching. It is an example of how, by \nusing the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility--and \nmost importantly, accountability--we can work with our State and local \npartners to make sure every child is taught by a qualified teacher. I \nlook forward to continuing to work on these issues when the Senate \nconsiders ESEA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nof the Senator from Louisiana be set aside, and the Senator from New \nYork be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2868\n\n(Purpose: To put teachers first by providing grants for master teacher \n                               programs)\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] for himself, and \n     Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 2868.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n            TITLE ____--21ST CENTURY MASTER TEACHER PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Mr. President, I rise to offer my amendment, the \nTeachers First Act, to the education bill we are currently considering.\n  If you had listened to the debate over the last 2 days on this bill \nas I have, there is not a single Senator who is satisfied with the \nquality of education in our public schools. We have different \nprescriptions, but we are unanimous in our belief that U.S. schools \nmust do better in this globally competitive and idea-based world.\n  In my own State, at the end of the last fiscal year, New Yorkers were \nshocked to learn that half of the State's fourth grade students could \nbarely handle written and oral work. Over the past 8 years, the number \nof New York schools cited for poor performance has more than doubled. \nThis is simply unacceptable.\n  I am concerned, of course, as a Senator from New York, but I am even\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\nmore concerned as a parent because my two daughters attend public \nschools in New York City.\n  For me, if we could accomplish only one thing, if we could make only \none change to our schools to raise the quality of education for all \nkids, it must be to improve the quality of our teachers and make the \nteaching profession more attractive to young people.\n  In the past, America was able to attract high-quality young people to \nteach--top-quality women who were locked out of other professional \nfields, talented men because of the promise of stable employment, or as \nan alternative to the Vietnam war draft. Today, very unfortunately for \nour country, to choose to teach is to choose financial sacrifice. And \nquality has become less important than filling vacant teacher slots. \nThis has to change for a whole bunch of reasons.\n  First, today's economy depends more on the quality of the minds we \nprovide in our schools than the minerals we dig in the soil or the \nwealth of the fields.\n  Two, we have an enormous teacher shortage on the horizon.\n  Three, studies tell us that teacher qualifications account for more \nthan 90 percent of the differences of students' reading and math \nscores.\n  Let me repeat that because it is an astounding fact.\n  Studies tell us that teacher qualifications account for more than 90 \npercent of the differences in students' reading and math scores. So \nquality and training count.\n  The bad news is that more than 12 percent of all newly hired teachers \nenter the workforce with no training at all, and 37 percent of all new \nteachers nationwide lack full certification.\n  I was at a reception of the North Carolina Community Bankers. I had \nnot had lunch and I wanted to smell the crab cakes. I told them about \nthe amendment I was submitting because much of the idea of this \namendment came from the work of Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina. One of \nthe bankers said: Why should we have any teachers who are not \ncertified? I said: We shouldn't. He said: Why do we let them teach?\n  The answer is very simple. We do not have enough qualified teachers \napplying for the jobs at existing salary levels. Given the working \nconditions of a teacher, given that the starting salary of a teacher in \nAmerica is $24,000 a year, schools--particularly in rural and inner-\ncity areas, but now in other places, too--are facing a Hobson's choice: \nno teacher or an unqualified teacher, an uncertified teacher.\n  There is no other choice. The number of people who are certified \ndoesn't fill the need for the number of teachers.\n  I think it should be a given in this great democracy of ours that \nevery American child deserves to be taught by a highly qualified and \nmotivated teacher. Scarce Federal dollars should be used to support and \nhelp replicate successful programs to recruit and retain high-quality \nteachers. And we should have standards in accountability to ensure that \nwe are doing right by our children.\n  I am proud to have worked with Senator Kennedy, and I compliment \nSenator Kennedy's tremendous leadership on his qualified-teacher-in-\nevery-classroom amendment. This effort, unfortunately, failed this \nafternoon. It would have included mentoring and professional \ndevelopment programs, provided resources and ongoing support to \nteachers, particularly in the subject areas of math and science where \nthey are desperately needed. The number of teachers, by the way, in \nmath and science who are qualified and certified overall is very low \nfor the simple reason those individuals can make virtually double in \nthe private sector with a background in math and science.\n  Second, that accountability measures for States and local districts \nto improve teacher quality be real.\n  Third, that recruitment efforts to attract the best and brightest \ncontinue.\n  As a complement to the fine work of Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, \nWellstone, Murray, Reed, and others, I am introducing an amendment that \nwill provide funding for teachers to complete a 1-year intensive \nprogram to become board certified. The National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards is the gold seal of certification. We want doctors, \naccountants, and architects to obtain board certification. We must have \nthe same for teachers.\n  I am one who believes strongly in standards and accountability in the \neducational system. I do not believe we should be lowering the bar for \nteachers or for students. To lower the bar is the end of a great \nAmerican tradition of meritocracy; that is, no matter who you are or \nwhere you come from, if you meet certain standards, you get the job.\n  On the other hand, if we are not going to lower the bar--and we \ncertainly shouldn't, and I support many of my colleagues in that \nviewpoint on both sides of the aisle--we then have to make sure people \ncan get over the bar.\n  If there are too few teachers right now who meet certification, we \ncan have uncertified teachers in the classroom or we can help more \nteachers become certified. That is the nub of this program.\n\n  Board certification requires teachers to undergo a rigorous regime of \ntesting and assessments based on actual classroom teaching, lesson \nplans, and student work samples. This is not some abstract test that \none takes. This is real on-the-job training. Teachers seeking board \ncertification are also required to pass written exams designed to test \nsubject matter knowledge, curriculum design, and student assessment \ntechniques. The process takes nearly a year and costs $2,000.\n  My proposal provides $50 million a year in grants for 5 years to \ncover 75 percent of the costs of certification in those districts with \nthe highest concentration of teachers who are not certified or \nlicensed. The local district would match the remaining 25 percent and \nteachers would agree to remain within the school district as master \nteachers for at least 2 years after certification.\n  Why don't we just simply allow localities to do this on their own? \nBecause they don't. They are strapped for funds, they have day-to-day \nneeds and concerns, and they will take an uncertified teacher and put \nthem in the classroom because they are faced with the choice of no \nteacher.\n  This is just the type of program the Federal Government should \ninitiate. We shouldn't mandate a program on the school districts. No \nschool district has to participate in this. Rather, we ought to focus \non the pressure points and pinpoint where a little financial incentive \nwill encourage school districts to do things that we think we need.\n  As my colleague, Senator Dodd, said in a private conversation the \nother day, we do have national values. To give money to local school \ndistricts and say, do whatever you want with it, ensures the same old \nsituation with which we are not happy. If we agree that we should raise \nthe bar for who should be teachers, what better method than to give \ndollars to local school districts that wish to help certify more \nteachers? Not all dollars; they have to match it 25 percent so it means \nsomething to them, but it gives them help.\n  The bottom line is that we have to make teaching an exalted \nprofession in the 21st century as the professions of law and medicine \nhave been in the 20th century. My amendment is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Today, only nine States have over 90 percent of their teachers who \nare nationally board certified. My own State has 61 board certified \nteachers; 61 out of 205,000 teachers in New York State. That ratio is \nabysmal. It is time to make a change. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:45 \nthe votes commence, with the first vote limited to 15 minutes and all \nsuccessive votes be limited to 10 minutes. There will be 2 minutes for \nexplanations prior to each vote. I also ask any amendment agreed to by \nthe Senate be modified to conform to the earlier-passed Roth amendment.\n  Let me announce the sequence of the votes: Coverdell, Boxer, \nBingaman, Wellstone, Feinstein-Sessions, Durbin, Kerry, Boxer, Schumer, \nand final passage.\n  The leader has advised both managers that the time limits on the \nvotes will be strictly adhered to. We had a lot of trouble earlier this \nafternoon. He is insistent that we follow this schedule. Some of these \nvotes may be by voice vote. We are still working on that.\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\n  This is the general outline of where we are going in the next 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be added to the \nagreement that Senators Torricelli and Lieberman have the remaining \ntime until 6:45 to speak. Senator Lieberman wants to speak to the \nLandrieu amendment and Senator Torricelli wants to speak on the bill \nitself.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I didn't hear the rest of \nit. We had an arrangement to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. At 6:45.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I should be here at 6:45.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to speak both in favor of the underlying proposal offered by \nthe Senator from Georgia and the Senator from New Jersey, which I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of, but also to speak on behalf of an \namendment that has been introduced by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, on behalf of herself, Senator Bayh, and myself.\n  Let me say briefly, on the underlying proposal, it is a modest but \nimportant proposal which encourages parents and enables parents through \nthe tax benefits provided to set aside some money for their children's \nfuture, and to use it for a variety of educational purposes that have \nbeen well outlined here. This proposal, as has been said over and over \nagain, is no different than existing legislation for use at the college \nlevel. I support it enthusiastically and think it is a step forward. It \nwill be of particular help to struggling middle-class families who want \nthe best for their children's education and often find it hard to pay \nthe way. This will help them just a little bit.\n\n  Second, speaking about the amendment offered by Senator Landrieu and \nSenator Bayh and myself, as I have followed the debate on the \nCoverdell-Torricelli proposal, I have been troubled, again, to see the \nSenate divided largely along partisan lines. The lines are familiar, \nthe arguments have been heard before, but they do not get us anywhere, \nand they particularly do not respond to the message that I get clearly \nwhen I go home and speak to people in Connecticut and that I guess my \ncolleagues here get when they go to their respective States. It is that \nthere is nothing that matters more to the people of America today than \nto improve our system of education, particularly public education, but \nall education, private, faith-based as well.\n  If we respond to that clear plea, that priority of our constituents, \nwith partisanship and posturing that produces nothing but a \ncontinuation of the status quo, then shame on us. So in hopes of \nreaching a realistic consensus in the weeks ahead, this debate in some \nways has been a warm-up. But it is an important one that has substance \nattached to it for the broader debate on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  The amendment Senator Landrieu has put forward is a piece of a \nbroader proposal that she and I and Senator Bayh, Senator Lincoln, and \nothers are developing as a total reform of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. It is building on good news in a number of our States \nwhich are moving in the direction, not of a fixation with rules and \nregulations or bureaucracies but concentrating instead on results: How \ncan we improve the educational performance of our children?\n  In the States that are succeeding, they are doing three things. \nFirst, they are infusing new resources into their public education \nsystems. We are going to have to invest more. Second, they are giving \nlocal districts more flexibility in how they meet those higher \nstandards as they determine the needs of their children and local \nschool systems. Third, they are demanding new measures and mechanisms \nof accountability to increase the chance that these investments will \nyield the intended return, which is higher academic achievement by all \nof our students. Those are the goals of the bill that Senators \nLandrieu, Bayh, Lincoln, I and several others are drafting.\n  It calls for revamping the framework of our Federal education \nprograms and engaging the States in a new performance-based \npartnership, where we would significantly increase Federal funding to \nhelp our schools meet these new expectations, to target these new \ndollars to the communities and children who are disadvantaged, who need \nthem most, and to provide State and local officials with broad latitude \nin allocating these resources to meet their specific priorities. We \nthen hold the States responsible for showing progress in meeting those \ngoals, to reward those who do and, yes, to punish those who do not \nbetter educate our children.\n  In this approach, we believe and hope, are the seeds of a bipartisan \nsolution. It brings together what is best on both sides of the favored \neducational reform. For those who call for more resources and more \ntargeting to poor urban and rural districts, we are proposing \nincreasing our investment in ESEA by $25 billion over the next 5 years, \n80 percent of which would be put into title I.\n\n  For those who call for more flexibility of local control, we propose \nconsolidating the mass of Federal categorical grant programs, a kind of \nWashington-knows-best attitude, into five performance-based partnership \ngrants, all of which are tied to the overarching goal of raising our \nchildren's academic achievement. And for everyone, the parent in \nparticular, who is concerned about the bottom line--and the bottom line \nhere is how well are my children being educated--we propose making \naccountability our new education linchpin by rewarding States that \nexceed their own performance goals and punishing those who routinely \nfail to show such progress.\n  We plan to introduce this bill next week and hope to have it \nconsidered on the floor during the ESEA debate. In the meantime, I \nappeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a hard look \nat that proposal and the ideas behind it.\n  I recognize nothing we do at the Federal level can, by itself, solve \nthe problems of education in our country. But we can create incentives \nfor change and innovation. We can identify the way and build the will \nto get there, which is our goal, as is, may I say, the goal of the \nunderlying bill before the Senate today.\n  I support the Landrieu amendment. I am proud also to state my support \nfor the Coverdell-Torricelli bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think by previous accord, not \nnecessarily by unanimous consent, Senator Torricelli will have the time \nremaining until the voting occurs.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I first express my admiration and, \nindeed, thanks to Senator Coverdell who, through these many days and \nmany years, has both written this measure and brought it to this moment \nof judgment. I have been proud to be his partner in this process, \nthough admittedly he has shouldered far more than half of this load, \nbringing us to this moment of judgment. I am genuinely grateful and \nproud to have worked with him.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think the Senator knows the compliments are mutually \nshared.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my colleague.\n  At this point I think every argument has been made and almost \neverybody has made them. This Senate has now looked at the question of \neducation savings accounts from every possible perspective. I know \nthese arguments, both for and against the legislation, have been \nsincerely made. But, indeed, I fear that what is the beginning of a \nlong and detailed analysis of the problems of American education has \nbeen plagued by a perennial senatorial problem, and that is making the \nperfect the enemy of the good.\n  Neither Senator Coverdell nor I have ever argued that offering these \nprivate savings accounts would solve every education problem in \nAmerica. They will not. No Senator could come to this floor with any \nproposal solving every problem. But they are the opening shot in a \nrevolution in American education, a revolution that, if we are wise \nenough, will at some point include the construction of new schools, the \nraising of teacher salaries, the increasing of accountability, and new \nstandards. But on this day, if we succeed, it changes the battle lines \nin American education by bringing private resources and the private \ncommunity into the process of education.\n  Throughout the history of our country, we have allowed American \neducation to be simply a question of what\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\nlocal governments, sometimes with Federal resources, can do through the \ninstruments of Government to educate children. That formula will always \ndominate American education. We seek to change it if only in this \nmarginal degree. By the use of these private savings accounts, we \nestimate that $12 billion of family resources will be used to help \neducate children from kindergarten through high school. That is not a \nsubstitute for public resources. It does not divert public resources. \nIndeed, not a dollar of public money is diverted from the public \nschools to any other institution. It does allow the community, a family \nat the birth of a child, to establish these savings accounts and then \ncall upon grandparents, parents, cousins, churches, synagogues, labor \nunions, and corporations to contribute moneys into these funds.\n  That cannot be bad. Mr. President, $12 billion will be spent on \neducation tomorrow that is not spent today. We may divide on other \nissues of education, but no one can sincerely argue in this Chamber \nthose resources are not needed or that it is not a good thing parents \nor churches or grandparents have a vehicle to participate in that \nchild's education.\n  I know my colleagues, particularly my Democratic colleagues, are \nsincere when they express concern, but this legislation will not help \nevery child. I cannot argue that point. There are some families so \nwealthy they may not qualify, and there are some families so poor they \nmay not be able to contribute or find sponsors who will. For them, \nthere are other days, other legislation, and other proposals which this \nSenate has an obligation to consider. But on this day, on this vote, \nfor millions of American families, working-class families, people who \nwork hard every day, middle-income families who can save $50, $100, \n$1,000 for their child, this is a vehicle.\n  Under what possible reason would the Federal Government be taxing the \ninterest of an account where a family saves for the education of their \nchild? Not only should we not be taxing it, we should be doing \neverything possible to encourage that family to save that money. It \nwill help most families.\n  Yet many of my colleagues still argue: But the money will be diverted \nfrom public schools. No, I say to my colleagues, not a dollar. Indeed, \nthe CBO has estimated that 70 percent of this money will actually be \nspent by public school students.\n  The other day, in this Chamber, my friend and my colleague, whom I \nadmire greatly, Senator Dodd, said: But the public schools are free. \nNo, I say to my colleagues, public schools are not free. Afterschool \nactivities cost money, tutors cost money, transportation costs money, \nbooks cost money, computers cost money.\n  Some of the greatest champions in the Senate of public schools in \nAmerica have argued against this legislation in the belief they are \ndefending public schools. Most of this $12 billion will go to the \npublic schools so middle-class families and working families will be \nable to use these funds to help pay for public school activities. Yet \nsome of this money will also go to help pay the tuition of private \nschool students, and that is a good thing, too.\n  I say to my colleagues, this has been a good debate. This is a sound \nproposal. I hope and I trust on a bipartisan basis we will send a \nsignal that this Congress is finally serious about genuine education \nreform; that we will return on another day to deal with the problem of \nteacher salaries, construction, and standards, but that on this day, we \nwill marshal private resources to deal with the public and private \nschool problems of America.\n\n  This is good, and it is sound legislation. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives on an overwhelming bipartisan basis. Almost every \nMember of this Senate voted for the identical proposal to fund higher \neducation. Now we offer the same bill with the identical language to \ndeal with K through 12. Senator Coverdell, I believe, has made a great \ncontribution by this legislation. I am very proud to join with him in \noffering it and very proud that it has become a genuinely bipartisan \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 6:45 p.m. having arrived, under \nthe previous order, the Senate will proceed to vote.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey \nfor his dedication and courage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2867, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Landrieu \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I further ask for the yeas and nays on the \nDurbin amendment and on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it shall be in order to \norder the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2880, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer \namendment No. 2880 on pesticides be modified with the changes that are \nat the desk and that we proceed to a voice vote. Under the procedures \nof voting, the Senator will have 1 minute of explanation, and then we \nwill proceed to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ______. PESTICIDE APPLICATION IN SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each school that receives Federal funding \n     shall--\n       (1) take steps to reduce the exposure of children to \n     pesticides on school grounds, both indoors and outdoors; and\n       (2) provide parents and guardians of children that attend \n     the school with advance notification of certain pesticide \n     applications on school grounds in accordance with subsections \n     (b) and (c).\n       (b) EPA List of Toxic Pesticides.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall distribute to each school that \n     receives Federal funding the current manual of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency that guides schools in the \n     establishment of a least toxic pesticide policy.\n       (2) List.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall provide each school that receives \n     Federal funding with a list of pesticides that contain a \n     substance that the Administrator has identified as a known \n     carcinogen, a developmental or reproductive toxin, or a \n     category I or II acute nerve toxin.\n       (c) Parental Notification of Toxic Pesticide Applications \n     in Schools.--\n       (1) In general.--On or after the date that is 18 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, any school that \n     receives Federal funding shall not apply any pesticide \n     described in paragraph (b)(2) on school grounds, either \n     indoors or outdoors, unless an administrative official of the \n     school provides notice of the planned application to parents \n     and guardians of children that attend the school not later \n     than 48 hours before the application of the pesticide.\n       (2) Notice.--The notice described in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) shall include--\n       (i) a description of the intended area of application; and\n       (ii) the name of each pesticide to be applied; and\n       (B) shall indicate whether the pesticide is a known \n     carcinogen, a developmental or reproductive toxin, or a \n     category I or II acute nerve toxin.\n       (3) Incorporation of notice.--The notice described in \n     paragraph (1) may be incorporated in any notice that is being \n     sent to parents and guardians at the time at which the \n     pesticide notice is required to be sent.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Nevada would \nlike to speak for 1 minute, in addition to my 5 minutes; is that all \nright? Are we discussing the pesticide amendment or the gun amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Pesticide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding the Senator \nfrom California had 1 minute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is fine with the Senator from \nCalifornia. I thank my friend from Georgia. We made a small change in \nmy amendment. Essentially, what we are telling parents now is that if \nthe schools their kids go to are going to be sprayed with dangerous \npesticides that are known carcinogens, that could cause nerve damage, \nthey will be notified 48 hours in advance of the spraying that will be \ntaking place.\n  In addition, what we do is we instruct the Environmental Protection \nAgency to take the booklet they have already\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\nproduced on how to get away from using these very strong and toxic \npesticides and send it to every school district in America.\n  I am very pleased this is being done. I have a larger bill, the \nChildren's Environmental Protection Act, on which I invite everyone to \njoin me. Children are not little adults. I am a little adult, but \nchildren are growing and changing. Their bodies are changing, their \nhormones are changing, and they are absolutely more adversely impacted \nby these toxins.\n  I thank my colleague very much. I hope we can have a voice vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield back the 1 minute. I thank the \nSenator from California for her cooperation. I call for a voice vote on \nher amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2880, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2880), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2881\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a Manager's amendment to the bill as amended \n                    by Senate Amendment number 2869)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have a manager's amendment. It has \nbeen cleared on both sides. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for Mr. Roth, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2881.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.''\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I call for the adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been told by staff that this has been \ncleared by the minority on the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2881) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to address one provision in the \nmanagers' amendment that has been adopted.\n  The provision to which I am referring deals with the authority of the \nFederal Housing Finance Board to allocate authority to Federal Home \nLoan Banks to guarantee school construction bonds. The provision \ncontemplates legislation that ``expressly'' authorizes the Federal \nHousing Finance Board to allocate such authority to the Federal Home \nLoan Banks. No inference should be drawn from this provision with \nrespect to the Federal Housing Finance Board's current authority.\n  I note that the general counsel of the Board has issued a legal \nopinion arguing that the Board has the implicit legal authority to \nallocate authority to Federal Home Loan Banks to guarantee school \nconstruction bonds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from Deborah \nSilberman, General Counsel, Federal Housing Finance Board, dated March \n3, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Federal Housing Finance Board,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1999.\n     Mr. Paul S. Friend,\n     Vice President and General Counsel, Federal Home Loan Bank of \n         New York, New York, NY.\n\n     Regulatory Interpretation: FHLBank of New York Request for \n         Regulatory Interpretation Regarding FHLBank Authority to \n         Issue Standby Letters of Credit In Conjunction With Tax-\n         Exempt Bonds or Notes, Including School Construction \n         Bonds (99-RI-7).\n\n       Dear Mr. Friend: This is in response to your February 10, \n     1999 letter on behalf of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New \n     York (FHLBank), as supplemented by a February 18, 1999 \n     letter, requesting a Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance \n     Board) Regulatory Interpretation regarding the FHLBank's \n     authority, under recently promulgated Finance Board \n     regulations, to issue standby letters of credit (SLOCs) in \n     conjunction with tax-exempt bonds or notes.\n       Specifically, the FHLBank has requested confirmation that \n     under the recently adopted Finance Board Regulation on SLOCs, \n     the FHLBank would have authority to issue SLOCs in \n     conjunction with tax-exempt bonds or notes ``when the issues \n     are designed to promote housing or the financing of \n     commercial and economic development activities that benefit \n     low- and moderate-income families, or that are located in \n     low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.'' In addition, the \n     FHLBank requests confirmation that the FHLBank could issue a \n     ``confirming'' letter of credit on behalf of a member that \n     provides a letter of credit for the benefit of bondholders in \n     conjunction with a tax-exempt school construction bond \n     issuance. Your February 18, 1999 letter indicates that the \n     FHLBank's issuance of the confirming letter of credit would \n     enable bond rating agencies to issue a triple ``A'' rating on \n     the bond, as well as provide an additional guarantee of \n     payment to the boundholders.\n       The Finance Board's former Interim Policy Guidelines For \n     FHLBank Standby Letters Of Credit (SLOC Guidelines), Finance \n     Board Resolution No. 93-63 (July 28, 1993), provided that the \n     FHLBanks could issue or confirm SLOCs, on behalf of member \n     institutions, ``in conjunction with tax-exempt bonds or \n     notes, only when the issues are designed to promote housing \n     or the financing of commercial and economic development \n     activities that benefit low- and moderate-income families, or \n     that are located in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.'' \n     That is, the purpose of the tax-exempt bonds or notes had to \n     be the financing of housing or commercial and economic \n     development activities eligible for funding under the \n     Bank's Community Investment Program (CIP), see 12 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1430(i).\n       On November 23, 1998, the Finance Board adopted a final \n     regulation (SLOC Regulation), which codified and amended the \n     SLOC Guidelines to allow for broader use of SLOCs by members \n     and eligible nonmember mortgagees and eliminated or modified \n     some of the restrictions that had been imposed on the SLOC's \n     issued or confirmed by the FHLBanks. See 68 Fed. Reg. 65693 \n     (Nov. 30, 1998). The SLOC Guidelines were rescinded by the \n     Finance Board after the SLOC Regulation was adopted. See \n     Finance Board Resolution No. 98-50 (Nov. 23, 1998).\n       Section 938.2(a) of the SLOC Regulation provides that:\n       Each [FHL] Bank is authorized to issue or confirm on behalf \n     of members standby letters of credit that comply with the \n     requirements of this part, for any of the following purposes:\n       (1) To assist members in facilitating residential housing \n     finance;\n       (2) To assist members in facilitating community lending \n     that is eligible for any of the [FHL] Banks' CICA programs \n     under part 970 of this chapter;\n       (3) To assist members with asset/liability management; or\n       (4) To provide members with liquidity or other funding.\n     See 63 Fed. Reg. 65693, 65699-65700 (to be codified at 12 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 938.2(a)).\n       Where a member issues an SLOC to support a tax-exempt bond \n     or note issuance, a FILBank's issuance on behalf of the \n     member of a confirming SLOC enables the transaction to \n     receive a triple ``A'' rating from the bond rating agencies, \n     lowering the interest rate paid on the bonds or notes and \n     reducing the cost of the bond issuance. Therefore, the \n     FHLBank's issuance of a confirming SLOC assists the member in \n     facilitating the financing purpose for which the bond or note \n     was issued. Moreover, the Preamble to the SLOC Regulation \n     states that ``a [FHLBank] LOC may be issued to support the \n     issuance of bonds.'' See id. at 65696. Accordingly, under \n     section 938.2(a)(1) and (2), a FHLBank may issue a confirming \n     SLOC on behalf of members in conjunction with tax-exempt \n     bonds or notes, provided the bonds or notes are issued for \n     the purpose of ``residential housing finance'' or ``community \n     lending.''\n       The Community Investment Cash Advance Programs Regulation \n     (CICA Regulation) provides the FHLBanks with an array of \n     specific standards for projects, targeted beneficiaries, and \n     targeted income levels that the Finance Board has determined \n     support ``community lending'' under all CICA programs, \n     including the CIP. See 63 Fed. Reg. 65536 (Nov. 27, 1998). \n     Specifically, section 970.3 of the CICA Regulation defines \n     ``community lending'' to mean ``providing financing for \n     economic development projects for targeted beneficiaries.'' \n     See id. at 65546. ``Economic development projects'' are \n     defined in section 970.3 as:\n       (1) Commercial, industrial, manufacturing, social service, \n     and public facility projects and activities; and\n       (2) Public or private infrastructure projects, such as \n     roads, utilities, and sewers.\n     See id. ``Targeted beneficiaries'' are defined in section \n     970.3 as beneficiaries determined by the geographical area in \n     which a project is located, by the individuals who benefit \n     from a project as employees or service recipients, or by the \n     nature of the project itself, as further set forth in the \n     CICA Regulations, See id. at 65547.\n       Thus, economic development activities that are financed by \n     tax-exempt bonds or notes and that benefit low- or moderate-\n     income families would have to be one of the types of eligible \n     ``targeted beneficiaries'' set forth in section 970.3 of the \n     CICA Regulation in order to qualify as ``community lending'' \n     for the purposes of the SLOC Regulation.\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\n     Economic development activities located in low- and moderate-\n     income neighborhoods (i.e., neighborhoods with an area median \n     income of 80 percent or less) would be targeted beneficiaries \n     for purposes of the CICA Regulation.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Under section 970.3 of the CICA Regulation, a ``targeted \n     beneficiary'' includes projects ``located in a neighborhood \n     with a median income at or below the targeted income level,'' \n     and ``targeted income level'' is defined to include \n     neighborhoods with an area median income of 80 percent or \n     less. See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       School construction would qualify as an ``economic \n     development project'' under section 970.3 of the CICA \n     Regulations since it is a public facility project. Therefore, \n     if the school construction project being financed by the tax-\n     exempt bond qualifies as a ``targeted beneficiary'' for \n     purposes of the CICA Regulation as discussed above, it would \n     qualify as ``community lending'' for purpose of the SLOC \n     Regulation. Accordingly, the FHLBank would have the \n     authority, under the Finance Board's regulations, to issue, \n     on behalf of a member, a confirming SLOC in conjunction with \n     a tax-exempt bond financing such school construction.\n       Finally, please be advised that the Finance Board recently \n     has adopted Procedures governing requests by the FHLBanks for \n     regulatory interpretations. See Porcedures for Requests and \n     Applications, Resolution No. 98-51 (October 28, 1998). All \n     future requests from the FHLBank for regulatory \n     interpretations shall be required to conform to the \n     requirements set forth in the Procedures.\n       If you have any further questions, please call the \n     undersigned at (202) 408-2570.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Deborah F. Silberman,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n       This is a Finance Board regulatory interpretation within \n     the meaning of the Procedures for Requests and Applications \n     adopted by the Board of Directors of the Finance Board \n     pursuant to Resolution No. 98-51 (October 28, 1998). The \n     regulatory guidance set forth herein may be relied upon by \n     the recipient subject to modification or rescission by action \n     of the Board of Directors of the Finance Board.\n                                    I concur: William W. Ginsberg,\n                                                 Managing Director\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in supporting this amendment, Senators do \nnot necessarily agree or disagree with this legal opinion. What the \nSenate is stating is that if a bond issuer is to receive both the \nbenefit of tax-exempt interest and a Federal Home Loan Bank guarantee, \nit can happen only if there is an express subsequent authorization \nenacted.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2874, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis the Coverdell amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, earlier in the day, the Senator from \nCalifornia sent an amendment to the desk dealing with, I will say in \nshorthand, guns, but more particularly the shooting that occurred \nearlier this week in Michigan for which we are all deeply grievous.\n  I have offered a substitute that I think embraces the spirit of the \namendment of the Senator from California. Earlier in the day she \nindicated she might vote for this one as well. I guess we will see.\n  The main differences are three. It is a little broader in scope. It \nacknowledges the problem of weapons in schools. It deals with drugs and \nculture, as well. It does not point the finger at the Congress or \nimpugn in any way what the motives are of various people who have \nstrong beliefs with regard to issues relating to guns.\n  It does not set an artificial deadline which is in the amendment that \nwas offered by the Senator from California. The spirit of the amendment \nis very similar. I think it will receive very broad support. As I said, \nthe amendment does not set an arbitrary date. It does not point the \nfinger at anybody's motives. Also, it is broader.\n  It is an amendment that appreciates what is happening here. It \ninvolves many aspects of our lives. Witness the situation in Michigan, \nwhere we are now reading about the environment in which this child \nlived who is alleged to have perpetrated the crime that occurred. As \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts said a little earlier, it is kind of \nhard to believe how that child was living.\n  That is the scope of the Coverdell amendment.\n  Mr. President, if there is any time remaining of my 5 minutes, I \nyield it back.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder, since the Senator yielded back his time, if we \ncan have an extra 2 minutes for Senator Reid on my side?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President--and I do not \nintend to object--I just want to determine how much time is left on \nthis amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Five minutes for me.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Plus the 2 minutes I gave to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under my reservation, let me emphasize this, if I could. I \nbelieve after that we will be prepared to start voting. I know Senator \nReid has been working aggressively to try to reduce the number of \namendments. I know the same is true with Senator Coverdell. But as I \nnow understand it, we still have eight amendments that could require \nvotes. Hopefully, that can be reduced with some voice votes. Then there \nis final passage. So we could have as many as nine votes.\n  I emphasize to Senators, and to their staffs who are here or who are \nlistening, we have already gotten an agreement that the first vote will \nbe 15 minutes, and then there will be 2 minutes, a minute on each side, \nbefore each vote after that so people will have time to know what is in \nthe amendments, and those will each be 10-minute votes. I am going to \nstay on the floor to enforce the time. We will end the first vote after \n15 minutes, and we will end each vote after that after 10 minutes.\n  So staffs should notify Members to start coming to the floor and to \nbe prepared to stay on the floor; don't go get something to eat. We can \nsave as much as an hour of time if Members will cooperate. So I am \ngoing to enforce the voting time. I think Senator Daschle will support \nthat and the sponsors, too.\n\n  With that, I do not object.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2874, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Coverdell has offered an amendment \nthat expresses the sense of the Senate that the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools Program should target the elimination of illegal drugs and \nviolence in our schools.\n  Those on this side of the aisle agree with his sentiment and, \naccordingly, I expect this amendment will receive nearly unanimous \nsupport.\n  What we want to make clear, however, is that we do not agree with his \none-sided attack in this resolution about the administration's gun \nprosecutions record.\n  What this amendment fails to recognize is that, in fact, firearms \nconvictions are up dramatically. In 1996, 22 percent more criminals \nwere incarcerated for either State or Federal weapons offenses than in \n1992. I am sure we could go forward with the statistics--that we do not \nhave--for 1997, 1998, and 1999 that would show it would be up even \nmore.\n  The proof is in the pudding. The Nation's rate of violent crimes \ncommitted with guns has dropped by 35 percent since 1993. Something \nthis administration is doing must be working. For instance, it could be \nthe passage of the Brady bill, which has stopped more than 400,000 \nfelons and fugitives from receiving firearms, preventing untold crimes \nand violence.\n  Finally, let's be serious. It will be a lot easier to prosecute gun \ncrimes once we close the loopholes that riddle our code. So while \nDemocrats support Senator Coverdell's conclusion, we cannot and do not \nsupport these one-sided findings in the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  I tell the Senator from Georgia, I have no problem voting on his \namendment that deals with getting drugs out of the schools. But let's \nbe clear, friends; this Coverdell amendment has nothing to do with the \nBoxer amendment. So don't think, if you vote for\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\nCoverdell, it somehow is a version of the Boxer amendment. They are two \ndifferent things. The Boxer amendment calls on the Senate to act \nresponsibly to pass reasonable, sensible gun laws.\n  We call on the Congress to do so not on an arbitrary date but on the \nanniversary of the Columbine tragedy. The Boxer amendment is not about \nthe incident in Michigan. It references it in a string of incidents of \nschool violence.\n  This Senate should be commended for acting 8 months ago to pass five \nvery reasonable, very responsible gun control amendments. But this \nSenate should be chastised for not doing anything about it at all since \nthat time. What we do in this very simple sense of the Senate is call \non the Congress to bring those amendments back here so we can send a \nbill to the President for his signature.\n  I want to tell you we are dealing with a harsh reality in America.\n  I am going to show you just two charts. The first one shows you how \nmany of our men and women tragically perished in 11 years of the \nVietnam war: 58,168 tragic losses for our Nation, and those families \nhave been hurting and suffering ever since. No matter on what side of \nthis conflict you find yourselves this is the tragic reality of \nVietnam.\n  In the last 11 years, the same amount of time as the Vietnam war, we \nhave seen over 396,000 deaths on our streets, in our schools. This is \njust handgun violence.\n  That is the tragic reality we are talking about in the Boxer \namendment.\n  Here is another tragic reality: How about this for an ad in a gun \nmagazine. It says: ``Start 'Em Young! There's no time like the \npresent.'' Here is a young teenager with a handgun in his hand: ``Start \n`Em Young!'' We know about starting them young. All you have to do is \nlook at what happened in Michigan. How young do they want them to \nstart?\n  I could not understand why we could not walk, hand in hand, down the \nSenate aisle and vote for the Boxer amendment.\n  But when I got back to my office, I found out why because there \nwaiting for me was a letter from the Gun Owners of America attacking my \namendment, saying, essentially, that I was taking political advantage \nof a horrible tragedy in Michigan, when, in fact, my resolution isn't \nabout that. It is about the tragic realities we face in this Nation and \ncalling on the Congress to act.\n  The Gun Owners of America has every right to take this position. They \nhave every right to do it. We should look at what their logo says: \n``Gun Owners of America, 25 Years of No Compromise.'' That is their \nslogan. That is their logo: ``25 Years of No Compromise.''\n  My friends, when we voted out those sensible gun control amendments 8 \nmonths ago, we did compromise. We compromised between the right of law-\nabiding citizens to have guns versus the right of children to have \nguns, mentally disturbed people, people with criminal records; and we \nfound a balance there. We did it in a bipartisan way.\n  All this Boxer amendment is saying is it is time to bring those \nsensible gun control measures--those compromises that withstood the \ndivision in this body and passed this body--back for a vote.\n  We have a very harsh reality in this Nation. Fifty percent of \nchildren ages 9 through 17 are worried about dying young; 31 percent of \nchildren ages 12 through 17 know someone their age who carries a gun. I \ndo not understand why on earth there would be opposition to simply \nsaying, we are proud of what we did 8 months ago. Let's bring those \nsensible gun laws back here. Let's act before the Columbine tragedy \nanniversary is upon us. Let's do the right thing.\n  I support this amendment. I hope my colleagues will as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2875\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate on the Bingaman \namendment, equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I desire to speak for 1 minute on the \nBingaman-Kennedy amendment.\n  This amendment Senator Bingaman and I offer is a very simple \namendment. It basically takes the amount that is being appropriated, \nidentified here under the Coverdell amendment, and rather than using it \nin creating the Coverdell approach on the education, it uses it to help \nand assist the Pell grants. It effectively increases the Pell grant by \nsome $250. The Pell grants, then, would be available to those who are \neligible under the Pell Grant Program.\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\n  It seems to me that program is targeted toward well-qualified, needy \nstudents attempting to continue their education. I think that is a \npreferable way of allocating the resources that are included in the \nCoverdell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the results of the \nlast vote so there will be no misunderstanding. I have the impression \nthat the vote was defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair announced that the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe that announcement may have been \nincorrect.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We already voted to reconsider and to lay it on the \ntable.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what would be the rule when an incorrect \ncount was announced by the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I say to the distinguished majority leader, we \nwill consult with the Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I didn't get a clarification on the rule. I believe a \nsimple clerical error--perhaps there is no precedent for that. If that \nis the case, then I think it would be appropriate to correct that or \nreconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This appears to be an understandable clerical error, and \nI don't think we ought to challenge the calculation or the ultimate \noutcome of that particular vote, but under the rules, I think the \nauthor of the amendment might have been entitled to another vote under \nconsideration, and I suggest that as a way to resolve the matter.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been pushing to try to get the votes \ncompleted in 10 minutes, and it does put additional pressure on the \nstaff to tabulate the results. I think that contributed to the clerical \nerror. I, therefore, move that the previous vote be reconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to make things more orderly, will Senators \nsit in their seats. We have a series of votes. It is impossible for the \nstaff to do its job. People are up there talking to them, asking them \nto repeat votes. Could we ask that everyone sit in their seats as they \nare supposed to do and vote from their seats.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is an important point, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer is advised by the \nParliamentarian that under the precedent of the Senate, when a clerical \nerror has occurred, it is the duty of the Chair to announce the correct \nvote.\n  The correct vote having been presented to the Chair, it is now \nannounced there are 49 yeas, 49 nays, and the amendment is not agreed \nto.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask consent the motion to reconsider be \ndeemed to have been tabled and the vote now occur on the Boxer \namendment, which would be the same vote that occurred earlier. That \nway, we will have a definite clarification of what the vote was and is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 2873\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2873. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. Nickles. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. Reid. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2875\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe we are on Bingaman amendment \nNo. 2875. He has already used his minute. Senator Kennedy did.\n  I reiterate that earlier today, I had a chart showing what the \nRepublican majority has done for Pell grants, and it is straight up.\n  The second thing I want to point out is this is the fifth time the \nother side of the aisle has tried to make moot the underlying premise \nof this bill we have been debating now for 2 weeks, the education \nsavings account. It blows away 14 million families, it blows away 20 \nmillion children, and it blows away $12 billion that would be \nvolunteered to help education in every quadrant, from kindergarten to \ncollege. As with all these other amendments, its objective is to \ndestroy the education savings account for millions of American \nfamilies. I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2875 offered \nby the Senator from New Mexico and, I believe, the Senator from \nMassachusetts increases mandatory spending by $1.2 billion. If adopted, \nit will cause the underlying bill to exceed the committee's section \n302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the \namendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant section of \nthe Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Sessions-Feinstein amendment says \neven if States decide, given the evidence, that retention and holding \nkids back does not work, States would have to do that. The Federal \nGovernment tells the States what to do and will cut off funds if they \ndon't do it.\n  My amendment makes a difference. It says at least let's make sure \nevery child has an opportunity to do well and to achieve on these \ntests, that there are certified teachers, that there is English as a \nsecond language, that there is high-quality educational materials, and \nthat we provide support for kids.\n  If we do not do this, in the name of being tough, the only thing we \nare doing is punishing kids. Let's at least make the commitment that \nevery child has the same opportunity to do well.\n  I am going to send to each colleague an NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund letter which brings together all the evidence and \nmakes this compelling argument.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this equal opportunity to learn \namendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the time has come to end social \npromotion. The Feinstein-Sessions amendment does that. It does it in a \nway that allows the States to set the standards they believe are \nappropriate for each level of achievement.\n  We are pouring more and more money every year into education. If we \ncare about those children, if we really are concerned about children, \nwe will find out if they are meeting at least minimum academic \nstandards. If they are not, we will be intervening, in a failing \nsystem, and will force the system to deal with them and help them \nthrough the process. It gives the States complete freedom to set these \nstandards.\n  President Clinton supported this in the State of the Union message. \nThe people of this country overwhelmingly support it. Over 10 States \nhave already gone to it. My State of Alabama is in the process of going \nto it. The Republican Party has favored it. Senators Feinstein, \nLieberman and Byrd are cosponsors of this amendment. It is time for us \nto pass it.\n  But we must not pass the Wellstone amendment. It will eliminate the \nability to make this system work effectively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2878. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, are we ready for debate time on the next \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe we are. There is now 1 minute to a \nside on Senator Feinstein's amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think it has been pretty clear, at \nleast to me and certainly to the State of California, the city of \nChicago, the city of Los Angeles, the city of San Diego, and other \ncities around this country, that either an implicit or explicit policy \nor practice of promoting children when they are failing or when they \ndon't even show up in school is probably the leading cause for many of \nus for the decline of quality public education across this great \ncountry.\n  It isn't politically correct to say we will no longer permit social \npromotion, but it can make a huge difference in where this Nation goes. \nThis amendment is very carefully crafted to say that Federal education \ndollars will not be available to a jurisdiction if the State does not \nhave a policy to prohibit the practice of social promotion. If we leave \nthe details to the State and local communities, it does not tell them \nhow, when, or where to do it. It simply says that Federal moneys are \ncontingent upon the abolition of that practice. The fact is that the \nStates are moving in this direction. The fact is that there is still no \naccountable standards.\n  I wish to stress that it does allow for remedial education; it does \nallow for Federal dollars to be used for remedial education.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if colleagues will listen for a second, \nI have two points. First of all, the evidence is overwhelming. I went \nover evidence this afternoon. There was no rebuttal. Holding kids back \ndoesn't work. That is not the real point. If your State decides that it \ndoesn't want to hold kids back, this amendment says it doesn't make any \ndifference; the Federal Government is going to cut off Federal funding. \nWe are telling States what to do, to hold kids back no matter what you \ndecide or we will cut Federal funding.\n  That is wrong. I hope there will be an overwhelming vote against this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have remaining four votes counting final \npassage. Senator Kerry and Senator Schumer have requested, through me, \nto ask unanimous consent they be allowed to speak for their amendments \nfor up to 1 minute at the present time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2866 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is a serious \neffort to try to attract qualified teachers in an era when the private \nsector is making it nearly impossible to draw people out of college and \nteaching because of the salaries. We really need a special incentive.\n  We have already created an incentive. We have a $5,000 paydown on \nloans. It is not enough to attract people.\n  I have offered an amendment that would raise the incentive and \nprovide, in essence, a GI bill for teachers. I think it is worthwhile. \nI will not ask my colleagues to vote on it tonight because we are on \nautomatic pilot. I think it is an idea that deserves better \nconsideration than it will receive under that kind of approach. I don't \nwant it prejudiced in the future by a vote that is on automatic pilot.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment with hopes we get \nthe ESEA on the floor and we will have an opportunity to consider this \nin a better, bipartisan, and perhaps more thoughtful mode.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2866) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2868 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw this amendment in \nthe interest of time. It is a very simple amendment. We have a real \nshortage in America of certified teachers. I was visiting with the \nCommunity Bankers of North Carolina looking for a few crabcakes. One of \nthe fellows came over and asked why we would have a teacher who was not \ncertified. The answer is very simple. Because many school districts--\nparticularly poor, inner-city districts and rural districts--have a \nchoice: Uncertified teacher or no teacher, because there are not enough \nqualified teachers, given salary levels, working conditions, et cetera, \nwho will go into the classroom.\n  This amendment helps certify teachers. We would pay 75 percent of the \ncost of training them. It is $50 million a year. It is a very good \namendment to help raise the quality of teachers. I have always believed \nwe should not lower the bar but help people get over it. That is what \nthis amendment does. I hope my colleagues will support it at some \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2868) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2879\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes to be equally divided \non the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the headlines in the morning paper tell \nthe story: America is facing a national gun crisis. Firearms are easy \nto come by for 6-year-olds and psychotics.\n  The violence is not confined to just the main streets. It is in our \nhomes, our fast-food restaurants, and in our schools.\n  This amendment gives to school districts across America an \nopportunity to apply for help from the Department of Education for \ngrants so they can educate the children in the school, and their \nparents, about how dangerous guns can be and how they should be stored \nsafely.\n  It provides money for public service announcements so we can try to \nreduce the gun violence we read about, sadly, every single day. We \nknow, as sure as we are here this evening, there will be another story \nin the newspaper in the not-too-distant future of more gun violence in \nschools. With the Durbin amendment, we at least start to move forward \ntoward reducing that violence by helping schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois and I have \nbeen discussing this amendment during the course of the day. We would \nhave voiced it, but the Senator from Illinois, as is his right, asked \nfor a rollcall.\n  My intention is to support the amendment.

Has the motion to reconsider been tabled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I strongly support and urge Congress to \npass and President Clinton to sign the Affordable Education Act now \npending before the Senate. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Children presently are 25 percent of our population and 100 percent \nof the future. It is my fundamental belief that Congress should invest \nin the future by improving educational opportunities for students. This \nbill is part of a comprehensive strategy to give parents and local \nschools the resources needed to make the 21st century, the era in which \neducational excellence for all students is achieved.\n  For the past three years, Congress has passed legislation that \nprovides tax incentives to help parents pay for the education of their \nchildren. But President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation that \nprovided these incentives. Parents across America hope and trust that \nthis time these tax incentives will be enacted into law.\n  A major feature of this bill is that it creates Educational Savings \nAccounts for K through 12 expenses. These ESAs allow parents to \ncontribute up to $2,000 annually to an Educational Savings Account. The \nbuild-up of earnings within the account is tax-free if used for \neducational expenses, such as tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs \nservices, books, computers, etc. The premise behind ESAs is that \nparents should have greater control over the education of their \nchildren. After all, who is in a better position to know what each \nchild needs--a bureaucratic Washington government or the parents and \nteachers who see that child every day?\n  This bill does more than just create Educational Savings Accounts. \nIncluded in this bill are other provisions that I have either supported \nor co-sponsored that:\n  Provide tax incentives to help pay for college tuition;\n  Provide tax exclusions for education assistance programs provided by \nemployers;\n  Revise the tax treatment of qualified state tuition programs to \nexclude from gross income any distributions used for higher education \nexpenses;\n  Allow a tax deduction of up to $2,500 per year of interest on \neducation loans;\n  Allow a limited tax credit for the donation of computers to schools, \nand extends from two to three years the age of computers that may be \ndonated to schools; and\n  Reduce the complexity of the arbitrage rules that currently govern \nthe issuance of school bonds.\n  This bill provides more than $4.3 billion of education tax incentives \nfor the next five years, and it gives more educational control to \nparents. Parents will be able to save more for the future education of \ntheir children.\n  This bill is just one part of an overall strategy to increase \neducational resources. Over the past five years Congress has increased \noverall educational spending by 40 percent, and Congress last year \napproved a budget that projects yet another 36 percent increase over \nthe next four years. In the next few weeks Congress will take up \nlegislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nI will be offering amendments to that bill that will:\n  Channel federal aid in failing school districts to teaching the \nacademic basics in order to raise student achievement levels;\n  Provide funds for failing school districts to use in attracting and \nretaining highly qualified teachers; and\n  Double the amount of federal aid for college costs for high achieving \nstudents in failing school districts.\n  For now, however, Congress should take the first step in expressing \nits commitment to improving education by passing the pending Affordable \nEducation Act. I urge Senators to support this legislation.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this week the Senate has debated \nlegislation which is designed, in part, to encourage families to invest \nin tax exempt savings accounts. Funds from these ``education savings \naccounts'' could be used for a variety of activities related to the \neducation of children, including for tuition and fees at private and \nreligious schools. I opposed this bill because I do not believe that \nthe federal government should divert funds, in this case more than 2 \nbillion dollars, to private and parochial education.\n  Such a move would be a fundamental change in the federal role in \neducation, a change I believe is misguided. Ninety percent of American \nchildren attend public schools. Rather than divert federal dollars to \nprivate and parochial schools, I believe the federal government has a \nresponsibility to assist states and local school districts work to \nimprove education for all children, especially children in poverty and \nchildren with disabilities.\n  During this debate, a variety of amendments were offered. Senator \nDodd proposed an amendment that would eliminate the proposed \n``education saving accounts'' and target its funds to increasing \nfederal funding for special education. I commend my Republican \ncolleagues for increasing IDEA--Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct--funding in fiscal year 2000 by 25 percent over fiscal year 1998 \nand 13 percent over fiscal year 1999. Nevertheless, the federal \ncommitment to special education falls far short of what local districts \nneed.\n  Senator Robb offered an amendment that would have made the funds \navailable for school construction bonds. I agree wholeheartedly with \nSenator Robb about the need to assist states and local school districts \nas they attempt to repair, modernize, and construct school facilities. \nHowever, I believe that there is a far better way to accomplish this \ngoal. At the end of the last session, Senator Snowe introduced S.1992, \nthe Building, Renovating, and Constructing Kids' Schools, BRICKS, Act. \nBRICKS would provide states with low interest loans to help defray the \nenormous costs associated with modernizing school facilities. I urge my \ncolleagues to look closely at Senator Snowe's excellent proposal.\n  Finally, there have been a number of worthwhile amendments designed \nto improve public education. Ironically, as the Senate has been \ndebating the Affordable Education Act, the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee has been attempting to mark-up legislation to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I voted against many of these amendments simply because I believe \nthey should be considered in the context of the ESEA rather than in a \npiecemeal fashion on a bill the President is certain to veto.\n  Improving and supporting education is the issue of greatest interest \nto most Americans. I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords on \na strong ESEA reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against the so-called \nAffordable Education Act, S. 1134, because it is not a wise use of \nFederal dollars. It does not address our national education priorities. \nAnd, it will not help those who are most in need.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about exactly who will benefit \nfrom this IRA expansion for elementary and secondary education \nexpenses. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 70 percent \nof the proposed IRA tax benefit would go to the top 20 percent of all \ntaxpayers. These higher income families, many of whom already send \ntheir children to private schools, would gain most of the benefits. \nFamilies unable to save, including most families earning less than \n$55,000 a year, would receive very little, if any benefit at all.\n  Additionally, this IRA tax benefit would be minimal. According to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, the average annual benefit for families \nwith children attending private schools would be limited to \napproximately $37; and for families with children in public schools, \nthe average annual benefit would be $7.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of the children in America attend public \nschools. Instead of investing in proven initiatives to raise academic \nstandards for all children, the bill before the Senate emphasizes the \nwrong priority. It fails to reduce class size, enhance teacher training \nin technology, modernize school buildings, expand after-school programs \nor improve special education.\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\n  According to the National Council on Education Statistics, nearly 53 \nmillion children are currently enrolled in public schools and the \nnumber is expected to increase to 54.3 million by 2008. It is estimated \nthat approximately 2,400 new school facilities will be needed to \naccommodate this increase. As is well documented, the condition of \nschool facilities and the student-teacher ratio are linked to student \nachievement. Therefore, it is clear where our federal education \nresources should be directed.\n  We must not lose sight of the fact that school modernization is a \ncritical component to the success of our school children. It simply \nmust be one of our national educational priorities. Local school \ncommunities cannot shoulder all of the costs associated with school \nbuilding modernization and technology infrastructure improvements.\n  Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that \nhas opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for \nstudents to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st \ncentury, they must learn how to use new technologies. But all too \noften, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their \ninstruction without being given the training to do so.\n  Too often students are left to teach teachers in the rapidly \nexpanding area of technology. It is not enough for a teacher to be able \nto email, they must use this education technology to advance their \ncurriculum and guide their students along the information highway. Just \ntwo years ago, it was reported that a mere 10 percent of new teachers \nreported that they felt prepared to use technology in their classrooms, \nwhile only 13 percent of all public schools reported that technology-\nrelated training for teachers was mandated by the school, district, or \nteacher certification agencies. Currently, only 18 states require pre-\nservice technology training. I am disappointed that the legislation \nbefore us does not adequately address the large-scale needs of our \nteachers in the use of technology in the classroom.\n  In my own state of Michigan I often talk with teachers when I visit \nschools and I find them straight-forward about what they don't know and \neager to develop new technology skills. In fact, the only reason that \nwe are not further behind in this area is that teachers have used their \nown time and often their own money to learn the technology skills to \nbetter teach their courses.\n  Almost 2 years ago, I brought together about 400 leaders in \neducation, business, philanthropy and government for a Michigan summit \nmeeting focusing on the need for a greater commitment to professional \ndevelopment in technology. My message at that gathering and my message \nnow is that we've got to match our teacher's commitment to our children \nwith our own commitment to their professional development in the use of \ntechnology in classroom instruction. I am currently involved with \nseveral initiatives that are an attempt to accomplish this.\n  Mr. President, for all these reasons, I cannot support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I voted for both the Coverdell and \nBoxer sense of the Senate amendments relating to school safety. I voted \nfor both amendments because I believe that Congress can and should \nenact legislation to provide for safer schools and a secure learning \nenvironment. The language of Senator Boxer's Sense of the Senate stated \nthat ``Congress shall make schools safe for learning by implementing \npolicies that will reduce the threat of gun violence in schools''; I \nrise now to briefly explain a few of the wholly-attainable measures \nthat I believe would truly make a difference.\n  During the Juvenile Justice debate I offered a commonsense amendment \nthat would allow local school districts to access existing funds \navailable under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act to conduct locker \nsearches for guns, explosives, other weapons, or drugs. Mr. President, \nno one involved opposes cleansing our schools of these elements, other \nthan those criminals who possess them; and to those few, I have no \nsympathy for any inconvenience these searches may cause. I am pleased \nthat my colleagues supported my amendment, which was accepted by voice \nvote.\n  I also suggest that Congress should build upon a current tax \ndeduction and reward businesses that donate school safety devices to K-\n12 schools. Qualified security equipment and technologies should \ninclude metal detectors, electronic locks and surveillance cameras.\n  Along with these security improvements, I believe it is important to \nprovide training for school personnel and parents on how to recognize a \ntroubled young person before tragedy strikes. And in the event of an \nattack, our school officials, security personnel, parents and \ncommunities must be trained for emergency preparedness and crisis \nresponse.\n  In that vein, I argue to my colleagues that we should allow ESEA \nfunding available under the Safe & Drug Free Schools and Communities \nprogram and the Innovative Education Program to be used for innovative \napproaches to reducing violence in schools and improving the classroom \nenvironment. Among other uses of such funding could be the testing of \nstudents for illegal drug use, at the request or consent of a parent or \nlegal guardian; comprehensive school security assessments; purchase of \nschool security equipment and technologies; implementation of a school \nuniform policy; and collaborative efforts with groups demonstrating \nexpertise in providing research-based violence prevention and \nintervention programs.\n  But the most important quality of these initiatives is that they \nwould be initiated at the local level by those with the most knowledge \nof the community, not by some nameless Washington bureaucrat wielding a \n``one-size-fits-all'' solution.\n  Finally, I was pleased to have the opportunity to vote for Senator \nDurbin's amendment, which harkens back to a day when this country \ndiscussed issues of responsibility and society in a constructive \nmanner, not in one based in fear or fantasy. Without question, we \nshould educate our young people on right and wrong, and we must \nencourage constructive adult involvement in the lives of our young \npeople, not only by parents and teachers, but also by community-based \norganizations, faith-based organizations, and local law enforcement \npersonnel. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Briefly, for the information of all Senators with regard to \nthe schedule for the balance of the week and the first of next week, in \njust a moment we will have the final 2 minutes, equally divided, to \nmake comments before final passage. That will be it for the night and \nfor the week. I commend Senator Reid, Senator Coverdell, and others for \nthe good work they have done in getting us to this point.\n  Because we have been able to finish all the amendments and go to \nfinal passage, we will not be in session tomorrow. We will be in \nsession on Monday and Tuesday, but the next recorded vote will not \noccur until approximately 5 o'clock Tuesday afternoon because of the 13 \nprimaries that are occurring across the country between the two \nparties. We will be in session Tuesday. We will be in session on \nWednesday and Thursday with votes likely into the night, and we may \nhave votes on Friday. So do not be scheduling departure on Thursday \nnight. We have to finish a couple of very important issues next week \nand have some votes on the Executive Calendar.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, everybody has heard just about \neverything they need to on this measure. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir courtesy and comity. It has been somewhat of a long journey, and \nI am glad we have finally arrived at final passage. The legislation \ndoes represent substance in education reform. I thank my comanager, \nSenator Reid of Nevada. I yield back whatever time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend those involved in this bill. Those \nof us who oppose this bill think the first order of business is \neducation, and yet\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nwe have done nothing about the quality of public education with this \nlegislation. Fifty percent of the benefits of this bill go to private \nschools, yet 90 percent of the children in America go to a public \nschool.\n  This bill does nothing about class size, nothing about the quantities \nof teachers in our schools, nothing about trying to improve the safety \nof our schools in this country. We believe we need to do a far better \njob on improving the quality of public education. Unfortunately, this \neducation bill does nothing to address those issues. For those reasons, \nwe will oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from Georgia \nfor the fine job in handling this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n     teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the \n     areas of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special \n     education, and bilingual education, and for those able to \n     teach in high-poverty school districts will be particularly \n     high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages \n     should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n     assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n     schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n       (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n     ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n     also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n     academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on \n     the academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n     science.\n       (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n     area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n     assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training \n     and classroom experience.\n       (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n     in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. 403. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to address the need of high-\n     poverty school districts for highly qualified teachers in \n     particular subject areas, such as mathematics, science, \n     foreign languages, bilingual education, and special \n     education, needed by those school districts, by recruiting, \n     preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing \n     professionals who have knowledge and experience that will \n     help them become such teachers.\n\n     SEC. 404. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The Secretary is authorized to use funds \n     appropriated under subsection (b) for each fiscal year to \n     award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to \n     institutions of higher education and public and private \n     nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out programs \n     authorized by this title.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this title, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2006.\n\n     SEC. 405.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SAFE LEARNING \n                   ENVIRONMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Every school child in America should have a safe \n     learning environment free from violence and illegal drugs.\n       (2) Violence and illegal drugs in the schools undermine a \n     safe and secure learning environment.\n       (3) Any instance of violence or illegal drugs in schools is \n     unacceptable and undermines the efforts of Congress, State \n     and local governments and school boards, and parents to \n     provide American children with the best education possible.\n       (4) In the last 12 months, there have been at least 50 \n     people killed or injured in school shootings in America.\n       (5) From 1992 through 1998, the number of referrals made by \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation for Federal firearms prosecutions \n     fell 44 percent, which resulted in a 40-percent drop in \n     prosecutions and a 31-percent decline in convictions, \n     allowing criminals to remain on the streets preying on our \n     most vulnerable citizens, including our children.\n       (6) From 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department only \n     prosecuted an average of seven persons per year for illegally \n     transferring a handgun to a juvenile.\n       (7) Since 1992, the percentage of 8th grade students using \n     marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the past 30 days has \n     increased 162 percent, 86 percent, and 50 percent, \n     respectively, according to the respected Monitoring the \n     Future survey.\n       (8) The February 29, 2000, shooting at Buell Elementary \n     School in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is evidence that \n     gun violence in American schools continues, that the drug \n     culture contributes to youth violence, and that the breakdown \n     of the American family has contributed to the increase in \n     violence among American children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools \n     program that Congress soon will be considering should target \n     the elimination of illegal drugs and violence in our schools \n     and should encourage local schools to insist on zero-\n     tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use.\n\n     SEC. 507. REDUCTION IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``School \n     Violence Reduction Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Every school child in America has a right to a safe \n     learning environment free from guns and violence.\n       (2) The United States Department of Education report on the \n     Implementation of the Gun-Free Schools Act found that 3,930 \n     children were expelled for bringing guns to school during the \n     1997-98 school year.\n       (3) Nationwide, 57 percent of the expulsions were high \n     school students, 33 percent were in junior high and 10 \n     percent were in elementary school.\n       (c) Grants.--The Secretary of Education shall award grants \n     to elementary and secondary schools (as such terms are \n     defined in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801)) to enable such \n     schools to--\n       (1) develop and disseminate model programs to reduce \n     violence in schools,\n       (2) educate students about the dangers associated with \n     guns, and\n       (3) provide violence prevention information (including \n     information about safe gun storage) to children and their \n     parents.\n       (d) Application.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subsection (b), an elementary or secondary school shall \n     prepare and submit to the Secretary of Education an \n     application at such time, in such manner, and containing such \n     information as the Secretary may require.\n       (e) Public Service Announcements.--The Secretary of \n     Education shall provide for the development and dissemination \n     of public service announcements and other information on ways \n     to reduce violence in our Nation's schools, including safe \n     gun storage and other measures.\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated funds of up to $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 \n     and such sums as may be necessary for each of the four \n     succeeding fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n              Technical Corrections To Amendment No. 2869\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, we are about to begin the heavy lifting on \nthe Patient Bill of Rights Conference Committee, and I wanted to come \nto the Floor of the Senate and lay out some of the key concerns and \nprinciples that should guide us in the coming month.\n  First, I want to take a minute and compliment my colleague, Senator \nNickles, for his fine work over, really, the last 3 years. He has been \na dedicated leader on this issue.\n  I am confident that as chair of the conference, he will conduct a \nfair and orderly process for this conference.\n  We are ready. Many of us have worked on most of these provisions for \nseveral years. I and my Republican Senate conferees, for one, have \nworked over the last several months to educate ourselves on the House \nbill.\n  Let me be clear. We want a substantive conference. As I have said, we \nhave already rolled up our sleeves, and I think we can work through \nthis complex bill and meet the deadline of completing this bill by the \nend of March. That is our goal and with the cooperation of every \nSenator and House Member on this committee, I believe we can meet this \ngoal.\n  The stakes are high. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that \nthe very future of medical care in this country hinges on what we do in \nthis next month.\n  From the very basic and practical question of who a patient calls for \nhelp when there is a concern about coverage or some aspect of their \nhealth plan--to the delivery of that care by doctors or other health \nprofessionals--to who regulates these fundamental health insurance \nissues--all of these issues will be greatly affected by this bill.\n  First, do no harm. This is the doctor's oath. I believe we serve \nAmericans badly if at the end of the day we do not adhere to that same \nrule.\n  That is why we cannot enact a bill that unreasonably increase the \ncost of insurance. We cannot leave American families with no choice but \nto drop their insurance altogether.\n  Even in our strong economy--the strongest economy that this country \nhas seen since WWII--the number of uninsured Americans has increased by \nabout another 1 million. The latest census numbers available show that \n44.3 million Americans were without coverage in 1998. That is one \nAmerican in six.\n  And employers are facing increases in health care costs this year of \nas much as 7.3 percent. Small businesses are struggling with even much \nhigher cost increases. Costs are rising for American employers who want \nto continue providing coverage to their employees.\n  For better or worse, managed care has been the main instrument in \nthis country for making health care more affordable for a vast number \nof Americans. If we price these products out of the market, with \nregulations, mandates and lawsuits, the effect will be crippling.\n  We recently heard from some fairly large employers who said that if \nthe House-passed bill were enacted, they would stop offering employees \nhealth insurance altogether--resulting in more uninsured.\n  These aren't just some unrecognizable companies with a few employees. \nCompanies like Wal Mart, which employs 800,000 employees, have \nindicated they would drop health coverage.\n  The Chamber of Commerce announced they would have no choice but to \nrecommend to their member companies to drop health insurance if the \nHouse-passed bill were enacted into law in its current form.\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\n  Overall, I believe about 36 percent of the employers in this country \nhave said they'd stop offering coverage. This Congress must not allow \nthat to happen.\n  Will these bills hike the costs for families and their employers? \nBoth bills will, even though Senate Republicans believe we have come up \nwith a better bill that addresses the complexities of the health care \nsystem and gives patients the care they need without unreasonably \nraising their costs.\n  The CBO has said, in February, that the House-passed bill would \ncancel coverage for over a million Americans, increasing costs of \nprivate health insurance premiums by an average of 4.1 percent above \ninflation. This driving up of the costs of medicine does little to \nimprove the quality of care.\n  Equally important as costs, is the issue of expanding lawsuits, or \nthe liability debate. I fought to prevent the Senate bill from \nincluding an expanded right to sue last summer, and 52 of my colleague \nagreed with me.\n  They recognized that consumers don't get much from these lawsuits. \nThey don't get greater care. They don't get much money for their \ntroubles either, because the lawyers take most of any settlement or \naward.\n  If the truth be known, lawsuits have never been a friend of the \npatient.\n  Nothing confirms this fact better than a recent IOM report, To Err is \nHuman: Building a Safer Health System, that finds unreported medical \nreports are killing alarming numbers of patients every year.\n  This report, based on the hard work of experts at the National \nInstitute of Medicine, concluded that the threat of lawsuits actually \nprevents hospitals, doctors, and other health care professional from \nreporting mistakes and errors that they have made.\n  We are not just talking about a few cases, but the report concluded \nthat as many as 98,000 people are killed each year because of such \nthings as:\n  Poor handwriting by doctors, which often causes pharmacists to \nmisread drug prescriptions and issue the wrong drug and/or dosage.\n  Unfamiliarity of doctors, and health professionals with the rapidly \nchanging and emerging technologies that are being introduced in health \ncare today. These technologies pose new hazards for patients, and \nprofessionals simply do not have competency and are not continually \nretrained.\n  The recommendations suggest that these errors are hidden for fear of \nmalpractice lawsuits.\n  More importantly, the report suggests that doctors, hospitals and \nother health care providers will never report errors without protection \nfrom the threat of litigation.\n  So what is the answer to the horrible fact that thousands of \nAmericans are dying each year because of unreported medical mistakes?\n  The IOM report calls for a national effort, and I agree that we have \nto work with every aspect of health care in this country to turn those \nnumbers of deaths around. We need our public agencies responsible for \nthe public health, like HHS, HRSA and the Agency for Health Care Policy \nResearch and Quality involved. We need state agencies and public health \ninstitutions involved.\n  All of these folks need to engage the entire health care industry in \na broad range of quality and safety issues. This is absolutely the \ndirection we must go to prevent medical mistakes.\n  The report suggests that all these folks should work together to \ndevelop standards for safety and define minimum levels of performance \nfor every health care organizations. All these efforts should focus \npublic attention on patient safety. We know how to prevent many of \nthese medical mistakes, and real reductions in errors are achievable if \nwe focus on patient safety.\n  President Clinton also wants to require every state to create \nmandatory reporting systems to collect information on medical errors. \nHowever, I haven't really heard very many folks say they support a \nmandatory system; most don't believe it will solve the problem.\n  Even the Administration official who presented the plan to the Health \nand Education Committee several weeks ago, acknowledged that a \nmandatory system of reporting may not be the best approach. Dr. John \nEisenburg, director of the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, \nadmitted that some of the criticism of the proposal was ``on target.''\n  He said, ``Do we know if these programs [mandatory reporting \nprograms] work? No, we don't. We don't know how well they work, and \nwhen they work best.''\n  The Health and Education Committee has had four hearing on this \nissue, and we have heard one thing time and time again: as long as \nthere is the fear that reported data--whether it is supposed to be \nconfidential or not--will be ferreted out and used by an aggressive \ntrial bar, we will never be able to reduce medical error rates. Unless \nwe do something about liability, there will never be a real and \nsubstantial effort made to report medical mistakes.\n  The American Hospital Association had this to day, ``Our concern is \naround the protection of the information that's contained in those \nreports. Any enterprising malpractice attorney is going to be able to \ntrack back to the caregivers.'' So, the fear of blame and lawsuits is \ntoo great.\n  When the American Medical Association testified at this hearing, they \nopposed mandatory reporting, saying that, ``The president has the cart \nbefore the horse. He'd put in place mandatory reporting, then study it \nand do something different if it doesn't improve patient safety''\n  My colleague, Senator Hagel, also specifically asked Dr. Dickey what \nshe thought of the IMM's conclusion that there be some liability \nprotections vis-a-vis this important issue--patient bill of rights.\n  You know what she said? She basically said that they wanted the \nflawed liability legal remedies and failed legal system that has harmed \nthe doctor's practice of medicine for so many years applied to HMOs, \nand then and only then should we fix the mess for everyone.\n  Where is the logic in that? That does not sound like the answer to \nme. Shouldn't we acknowledge that, yes, this system that has caused \ndefensive medicine and cost society in terms of quality health care for \ndecades, and killed people according to the IOM, should be fixed before \nwe expand its breadth to anyone else?\n  So, Mr. President, I say that liability has never been a friend to \npatients and the unfortunate findings about annual deaths in the IOM \nreport are the best evidence of that fact. This IOM report is very \nimportant in our deliberations, and none of us should lose sight of \nthis fact.\n  I also believe that my constituents back in New Hampshire should not \nhave to deal with a greatly complicated regulatory bureaucracy. You \nknow, a patient that has a question about his coverage or some other \naspect of his health plan wants a straight answer to a question.\n  I want to highlight this fact: The consumer wants a straight answer. \nUltimately, he should be able to call his health plan and receive \nreliable information.\n  If the answer he gets is not the answer he wants, the patient should \nhave a means of redress. Under the Senate passed bill, we have set a \nsystem that lets doctors take a look at what doctors are deciding for \npatients.\n  Under the Senate passed bill, concerns are addressed by a doctor \nspecializing in the patient's type of problem. The doctor is \nindependent, and makes that decision.\n  There are several levels of independent medical review where a \npatient can go outside the insurance plan and have another doctor who \nspecializes in the same type of problem look again at the patient's \nneeds and decide if the patient should or should not have the requested \nservice or treatment.\n  This is an approach designed to get the patient care, and get the \npatient good care.\n  The House-passed bill also has an appeals process, but I am very \nconcerned its design is more about creating more lawsuits, and putting \nmore money in attorneys' pockets.\n  What will patient's get out of this? They won't get the care they \nneed. So we think we have come up with a better idea.\n  In conclusion, let me say that patients really want and need to be \nput back into the health care equation, and I think that has been \nacknowledged on both sides.\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\n  That is why many of the provisions in both bills are very similar. I \nthink the provisions on plan information in both bills are similar and \nthere is common ground from which we can work.\n  We both give Americans expanded new rights to go to an emergency room \nand get the care they need without worrying about having to fight with \ntheir insurer over who will pay for this care.\n  We both greatly expand access to specialists. Both bills allow direct \naccess to a pediatrician for children, and for women seeking primary \nand preventative ob/gyn care.\n  So, we are close on very many of the issues that are important to \nmost Americans. These are major issues that I believe we can come to an \nagreement on.\n  Other issues will be difficult to resolve, but I am committed to \nsitting down with colleagues on the other side of the aisle to discuss \nthese issues, and will promise to negotiate in good faith.\n  We may not agree yet, but I am hopeful. I think Democrats and \nRepublicans share a goal of wanting to ensure individuals have access \nto safe and appropriate health coverage. So I am positive about this \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1113-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEATH OF KAYLA ROLLAND\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise, with sadness and a heavy heart \ntoday. On Tuesday, Kayla Rolland, a 6-year-old first grader was shot \nand killed by a classmate at Theo J.

But for someone so young, to \nhave her hopes and dreams cut short by gunfire--stretches the limits of \nour power to understand and to accept.\n  As the father of two daughters, also in the first grade, I can't get \nout of my mind the pictures of Buell Elementary School, as so many \nfrightened young children facing a terror few of us would want to know \nfirsthand, rushed into the arms of their parents.\n  I thank God each day that my kids return home safe, away from the \ndangers of this world and from the senseless violence that haunts our \ncommunities.\n  But, as our Nation tries to address the questions and issues that \nsurrounded this tragic event, I hope that, for the next few days, we \nfocus on Kayla's family.\n  A family lost a child this week, and that we must not forget.\n  There is a time and a place to address the circumstances surrounding \nKayla's death and the public policy issues involved, and I look forward \nto those discussions.\n  But, I hope that we will not allow the policy debates and the media \nrush to examine this tragic event cause us to forget the immediate \nneeds of a family in mourning.\n  Above all, I hope that we will keep the Rolland family and Kayla in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n  In closing, Mr. President, on behalf of my wife Jane and myself, I \nwould like to express our family's deepest sympathies to the Rolland \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1113-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1113-S1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SAVE OUR SURPLUS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important bill \nI introduced yesterday. My Save Our Surplus, or S.O.S. legislation \nwould lock in every penny of the $23 billion non-Social Security \nsurplus which materialized in FY 2000 and return it to working \nAmericans in the form of debt reduction, tax relief and structural \nSocial Security and Medicare reform.\n  The reason for this legislation is simple: Last year the Congress \nadopted my amendment in the budget resolution to set up a reserve fund \nfor any non-Social Security surplus for tax relief.\n  Unfortunately, this provision in the budget resolution was completely \nignored in the appropriation process. As a result, we ended up spending \nevery penny of the project $14 billion on-budget surplus.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated early this year that, \nThanks to our strong economy, we would have an even higher $23 billion \non-budget surplus in the current fiscal year despite that spending \nspree.\n  Mr. President, this $23 billion non-Social Security surplus does not \nfall from the sky. It is working Americans who generated the surplus--\nnot Congress, not the President, but Americans' hard work.\n  In fact, hard working Americans have created a strong economy that \nhas turned the ink in Washington's accounting book black for the first \ntime in 40 years. The budget surplus above and beyond Social Security \nwill top $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Clearly, the reason we have a surplus is the result of the hard work \nof working men and women of this country. Washington should not be the \nfirst in the line to spend this surplus.\n  Mr. President, the budget surplus above and beyond the Social \nSecurity surplus is tax overpayments and should be returned to \ntaxpayers in the form of tax relief, debt reduction and Social Security \nreform.\n  If we don't return the tax overcharges to the taxpayers in these \nways, Washington will spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief, \ndebt reduction or the vitally important task of preserving Social \nSecurity. Last year's appropriations spending has proven my fears are \nwell founded.\n  President Clinton has already proposed spending nearly all of this \nsurplus, and both Chambers of the Congress are preparing to add even \nmore to the President's request in this year's supplemental spending \nbill.\n  This is not right. Last year's discretionary spending was already \nincreased by over 5 percent, twice the rate of inflation. If Congress \nspends this additional $23 billion surplus, discretionary spending will \nincrease by over 9 percent. If there is a Supplemental, it should be \nfully offset by spending reduction.\n  President Clinton also proposes to ``correct the gimmicks'' in the FY \n2000 Appropriations bills by shifting payment dates from FY 2001 back \nto FY 2000, lifting restrictions on obligations, and reversing advance \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, I was the one that spoke repeatedly on the Senate \nfloor last year in strong opposition to budget gimmickry. However, \nchanging the gimmicks now would have the effect of increasing \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending in FY 2000 by $10 billion while \nalso allowing for spending to increase in FY 2001 by a corresponding \namount.\n  Mr. President, two wrongs don't make a right. Let's leave FY 2000 \nspending the way it is and pledge to stop the gimmicks this year.\n  The last thing we should do is to spend tax overpayments to enlarge \nthe government. If we cannot give working Americans a tax refund this \nyear due to President Clinton's veto of our tax relief bill, we at \nleast should dedicate this on-budget surplus to reduction of the \nnational debt.\n  It is true that our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly \ndue to the continued growth of our economy. However, our long-term \nfinancial imbalance still poses a major threat to the health of our \nfuture economic security.\n  We must also recall that Americans have long been overtaxed, and \nmillions of middle-class families cannot even make ends meet due to the \ngrowing tax burden. They still call for major relief. That's why we \npassed nearly $800 billion in tax relief for them. But President \nClinton denied them the tax refund they deserve.\n  FY 2000's spending is the worst example of fiscal irresponsibility. \nWashington spent far more than it should have. But what concerns me is \nthat if we continue this dangerous trend by spending this $23 billion \nadditional surplus for FY 2000, we will push the spending baseline even \nhigher, leaving an even smaller on-budget surplus for our 5-year or 10-\nyears tax relief or for debt reduction.\n  I understand that we do have emergency spending needs each year. I \nsupport true emergency spending, such as disaster relief or \nagricultural crisis relief. But I believe we should, and can, meet \nthese challenges by prioritizing and streamlining government programs \nto offset this new spending while maintaining fiscal discipline.\n  Again, my point is, Mr. President, that this non-Social Security \nsurplus is\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nnothing but tax over-payments. It is the American taxpayers' money and \nit should be returned in the form of debt reduction, tax relief or \nSocial Security reform.\n  If we don't give the non-Social Security surplus back to the \ntaxpayers in these ways, Washington will soon spend it all. Such \nspending will only expand the government, making it even more expensive \nto support in the future, creating an even higher tax burden than \nworking Americans bear today and a higher federal budget.\n  I join Chairman Alan Greenspan who has been advocating using surplus \nfor debt reduction and tax relief rather than increasing government \nspending.\n  My S.O.S. legislation would achieve this goal by creating a new point \nof order against any legislation reducing the FY 2000 non-Social \nSecurity surplus if it is not used for debt reduction, tax relief or \nstructural Social Security and Medicare reform.\n  The S.O.S. legislation is a fiscally responsible bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1114-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an \nimportant point in our history and that is to commemorate this day 164 \nyears ago, Texas Independence Day.\n  Each year, I look forward to March 2d. This is a special day for \nTexans, a day that fills our hearts with pride. On this day 164 years \nago, a solemn convention of 54 men, including my great, great \ngrandfather Charles S. Taylor, met in the small settlement of \nWashington-on-the-Brazos. There they signed the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence. The declaration stated:\n\n       We, therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare . . . \n     that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign \n     and independent republic.\n\n  At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was \nhospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After \ndeclaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a \nconstitution and organized an interim government for the newborn \nrepublic.\n  As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was \nsigned in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It \nwould exact a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice. My great, \ngreat grandfather was there, signing the declaration of independence. \nAs most of the delegates did, he went on eventually to fight the Battle \nof San Jacinto. He didn't know it at the time, but all four of his \nchildren who had been left back at home in Nacogdoches died trying to \nescape from the Indians and the Mexicans who they feared were coming \nafter them.\n  Fortunately, he and his wife, my great, great grandmother, had nine \nmore children. But it is just an example of the sacrifices that were \nmade by people who were willing to fight for something they believed \nin. That, of course, was freedom.\n  While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican \ntroops held the Alamo under siege, challenging this newly created \nrepublic.\n  Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis \nsent his immortal letter to the people of Texas and to all Americans. \nHe knew the Mexican Army was approaching and he knew that he had only a \nvery few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. Colonel Travis \nwrote:\n\n       Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at \n     discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly over the \n     wall. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then I call on you \n     in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, of everything dear to \n     the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. \n     The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt \n     increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If \n     this call is neglected I am determined to sustain myself as \n     long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets \n     what is due his honor and that of his country--Victory or \n     Death.--William Barrett Travis, Lt. Col. Commander.\n\n  What American, Texan or otherwise, can fail to be stirred by Col. \nTravis' resolve? In fact, Colonel Travis' dire prediction came true--\n4,000 to 5,000 Mexican troops laid siege to the Alamo. In the battle \nthat followed, 184 brave men died in a heroic but vain attempt to fend \noff Santa Anna's overwhelming army. But the Alamo, as we all in Texas \nknow, was crucial to Texas' independence. Because those heroes at the \nAlamo held out for so long, Santa Anna's forces were battered and \ndiminished.\n  Gen. Sam Houston gained the time he needed to devise a strategy to \ndefeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, just a month or so \nlater, on April 21, 1836. The Lone Star was visible on the horizon at \nlast.\n  Each year, on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-\nBrazos State Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where \nthe 54 patriots pledged their lives, honor, and treasure for freedom.\n  On this day, I read Colonel Travis' letter to my colleagues in the \nSenate, a tradition started by my friend, the late Senator John Tower. \nThis is a reminder to them and to all of us of the pride Texans share \nin our history and in being the only State that came into the Union as \na republic.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to continue the tradition that was \nstarted by Senator Tower, because we do have a unique heritage in Texas \nwhere we fought for our freedom. Having grown up in the family and \nhearing the stories of my great great grandfather, it was something \nthat was ingrained in us--fighting for your freedom was something you \ndid.\n  I think it is very important that we remember the people who \nsacrificed, the 184 men who died at the Alamo, the men who died at \nGoliad later that same month. Their deaths gave birth to Texas \nIndependence and we became a nation, a status we enjoyed for 10 years \nbefore we entered the Union as a State.\n  I might add, we entered the Union by a margin of one vote, both in \nthe House and in the Senate. In fact, we originally were going to come \ninto the Union through a treaty, but the two-thirds vote could not be \nreceived and, therefore, President Tyler said, ``No, then we will pass \na law to invite Texas to become a part of our Union,'' and the law \npassed by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate.\n  I am very pleased to, once again, commemorate our great heritage and \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1114-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1114-S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     U.S. ASSISTANCE TO MOZAMBIQUE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nAdministration's decision to send urgently needed assistance to \nsouthern Africa, where heavy rains have caused devastating floods, \nparticularly in the Republic of Mozambique.\n  Last night President Clinton approved the deployment of a Joint Task \nForce to the region, including C-130 aircraft to deliver desperately \nneeded supplies, and six heavy lift helicopters\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\nto pluck survivors from the trees and rooftops where they cling to \nlife. This assistance will supplement the efforts already underway, \nunder the auspices of the U.S. Agency for International Development and \nthe U.S. Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, this assistance comes not a moment too soon. \nMeteorologists believe that even more rain is likely to fall on the \nregion in the very near future. The resources the world has already \nprovided are stretched nearly to the breaking point, as the need to \ndeliver food and other supplies to survivors competes with the need to \nrescue those precariously hanging on above the floodwaters, waiting to \nbe evacuated to dry land. The Mozambican families who survived the \nthreat of rising waters are now at risk again, as water-born diseases \nlike cholera, malaria, and meningitis surge in the flood's aftermath.\n  These floods are particularly tragic because the country most \nseriously affected by them, Mozambique, has made significant strides \ntoward recovery from its long and brutal civil war. Though the country \nis still affected by extreme poverty, in recent years Mozambique has \nenjoyed exceptional rates of economic growth, and while more needs to \nbe done, the country has improved its record with regard to basic human \nrights. Mr. President, the people of Mozambique have been fighting for \na better future. This kind of disaster comes at a terrible time, but \nour intercession may help the people of Mozambique to hold to the \nopportunities that lay before them before the waters rose.\n  The American government and the American people have reached out \nbeyond our borders time and again to aid communities in crisis--from \nthe earthquake victims in Turkey and Taiwan to the mudslide survivors \nin Venezuela. We stand united in a basic expression of human compassion \nagain today. I applaud the Administration's action; I believe it is an \nentirely appropriate use of our country's resources, and I wish the \npeople of southern Africa the very best as they work to recover from \nthese devastating floods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1115-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRICE-ANDERSON AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the \nPrice-Anderson Amendments Act of 2000 with my colleague and the ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nSenator Bingaman.\n  For over 40 years the Price-Anderson Act has provided a comprehensive \nsystem of liability coverage for nuclear incidents and has been \nextended three times since 1957, most recently in 1988. The act's \nauthority to extend new coverage will expire on August 1, 2002, and I \nbelieve that it is important that we extend the authorities well in \nadvance of that date.\n  When we reauthorized the law in 1988, we asked both the Department of \nEnergy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review the Act and \nsubmit reports assessing its value and the need for further extension \nas well as making recommendations for any necessary changes. Both \nagencies recommended that the Act be extended with only minor changes. \nThis legislation makes those relatively minor modifications and extends \nthe authorization for an additional ten years.\n  Mr. President, the Price-Anderson Act is an important aspect of the \ndevelopment of nuclear energy in the United States. If we are going to \nmeet any of the emission goals set forth for our domestic electricity \nproduction, then nuclear power necessarily must remain a vital \ncomponent of any energy policy. The Price-Anderson Act is essential to \nallow contractors and suppliers to prudently take the financial risks \nassociated with nuclear activities for the Department of Energy as well \nas those undertaken by commercial nuclear facilities licensed by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission. The Price-Anderson Act provides \nimportant protections to the public in the unlikely case of a nuclear \nincident. This legislation will extend those protections as well as \nmaking other necessary amendments to the Act.\n  I fully support this legislation and I hope that we can have it \nenacted expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1115-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is especially appropriate that \nthe Senate is debating education reform today, because today is Read \nAcross America Day. The National Education Association deserves great \ncredit for bringing together the nation's leading education, literacy, \nand community organizations to help children in communities across the \nNation experience the joy of reading.\n  Reading is the foundation of learning and the golden door to \nopportunity. But too many children fail to read at an acceptable level. \nFor students who don't learn to read well in the early years of \nelementary school, it is virtually impossible to keep up in the later \nyears. That's why literacy programs are so important. They give young \nchildren practical opportunities to learn to read and practice reading. \nWe also need to do all we can to encourage children and parents to read \ntogether. That's why Read Across America Day is so important.\n  I am also proud of other programs that take place throughout the year \nto encourage reading. In October 1998, Congress passed the Reading \nExcellence Act to provide competitive reading and literacy grants to \nstates. The purpose of the program is to help high-need schools teach \nchildren to read in their early childhood years. In addition to \nclassroom instruction, the program helps teachers to improve their \nteaching. It also expands the number of high-quality family literacy \nprograms, works with local and national organizations to ensure that \nchildren have access to books, and provides early literacy assistance \nfor children with reading difficulties.\n  Last August, Massachusetts was one of only 17 states to receive funds \nunder this competitive grant. The Massachusetts Department of Education \ndistributed these funds to local school districts throughout the State. \nThe program builds on the America Reads initiative. In 1996, President \nClinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton designed a new effort to \ncall national attention to child literacy by proposing the ``America \nReads Challenge,'' which encourages colleges and universities to \nearmark a portion of their Work-Study funds for college students \nwilling to serve as literacy tutors. Institutions of higher education \nacross Massachusetts are already creating strong ties with surrounding \ncommunities, and participation in the initiative enhances those \nrelationships. Today, over 1,000 colleges and universities across the \ncountry are committed to the President's ``America Reads Work Study \nProgram,'' and 73 of these institutions are in Massachusetts. I'm proud \nof the strong national commitment that we are making to help every \nchild read well. By working together, we can make a significant \ndifference for children across the country.\n  Last year I celebrated ``Read Across America Day'' with students from \nSquantum Elementary School in Massachusetts. The students and teachers \nhave an excellent slogan--``Drop Everything and Read.'' For at least 15 \nminutes a day, the school does just that. But if we truly want to help \nall children learn to read early and well, every day should be Read \nAcross America Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1115-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1115-S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LARRY AHRENS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Larry \nAhrens, a man who has become an institution in Albuquerque. This week \nhe celebrates his 20th anniversary as morning host on 770 KOB, one of \nthe best-known radio stations in New Mexico. Larry's radio career has \nspanned much of my own Senate career, and we have developed a wonderful \nfriendship and working relationship over the past two decades.\n  There is something comforting about turning on the radio and hearing \nthe same recognizable voice welcoming the day. For thousands of New \nMexicans, Larry has become that reassuring deliverer of news, \ncommentary and other interesting and entertaining information. It \nhardly seems like 20 years have lapsed since Larry first addressed KOB \nlisteners and endeared himself to us with his level-headed take on life \nin Albuquerque and the Land of Enchantment.\n  Larry Ahrens took over New Mexico's most high-profile radio job as\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\nmorning host on 770 KOB on March 3, 1980. But he began his career in \nhis native southern California.\n  A job offer in Roswell brought Larry to the New Mexico airwaves in \nlate 1972. Apparently his talent was clear even then, as an El Paso \nstation owner traveling through Roswell heard Larry on the air and \nended up offering him a job. Ahrens spent two and a half years in El \nPaso before coming back to New Mexico to begin his long run as host of \nKOB's morning show.\n  Over the years, I've observed that a lot of radio personalities come \nand go. Larry has been a steady and reliable fixture on KOB, which I \nattribute to the fact that his show mirrors the community. He has \nserved New Mexico with integrity, opening his mike to air the views of \nthe day--whether they come from young mothers on Albuquerque's West \nSide, retirees in the Heights, or even the occasional politician.\n  Part of Larry's appeal is linked to the fact that his job is more \nthan sharing with New Mexicans between 5:30 and 10:00 a.m. Like so many \nothers, I appreciate Larry as an active member of the community and a \nkey supporter of important civic causes. One example is Larry's annual \ngolf tournament for the University of New Mexico's academic scholarship \nprogram, now in its 18th year. He has raised more than $600,000 to give \nscores of New Mexico students an opportunity to continue their \neducation.\n  Larry and the morning show he hosts play a welcome role in the day-\nto-day lives of many New Mexicans. Where once I could only enjoy \nLarry's broadcasts when in New Mexico, I am pleased that technology is \nnow so advanced that I can listen to his show live on the Internet. \nIt's almost like being home.\n  Times may have changed since Larry first took to the airwaves, but \nhis presence has remained constant for 20 years. Today, I think it \nwould be fair to say Larry reigns as the premiere morning show host in \nAlbuquerque.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Larry Ahrens on this career milestone, \nand salute his contributions to New Mexico throughout his impressive \ncareer. Finally, I add my voice to those thousands and thousands of New \nMexicans who look forward to tuning into the radio to hear Larry's show \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1116-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   6-MONTH PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n                IRAQ--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 88\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c) and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to Iraq \nthat was declared in Executive Order 12722 of August 2, 1990.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill help our domestic semiconductor industry continue to thrive. The \nproposal that I am introducing today, along with my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Larry Craig, merely extends an existing temporary duty \nsuspension for certain semi-manufactured forms of gold. Specifically, \nthe bill amends the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule to extend, until \nDecember 31, 2005, the duty-free treatment of gold bonding wire. This \nproduct is critical to the manufacture of semiconductors and integrated \ncircuits.\n  The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 \nsuspended the 4.9 percent duty given to gold bond wiring classified \nunder Harmonized Tariff Number 7108.13.7000. This temporary duty \nsuspension expires on December 31, 2000 and should be renewed. This is \nparticularly true given that the duty on most other products used in \nthe manufacture of semiconductors were removed during the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade \nnegotiations which concluded in 1994. Members of the U.S. semiconductor \nindustry believe the failure to include gold bonding wire in the list \nof duty eliminations was more of an oversight than anything else. This \nlegislation helps rectify this situation.\n  The gold bonding wire essential to the manufacture of semiconductors \nand integrated circuits is unique in its fineness, purity and \napplication. The nearly 100 percent pure gold wire whose diameter \nmeasures 0.05 millimeters or less has no other known purposes or uses \nother than those associated with the assembly of semiconductors.\n  U.S. semiconductor manufacturers that assemble their products \ndomestically rather than abroad will be adversely impacted if this duty \nsuspension lapses. A duty of almost five percent on gold bond wiring \nwould increase the cost of doing business for American companies that \nchoose to assemble their goods in this country. We should support, not \nhinder, efforts like this one that are a win-win for the American labor \nforce and our nation's economy. More hardworking Americans are employed \nwhen the assembly process occurs domestically. Furthermore, lower costs \nencourage more U.S. companies to conduct these activities at home. In \nthe end, this provides a boost to the overall economic well-being of \nthe United States.\n  This duty suspension proposal lacks domestic opposition and its \npassage has only a de minimis revenue impact. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this measure. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Thurmond, \nintroduce a series of duty suspensions designed to permit the import of \nraw materials into the United States duty free. The materials are not \nindigenous to or made in the United States. Therefore, their \nimportation will not displace domestic sourcing. Moreover, because of \nthe nature of the products at issue, they will assist in the creation \nof additional jobs in the United States.\n  I believe this is the most appropriate use of such legislation. The \nimported product will not displace any that is manufactured in the \nUnited States. Moreover, the imported product will assist in enhancing \nAmerican productive capacity. I am, therefore, hopeful that this new \ncapacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will \nincrease employment in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2159. A bill to provide flexibility when merited and \naccountability when warranted in the Nation's elementary schools and \nsecondary schools, to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nachievement-based college scholarships to students in failing schools \nor failing school districts, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               EXCELLENT SCHOOLS FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN ACT\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to address a serious and specific crisis that has occurred \nin my home state of Missouri.\n  In October of 1999, the Missouri State Board of Education canceled \naccreditation for Kansas City's schools, effective May 1, 2000, and \ngave St. Louis a court-required probationary period in lieu of \naccreditation withdrawal. Today, 80,000 young people are trapped in \nthese failing urban school districts. It is hard for students to be \nsuccessful in these types of settings. Both of these school districts \nreceive substantial financial resources from the federal government, \nyet we are not seeing positive results on our investment. It is time \nfor taxpayers to have accountability so that they know their tax \ndollars are spent in classrooms to boost academic achievement.\n  This is especially true since Congress is continuing to increase its \nfinancial commitment to education. Federal education funding has \nincreased by 40% since 1994. And most recently, last year Congress \napproved a budget that proposes to increase federal resources for \neducation by an additional 40% over the next five years. The final \nbudget bill passed by Congress for FY2000--and that I supported--pays \nthe first installment by increasing these resources by 6%, or $2 \nbillion, $35 billion for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  In light of this increase in federal education resources, I want to \nencourage better, smarter use of federal funds where the need is \ngreatest--in failing schools--so that the children languishing in these \nschools will have a real opportunity to achieve academic excellence and \ncreate a brighter future for themselves.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the Excellent Schools for All Our \nChildren Act, a three-part program to help students trapped in failing \nurban schools in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other U.S. cities. This \nbill was developed in response to my state's challenge to the \naccreditation of Missouri's two largest school districts.\n  This new legislation would channel federal aid in failing schools to \nteaching the academic basics, in order to raise student achievement \nlevels; would provide funds for failing schools to use in recruiting, \nretaining, and rewarding highly qualified teachers; and would double \nthe amount of federal aid for college costs for high-achieving students \nin failing schools.\n  While focusing on an overall plan to streamline and simplify federal \neducation programs for all schools, my plan incorporates a two-tiered \n``flexibility when merited and accountability when warranted'' approach \nto the use of federal education resources.\n  First, this legislation proposes a major reduction in paperwork and \n``red tape'' for all schools, by consolidating a number of federal \neducation programs so that funds may be sent directly to local schools. \nSchools will be free to use the funds in ways they believe will be most \neffective in elevating student achievement. The programs included in \nthis consolidation are: Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Class Size \nReduction (the ``100,000 Teachers'' funding); Title III, Technology for \nEducation; Comprehensive School Reform under Title I; Title VI block \ngrant; Immigrant Education under Title VII C; the Fund for Improvement \nof Education under Title X, Part A; and the McKinney Homeless \nAssistance Act. This provision is modeled after the Bond-Ashcroft \n``Direct Check for Education'' legislation introduced in 1999.\n  For school districts that fail to meet their state's performance-\nbased accreditation standards and, are thus failing their students, \nthese ``direct check'' funds may be spent only for purposes relating \ndirectly to improving academic performance. This will include focusing \non ``the basics;'' funding mentoring programs to help students who \ncan't read, write or do arithmetic; and using proven methods of \ninstruction, such as phonics. These federal funds can also be used to \nrecruit, retain, and reward high quality teachers. Districts in trouble \nneed help in finding and keeping the very best teachers, and my \nlegislation provides resources for this purpose.\n  These school districts will be asked to report on how they have spent \ntheir federal resources and on their students' academic performance \nusing state and local measurements. Parents and others in the community \nneed to see how their federal tax dollars have been spent on educating \ntheir children.\n  When these school districts attain state accreditation for two \nconsecutive years, they will gain the authority to use federal \nresources under new standards for expanded local control created by \nthis legislation for non-failing schools. These school districts \nregaining accreditation will also have access to $10 million annually \nin new federal funding to reward teachers and principals for improved \nstudent performance, and for professional development opportunities.\n  Finally, the Excellent Schools for All Our Children Act encourages \nstudents in failing school districts to be high achievers. As an \nincentive to their studies, I am proposing special college aid awards \nthat would at a minimum\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\ndouble the amount of federal aid now available for students' college \ncosts. Students who rank in the top ten percent of their high school \nclass and have an ACT or SAT score that is at or above the national \naverage would be eligible for these ``Good Student Scholarships,'' \nwhich would be equal to the maximum appropriated Pell Grant award, \npresently $3,300 per year. Thus, a high-achieving student eligible for \na Pell Grant of $1,500 would also receive a Good Student Scholarship of \n$3,300, for a total federal aid package of $4,800.\n  Mr. President, as a parent and public servant, I want to help \nthousands of young Missourians who are trapped in failing urban \nschools. It is clear to me that federal resources should be doing more \nto benefit these children. My plan to target resources to fund programs \nthat will encourage and elevate student achievement will provide our \nstudents in failing school districts with the opportunity to succeed. \nWe cannot risk losing an entire generation to the snares of education \nmediocrity. The federal government can--and should--be a critical \npartner in providing education funding in a manner that will help all \nour school children attain academic excellence.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed in its entirety \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2159\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require health plans to include infertility \nbenefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\n     the fair access to infertility treatment and hope (faith) act\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would greatly improve the lives of millions of \nAmericans, thousands of whom live in my State of New Jersey, who are \ninfertile.\n  For many American families, the blessing of raising a family is one \nof the most basic human desires. Unfortunately almost fifteen percent \nof all married couples, over six million American families, are unable \nto have children due to infertility.\n  The physical and emotional toll that infertility has on families is \nimpossible to ignore. I have heard from a number of men and women from \nNew Jersey who have experienced the pain and trauma of discovering that \ntheir bodies, which appear normal and function perfectly, are somehow \ndeficient in the one area that matters most to them. This is only \ncompounded when patients discover that their insurer, which they rely \non for all of their critical health needs, refuse to cover treatment \nfor this disease. The deep sense of loss expressed by those who desire \na family as a result of this gap in coverage is real and significant. \nTheir pain should no longer be ignored.\n  Infertility is a treatable disease. New technologies and procedures \nthat have been developed in the past two decades make starting a family \na real possibility for many couples previously unable to conceive. In \nfact, up to two thirds of all married couples who seek infertility \ntreatment are subsequently able to have children.\n  Unfortunately, due to the high cost of treating this illness, only 20 \npercent of infertile couples seek medical treatment each year. Even \nworse, only four out of every ten couples that seek infertility \ntreatment receive coverage from health insurers, and only one quarter \nof all health plans provide coverage for infertility services.\n  My bill, the Fair Access to Infertility Treatment and Hope (FAITH) \nAct, will end this inequity by requiring all health insurance plans to \nensure testing and coverage of infertility treatment. Specifically, \nFAITH requires health plans to cover all infertility procedures \nconsidered non-experimental that are deemed appropriate by patient and \nphysician, up to four attempts (with two additional attempts provided \nfor those successful couples that desire a second child).\n  One reason often cited by health insurers for their continued refusal \nto provide infertility treatment is the negative impact that this \ncoverage would have on monthly premiums. However, recent studies \ndemonstrate that FAITH would raise the costs of health coverage by as \nlittle as $.21 cents per month per person, an insignificant amount \ncompared to the enormous premium increases we have recently seen from \nHMOs.\n  Similar legislation that recognizes the vital right of families to \ninfertility treatments has already been passed in thirteen states, \nincluding Texas, California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, \nMaryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Arkansas, Hawaii, Montana, and \nWest Virginia. In my home state, both branches of the New Jersey \nLegislature recently passed legislation that mandates this coverage.\n  Reproduction is one of the most important values for both men and \nwomen, and those individuals who desire the gift of family should have \naccess to the necessary treatments that make life possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time that the text of the bill, in its \nentirety, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access to Infertility \n     Treatment and Hope Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) infertility affects 6,100,000 men and women;\n       (2) infertility is a disease which affects men and women \n     with equal frequency;\n       (3) approximately 1 in 10 couples cannot conceive without \n     medical assistance;\n       (4) recent medical breakthroughs make infertility a \n     treatable disease; and\n       (5) only 25 percent of all health plan sponsors provide \n     coverage for infertility services.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY \n                   ACT OF 1974.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart B of part 7 of subtitle B of title \n     I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1185 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 714.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na 1 year moratorium on certain diesel fuel excise taxes and to require \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to transfer amounts to the Highway Trust \nFund to cover any shortfall; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\namerican transportation recovery and highway trust fund protection act \n                                of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``American \nTransportation Recovery and Highway Trust Fund Protection Act of \n2000.'' This is a new revised version of S. 2090 which I introduced on \nFebruary 24, 2000, to address the escalating prices of fuel which \nsupports our nation's truckers, farmers, public transportation, and \nother users.\n  Based on discussions with my colleagues and testimony presented at \nthis morning's Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, I \nhave drafted a new bill which would replace the lost revenues from the \ntemporary suspension of the excise tax with monies from the budget \nsurplus in the general fund to fully protect the Highway Trust Fund. \nSimilar to the original bill, S. 2090, my new bill still would \ntemporarily suspend the federal excise tax on diesel fuel for one year \nor until the price of crude oil is reduced to the December 31, 1999 \nlevel.\n  Americans fought their war in the Persian Gulf, lives were lost out \nin the sand, some came home with undiagnosed illnesses, defended them \nfrom their cousins while the Kuwaiti ruling family relaxed, and this is \nhow we get repaid, with soaring fuel costs, jeopardizing America's \nlivelihood.\n  While OPEC grows fat, Americans are growing thin, not because they \nwant to, but because they have to choose between food or heating oil. \nNice choice for some Americans, freeze or starve? The American people \ndeserve better.\n  This problem will continually revisit us as long as we are dependent \non foreign oil. I have seen news reports that OPEC will not boost \nproduction at least until July, and that quote came from Iran's oil \nminister. Norway, who is not a member of OPEC and is the world's second \nlargest oil exporter, made no promise to increase oil production \neither. It is unfortunate that we, a global super power, are reduced to \nbegging.\n  One of the things I have learned in my time in Congress is that too \noften we get bogged down in the details. The\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\ncurrent fuel crisis an example where the discussion tends toward \ninternational price fixing and our foreign dependence, rather than \nfocusing on the daily effect on American people.\n  If we do not recognize the economic devastation the skyrocketing cost \nof fuel is already taking, wait until shipping by truck, rail, and ship \nstarts to collapse. The total value of freight carried by truckers in \n1996 was approximately $368 billion. This number would be higher today, \nbut these were the most recent numbers that CRS could provide. If these \ncurrent increases in oil prices do not stop, some trucks can not afford \nto run. If just 10 percent of the trucks on the road stop running, if \nyou do the general math, it could amount to a $36.8 billion value \ndecrease in freight. This is a hit to the economy I do not want to see. \nIf the rigs stop rolling, this nation stops rolling.\n  Also, if we do not recognize the national security component of being \ndependent on OPEC oil, I want to know how many more American lives we \nhave to risk to recognize it? We should have to grovel in front of the \naltars of the almighty oil ministries.\n  I urge my colleagues to support prompt passage of this bill to \nprovide immediate relief for America's truckers, farmers, and other \ndiesel fuel users. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a study of the engineering feasibility \nof a water exchange in lieu of electrification of the chandler Pumping \nPlant at Prosser Diversion Dam, Washington; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n              yakima river basin water enhancement program\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat will amend the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Program \n(YRBWEP), first approved by Congress in 1994 (PL 103-434). That \nlegislation established a comprehensive framework for increasing \ncritical flows in the Yakima River in order to reverse a longstanding \ntrend of declining salmon and steelhead runs.\n  One portion of that legislation, Section 1208, authorized a specific \nproject to electrify hydraulic turbines at the Chandler Pumping Plant \nnear Prosser, Washington. By converting these pumps from hydraulic to \nelectrical power, an additional 400 second feet of water would be added \nto a 12-mile stretch of the Yakima River below Prosser Dam called \nChandler Reach. This project would increase survival rates and provide \nimportant new habitat for both the anadramous and resident fisheries in \nthis critical section of the Yakima River. This electrification project \nis still a good approach to augmenting Yakima River flows, but early in \nits implementation an even better idea was developed that can nearly \ndouble the benefits projected from electrification.\n  This new approach could result in completely eliminating the need to \ndivert water at Prosser Dam and Wanawish Dam for use by the Kennewick \nIrrigation District (K.I.D.) and the Columbia River Irrigation District \n(C.I.D.). This plan will require building a new pumping plant on the \nColumbia River and a pipeline to connect this new facility to K.I.D. \nThis approach could add back to the Yakima River during critical flow \nperiods the entire 759 second feet of water now diverted at Prosser \nDam. This project might well be the key to the success of the rest of \nthe YRBWEP program. For the extensive efforts being made farther \nupstream to be entirely successful, the lower sections of the Yakima \nRiver must provide the conditions necessary for salmon and steelhead to \nsurvive their journey to and from the upper river and its tributaries. \nThe Chandler Reach and the lower Yakima must have sufficient water at \nthe right time for anadromous fish to be able to transit this area. \nWithout it, the programs upstream will be less effective.\n  The legislation I will introduce today authorizes the Bureau of \nReclamation to spend some of the funds previously authorized for the \nelectrification project to develop this new approach. There are several \nstudies and undertakings necessary to determine with certainty the \nefficacy and cost of this pump exchange project. These include carrying \nout a feasibility study, including an estimate of project benefits, an \nenvironmental impact analysis, and preparing a feasibility level design \nand cost estimate as well as securing critical right-of-way areas and \nsuch other studies as may be required.\n  This change in approach to enhancing flows in the lower Yakima is \nenthusiastically supported by the resource agencies of the State of \nWashington, including the Washington State Department of Ecology, as \nwell as by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States \nFish and Wildlife Service, and many other primary stakeholders on the \nYakima River, such as the Yakama Indian Nation. To date all \norganizations and agencies contacted want to see the necessary work \ndone to develop this project further, and this legislation will provide \nthe crucial resources to complete the feasibility and engineering \nstudies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY.\n  S. 2166.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require \ncolleges anduniversities to disclose to students and their parents the \nincidents of fires in dormitories, and their plans to reduce fire \nsafety hazards in dormitories, to require the United States Fire \nAdministration to establish fire safety standards for dormitories, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                       fire safe dorm act of 2000\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fire \nSafe Dorm Act of 2000. I am pleased that my colleagues in the House, \nRepresentatives Carolyn Maloney and Rush Holt, will join me in offering \nthis important legislation.\n  On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire in a Seton Hall University \ndormitory claimed the lives of three students and injured 58 others, \nincluding at least 54 students, two police officers and two \nfirefighters. The dormitory, Boland hall, was built in 1952, and \nalthough it was equipped with smoke detectors, it was not required to \nbe equipped with a fire sprinkler system.\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\n  Nothing is as painful as a senseless accident that takes the lives of \nyoung people. And unfortunately, the Seton Hall community is not alone \nin its grief. In fact, in the last decade, at least 18 young people \nlost their lives in dormitory fires. We must do all we can to prevent \nfuture tragedies. Students have a fundamental right to pursue an \neducation in a safe, secure environment. Parents have a right to know \nthat their children are protected from harm while on school property.\n  That is why I am pleased to offer the Fire Safe Dorm Act of 2000. \nThis legislation is straightforward. It takes two important steps to \nensure the safety of student housing.\n  First, the bill requires nationwide standards. Under the Fire Safe \nDorm Act, the U.S. Fire Administration would develop comprehensive \nstandards for dormitory fire safety. These standards would include such \nsafety devices as fire sprinklers, smoke detectors, and flame resistant \nfurniture and mattresses. Colleges and universities would be required \nto develop plans to adopt these new standards within 10 years of the \nbill's enactment.\n  Second, the Fire Safe Dorm Act requires disclosure. It requires \ncolleges and universities to tell students, prospective students, and \ntheir parents, about the safety of campus housing. Specifically, are \ndormitories equipped with sprinklers? Are the furniture and mattresses \nfire resistant? Learning institutions are already required to disclose \nstatistics about crime on campus. They should also have to tell the \npublic about the steps they've taken to protect students from fire.\n  Mr. President, the Fire Safe Dorm Act takes important steps to \nsafeguard against another tragedy like the fire at Seton Hall. I urge \nall my colleagues to support this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Fire Safe Dorm Act of \n2000 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the increase in the tax on social security \nbenefits, to eliminate the earnings test for individuals who have \nattained retirement age, and to gradually raise the age for required \nminimum distributions from pension plans, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the senior citizens' financial freedom act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior \nCitizens' Financial Freedom Act, a bill which would accomplish three \nobjectives. First, it rolls back the Clinton Administration's 1993 tax \nincrease on Social Security benefits. Second, it repeals the Social \nSecurity Earnings Test working penalty on Seniors. Finally, it returns \nto our Seniors the ability to control their own savings, by increasing \nthe age when minimum IRA distributions must begin, from 70\\1/2\\ to 85.\n  Mr. President, our tax code mercilessly penalizes Seniors. In fact, \nSeniors are double taxed. First the government takes money from their \npaycheck to pay for the Social Security system. Then, when the senior \nreceives their benefits, they are taxed again. The Government also \npenalizes Seniors for working by placing an ``Earnings Test'' just to \nreceive Social Security benefits. Finally, the Government forces \nSeniors to withdraw benefits from their IRAs, whether they want to or \nnot, and penalizes them with a 50% tax if they do not.\n  This is immoral, illogical and simply wrong.\n  Mr. President, I applaud our colleagues in the House for passing a \nbill to eliminate the Social Security Earnings Test, which takes away \nSocial Security benefits simply because a 60 year old works. We should \nbe celebrating those between 60 and 70 years old who can work, but \ninstead, we punish them. For a Senior between 60 and 65, if they earn \nover $9,600 in income beyond Social Security benefits (which is just \nabove the poverty level), they lose 50% of their benefits. For those \nbetween 65 and 70 years old, they lose 33% of their benefits for \nearning over $15,500. It's not until they turn 70 can they both work \nand keep their benefits. This represents a marginal tax rate for \nsomeone under 65 of almost 60%. While I agree that the Earnings Test \nmust be eliminated, Congress should go beyond this.\n  In 1993, President Clinton proposed, and the Democratic-controlled \nCongress passed by one vote, a 70% increase on Social Security \nbenefits. These benefits should not be taxed at all, but the fact that \nthey were raised so much gives us the opportunity, during these large \nsurpluses, to provide immediate relief for our Seniors. When coupled \nwith the Earnings Test, these two taxes can result in some couples \nsuffering under a 103% marginal tax rate. Seniors could lose more than \na dollar for making another dollar.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must amend the IRA distribution \nrequirements. When a person reaches 70\\1/2\\ years old, the Government \nforces them to begin taking out money from their IRA, which they \npersonally have saved up for it's their money. They have to\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\ntake all of it out of their account within their life expectancy at the \ntime they start making withdrawals, which for someone 70\\1/2\\, is \ncurrently about 15 years. They must make these withdrawals whether they \nneed to do so or not. And if they do not take out the money, or cannot \nbecause they're invested in long-term projects, they lose 50% of the \nmoney to punitive taxes. Essentially, they are penalized for their \nforesight in saving for retirement, and their industry for finding \nother sources of income than these retirement assets. Mr. President, \nthis is a policy that only the federal government could think up, and \nit comes from the bureaucratic mentality that says the people's money \nbelongs to the government, and not the people. What is particularly \nworrisome, is that although the current rules assume someone 70\\1/2\\ \nhas a life expectancy of 15 years, people are living longer and \nretiring later, and these rules could result in individuals not having \nthe money available when they really do need it.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support reducing the tax burden \non Seniors, to give those Seniors who want to work the freedom to work, \nwithout the fear of penalty and to restore their control over their \nsavings. In short, I ask my colleagues to restore to Seniors their \nfinancial freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 88\n\n       Whereas the price of crude oil has more than doubled in the \n     past year to over $30 per barrel, and prices of petroleum \n     products such as heating oil, diesel fuel, and gasoline have \n     reached record levels;\n       Whereas a sharp sustained increase in the price of crude \n     oil negatively affects the overall economic well-being of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas high oil prices harm people and businesses;\n       Whereas the Energy Information Administration has \n     determined that Northeastern United States fuel reserves are \n     the lowest in 20 years and that Americans are ``skating on \n     thin ice'' in meeting energy requirements;\n       Whereas the current price and supply crisis was largely \n     created through the actions of the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') by market-distorting and \n     collusive production reductions, and OPEC's activities would \n     be in violation of United States antitrust laws if conducted \n     within the United States;\n       Whereas OPEC has demonstrated unity not seen since the \n     energy crises of the 1970's;\n       Whereas the United States has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     of over 570,000,000 barrels of crude oil to protect against \n     threats to oil supplies;\n       Whereas many experts, trade associations, and members of \n     Congress have called for a drawdown of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve to combat OPEC's market distorting \n     behavior;\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\n       Whereas a drawdown or the threat of a drawdown of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve could provide a critical tool to \n     break the resolve of OPEC to practice market distorting \n     behavior, and a sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve would increase domestic supplies and drive down \n     prices in the short term;\n       Whereas swaps from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve offer a \n     way to increase the overall size of the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve at no cost to the taxpayer; and\n       Whereas low global inventories allow OPEC to retain \n     inordinate control over supply and pricing, and consequently \n     undue influence over the global economy: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) using authority under existing law, directly through \n     time exchanges (or ``swaps'') or through other means, the \n     President and the Secretary of Energy should draw down the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an economically feasible \n     manner and to a responsible degree, to combat unfair foreign \n     trade practices of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries and alleviate the severely deleterious consequences \n     to people and businesses in the United States that those \n     practices have caused; and\n       (2) the President and the Secretary of Energy should \n     prepare for future threats to the economy and energy supply \n     of the United States by developing methods to--\n       (A) draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve quickly when \n     needed; and\n       (B) increase the quantity of crude oil in the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve over time in an economically reasonable \n     manner.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nSchumer, to submit a senate concurrent resolution expressing the Sense \nof the Congress that the Administration should act immediately to \ncombat the anticompetitive campaign OPEC has waged on the world's oil \nmarkets. Through this resolution, we call upon the President and the \nSecretary of Energy to defend America's interests through the immediate \nrelease of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We are pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Jeffords, Snowe, Lieberman, Moynihan, Levin, \nLeahy, and Dodd who are original cosponsors of this important \nlegislation. We are also pleased to have the strong support of the \nAmerican Trucking Association which represents 9.6 million people \nemployed in the American trucking industry and their families. Perhaps \nno one has felt the pain for soaring oil prices more then they.\n  Today we ask the Administration to combat the unfair and \nanticompetitive practices of OPEC, and to ease the pain this cartel has \ninflicted--and will continue to inflict--on the people and businesses \nof the Northeast, the Midwest, and throughout America.\n  Last fall, Senator Schumer and I began cautioning the Administration \nabout OPEC's production squeeze and the impact the cartel would have on \nour economy. At that time oil prices were rising, and U.S. inventories \nwere falling. Throughout the winter, Mainers, New Yorkers, and all \nAmericans who heat with oil have suffered from the highest distillate \nprices in a decade. The entire nation has suffered--and will continue \nto suffer--through increased gasoline and diesel fuel costs.\n  One year ago, the average retail price of a gallon of diesel fuel was \n95.6 cents. Today, prices across the nation have skyrocketed. In my \nhome state, diesel costs range from $1.60 in Bangor to $1.90 in \nBiddeford.\n  This jump in prices deeply harms truckers and, by extension, all \nAmerican consumers and businesses. The trucking industry consumes \nnearly 30 billion of gallons of diesel fuel a year. At today's prices, \nthat means truckers across the nation must shoulder $15 billion more in \nfuel costs this year, compared to last.\n  I have heard from small Maine trucking companies that are in dire \nstraits. One owner of a trucking company in Ellsworth, Maine tells me \nthat, due to particularly high fuel costs, many independent truckers \nshe contracts with may not be able to stay in business. She says that \nowner-operators and small trucking companies cannot withstand the \nexorbitant price of diesel fuel for much longer and warns that \nimmediate action is necessary. Potato farmers in northern Maine tell me \nthey are having difficulty shipping their crop to market because the \nhigh cost of diesel has made it economically unfeasible to come to \nAroostock County.\n  I was struck by a sign I saw on a rig two weeks ago when truckers \nconverged upon Washington, demanding action from our government--it \nread: ``if you eat it, drink or wear it, it probably got to you by \ntruck.'' This catchy slogan underscores the importance of trucking to \nour country and our way of life.\n  But everyone shares in the pain inflicted by OPEC. Yesterday, a \nbarrel of crude oil closed at $30.43, a one hundred-fifty percent \nincrease from one year ago. These high crude prices hurt all \nAmericans--at the pump, on the farm, in the supermarket, at the airline \nticket counter, and at home during cold winter nights.\n  OPEC member-countries have colluded to take some 6% of the world's \nsupply of oil off the markets in order to maximize profits. The \nstrategy's is working--although OPEC countries sold 5% less oil in \n1999, their profits were up 38%.\n  OPEC's production squeeze has caused fuel reserves to shrink to \nhistoric lows. The Administrator of the Energy Information \nAdministration--which is part of the Department of Energy--was quoted \nin The New York Times last week saying the fuel reserves in the \nNortheast were ``dangerously low,'' the lowest in 20 years, and that \nAmerican's were ``skating on thin ice'' due to low fuel inventories. \nIndeed, we were told by the Energy Information Agency that distillate \nstocks in New England reached an all-time low last month.\n  We have been disappointed that the Administration has failed to heed \nour call over the past several months. But even now, it is not too \nlate. A release of oil from the SPR would have an immediate impact upon \nthe price of oil and would help break OPEC's resolve to maintain an \niron grip on our nation's supply.\n  So today we offer a resolution calling upon the Administration to use \nthe tools at its disposal to fight OPEC's unfair and dangerously \nharmful trade practices. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis resolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yesterday, crude prices closed just below \n$32 per barrel--the highest price since a brief spike during the \nPersian Gulf War. At this level, it is very likely that gas prices will \nreach $2 per gallon by Memorial Day.\n  The price of oil has reached a point where it is no longer a \nnuisance, but a crisis for our economy. We have called on the President \nand the Secretary of Energy to release some of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve (SPR) in order to bring this price spike under control. And \ntoday, we are introducing a concurrent resolution to again request that \nthe Administration use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bolster our \nrapidly dwindling oil inventories, stabilize prices, and to convince \nOPEC that America is ready to use leverage to protect our national \neconomic interests.\n  During the past two weeks, Secretary Richardson has met with OPEC \nministers to encourage them to increase production. They discussed a 1 \nmillion barrel per day increase, but according to experts, that will \nstill not be sufficient to meet America's demand. In fact, even if OPEC \nincreased production to 3 million barrels per day by the 4th Quarter of \n2000, the U.S. will still have $30 barrels next winter. This is because \ninventory levels of petroleum and petroleum products are at their \nlowest levels in more than 20 years. Gasoline inventories are down 15 \npercent from last year, and crude inventories are down 13 percent. \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development inventories are 99 \nmillion barrels below normal.\n  Low inventories means that OPEC will continue to control global \nsupply and demand. Even if OPEC increases production by a small amount, \nit will not be sufficient to prevent them from increasing prices at any \nmoment. This, therefore, has become a matter of national security.\n  The United States must use the SPR to prod OPEC to release \nsignificantly more oil. If the United States releases the reserve \nthrough swaps, other OPEC producers will realize that their \nstranglehold on the market is ending and will disregard their quotas, \nthereby releasing oil into market and forcing the price back down. That \nis the scenario OPEC fears the most and that is the card that we need \nto play to ensure a sufficient and timely increase in production. We \nhave been warning since\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nSeptember that this day would come if the United States did not play \nthe SPR card. It is here; it is late; but it is not yet too late to \navert a crisis. We need to use the leverage of the reserve.\n  Increased oil prices could severely affect the health of our economy. \nIt has the potential to increase inflation. It will drain the budgets \nof working families. The price of shipping will increase. Oil prices at \nthese levels will filter through every sector of our economy like a \nvirus.\n  The President and Secretary Richardson must act quickly to release \noil from the SPR in order to counter OPEC's assault on the United \nStates and the global economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1130-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 89--TO ESTABLISH THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL \n     COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES FOR THE INAUGURATION OF THE \n   PRESIDENT-ELECT AND VICE-PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES ON \n                            JANUARY 20, 2001\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n     teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the \n     areas of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special \n     education, and bilingual education, and for those able to \n     teach in high-poverty school districts will be particularly \n     high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages \n     should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n     assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n     schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n       (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n     ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n     also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n     academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on \n     the academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n     science.\n       (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n     area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n     assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training \n     and classroom experience.\n       (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n     in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. ____3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to address the need of high-\n     poverty school districts for highly qualified teachers in \n     particular subject areas, such as mathematics, science, \n     foreign languages, bilingual education, and special \n     education, needed by those school districts, by recruiting, \n     preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing \n     professionals who have knowledge and experience that will \n     help them become such teachers.\n\n     SEC. ____4.

Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues an issue that is not being raised in the otherwise \ninformative presidential primary campaigns. It is not a theoretical \nissue, nor is it an issue concerning budgetary decisions.\n  Rather, it is an issue which sends American pilots on combat missions \nalmost daily. It is an issue which throughout the last decade has cost \nthe lives of hundreds of American and thousands of soldiers and \ncivilians of other nationalities. It is an issue which threatens the \npeace and security of some of our closest allies, and which, if not \nsolved, could threaten the United States with weapons of mass \ndestruction. It is an issue which starves and hold captive twenty-two \nmillion people in conditions of unparalleled terror of their \ngovernment. It is an issue which we have failed to deal with \ndecisively, and that failure calls into question our dedication to the \nfreedom we prize so highly for ourselves.\n  The issue is the continuing rule of Saddam Hussein. Nine years after \nthe United States led a coalition to eject Iraqi forces and liberate \nKuwait, Saddam continues to brutalize his people, threaten his \nneighbors, and develop weapons of mass destruction--earlier versions of \nwhich he used on neighboring states, on Israel, and on his own people. \nThe good news is that sanctions have weakened his military, and his \npolitical support base has shrunk to his immediate family. All of \nmountainous northern Iraq and large swathes of southern Iraq are free \nof his control. Nonetheless, he continues to rule the central part of \nthe country and, as Jim Hoagland pointed out in today's Washington \nPost, Saddam is likely to outlast yet another American President.\n  The Administration will no doubt point to the restraining effect UN \nsanctions have had on Saddam's ability to threaten his neighbors. In \ntruth, his regime would have been far more aggressive if sanctions and \nthe no-fly zones guaranteed by U.S. and British airpower had not been \nin effect. But in choosing policy options against an outlaw like \nSaddam, restraint is a minimal objective.\n  For example, we and our allies in the former Yugoslavia are not \nseeking to restrain those accused of war crimes during the ethnic war \nthere; we seek to catch them, lock them up, and get them to The Hague \nfor trial. Saddam has killed far more than any of the wanted Yugoslavs, \nand he keeps on killing today. Our rhetoric, including mine today, \ncalls for the same response to Saddam.\n  But our real policy is merely to restrain him. The fact that the \nrestraint has endured nine years is what the Administration shows as \nevidence of its success. But adhering to the policy of restraint is \nactually taking us farther from our stated goals. Support for the \nsanctions policy is eroding at the UN. This, along with rising oil \nprices and Iraq's rising oil production, have made Saddam a key global \nenergy player once again. In addition, Saddam has had thirteen months \nto develop weapons of mass destruction without the inhibition imposed \nby outside inspections. Now, a new inspection regime has been voted by \nthe Security Council. If Iraq eventually accepts it, I presume Dr. Blix \nand his new inspectors will do their best. Yet, they will never be as \nintrusive, and therefore as effective, as UNSCOM. In sum, the \nrestraints which we have kept on Saddam for nine years are loosening. \nHe is very close to being free of the handcuffs in which both we and \nhis people have invested so much.\n  Restraining Saddam was always a minimal objective. It was a way to \navoid the strategic risk many see in the bolder objective of acting in \nsupport of the Iraqi opposition to remove Saddam from power and achieve \ndemocracy. It is ironic that the minimal objective requires the \ncontinual application of U.S. military force, not just for a decade, \nbut presumably forever. The bolder objective, once achieved, would \nbring U.S. military operations and basing in the Gulf countries to an \nend. I believe Congress has recognized the need for bold action. In \npassing the Iraq Liberation Act in October 1998, Congress expressed its \nfrustration with the status quo and provided resources with which the \nAdministration could support the Iraqi opposition in their efforts to \nremove Saddam from power.\n  In signing the Iraq Liberation Act, President Clinton affirmed that \nU.S. policy was not merely to restrain Saddam but to see him replaced. \nUnfortunately, the President's policy pronouncement has not been \nfollowed by action. The President and Vice President have encouraging \nwords for Iraqis seeking to free their country, but their words are \nbelied by the inaction of their Administration. Despite unprecedented \nunity, the Administration has provided only a small proportion of \navailable resources to the Iraqi opposition, and this only on \nsuperficialities which will have no effect on opinion inside Iraq. The \ncountries in the region all agree the U.S. is not serious about \nsupporting Saddam's removal. If you don't believe me, call the \nambassador of any Middle Eastern country and ask him or her if our \nactions and rhetoric match.\n  If the Administration actively sought Saddam's replacement, our \nallies in the region would know it and they would cooperate with us. \nBut the Administration has not asked because the\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\ntruth is, beneath the rhetoric, we are clinging to the old policy of \nrestraining Saddam. There are now signs that the consensus for even \nthat is fraying. I would hate to think that the boldest hope of our \nnational security establishment is that our policy will hold until noon \non January 20 of 2001.\n  I admit to coming late to an understanding of the evil of the Iraqi \nregime and the imperative of fighting it. After Saddam's invasion of \nKuwait in 1990, I voted against the Gulf War resolution. My distrust of \nthe Bush Administration's statements regarding the need for the use of \nforce in Iraq were colored by my own experiences in Vietnam. But Iraq \nis not Vietnam. And I have come to understand the brutality of Saddam \nHussein's regime and the overwhelming requirement to support the \nefforts of Iraqis to replace it. I understand the threat the regime \nposes to his people, to his neighbors, and to the rest of the world. \nMost of all, this is about our commitment to freedom.\n  The long night of the Iraqi people will not be ended through a policy \nof merely retraining the Iraqi regime. Instead, we must work to match \nour words and our deeds to actively support the Iraqi opposition in \ntheir effort to remove Saddam Hussein and establish a democratic Iraq. \nWhen the people of Iraq obtain their freedom, it will transform the \nMiddle East. It will create a new region in which brutality, poverty, \nand unnecessary armaments will be supplanted by security, prosperity, \nand creative diversity.\n  Mr. President, this goal is within our reach. But the difference \nbetween success and failure in this endeavor will be measured by our \nwillingness to act in support of the people of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1151-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1151-S1152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, after going to the southern Sudan as a \nmedical missionary and a surgeon 2 years ago, I came home with a \nrealization that the unparalleled human disaster I went there to \naddress was really, to my own surprise, inextricably linked to my role \nas a Senator. Yesterday, that realization was brought home again to me \nin the most horrific and despicable way.\n  As background, the Government of Sudan has, for over 16 years, \ncarried out a war of unrivaled barbarity against its own people. Over 2 \nmillion people, mostly civilians, have died in bombings, intentional \nmass starvation, raids by militias on horseback, and what we call more \nconventional war. Slavery there today is common, so common that the \nraiding parties the Government of Sudan in Khartoum sponsors accept \ncaptive humans as their pay.\n  Yesterday, the regime in Khartoum struck once again, this time with \nold Soviet cargo planes that have been crudely outfitted as bombers of \na sort, where large antipersonnel bombs are simply pushed through large \ncargo doors.\n  The accuracy is poor. Yet the intent could not be clearer. I received \na phone call yesterday morning around 10 o'clock. It was at 6:25 a.m. \nyesterday morning, minutes before the first wave of relief flights were \nto leave the United Nations relief operations in Lokichokio, Kenya, \nthey received a phone call from Khartoum instructing them that no \nrelief flights would be allowed into Sudan the entire day.\n  The Government of Sudan then proceeded with a full day of bombing \nraids on nine sites in areas of rebel control.\n  What were the strongholds the Government of Sudan hit in those raids \nyesterday? What decisive blow did they deliver to those rebels?\n  Well, there is one location that I know for sure was a civilian \nhospital. They bombed and destroyed a tuberculosis clinic and one of \nthe only x-ray machines in the entire country. They hit the local \nmarketplace. They hit a feeding center for the starving and displaced.\n  In three passes over the small bush town, they dropped five \nantipersonnel bombs. They killed or maimed civilians, many of them \npatients in the hospital, others in the marketplace, others in a \nfeeding center for the starving.\n  All of these were known civilian centers and all were intentionally \ntargeted. The Government of Sudan knows exactly what is in that town \nand in those hospitals, and they targeted them anyway.\n  Why do I mention this? How do I know this was a civilian target? It \nis because it was approximately 2 years ago that in this very hospital \nI was operating in southern Sudan in a small village called Lui. The TB \nclinic is adjacent to a small schoolhouse that was converted to a \nhospital. It is in a small outpost, and there is a little airstrip town \nthere just north of the border approximately 100 or 110 miles. The \npress release I received today describing the incident in this hospital \nwhere I worked says:\n\n       Armed aircraft from Sudan's Islamic government dropped 12 \n     bombs on the Samaritans First Hospital in Lui, the only \n     hospital within a 100-mile radius. Eleven of the 12 bombs \n     exploded at or near the hospital killing a number of people, \n     critically wounding dozens, and damaging the hospital's \n     children's and tuberculosis wards. More than 100 patients \n     were being treated or housed at the hospital at the time of \n     the bombing, where four American doctors are stationed. The \n     bombing prompted many patients to flee, interrupting critical \n     tuberculosis treatments needed to save their lives.\n\n  This release came to my office this afternoon.\n  Again, these senseless acts are militarily insignificant, I believe. \nThe only purpose is to terrify and kill civilians and the doctors and \nthe relief personnel who dare to provide life and comfort to them.\n  The most outrageous aspect of all of this is not that I have been \nthere, that I know this hospital well, that I was one of the very few \nphysicians and early surgeons to come to that hospital, and it is not \nthat this could have just as easily happened when I was there; it is \nthat this is not an uncommon practice. It is a chosen tactic in the war \nthat lurks on the edge of the world's consciousness.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the same government dropped bombs on a town in the \nNuba Mountains area, killing 21.\n  What was the critical rebel target that day? It was a group of \nschoolchildren under a tree--not child soldiers, but children trying to \nlearn to read.\n  These are just two in a long and sickening history of intentionally \nbombing civilians by the Government of Sudan.\n  How long does the world intend to tolerate these outrages? How long \nwill the regime in Khartoum benefit from their prowess in public \nrelations in the capitals of Europe and the Middle East --and on Wall \nStreet? If indiscriminately bombing children and the infirm doesn't \nserve as a call to action, then what will it take?\n  I am realistic about what the world is willing to do. Rage and \nindignation are expected. But it is about 16 years past due for the \n``international community'' that responds so generously and decisively \nin many other places to act forcefully and with clear purpose in Sudan.\n  The world should be ashamed that it has gone on so long. I am ashamed \nthe United States has not made this a greater priority. For a country \nthat is willing to act decisively in Bosnia and Kosovo, we should be \nashamed of the anemic level of action to stop this war in Sudan. As a \ncountry that is willing to invade another country--Haiti--to stop \nviolence and injustice, we should be ashamed by the fact that we are \nwilling to do so little in Sudan.\n  I am not suggesting that the United States or anybody else become \nmilitarily involved in Sudan. Even if that were politically popular \nhere, it would not be something I would recommend. But the world should \nbe ashamed that we have failed to use all reasonable tools at our \ndisposal. Some of our closest allies in Europe and the Middle East \nwould be especially ashamed for their receptivity toward the regime in \nKhartoum.\n  Yes, I am outraged and disgusted by the bombings of yesterday. I am \noutraged by the bombings of 2 weeks ago. I am outraged and disgusted by \nthe past 16 years of brutality. I believe the administration and the \nworld should share that outrage, and in some cases they do.\n\n  But outrage alone gets us no closer to bringing the war to a \nconclusion. It requires a credible, coherent, and forceful policy from \nthe United States and from the world.\n  Our policy is only selectively forceful and, as a consequence, lacks \ncoherence and credibility--both in Khartoum and in the capitals of the \ncountries we\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\nmust have on board to end the war. Correcting those problems cannot \nhappen overnight, but I propose a few steps we can now take.\n  First, the House of Representatives should act now to take up and \npass the Sudan Peace Act. This bipartisan legislation was written \nprimarily to address the deficiencies in the way our vast amounts of \nfood aid are delivered, and to compel the administration and our allies \nto bring as much pressure to bear on the Government of Sudan--and the \nrebels--to get serious in the limping peace talks. This is a sensible \nand helpful step Congress can take right now.\n  Second, the United Nations should deploy monitors to areas of \nconflict in the Sudan now. The Government of Sudan has escaped the \ncondemnation they deserve in large part because the eyes of the world \nare so far from this remote and enormous land. Human rights monitors \ncan bring this to light and give the world the information they need to \npush for resolution of the war. Most importantly, they can force the \nturned eyes of the world to confront the manmade disaster in front of \nthem.\n  Third, we must overhaul our humanitarian operations in Sudan now. \nThey are in complete disarray. The Government of Sudan has the right--\nand routinely exercises it--to block any food shipments anywhere in \nSudan with the stroke of a pen. It is an outrage that we allow them to \nmanipulate our food aid as a weapon of war. They do it, and they do it \nwith devastating effect. The United States and United Nations must make \nending that veto power a top priority. I also call on the humanitarian \norganizations and the rebels to end their squabbling over the rules of \noperating and in rebel-held areas and get back to work now. In an \nargument that can only be described as petty and childish compared to \nthe catastrophe at hand, some of the groups most important to an \neffective relief operation are pulling out.\n  Fourth, the administration and our European, Middle Eastern, and \nAfrican allies must get the floundering peace process moving on. They \nneed to stop letting the Government of Sudan manipulate the process and \nstop promising cease-fires and cooperation while continuing to carry on \nthe war. In fact, a cease-fire is in effect now, if you can believe it. \nOur allies must be convinced to stop offering ``alternative'' peace \nnegotiations to distract from what is really at issue in the talks in \nNairobi. They must now set aside legalistic excuses and put the \nnecessary pressure on the combatants to get to the table and get \nserious about ending the war.\n  Fifth, we must push our allies to stop responding to what is called \nKhartoum's ``Charm Offensive.'' This PR campaign paints a picture where \nKhartoum is simply ``misunderstood'' and unfairly vilified by the \nUnited States. They offer the cruise missile attack against the \npharmaceutical plant in Khartoum as convincing evidence. They deny the \nethnic cleansing in the south as just another arm of the American \npropaganda machine. The lies have been alarmingly effective and little \nhas been done to disabuse the world of the ridiculous notions.\n\n  No. 6, the access to weapons and capital the regime in Khartoum \nenjoys must be addressed now. The oil being exploited in contested \nareas of Sudan is fueling the war and allowing Khartoum to plow more \nmoney back into weapons purchases. Much of that money has been raised \nin the United States. Ironically, capital is raised on Wall Street, \njust blocks from the World Trade Center Towers, which were bombed by \nterrorist who operated with support from Sudan. I realize that \ncontrolling private and legal funds is tricky business, but the United \nStates' continued ambiguity on this point gives the distinct impression \nthat there is a price on the lives of the people of Sudan, and that the \nprice has been determined. We cannot afford that ambiguity. We must \nbegin an internationally coordinated effort to limit access to the \nweapons and capital that allows Khartoum to continue their war, just as \nthe world did against the apartheid government of South Africa. Even \nnow, a grassroots effort to push large investors in the United States \nand Canada to divest of the stocks of the companies operating in Sudan \nis gaining considerable momentum and having an effect on share prices. \nTheir successes are drawn purely on the power of shame. Surely this \ntells us that economic pressures can work if coordinated and if \nsupported with good information. Governments will respond to the same \nshame that investors respond to. It's a powerful tool in a coordinated \ndiplomatic and economic push, and we would be remiss to not use it.\n  These recommendations are not unreasonable or particularly difficult \ntasks. These are things we can do right now beginning today.\n  It will not require a great deal of money. In fact, it may cost less \nthan we spend now. What it will require, though, is effort, some \ndiscomfort and a significant amount of diplomatic and political \ncapital.\n  What it requires most is leadership. We in Congress can press these \nissues, but we cannot unilaterally form our foreign policy. That is the \nConstitutional prerogative and responsibility of the President of the \nU.S.\n  The President should immediately become personally involved in \nseeking resolution and pressing these peaceful goals in Sudan. To date, \nhe has not.\n  Just a little more than a month ago we observed ``the month of \nAfrica'' at the United Nations. There, the war in the Congo was the \nfocus. That war is compelling and the implications it has for the \nfuture of Africa are very real. It too deserves the focus and attention \nof the United Nations.\n  Yet the festering--and much more deadly--war in Sudan went without \nany serious consideration at the United Nations during ``the month of \nAfrica.'' Not only is that shameful in itself, it was a lost \nopportunity.\n  We can afford no more lost opportunities when it comes to Sudan. This \nwar has continued long enough and has cost enough lives. It has hovered \non the edge of obscurity for too long. It is time to get the world to \nforcefully and directly address it.\n  Only the United States can provide that kind of leadership. And only \nthe President can direct the United States' effort with any hope of \never being truly effective and bring the necessary diplomatic and \neconomic forces to bear.\n  The President has a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives \nin Congress willing and waiting to help in that effort. As Chairman of \nthe Africa Subcommittee, I pledge my commitment to such an effort.\n  It is unusual that we see such opportunities for immediate, \nbipartisan action in Congress, especially in an election year. It is an \nopportunity we cannot afford to pass up. To many lives have been lost. \nToo many lives are still at stake. The time to act is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1152-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1152-S1153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \nfriend and colleague Senator Graham to introduce a resolution \ncontragulating Florida State University's football team on winning the \n1999 Division 1-A Collegiate Football National Championship. As a \nSenator from Florida and the father-in-law of an avid Seminole, I join \nwith all those in my home state and those across this country in \nhonoring Coach Bobby Bowden, his staff, and the football team for this \noutstanding accomplishment. Not only is this a special achievement that \nwill long be remembered by the coaches and the players but it is also a \nmoment to savor for the students, alumni and supporters of Florida \nState University.\n  Florida State University has one of the most exciting, prolific and \nsuccessful college football teams in the country. In fact, they won 108 \nfootball games between 1990 and 1999, more than any other Division 1-A \ncollege football team during this timeframe. By finishing the 1999 \nseason undefeated and untied, they have also extended their NCAA \nDivision 1-A record streak of top-four finishes in the final Associated \nPress poll to 13 years in a row, the only football team to have \naccomplished this feat.\n  But as impressive as all these achievements are, they have \naccomplished what no other football team has been able to do. The 1999 \nSeminoles are the first Division I-A collegiate football team in the \ncountry to be ranked number one for the entire season by the Associated \nPress since the preseason rankings began in 1950.\n  1999 will also be remembered fondly by my good friend Bobby Bowden \nfor reasons other than surpassing the 300 victory mark, or winning his \nsecond football national championship, or for obtaining his first \nperfect season in 40 years as a head football coach. In 1999, Coach \nBowden and his lovely wife, Ann, celebrated their 50th wedding \nanniversary. Coach Bowden, Priscilla and I wish you and your wife our \nsincere congratulations on this most important milestone.\n  The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be the home to three of \nthe finest college football teams in the nation: Florida State \nUniversity, the University of Florida and the University of Miami. \nTogether, these three schools have won seven Division 1-A college \nfootball championships since 1984. That's seven college football \nchampionships in the last 16 years. This proves that the road to the \ncollege football national championship goes right through the State of \nFlorida.\n  For those who love to wear the Garnet and Gold and do the Seminole \nChop and the FSU War Chant, I am honored to introduce this resolution \non their behalf, which honors the 1999 Florida State football team, the \ncoaches and staff for winning the Division 1-A Collegiate Football \nnational championship.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ncopy of the names of the 1999 Florida State University football \nplayers, coaches and staff, along with their season schedule, results \nand final polls recognizing the Florida State Seminoles as the 1999 \nDivision 1-A national champions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY SEMINOLES 1999 DIVISION 1-A COLLEGE FOOTBALL\n                           NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Players                              Position\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAllen, Brian.................................

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee on \nconference on the bill (S. 376) to amend the Communications Satellite \nAct of 1962 to promote competition and privatization in satellite \ncommunications, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 376) \n     have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by all of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report. (The conference report is \nprinted in the House proceedings of the Record of today, March 2, \n2000.)\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I extend my sincere appreciation to Senate \nCommerce Committee Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings, House Commerce \nCommittee Chairman Bliley, Representative Markey, and all of the other \nMembers of the Senate-House conference for working together in a bi-\npartisan manner on satellite reform legislation. Through the dedication \nof the conference, and in particular Chairman Bliley, the 106th \nCongress can now present President Clinton with the opportunity to sign \ninto law a meaningful bill that will enhance market competition and \nbenefit consumers everywhere.\n  When I undertook the challenge of guiding legislation through the \nSenate that would encourage genuine competition in the rapidly evolving \ninternational satellite communications industry through deregulation, I \ndeclared five basic principles that would serve as the foundation for \nmy effort.\n  (1) The legislation must enhance competition in the global satellite \ncommunications market;\n  (2) The legislation must be consistent with the United States' \nexisting treaty obligations;\n  (3) The legislation must enhance global satellite connectivity to all \nareas, including remote and rural;\n  (4) The legislation must ultimately increase consumers' choices, \nenable technological innovation and lower costs; and\n  (5) The legislation cannot impose any unnecessary new regulatory \nschemes on this vibrant global industry.\n  These principles were incorporated into The Open Market \nReorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications \nAct, known as ORBIT, S. 376 which the Senate swiftly and unanimously \npassed. I am very pleased to note that the conference agreement now \nbefore the Senate retains the core principles reflected in ORBIT while \naccommodating the concerns articulated by Chairman Bliley and his House \ncolleagues.\n  This compromise legislation represents the desire of Congress to \ninject more competition and more privatization into the international \nsatellite communications market. Specifically, the conference agreement \nachieves these important objectives by:\n  Establishing definite and reasonable criteria and dates certain for \nthe privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat.\n  Calling for an IPO of the privatized INTELSAT of October 1, 2001, but \nprudently recognizing that market conditions must be taken into account \nand therefore, allowing the IPO date to be extended to no later than \nDecember 31, 2002.\n  Eliminating INTELSAT's and COMSAT's privileges and immunities while \nprotecting COMSAT for action taken in response to instructions of the \nU.S. Government in carrying out its responsibilities as the U.S. \nsignatory.\n  Eliminating upon enactment the antiquated ownership and board \nrestrictions on the U.S. signatory to INTELSAT, thereby allowing \nLockheed Martin to complete its acquisition of COMSAT upon enactment of \nthis bill without conditions.\n  Creating a competitive, level playing field in the satellite \nindustry.\n  Removing the intrusive role of government in the commercial satellite \nindustry.\n  Using access to the U.S. market as a strong incentive to keep \nINTELSAT's privatization effort moving forward without delay.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference agreement rejects any \nnotion that the government should be interfering in the contractual \narrangements between COMSAT and either its customers or INTELSAT. The \ngovernment should not be permitting, let alone encouraging, abrogation \nor modification of any such arrangement. Among my serious concerns, I \nconcluded long ago that this would be contrary to the Fifth Amendment's \nTakings Clause. The bill before us is very clear on this point. This \nlegislation in no way directs the FCC to take any action that would \nimpair private contracts or agreements.\n  On a related point, the conference agreement also flatly rejects \n``Level IV direct access'' in any form. Permitting or requiring Level \nIV direct access would have unfairly forced a divestiture of COMSAT's \nINTELSAT assets. I am pleased that the conference agreement flatly \nrejects Level IV direct access.\n  Let me also commend Senator Stevens and our good friend, Mr. Dingell, \nin the other body for improving this bill in conference with the \naddition of language to preserve our national security interests. The \nconference has produced an agreement that will encourage expeditious \nprivatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat and allow Lockheed Martin to \nreinvigorate COMSAT as a competitor in the international satellite \nmarketplace.\n  At the end of the day, the conference agreement will lead to enhanced \ncompetition in telecommunications services, resulting in real consumer \nbenefits of more choices, lower prices and new services.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 91 introduced earlier \ntoday by Senators Durbin, Gorton, Lott, Helms, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 91) congratulating \n     the Republic of Lithuania on the tenth anniversary of the \n     reestablishment of its independence from the rule of the \n     former Soviet Union.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, March 11 will mark the 10th anniversary of \nthe declaration of independence of Lithuania from the domination of the \nSoviet Union. Lithuania led the way for other Soviet Republics to throw \noff the yolk of Soviet Communist imperialism, resulting in the \ndisintegration of the Soviet Union.\n  This declaration was not without cost--in January 1991, Soviet \nparatroopers stormed the Press House in Vilnius, injuring four people. \nBarricades were set up in front of the Lithuanian Parliament, the \nSeimas. Soviet forces attacked the television station and tower in \nVilnius, killing 13 Lithuanians. One woman was killed when she tried to \nblock a Soviet armored personnel carrier.\n  But these courageous Lithuanians did not suffer and die in vain. \nLithuania has now become a vibrant democracy. It has established a \nfree-market economy and the rule of law. Lithuania wants to be fully \nintegrated into Europe, and is seeking membership in the European Union \nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n  This year we also celebrate the 60th anniversary of the U.S. \nCongress' insistence that Soviet domination of the Baltic states would \nnot be recognized by the United States. The logic then and the logic \nnow is that the United States will only recognize a free and \nindependent Lithuania. What we celebrate this year is what we must help \npreserve next year and the year after that. We must carry on that \nprinciple today by being sure that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are \nadmitted into NATO as an unequivocal statement that we will never \ntolerate domination of the Baltic states again.\n  I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my \ncolleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next \nround of NATO expansion.\n  That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all my \ncolleagues can agree on the importance of Lithuania's contribution to \nfreedom and independence for the former Soviet Republics and will join \nme in congratulating Lithuania in celebrating ten years of that \nprecious freedom and independence.\n  I am honored that my mother was born in a tiny Lithuanian village \nmany years ago; that she came to this country proud of her heritage, \nbut determined to be an American citizen. This Senator, the son of that \nproud Lithuanian mother, now serves in this great body and takes pride \nin being able to rise and salute the courageous people of Lithuania on \nthis the occasion of the tenth anniversary of their independence from \nSoviet domination.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and, finally, any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Res. 91) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 91\n\n       Whereas the United States had never recognized the forcible \n     incorporation of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania into the former Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the declaration on March 11, 1990, of the \n     reestablishment of full sovereignty and independence of the \n     Republic of Lithuania led to the disintegration of the former \n     Soviet Union;\n       Whereas Lithuania since then has successfully built \n     democracy, ensured human and minority rights, the rule of \n     law, developed a free market economy, implemented exemplary \n     relations with neighboring countries, and consistently \n     pursued a course of integration into the community of free \n     and democratic nations by seeking membership in the European \n     Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and\n       Whereas Lithuania, as a result of the progress of its \n     political and economic reforms, has made, and continues to \n     make, a significant contribution toward the maintenance of \n     international peace and stability by, among other actions, \n     its participation in NATO-led peacekeeping operations in \n     Bosnia and Kosovo: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress hereby--\n       (1) congratulates Lithuania on the occasion of the tenth \n     anniversary of the reestablishment of its independence and \n     the leading role it played in the disintegration of the \n     former Soviet Union; and\n       (2) commends Lithuania for its success in implementing \n     political and economic reforms, which may further speed the \n     process of that country's integration into European and \n     Western institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/02/senate-section/article/S1156-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1156-S1157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARTS EDUCATION MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 128\n\n       Whereas arts literacy is a fundamental purpose of schooling \n     for all students;\n       Whereas arts education stimulates, develops and refines \n     many cognitive and creative skills, critical thinking and \n     nimbleness in judgment, creativity and imagination, \n     cooperative decisionmaking, leadership, high-level literacy \n     and communication, and the capacity for problem posing and \n     problem-solving;\n       Whereas arts education contributes significantly to the \n     creation of flexible, adaptable, and knowledgeable workers \n     who will be needed in the 21st century economy;\n       Whereas arts education improves teaching and learning;\n       Whereas when parents and families, artists, arts \n     organizations, businesses, local civic and cultural leaders, \n     and institutions are actively engaged in instructional \n     programs, arts education is more successful;\n       Whereas effective teachers of the arts should be encouraged \n     to continue to learn and grow in mastery of their art form as \n     well as in their teaching competence;\n       Whereas the 1999 study, entitled ``Gaining the Arts \n     Advantage: Lessons from School Districts that Value Arts \n     Education'', found that the literacy, education, programs, \n     learning and growth described in the preceding clauses \n     contribute to successful districtwide arts education;\n       Whereas the 1997 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress reported that students lack sufficient opportunity \n     for participatory learning in the arts;\n       Whereas educators, schools, students, and other community \n     members recognize the importance of arts education; and\n       Whereas arts programs, arts curriculum, and other arts \n     activities in schools across the Nation should be encouraged \n     and publicly recognized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.
